@SenateMajLdr why didn't you wish @BarackObama Happy Presidents Day? Are you too busy being the worst man in Washington? I guess so.
@SenateMajLdr Celebrate Presidents Day while you trash the Constitution out of hatred for the present one.
@SenateMajLdr Respect the office & vote for #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr same to you!
@tkdmike @ActDontReact @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Id call Mitch but they seldom answer the phone!!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress You mean Slave Owner in Chief! And stop disrespecting and obstructing the 1st A-A POTUS.
@SenateMajLdr we also celebrate our current Commander in Chief President Obama
@SenateMajLdr  should we call you dear leader? since you think you can change the constitution? you remain at best an embarrassment.
@polandmary21 @SenateMajLdr People are only outraged over the government teat when if feeds the hungry. #ImpeachTurtlePeople
@SenateMajLdr
Thank u for supporting the ppl & standing up for the US n waiting to confirm a Supreme Court justice. Please don't let us down
@kay_kingsbury @SenateMajLdr He'not standing 4 all the ppl. He's causing a break down in our Constitutional gov't.
@Janus16 @SenateMajLdr
You mean like the Democrats in 2007? Or you mean because the Republicans have a say at all& u don't feel they should?
@kay_kingsbury @SenateMajLdr the Dems and Rep should follow Constitution. We have our "say" when we vote.
@SenateMajLdr In your next breath you'll slander and disrespect the one our military serves now. #YouInsultTheWholeChainOfCommand
@SenateMajLdr What would President Washington say about ur behavior? You are robbing the judicial branch of a justice. #growupsenate
@SenateMajLdr and he would say "do your job obstructionist"
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob #POTUS has 300+ days in ofc: he's REQUIRED 2 nominate for #SCOTUS=Rule of LAW & functional democracy.Shame on #GOP!
@SenateMajLdr Give George Washington his birthday back!
@SenateMajLdr YOU ARE THE WORST!!  George Washington would laugh and at you. You're not a leader, you're an angry white man.
@SenateMajLdr  it is the presidents constitution j
@SenateMajLdr celebrate as you make a mockery of the Constitution. #RepublicanCoup
@SenateMajLdr Let's celebrate President's Day by respecting the constitution and the office of POTUS. What do you think Mitch?
@SenateMajLdr George Washington wasn't born in the United States!
@SenateMajLdr Do you celebrate this by refusing to work in the democratic process?
@SenateMajLdr his actual birthday was February 22nd, but why would we expect you to know that or anything else!
@SenateMajLdr I am sure he is rolling in his grave.....
@SenateMajLdr How sad that you shame his legacy. Voting no on a candidate is an act of conscience. Refusing to vote on any is dishonor.
@SenateMajLdr great man; talked about LIBERTY and never freed his SLAVES; no wonder nation is failing; we are all SLAVES to CONSTITUTION!
@SenateMajLdr you want to wait on the next President Hillary Clinton, that's  a smart move I see what you're doing, I like it. GOOD JOB
@SenateMajLdr I thought you didn't believe in presidents?
@SenateMajLdr He'd be ashamed at yr underhanded tactics. He put our country 1st; you don't!
@SenateMajLdr @gop show their true intentions, to undermine our Democracy under the guise of protecting it. #SCOTUS replacement @maddow
@SenateMajLdr Ditto all the replies that say you are a hound dog that not only can't hunt but would get lost in the woods.
@SenateMajLdr  President  Obama will go into history as a great President, while working with worst Congress.
@SenateMajLdr I hope you will stall in Supreme Court Justice seat! I am hearing a lot thing in the Death Scalia and it look suspicious C I O
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress just 1 time for the sake of the country have a backbone
@SenateMajLdr I doubt seriously you would have the audacity to tell Washington (or any white president) not to nominate a SCOTUS justice.
@SenateMajLdr George Washington's bday is Feb 22nd, your knowledge of American history is only surpassed by your constitutional knowledge
@SenateMajLdr The celebration will begin when worthless politicians like yourself die off or kicked of office without pensions
@SenateMajLdr u dishonor the memory of Justice Scalia, a textualist,by not having a hearing and voting on a nominee. The height of hypocrisy
@SenateMajLdr Remember when you voted in '88?! Because EVERYONE else does #MITCHPLEASE @HuffPostPol @esquire @POTUS
@SenateMajLdr stand firm Mitch. Me and millions of Americans are counting on u. DO NOT CONFIRM ANY OBAMA SCOTUS NOMINATIONS!!!!
@SenateMajLdr IN 2005 MITCH HAD A DIFFERENT STANCE GOOGLE'S IT AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK AMERICA.GUYS LIKE MITCH ARE RUINING THIS COUNTRY.
@SenateMajLdr Ronald Reagan appointed a justice during HIS LAST YEAR OF OFFICE.  Why not Obama? This is hurting Americans.  We don't forget.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Sen. McConnell you are not honoring Justice Scalia, you're disrespecting him. #Scalia
@SenateMajLdr And to think we now have the likes of you aiding Obama...Please someone slap this turkey necked fool back to Kentucky
@SenateMajLdr please start working for all the people in this country instead of partisan grandstanding & blocking progress for Americans.
@SenateMajLdr your high-handed disrespectful tone to President Obama is precedent setting & demeans your position as Senate Majority leader.
@SenateMajLdr The American people elected President Obama twice. He has the constitutional authority to now nominate a Supreme Court Justice
@SenateMajLdr So how are you going to celebrate? By obstructing the current Commander in Chief, and ensuring he's a one-term President?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress What do you suppose he would think of the job you and your colleagues are doing? I doubt that he'd be imprssd.
@SenateMajLdr respect the current POTUS you pandering hack. #SCOTUS #PresidentsDay
@SenateMajLdr How about celebrating the CONSTITUTION and approving a SC nominee?!   It's your F***ING JOB.  Just do it!  Or NO PAY 4 U.
@SenateMajLdr 
 Sen McConnell: 
Make President George Washington proud by holding the line on appointing Supreme Court Justice.
@SenateMajLdr So glad to live in an era #GeorgeWashington's wish for the USA is finally coming true!

#PresidentsDay
@SenateMajLdr ~ The current one needs to be IMPEACHED, before he really does transform this Country ... for generations.
@SenateMajLdr  Washington is rolling his grave over you & your party's DISRESPECT for our Constitution. Hypocrites all!!
@SenateMajLdr <-- 

What the GOP is proposing we do with the #SCOTUS has never been done in US history, be prepared 2 lose in 2016,2018 
@SenateMajLdr <-

Scalia REPLACEMENT: Loretta Lynch has already been vetted for AG by REPUBLICAN SENATE, u won't be able 2 invalidate her.
@SenateMajLdr When @HillaryClinton becomes President she will pick the #SupremeCourt nominee ! I hope she picks #BarakObama ! #lmao
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress do you actually understand the constitution? It is a big word you you
@SenateMajLdr He was exceptional and a true leader.  Understood importance of our Constitution.  So fight for it now, new SCJ after Obama.
@SenateMajLdr hmm...u must hate Pres Obama is and will be mentioned in the same breath as Pres Washington- Commander in Chief!
.@SenateMajLdr Washington appointed Samuel Hitchcock and John McNairy in the last year of his terms to federal judiciary. #Scalia #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr is no leader just a lazy bought republican on all 4s for #Koch! if you had a shred of dignity you would resign immediately.
@SenateMajLdr this rule that doesnt exist is an excuse for our colleagues to run out the clock on qualified nominees
@SenateMajLdr @SenateMajLdr Happy President's Day to the Best President @POTUS   Barak Obama ! #PresidentsDay
@SenateMajLdr "commander in chief" - isn't that a misnomer?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Please consider a emergency reconvene to stop a possible recess appointment. Thank you.
@SenateMajLdr And tomorrow you'll continue to undermine our democracy & shred our Constitution 4 nothing more than mere $$$. #PresidentsDay
@SenateMajLdr But his birthday is 2/22
@SenateMajLdr Too bad you have zero respect for the office.
@SenateMajLdr ironic since your last tweet was a call to subvert the Constitution that Washington fought for.
@SenateMajLdr And an especially happy President's day to President Barack Obama.
@SenateMajLdr You seem to think you are POTUS. YOU ARE NOT and you are a hypocrite when you pretend to honor Washington and the constitution
@SenateMajLdr happy president day to all,accept Hispanic,African American! You are for one group of people.You don't do your job!
@SenateMajLdr - And hopefully the office can recover from the damage you and your ilk have done to it the last 8 years.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress #asshole
@SenateMajLdr and the current president, right?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress TRAITOR!!
@SenateMajLdr he'd have you hung for treason!
@SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP Notice there is no Senators Day. Advise and consent, not delay or obstruct! @CNN @MSNBC @BBCBreaking @npr @FoxNews
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress You can celebrate them, I deal with them as part of US history. Let's talk 1800-1900 (ignored) black history
.@SenateMajLdr George Washington appointed Supreme Court Justice Oliver Ellsworth IN HIS LAST YEAR IN OFFICE.  #DOYOURJOB
@SenateMajLdr Like hell we do. Americans are celebrating our fabulous President Barack Obama. Smartest guy in Washington by a country mile
@SenateMajLdr So today in honor of Washington why don't you all represent what he would have done in your position. Just for one day!
@Ohmysherrigray @SenateMajLdr #GeorgeWashington also warned against political parties in his farewell address. I guess we can see why #vote
