You are nothing but an old white racist. It is time we take back out country from you and those like you. We, the people, have had enough.
Yeah Sure Mitch that's exactly how I'm sure it will be remembered a few weeks from now after another $50 million bombing another runway
Your hypocrisy is sickening. You criticized Obama for the stuff you are letting Trump get away with. Party before country is evil, old man.
WHY DID YOU VOTE AGAINST THIS KIND OF ACTION WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA REQUESTED IT OF CONGRESS..SOMETHING TRUMP SHOULD BE DONE?
#FlipFlop
False Flag Propaganda to get support for an illegal intervention in foreign affairs all in the name of profit. #wakeupamerica #sheep
& THEN SENDING CIA TORTURE CHIEF TO FAKE PHYSICIAN TO COVER UP & LIE THAT VICTIM IS CRAZY OR VIOLENT?
Yet you opposed the same proposal from Obama in 2013. Between this and Gorsuch, clear signal is that Trump ass tastes like candy to you.
GOP is a hypocritical embarrassment! Support of an incompetent POTUS, Hyper-partisanship, no accountability to constituents! They need to go
Please explain why you support an attack on #Syria now but didn't in 2013. What changed?
Lets go find all the bad guys in Syria and cut their taxes. Problem solved.
But the killing of 1500 in 2013 was OK? You wouldn't give Obama the go ahead because he was a black democrat. Trump does it without you.
If so great, then why did you oppose Obama's request to do the same thing?  Why did you oppose EVERYTHING Obama requested?  Racist much?
In the same way Chamberlain's negotiations prevented WWII
IT WAS EVEN MORE CLEAR WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS ACTION IN 2013!!  YOU VOTED AGAINST IT.  WHY WAS IT OK THIS TIME? AMERICANS KNOW WHY
These attacks, monstrous as they are, were not a direct attack against the United States or one of its treaty allies -your quote under Obama
Exactly what did this attack accomplish? R you concerned that Assad continues 2kill Syrians. @SenateGOP a bunch of hypocrites. #Trumprussia
Its so clear to US voters that the only reason GOP is in support of these actions in #Syria, is because #POTUS is wearing your team's jersey
We can see that it was a clear signal to the American People that trump really is trying to distract from #trumpRussia it's not working
why didn't u support the exact same attack in 13.  Playing the politics game instead of protecting the country. #hypocrite
this is a signal that you are a racist. Love America hate you
Funny how you didn't feel this way when Obama wanted authorization on Syria. What has changed hypocrite Mitch???
So Russia n Syria started using the same airfield to bombed their people again.  Trump gave the plan, what's next?  U said Obama didn't have
NO Chemicals in the buildings bombed in syria by USA!?UK Guardian Reported this w/ VIDEO...You're corrupt+ yr legacy will show this
So your giving blanket approval for the President to do what he wants without Congressional approval?
Now what? Assad is not going to stop. Refuges? Will he retaliate against his own people?
This could have been done years ago if you would have given Pres. Obama a war authorization. Trump broke the constitution
What of other attacks on his people, who draw the lines to protect them from Assad's evil?
What is the Human call on these attacks.
You didn't care about 1000+ Syrians dying in 2013 but 70 die and NOW your croc tears come out.
You had NO prob saying no 2 Obama + citing no sec threat. But white Republican in WH + you turn n2 a teen Belieber 4 war.
War the ultimate distraction!
 Yeah, we really showed them! 
Listen your friend Trump forewarned Putin of the upcoming attack as a result of the chemical attack he carried out days before.  Messed up

All I hear you saying is you put party before country and everything else. Could have sent message 4 yrs ago if that's what it's about.
Sadly, we would have taken out the runway if this were intended to be anything more than a distraction
Did you give approval cause no one else in congress did
It's not clear to ANYBODY,least of all trump.i hope 2 hell whatever he watches on tv 2night doesn't prompt him 2 whip out the nuclear codes.
This is twitler trying to wag the dog. You are complicit. Maybe we can save $ and use the same firing squad for all you traitors #PUTINSBOYS
As he does it again, foolish man!
Why would assad do a gassing knowing it`d end his govt? Smells fishy.
Maybe he thought he could show the world that Trump was weak like Obama, but it didn't work!
Trump was willing to fight isis with Assad and russia.
Maybe Assad and Russia didn't want that.
Just saying no thanks works better than gassing your own ppl.
Yeah, Republicans are great at getting America into wars. Easy choice when you're not the one who has to go fight them. Also, Cha-ching!
How much did the useless firework cost us?Didn't trump deny passage 2&thru the USA 2 the BEAUTIFUL Babies?Isn't Syria on the Muslim ban list
And what does Jared say?
Where were you 3 years ago?
Wrong. Apparently he can even still use the airbase that was attacked.
@McConnellPress 2013:  1) "A vital national security risk is clearly not at play".
Flip flop.... we see you!!!!!!!!!!
#hypocrite
#StupidIdiot
@POTUS and @GOP do not care about majority of Americans or Syrians. Show compassion OPEN U.S. DOORS to these desperate people. They need us!
"My govt break plan gut me my Gore-suck & pres is 'no plan' Drumpf stead o' black Obama I stopped, bomb shit outta Assad good idea now"
Hillery said she.d bombed all bases get used to loose.n Dems and we got a judge Hillery would have started a big war get over it cry babies
Funny how against this you were when @BarackObama was President. You are f-ing up the country and proving you can't lead.
GOD YOU ARE SO DISGUSTING.
Such a joke. You told Russia. Russia told his boyfriend. His boyfriend moved everything to safety and we wastes expensive bombs.  Freak
again more hypocrisy - where were you when Obama asked for authorization to punish Assad in 2013 after he gassed thousands?
The BIGGEST hypocrite ever not to demand it now. 2/2
Care to share with the rest of the class what the broad long term strategy is here?I mean you demanded it in 2013 so you'd have to B the 1/2
You are such a creep. Do you really think we don't see you? Don't see that you sold out country? We do.
If it's being described as "the most ineffectual US strike in decades" I don't think Assasd is much scared. #RESISTANCE
No it's  not. It's  a f*ckin show and you know it you shill. The base is being used by Assad's warplanes right now Dimwit.
I hope you drop several more similar signals promptly.  If you don't, the message Assad will get is that he will pay only that small price.
Bull. Didn't do one thing to limit Assad.
Mitch loves Paul Ryan's special sauce while Trump tosses his salad.
It was also against our Constitution! Congressional approval is needed- WAR IS NOT WHAT AMERICA WANTS. This is not our fight; RUSSIA'S FIGHT
Between vetoing an authorized attack 4 years ago and not having a vote on Garland, you are the biggest hypocrite in senate history.
Then why did you vote no to Obama requesting a similar strike in 2013 after a chem attack that was significantly worse?
So Syria's chemical weapons NOW POSE a threat to US security that they DID NOT POSE in 2013???  What changed in 4 years???
Do Republicans care about #Muslims now? Thought we were supposed to be afraid of anchor babies & all that #confusing #Trumprussia
You were against Obama air strikes in 2013 when Assad gassed over 1000 Syrians. You are an absolute hypocrite. #disgraceful
Riiiiight. Just regular bombs.  Regular bombs are ok. Go ahead and kill all the civilians you want,  just use regular bombs
What about 200 civilians dead in Mosul at hands of US?  Is that unacceptable too?
You wouldn't approve Obama's request to initiate strikes. Trump didn't ask.
And here, in Oregon
Maybe you can meet him with POTUS on a Trump golf course
Yes, it's awful when an authoritarian regime uses chemical weapons against it's own citizens. As shown here, in North Dakota, last winter.
And here in Oregon
don't try to change the subject u robbed us women and American workers deserve more than a scj that will vote against justice
Perhaps we should ask questions before shooting!!! haven't we made enough mistakes in the middle east over the past 15 years!!
Look in the mirror and ask yourself if you would say the exact same thing if Hillary were pres. and launched an airstrike w/o congress aprvl
@twright55 get rid of this chemical weapon child killer and make him face crime against humanity charges.
ARE YOU BEING HELLED HOSTAGE AT GUN-POINT BY SOMEONE, THAT TELLES YOU TO TWEET THAT YOU TWEETED ABOUT SYRIA AND MR. ASSAD
You are a hypocrite.
Where's the Congressional approval?
Why did it take 7 attacks by Assad before we acted? Impress Chinese? Distract from investigations? Healthcare failure?
what about all the horrendous events in Aleppo? 
You know it's okay and your right to criticize POTUS. Try it.
If you had approved Obamas plan 4 years ago we wouldn't be in this mess
Where were you the first time he did it?  Oh right.  In the senate.  Quietly doing nothing.
Shouldn't you be #outraged? What changed in this matter other than the party at the top? #sad #partypolitics #DoSomething right! #shameful
Yep. Bombing an abandoned airbase that had 8 hours warning should really turn the trick! 

Christ.
And a clear signal that the GOP is about party and politics rather than constituents... look at their history! #sad #partypolitics #sick
No Turtleboy..

It was an illegal act!

Our Senate MUST Vote on any air strikes!

We all know @POTUS is trying to deflect his Russian lies!
And yet, when Obama tried to resolve the Syrian crisis, you blocked him.  Not for any decent reasons of course - just moronic petulance. Sad
You are a traitor to the Democratic process & the American ppl on many many levels.
What was your "clear signal"  when President Obama wanted to do something? You said, no.
This act is illegal .. the congress is the only one  that can declare war another reason to #impeach
funny u opposed strikes in 2013 but now it okay. Oh yeah a so called Republican POTUS
ohhh yes! Keep dreaming!
Where was your conviction in 2013? Oh that's right...we had a Black President then.
Nope...it's just BS ploy between dear leader & Putin.  Retire old coot!!
Right. I'm sure he'll immediately fold cos you and Trump are so tough.
McConnell you are no longer protecting our great democracy. Your vision is narrowing with age. Please go, and take your immorality with you.
You refused to allow Obama to make any kind of force on Syria .But now your kissing butt
Obama is smarter and a way better man than Trump or McConnell who are nothing but 2 bit greed con men
Where were you when Mr Obama wanted to retaliate?....oh right....you were the leader of the Party of No....
Where was your thinking on this in 2013? Thousands have died because GOP won't take responsibility for anything. This will backfire.
And need to retire or go to a nursing home.
I'm still focused on Trump ties with Russia. That won't change.
No worries little sad man, he will probably start using them on us. I hope he knows where you reside.
It was strictly a reality show diversion from the Russian Scandal. Trump alerted Putin who in turn told Assad. A very expensive charade. Sad
when Obama wanted to do something against bashar why didn't you do something then instead of voting against the no fly zone
This is an impulsive distraction. @POTUS  is not the poster child for humanity #Hypocrites
If Obama had done this you'd have been screaming about him not getting Congressional approval. You and morals parted company long ago.
Nope ASAAD had prior warning. US smokescreen 4 Trump. Fact-check, sir. only clear signal was that you back a collaborator #investigateTrump
Lol. And @POTUS didn't even tell you he was going to do it. I'm going to start calling you Melania. Or fishwife.
So when did the Senate approve these actions?Ya know that the base was cleared before the attack since the idiot warned Russia.Subpar brains
A clear signal would be stating Assad has to go and allowing refugees in
That was so absolutely  correct.  Trump   
Or that the "rebels" can stage false flags and have Assad removed by Western powers?
All a ruse! Trump informed Putin, Putin informed Assad, Assad moved aircraft & personnel. All to make Trump look tough. Trump  is a failure
But when Obama asked you yo intervene you said no? #Hypocrisy
God will judge all.
It is not known who poisoned them. The Wahhabis seized chemical plants, it can be their business.
Rocket attacks on Syria and a vote for Gorsuch on the same day. This is a coincidence?
No, this is our orange-faced Grifter-In-Chief, trying to prove that he's tough and in charge. It's what bullies do.
Today should vote for Gorsuch. It would be a shame if the rocket does not work and he is not confirmed. What cynicism. To poison people in
It's not a clear signal. It's a single datum. Clarity is Multiple consistent responses. Like if Senate declares Assad a war criminal...
I think this was a bad idea if anything this should have been a hit on Isis
H e still has the chemical weapons unless UN goes in and takes them.
or a signal that we r only willing to help ppl of other countries if it means we can lob missiles at something but no refugees please
