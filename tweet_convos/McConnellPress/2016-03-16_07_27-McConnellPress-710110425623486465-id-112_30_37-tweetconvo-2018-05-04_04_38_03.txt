@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Need more time to huddle w other bitter Sen Repubs bfor issuing your negative comments, eh?
@SenateMajLdr do your job.
@SenateMajLdr You are a big baby
@SenateMajLdr Time to call off the GOPe rats on Trump & look at reality, we pay your salary!
@ringod01 @SenateMajLdr unfortunately they get to decide their salary and everything else about their jobs. Wish I could! #mustbenice
@SenateMajLdr Hopefully your remarks include the phrase, "We will do our job." Enough of the #grandstanding. Just #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr THE BIDEN RULE IS NOT LAW, ONLY AN OPINION. NOTE: BE AWARE I AM SEEING WHAT LEGAL ACTION I CAN TAKE.
@SenateMajLdr AS AN U.S CITIZEN I AM HARMED BY YOUR IN ACTION TO YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO HOLD A HEARING.
@SenateMajLdr Excited to hear you urge fair consideration of the #SCOTUSnom by the U.S. Senate.
@SenateMajLdr well...u have to decide btw Hillary the "Liberal"or Trump the "Crazy" or confirm Garland! What a gamble, huh?
@SenateMajLdr  I part of your remarks included the phrase "I don't care what the Constitution say". #d
@SenateMajLdr DO YOUR JOB for the American people & approve Judge Garland for SCOTUS. You've embarrassed yourself & the GOP long enough.
@SenateMajLdr Mr McConnell, just because Obama is black does not disqualify from doing his duty. DO YOURS!
@SenateMajLdr The tweets from the un-american left show they can't express themselves without profanity. Lack of intelligence.
@SenateMajLdr DO YOUR JOB, MITCH! Refusing to even meet with a #SCOTUS nominee has no basis in the Constitution or history.#DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr and they better be respectful to Judge Garland and the President like he did to the Senate!
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr #doyourjob or watch how many Rs lose theirs in November
@SenateMajLdr Your mom will give remarks later
@SenateMajLdr just shut up and do your job no one wants to hear what u have to say they want you to do what you were elected to do!
@SenateMajLdr Do your job and let the Senate vote on Judge Garland. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr Good speech.You notice our president only acts presidential when it pleases him and this is one of those times.@StopObamaCourt
@SenateMajLdr  ok Sen. McConnell, if Trump is NOT nominated and Garland not confirmed I will vote for Hillary as revenge against the REPUB.
Really interested to hear @SenateMajLdr response. #SCOTUSnominee was pretty much a dare to not have up/down vote   http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/16/us/politics/garland-supreme-court-nomination.html â€¦

@SenateMajLdr And while you're at it, please #EndorseCruz @RandPaul
@SenateMajLdr Don't bother, your full remarks will be a bloviating version of "Lalalalala, we can't hear you!"
@SenateMajLdr Will the GOP take the Liberal bait and tuck tail / run again?  

Will we unite and stand up against the Left's Propaganda unit
@SenateMajLdr Please do not cave to this POTUS. Stand your ground Mitch! #WeThePeople demand that you do not nominate this judge!
@SenateMajLdr he's got you over a barrel AGAIN. It's chess vs checkers Mitch Mac will you keep your promise?
@SenateMajLdr you should also prepare your remarks for when your party loses control over the Senate in November.
@SenateMajLdr This is our chance to re correct the mistake all republicans have made especially the last 6 years. Unite against Obama's spin
@SenateMajLdr need more paint in that corner Dr No?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress do your job as an elected official of the same people that chose our current president. #SupremeCourt

@SenateMajLdr if you refuse to do your job you should be charged with sedition. And if you don't know what that is look it up
@SenateMajLdr and if they don't include holding hearings, you will continue destroying the country you claim to love.
@SenateMajLdr I hope you decide to #DoYourJob . This is why Americans can't stand politicians.
@SenateMajLdr why don't you just hold your breath and stomp your feet.  Either way, it is a  #tantrum  Just #DoYourJob Mr. Leader
@SenateMajLdr Why is it ugly white men always marry Asian chicks? Can't even marry an American, that's unpatriotic #DoYourJob
.@SenateMajLdr presides over the most partisan & obstructionist Senate. He hates compromise even more than he hates Obama. #DoYourJob
DO YOUR JOB!! @SenateMajLdr @OrrinHatch 

Listen to Orrin:
@SenateMajLdr Obama was elected twice because Romney let us down in 2012.  His Presidency should have never went past 2012.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress
@SenateMajLdr Those will be simply ' No way!', right?
@SenateMajLdr Obama has yanked and pulled the people around for too long.  Let the people decide.   Americans are hurting because of Obama.
@SenateMajLdr Hopefully it will be "I will be doing my job." The president is still in office. Stop taking OUR voice away. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Let me guess it will go like this.. you will put your fingers in your ears, stomp your feet and yell "NA NA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"
DO YOUR JOB!! @SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr What will you say, Mitch? Will you tell us how much you hate America? How you routinely spit on the Constitution?
