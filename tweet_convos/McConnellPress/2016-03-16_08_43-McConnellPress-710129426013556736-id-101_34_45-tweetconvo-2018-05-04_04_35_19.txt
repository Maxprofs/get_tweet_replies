@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs ok, so let Hilary nominate Michelle next year
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Just like the dead Scalia.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs I've never voted democrat but I will this time to watch this blow up in your face.
@SenateMajLdr first you rig the GOP in Colorado and take away peoples right to vote then you refuse to do your job and give us SCOTUS##
@SenateMajLdr the real issue is that you're being petty, stubborn, and prideful. Stop hiding. You have a softball yet you refuse to swing.
@SenateMajLdr No shit.  That's how it works.
@SenateMajLdr WHY Oh WHY does Congress allow 5 lawyers in black robes to control our country and it's people. SCOTUS way out of control
@SenateMajLdr so please let our president who was elected to do so make a pick and send it to you in the senate.
@SenateMajLdr Thanks for failing Americans with your petty partisan obstructionism. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress your putting a lot of faith in the republicans winning.  As of now Hilary leads, whatcha gonna do then??
@SenateMajLdr so you're just scared then? Too scared to #DoYourJob?
.@SenateMajLdr Thank goodness we elected a President to uphold our values. Sorry Scalia didnt die next year. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr I guess the ends justify the means.  How is it going to feel when GOP loses AGAIN?  @FoxNews @SpeakerRyan Have the hearings.
@SenateMajLdr and Americans knew that when they elected Obama again
@SenateMajLdr Orrin Hatch likes Garland. But that doesn't matter. You have a constitutional obligation to consider nominee. Do your job.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress #doyourjob America voted for President Obama twice!
.@SenateMajLdr Just do your fucking job or we'll get somebody who actually wants to.
@SenateMajLdr Yeah, wouldn't want them reversing Citizen's United and taking money out of your pockets, you corrupt shill
@SenateMajLdr and should be chosen by the person the MAJORITY of this country ELECTED since he still has a job to do - WTH - #youaretheworst
@SenateMajLdr  which is why delaying for a year is wrong.
@SenateMajLdr You do remember that you are paid to do a job by the people . I think you need to refrain from making this personal @ POTUS
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs  And you say Obama is politicizing this?  Do you even hear yourself when you talk?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Yes, he could, but general elections have consequences.  Accept that the GOP lost and #DoYourJob!
@SenateMajLdr That's the consequence of losing the 2012 Presidential election. You knew this in 1970. Reread what you wrote.
@SenateMajLdr The same is true of any and all "next justices."
@SenateMajLdr right!  Approve him!  The American people elected the man who nominated Garland, turkey neck gobbler.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress -And that's exactly what the American people are hoping for.  NOT another Scalia....prejudiced man.
@SenateMajLdr Failure to hold hearings is going to have huge impact in your returning in January as minority leader

#DoYourJobYertle
@SenateMajLdr You just don't want any Dem nominating a SCOTUS justice. You are one completely useless senator.
@SenateMajLdr Over 70% of Americans want the minimum wage raised to 12.00 an hour and no tax cuts for billionaires. Are you listening???
@SenateMajLdr Ergo, maybe you should just stop your posturing and your grandstanding and do your job.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Move forward and stop the games! #ivotedforyou
@SenateMajLdr You mean like the RW majority have now been doing for a number of years.....impacting so many with conservative BS ok 4 u but
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress And I am scared that as. Republican I won't be able to continue my discriminatory policies.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress As could blocking the nomination for political reasons. DO YOUR JOB.
@SenateMajLdr I DO wish you & your buddies in GOP would have had this  mindset throughout Obama's terms, rather than caving & going along
@SenateMajLdr Which is not your business. Your job is to make sure the President offers a qualified candidate and the candidate gets a vote.
I know!   I think @HillaryClinton should start thinking about her choice now.  @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress #Decision2016
@SenateMajLdr yes....pay no attention to the 65% of Americans who want a vote.  You're making November really easy.
@SenateMajLdr From your mouth to God's ear.  America NEEDS major change.
@SenateMajLdr You want Donald Trump picking SCOTUS nominees. Stop it. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Thanks for the "Obvious" rhetoric MM.
@SenateMajLdr @GOP .. @billclinton nominated this same judge during election year; GOP blocked him only to later confirm him after election.
Maybe for the better“@SenateMajLdr The next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of #SCOTUS & have profound impact on our country
@SenateMajLdr yes you're right. Now how to we get one? By UNITING behind @tedcruz because we won't get one with Trump presidency!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress good because we'lI put about five in office when we take the White House and the Senate and the House. You suk
@SenateMajLdr God forbid a moderate be a bad choice. It's sad that you're so entrenched that you won't do what you were elected to do.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs This #SCOTUSnominee supported the 2007 DC gun ban attempt. Disqualified from consideration.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Mitch you put up a good fight. The pressure must be immense. It's been at least an hour. Fold your hand
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs YET #SCOTUS is allegedly apolitical??
@SenateMajLdr As it always is. Stop changing the game. We voted in Obama, twice. Let him do his job for once.
@SenateMajLdr and don't you want someone fair and dedicated like Garland?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs yet for all the talk the GOP will cave and give the dems what they want
@SenateMajLdr I hope @HillaryClinton nominates an African-American Female from Mexico thats Muslim.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob you need to be voted out of office
@SenateMajLdr You've already had a profound impact on our country -  a destructive one!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress #DitchMitch
@SenateMajLdr 
Please do your job- Merrick Garland is an exemplary choice
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress  McConnell- you should be ashamed for not considering SCOTUS nominee- you're embarrassing!
@SenateMajLdr we'll just keep on obstructing and wait for Hillary Clinton to pick one for you.
@SenateMajLdr: The American people HAVE ALREADY spoken, and President Obama has made his choice. DO YOUR JOB McCONNELL!!
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs That's what the people want fool! #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Welcome to the minority you cranky mushed mouth old man.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Set the confirmation hearings for next February. Problem solved.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs why is the GOP not behind Ted cruz.  Please stop politics he is best for our country.  @tedcruz
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs  @Senate_GOPs do not consider @potus @SCOTUSnom #bidenrule
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr DO NOT GIVE IN!!!!!!
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs the only question that matters is where does he stand on the death penalty
@SenateMajLdr stand your ground Mitch
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs That's an understatement.
~@SenateMajLdr You were elected. The President was elected. You have a nominee. The Constitution is clear. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr do your job! Stop acting like a child
@SenateMajLdr so reject it!
@SenateMajLdr Which is why I'm sure you'll vet any nominee thoroughly, then have an up or down vote.
@SenateMajLdr so that's why you want Donald Trump, the "ya fired" guy, to pick the nominee right?
This partisanship & obstruction is exactly why Congress has an approval rating of only 14% http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/Congress-Public.aspx?utm_source=twitterbutton&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=sharing … #DoYourJob @SenateMajLdr
