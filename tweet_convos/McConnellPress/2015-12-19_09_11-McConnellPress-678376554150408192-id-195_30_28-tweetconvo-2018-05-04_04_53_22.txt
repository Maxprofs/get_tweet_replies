Since when? So far, the @Senate_GOPs has bowed down, sucked up, wimped out, caved in, knuckled under to the Democrats. Totally useless.
.@JimAustin45 you mean you're upset they didn't shut the government down over disagreements as usual this year?  @Senate_GOPs
@AtheistEngineer @Senate_GOPs To what extent should America sacrifice its future in order to keep the government functioning?
@JimAustin45 electing not to pay our debts over a political dispute is a great way to screw up our low interest rates. @Senate_GOPs
@AtheistEngineer @Senate_GOPs No one said anything about suspending payments.
@JimAustin45 that's not true. The right has held us hostage over debt ceiling limits on several occasions, risking default. 

@Senate_GOPs
@AtheistEngineer @Senate_GOPs Refusing to raise debt ceiling only prohibits increasing debt, not payment on current debt.
@JimAustin45 and you think those are unrelated?

@Senate_GOPs
@Senate_GOPs is this a joke? Just go away and leave us alone. Don't piss on my head and tell me it's raining
