Haha, and we have never seen SCOTUS opposition like this either. #Toolz
Not a single Republican opposed Judge Garland.  You are a flagrant partisan hypocrite.
and Merrick Garland was a GOP choice #resist
ciao come va?
The stakes R now higher.Senators view a nom 2 the court of appeals differently than they view a nominee 4 the Supreme Court.
I bet you can expect more this time around.
Applying the same logic to Sessions would result in NO vote.  Previously denied=denied now.
but now he has Trump taint.  Ugh!
neither did Merrill garland receive no votes from republicans
That was then, and not for the Supreme Court. I think you know the difference.
Merrick Garland was also a solid bipartisan choice.  You failed to uphold your constitutional oath
eat it Mitch
Lol! Guess you taught those naive 2006 Democrats how to obstruct, didn't 'cha,   @SenateMajLdr? You made the bed. @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts
Merrick Garland was supported by GOP.  You wouldn't do your job. SHAME!
So what? You tried to block Merrick Garland in 1997 for reasons unrelated to his qualifications - sound familiar? -and failed.
unfortunate that such a good man is already demoralized.  Might relate to your actions?
funny when Obama wanted to appoint someone just as qualified you stuck it in his face
Not 1 Republican opposed Judge Garland before either. Yet you FAILED TO DO YOUR JOB.
Garland didn't receive a single no vote from Republicans.  You used to love him, Mitchy. #hypocrite
Won't happen this time old boy
The biggest disappointment I have an Obama is not calling you on the carpet for being a piece of 
but now it has President Bannon's taint on it.  No Dem takers!
The rabid Trump base loves you for this.  Everyone else?  Nah.  We actually read.
Gorsuch is beside the point. There's too much on the line now to lay any weapon down. And you helped launch us down this path.
so and you blocked garland. Payback turtle!!
If you are using that reasoning, Sessions shouldn't be confirmed because he was denied in past by both parties
Not a single Republican thought they needed a ninth judge last year. Apparently, it can wait.
um you set a precedent last year on SCOTUS.  I'd argue they are just following your precedent.
Get facts straight-not a rule & no empty SCOTUS seat. A speech given by Biden about nomination rancor
It's not about the nominee, it's about the principle. Sound familiar? It should.
and he said garland was a brilliant political mind you sloth
Just go Nuclear,your in charge the people are with you and Pres Trump.Don't give into the Dem's.
Not the same court
So what?
@MarieMa49685063 @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts Democrats want to allow the enemy to come here and murder us and rape the women
#garland,akes9
Of course that was before you had your 'proudest moment' denying President Obama his pick.
I know who also got "no?" #Garland bc u never gave him a chance, u hypocrite
Nor did Merrick Garland receive any 'No's' from Republicans.
Relevance? Circuit courts are not the Supreme Court!
That was a different job you hypocrite.  What happened to Garland's up and down vote? #LiarInChief
@McConnellPress @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts You make our country sick. You are octogenarian poster boy for corrupt GREEDY GOP.
@McConnellPress @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts He's going to Gore&suck our civil liberties & cow tow to billionaire club.
The majority of Republican senators voted to confirm #MerrickGarland to the D.C. Circuit
this seat should be Obama's to fill. Not trump's.
We need to have the cabinet 100% confirmed! Please make this happen Mr. Leader
As the architect of 8 yrs of obstructionist politics how can you muster the nerve for this drivel?
I guess you've forgotten Merrick Garland? Today's GOP just love to "forget" and revise history.
U @SenateMajLdr R the reason people hate BOTH parties & #President #Trump WON! Quit playing games and INVESTIGATE VOTER FRAUD!!! @PolitiFact
No one voted against Robart either in 2004. POTUS deserves censure from senate for his attack on judicial branch.
You deserve to be hung in the gallows in a public square for all the harm you've caused this country
McConMan you have harmed this nation over & over & over again with your antics.  Just keep it up.
TRUE: Mitch McConnell will never get the stench of @realDonaldTrump off of him. History will not be kind to him
Merrick Garland was also highly praised by GOP. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/22/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-exaggerates-tradition-not-confirmi/ …
Ask Mitch how much did his wife get for speaking in 2015 to Iran $50,000
That was then. This is now. Reap what you sow, sir.
After what you did you President Obama's nominee, I hope all the Dem. rise up in protest.
Please do not put party before country. We are better than this @SenateMajLdr
And Merrick Garland had majority Republican votes...when congress still tried for 'right' thing.

IF YOU PLACE THE FRAUDULENT PROFITEER BETSY DEVOS IN PUBLIC OFFICE YOU WILL PAY FOREVER.
@McConnellPress @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts under your obstruction,judicial vacancies doubled. Judicial emergencies tripled.TRUE
@McConnellPress @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts and that hasn't stopped you from voting against your own nominees
interesting, not a single NO vote for "so called judge" James L. Robart ....
That was then. This is now.
Republicans didn't even consider Merrick Garland because they disliked Obama. FACT
Gorsuch 10 years ago is not Gorsuch now and being qualified for that post doesn't make him qualified for this one
You governed only for your re-election and not for the people for years. It is time for you step aside. #TermLimits
these are different times dangerous times w/corrupt, evil, power hungry men as u terrorize the peopl
why should we care? you only opposed Garland as a stunt. Republican President Trump is now your albatross
@McConnellPress @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts you are not a leader you are a follower and an old bigot period
@McConnellPress @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts same thing GOP did to Merrick Garland
how many 'NO' votes did #MerrickGarland receive? You're a partisan treasonous snake who should be PRIMARY-ED & VOTED OUT.
Yeah - that's what happened with Garland. No Republican opposed Garland either - UNTIL YOU SAID TO.
I wish that Republican and Democratic come together, and make some changes.
Do you think the public is going to forget Merrick Garland so easily? Karma is a bitch!
This is a #MerrickFact the he wasn't allowed a hearing...WHY? Mcconnell Fact...#Coward #Hypocrite #sellout
Voters are watching. We see you and your lack of respect for us and the US constitution.
my proudest moment was stopping Obamas nomination. Hypocrites
Republican hypocrisy on Obama's SCOTUS pick you should have been fired!
we want the best for our children and YOU KNOW #BetsyDevos is THE WRONG CHOICE! VOTE NO!
it's like you guys are attempting to train wreck the country in hopes of making a few rich. These kids matter! #KidsEdMatters
I have never served in a political office. Would I be qualified to introduce bills in the senate? Could I have YOUR job?
would you elect me to the US Senate and I have NO knowledge of constitutional law or a  degree in political science?
I wouldn't if you think a political science degree makes you qualified lol.  I understand your point, just bad ex.
You can't not fly a plane & land it safely if you've no experience with being a pilot. How can she successfully lead PublicEd?
as a 12 year educator, I have more experience than #BetsyDevos. I attended public schools and have student loans.
Remember 

When Trump brings the #USA to War and Lifts Russians sanctions

Supported by @SenateMajLdr & @GOP
I solemnly swear  to uphold the laws and NEVER say a negative word against Mother Russia.
#TraitorInChief 
@McConnellPress @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts it's 2017 now baby 
doesnt need your made excuses for him his opinion is more important !Stop playing politics with it
2017 vote for Garland GOP blocked America SPEAKS.
You and the GOP stole the seat from Obama,admit it all of you are Racist.
Jusge Garland didn't get a vote!!!
@McConnellPress @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts Tjat was then. This is now
I think parties should be gone all together. I'm tired of all the party line voting & deal making. Bunch of corrupt old men!
Do you realize that the Dems represent people too. So they're fighting for what really is the majority despite the president.
You CHANGED the rules this week to pass incompetent nominees & that was fine? But not breaking tradition is different? Please.
Why are you fine w/breaking rules & tradition when it helps you but when the Dems wanted to pick the SC it couldn't be done?
and no Republican opposed James Robart but now he's just a so-called Judge. Care to comment? #facts
You hypocrite. At least they considered him in 2006, unlike Garland. This is a mess of your making.
Your lack of morality got us TRAITOR Trump.
@Weltenbrandt @SenateMajLdr @nytimes Mitch has the a advantage of tucking his head down in his shell when the going gets tough.

Neither did Merrick Garland you tRump& Putin boot licker.
Garland deserves a vote
Stolen pick from a illegitimate President
So wait, is this a fact or an alternative fact?
2006 Court of Appeals VS 2017 Supreme Court. 11 yrs? What else is different? UR attempt 2 prove TRUTH is SAD & SLIMEY. #RESIST
Mitch you have no balls no spine
different bar for Supreme Court.  You denied Garland another great judge a hearing or phone calls.
http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article130415834.html# …
really you think you can remember that far back
Gorsuch's views on discrimination are not acceptable
Same for Garland.   Reds loved him until Obama nominated him
Big difference from the Supreme Court.
Get a backbone and use "The Reid Option" and get the job done fast track !
How does it feel being the stooge to white supremacists? What will history books say about you?
Screw you. You stole that seat. GO NUCLEAR. I'm backing every rep in my state that opposes Gorsuch.
Where's Merrick Garland's no vote? #obstruct much hypocrite? Stolen @SenateMajLdr @PolitiFact #amjoy @GorsuchFacts @GarlandSCOTUS #scotus
You #obstructed &refused to vote at all @SenateMajLdr You lie. #dirtypolitics @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts @GarlandSCOTUS
Wow!  It looks like you can tell the truth on occasion.  What do you want, a cookie? #StolenSeat
You're OK aligning with white supremacists as long as you can line your pockets, yes?
- what could've made them change their minds, I wonder?
why do you always look like you're about to drop a huge load?
And now in a move exposing MASSIVE hypocrisy they will all vote no.

you have failed the country. Putting party over constituents we will not forget what you did for 8 years #CountryOverParty
.Consensus!
8 million citizens voted for someone other than this Mess. #LowestRatedPresidentEver #Nomandate
it's a stolen seat and most Democrats don't believe trump will be POTUS in a year?, need to wait
but that wasn't for a lifetime appointment made by an idiot! #ApplesToOranges
Dems actually do their Job ! No reaching or bending !Repubs should take a lesson !we expect partisan
I doubt anyone considers him a poor jurist.  However, they are enraged by your unethical obstruction of the Garland nomination
you mean Obama's stolen choice right? But then your wife did get a sweet new job
So what?  That was then, this is now.  Stakes are higher.  What happened to Merrick Garland, anyway?
enforced "Biden rule" for 10 months.  Now it's time for @senschumer to enforce the "McConnell Rule" till 2018-20 @politifact
.@SenateMajLdr @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts  Garland didn't receive a single no vote from Rs because you took ur ball and went home. #Cheater
you should have held hearings for Garland. Party politics. You're a plight on our democracy.
Merrick Garland did not receive a single no vote from Republicans. Sad. Unconstitutional.
Have you no sense of decency sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?
Right, and now it's 10+ years later, and it was not a SC position.  So what is your point?
times change jackass
Court of Appeals is NOT SCOTUS. Obstruct for a full year but want to confirm nom from a lunatic? FU
Did they know he founded and led a club called Fascism Forever?  @SenateMajLdr @PolitiFact @GorsuchFacts Fuck this guy forever.
Go NUCLEAR and bypass these libtards. WE NEED GORSUCH NOW! NO DELAY ON HIM! SAVE U.S. NOW!
Merrick Garland.
The High School fascist???
Yes, and Merrick Garland also didn't receive a single 'no' vote from Republicans in 2016. So, why isn't he on the Bench?
damn your just a pushy sob
thats because they lie. Not American.
Is that supposed to cheer sane people? You are of both incapable of good judgement?
true fact: you do your job exactly as a ten year old would do it
omg you for once told the truth, it is still a stolen seat
Did merick Garland??#hypocrisy # indivisible #2018
I strongly oppose #Gorsuch @Scotus he will side with corps citizens and family planning and children issues #StopPresitBannon
And your refusal to have a vote for Garland? Because you were concerned he would be approved.
SO WHAT?  IT'S A NEW DAY AND PAYBACK IS A BIATCH.  #MerrickGarland  awaits.  @GOP
why are you subtweeting politifact?
you wouldn't have this pushback if you had allowed Garland to move forward. You know that don't fake
Please represent the people. The people say NO to DeVos! Your "yes" vote is a slap to our face. #NOdevos
The SCOTUS  seat belonged to Obama to fill. Jerk. Hypocrit.  Gorsuch is a racist. #TheResistance
