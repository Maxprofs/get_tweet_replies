YOU Obstructionist. I pray for locus in your office and in your home.
Who wants to watch an A RINO GLOBALIST? U have a lot of guts saying we shouldn't have a wall at our southern border. RETIRE!
@McConnellPress @cspan Like you did when PBO was elected? #Trump deserves as much respect, cooperation as YOU gave Obama. NONE
@SenateGOP @cspan What a deplorable poor excuse for a human
Hold a vote for term limits. Discuss disagreements publicly not privately!  Work with President Trump, not against him!
@SenateGOP @cspan please push to have HRC indicted for ALL the crimes she has committed against our United States of America

@McConnellPress @cspan Republicans are not innocent. Your judgment was wrong and Bluecollar was hurt by your Policies  to.
Ok i'll be watching. Think about americans, not your vengeance.  FIX Obamacare, not repeal it.  Fix things instead!!
You don't move forward.  You are already behind.  You are the most Dispicably greedy & people in history.
WE ARE WATCHING YOU...DONT SCREW OUR VETS OR SENIORS.
@SenateGOP @cspan  threatened to do if Clinton had won. I think we should wait until the next President is elected in 2020.
@SenateGOP @cspan YOU DO NOT HAVE A MANDATE MITCH. The American people may want to leave that SCOTUS seat empty like you all
"We The People" want a wall-not a crooked globalist career politician. So shut up & remember U work for "We The people"
Watch out, Mitch. Item #1 on the agenda is to impose #TermLimits on you. I think 30 yrs in Congress is enough already!
do we need to make history again and recall @SenateMajLdr Term limits or bust!
interesting. You didnt support our president -he handed the republicans a miracle. Dont even try to run him.
You will have 100 days to do what you said you would do with your majority, even through reconciliation. DO IT!!!
You know as well as I do that "the wall" is nonsense. Please don't indulge him.
Just do what the House does.  You'll do great.
STEP DOWN AS SEN. MAJ. LEADER. YOU'VE DONE NOTHING IN 2 YEARS EXCEPT BE A MALE MEMBER!

"Term Limits" of which McConnell is opposed. Push public referendum vote if necessary. Will of the people ~Trumps Mitch
You don't know what moving forward looks like.
Draining the swamp of the likes of you RINO's
Demand senate hearings on 1431 lawsuits filed against Trump for failure to pay his contractors. Or GOP endorses this.
What about Merrick Garland? #DoYourJob
lucky for you. You now have a #TrumpPresident so I'm sure your policies are better advanced since he isn't black.
@SenateGOP  PAMET U GLAVU https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_(mythology) â€¦
Mitch McConnell is the political chameleon - an insider who became a multi-millionaire from Washington DC!
How about you appeal the EC votes because Trump's a madman and Hillary won the popular vote?
you've proved yourself to be selfish, unfeeling SOB. I should listen to you skew facts some more? #Nothappening
over 50 million ppl couldn't care less.
@SenateGOP @cspan do your country a favor, announce your retirement
Oh goodie!!!  We haven't heard from you in months!  Silent Mitch on election NOW wants us to hear him!  #TermLimits1st
Why do you want to deprive millions of previously uninsured people health insurance? #don'trepealobamacare #fixit
Nuclear option.  End the filibuster now.  Democrats were going to do it if they won. No unilateral disarmament.
I want to know where your hatred and vitriol for President Obama come from.  It runs so deep.
@SenateGOP @cspan Will you go after Trump for his Trump U fraud and tax evasion? I doubt it since you have no convictions.
Are you concerned about the role the Russians played in the election or is it fine because you won?
@SenateGOP @cspan years of hate who's America is this.
Are you still alive?
@McConnellPress hey Mitch. We sent a mandate. To drain the swamp. That means you too. First 100 days start the next 4 yrs.
We need YOU to work with DJT on the campaign issues. We will begin the swamp vote soon and Results are everything. 2017
5# of cheese for those in need. Add a can of band aids in place of insurance.Let's have no regulations for any business
Whoop-Dee-Do! What are you going to talk about? More obstruction or more eroding the middle class?
The human Turtle  @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress on a mission to mess with my insurance 
@SenateGOP @cspan so you can concede the election to Hillary?
I hope term limits will be addressed and not through elections. We the people want limits for congress!
you let the party down, so step down, do us a favor
Is this where you announce the formation of the new religious order: Christian State In America? #CSIA #jesustaliban
You frigging grand wizard!
I'm not sorry Sen. Ayotte lost! Her record on immigration issues was pathetic, as is yours and Ryan's!
Old polio man is going to fuck it to us! Malice, cruelty & needless suffering to keep dirty coal alive in Kentucky!

Wise up my man. If you haven't noticed the people spoke loud and clear yesterday. We're fed up with career politicians. #trump
I hope you get caught in a fishing net on your way there
Better be getting the Senate & Congress on same page. Americans are SICK of all the Washington #BC. We will we Watching
if your party wants unity moving forward please consider the goodwill gesture of giving Garland his hearing.
time for you to resign
Why are you going to start doing anything since you haven't done anything for the past 8 years?
Better produce coal jobs for Eastern KY quickly bozo. You have one year.
god luck jackass. Got another recession planned, like the last time you had control of all government?
#EndCitizensUnited #TermLimits   #GOP @StopBigMoney @USTermLimits
Absolutely, Obamacare MUST be replaced, & any & all consideration of anti-gun Judge Garland must end!
Need to Bring All Senators together Hope Joe will Join Ranks of Conservatives and Welcomed
Mitch, either start getting things done or retire!  Lifelong politicians are repulsive.
Moving forward after eight years of obstruction. F**k you and the Repugnican party. I hope Democrats in
congress give Trump the same treatment that Repugnicans gave Obama for eight years!
repeal Obamacare!
@SenateGOP @cspan if there is graft and corruption get it out no matter which side.
congratulations mr. McConnell . 
Sayed .
sorry old boy. TRUMP already laid out his 1st 100 days. Jail Hillary & sue women he sexually harassed.  You're too late
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
oh you want it to move forward now that you got your black man out. You are a racist. You are the reason for Trump!
what sort of deal with #Satan did you make to still be alive?
. @SenateMajLdr Just because you're a Republican; doesn't mean your irreplaceable. You need to retire. People are tired of lies & corruption
Mitch the Destroyer. Nice guy. You don't give a flying F about us. what a joke.
If you let this man destroy OUR democracy it will be on your head
as president elect,,gag. TRUMP,,, I agree with term limits for Senate, ,,what makes you better than a president ?
."He" is a racist, misogynistic 'person' who is ill-informed and morally & ethically bankrupt. He will be a one-term president!
We will provide 2 Republicans the same respect & cooperation that you have provided Obama & Democrats

Bipartisanship is off the table.
Careful.  Half the GOP hate Trump  Hold him to the same standard you held Obama to....or be replaced.

I believe in the reasonable leadership of sound, calm, experienced minds.
well I would like to believe in that with you but I have grave doubts it will happen
Less than 50% of registered voters voted. He got 49% of 49% which is nothing to brag about.
@oreillyfactor  No more feet dragging. Let's start gwtting things done, DAY ONE! Start with Kate's Law
