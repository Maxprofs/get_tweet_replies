Oh Brother Mitch...really...you Reps would confirm Hitler if it kept you in power. CORRUPT.
@SamSanderson123 @SenateMajLdr @SenatorSessions Especially Hitler.
@McConnellPress @SenatorSessions You're right! Because someone who's opposed civil rights is totally the man for the job.
How do you live with yourself?
you have deep devotion to the money in your pocket, not to the American people.
.@SenateMajLdr @SenatorSessions 
he looks like a turtle who just got caught at a kkk meeting
bullshit
get real McConnell we all know the mans history! Mitch McConnell is a dishonest little turtle!!!
As long as the law is for fat old white men with not an ounce of compassion. Talk about shit gibbon.
Enjoy your last term, Mitch. If you survive it. 800K votes & you think your racism/sexism speaks for America?
So, you knew about the Russian hacking & didn't want to tell the people who employ you, as you won, right?
can't trust a turtle on politics
.@SenateMajLdr @SenatorSessions Just a FYI: the KKK's Constitution & corresponding rules & regulations r not the same as the US Constitution
you mean all white people right
Even for women who persist? #shepersisted
buncha N E R D S
THEPEOPLE are watching
"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted" -- Mitch McConnell -- Thanks for the motivation!
Nope, THIS is the funniest thing I've heard all day! LOL
- are you dating him or what? I've never heard so much effusion for a cabinet nom before!
Says the man who confirmed Betsy DeVos to make it easier to eliminate the Department of Education.
I respect Coretta Scott King and her contribution to Civil Rights in the United States.  Do you?
Senator Sessions has a history of prosecutorial misconduct and racist abuse of Alabamans. He is a disgrace.
I could VOMIT just looking at you.
#WaynesWorld NOT! unless old white men
@McConnellPress You are a Senate dinosaur.  It is time for you to retire.  Your actions against Sen.  Warren were disgusting
But not equal RIGHTS for all. Such a polite little racist!
bigoted Racist who will suppress minority vote
Sessions has a long track record of the exact opposite. His law favors rich white men. That's how you want it
liar, God will punish you for that.
As long as you're white.
A Racist good ole boy.who will surprise the vote of minority's
@McConnellPress @SenatorSessions a woman's place won't be determined by you. Retire yourself and your antiquated mindset.
@McConnellPress @SenatorSessions anyone would attempt to silence #CorettaScottKing has no soul and is ANTI-AMERICAN. Shameful
who are white and male.
Hiding in your shell again turtle? He's a gerrymandering bigot
it must gall you to see a powerful woman.  Makes you real insecure don't it.  Women terrify you.  Interesting
.@SenateMajLdr.@SenateGOP keep spreading this malarkey, and we Americans aren't buying it. We've all read @SenatorSessions record of racism.
When is he going to start showing it? When are YOU going to start showing it?
so you will lie for him, got it.
Ah, Jeffy! He voted for wars on the American Xpress plan but said no way to fund vet "entitlement programs"
Of course you mean the laws of the Confederate States of America.  I suspect you two have a secret handshake
I don't fucking believe that! he supports the death penalty for cannabis so fuck him the brown nose loser
not this 64 year old white woman who fought 27 years ago to have her tubes tied and payed for it! YES Woman
especially black people,women,minorities.  You betrayed kentucky and you betrayed your own soul Mitch.
@McConnellPress @SenatorSessions Rule 19 shouldn't apply there is nothing to impugn about Sessions a obvious racist
@McConnellPress @SenatorSessions Message for Black history month. Silence woman senator quoting Coretta King about Sessions
@McConnellPress Bullshit. Only you and your GOP cronies believe this.
How soon can we get rid of you? Asking for myself. And lots of other people who think you are the worst.
you are so full of it!  Sessions has a racist history and the last place he should be is in the AGs chair!
Well, all laws except the VRA and the Civil Rights Act.
@McConnellPress @SenatorSessions if there's a god, u will stroke on that lie
WE WILL SEE. ..history will remember ur actions. 
U NOW FULLY OWN TRUMPISM.
Hahaha. ..
God save America
BULL
#ShePersists #CorettaScottKing
How do you get ur mouth to fit around that lie? #liar #shame #bully #letlizspeak #2018 @GOP
Maybe he can explain how you violated the constitution for political benefit.
And he will help hide all his bosses crimes.  He's committed several all ready.
Bull shit.
blablablabla! Lies! We don't believe you!
will he persist? @SenWarren
#letlizspeak
Sorry it looks like a duck it sounds like a duck it's a duck. Or not qualified to be in the post.
Kentucky please please vote this Janus out of office so we can restore civility and cooperation in gov't.
shame on you for what you did to @elizabethforma !  She speaks for all of us and we're done being quiet!
You believe "War is peace / freedom is slavery [and] ignorance is strength.‚Äù
except if your black, apparently.
Do you believe your own lies?
7xs he voted for the government to stomp on citizens civil rights and privacy. GOP is well ahead in fascism.
Hope you are right because the people are funding @ACLU in case you are wrong
Donated to the ACLU in your names.
good thing you are allowed to speak. Oh right, you're not a woman who has been warned, right?
I guess we will see but unfortunately I don't believe it.
I certainly hope so, @SenateMajLdr. There are a lot of people watching if @SenatorSessions works independently, fairly, & without influence.
equal for all? Coretta Scott King says otherwise and so do I #persist

As long as they're white.

Delete Your Account.
That is, to all white males. Minorities and women are a different story.

there is no evidence of that.
Yah and we believe in the Tooth Fairy too!
@SpeakerRyan Great idea to put racist in this position. GREAT IDEA!
Careful now. Wouldn't want to violate Rule 19.
wondering how Master Mitch the hypocrite shits down his wife when he disagrees. America knows how he does it.
His record does not bear this out.
equal application for the whites not brown, black  and coretta scott king was right
She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted
Yes, especially Jim Crow laws
Mitchell why don't you crawl back into your turtle shell where you've been for the last 8 years. Sad!
That is a lie proved by Sessions' own record. He is not fit to serve. Nor are you. #ShePersisted
@McConnellPress @SenatorSessions Millions of Americans- who YOU work for- Loudly disagree.  Vote McConnell OUT!!! Bye bye
.@SenateMajLdr If that were true, why were you so AFRAID to allow Senator .@SenWarren read relevant information about .@SenatorSessions ?
I agree. Let's get things moving and done. A lot more needs to get done. Seems to me a lot of wasted time.
Bullshit.... let Mrs Kings voice eco around USA! Justice for the people!!
Worst choice ever! A racist pure & simple. 2018 can't come fast enough & the @GOP has Trump anvil around neck
-if he was so qualified, why did you strongarm Warren. No REAL man or American behaves that way. #Sad #Hate
Keep smokin that Bannon crack pipe #NoNazisInWhiteHouse #BanPresidentBannon

you sure didn't show the same "reverence" to your other colleague @SenWarren .  Or your "reverence" only applies to men?
Disagree!
*unless they're black. #racist
He is a racist and the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP are a bunch of #traitors to America.  #COUNTRYBEFOREPARTY
Unless they are black or women or minorities
that's NOT what his record shows.
his a stinking bigot.

.@SenateMajLdr @SenatorSessions except all those actions and words he's spoken that prove this to be false, right? Or are we ignoring those?
nevertheless she persisted. I, American voter, am asking you to do the right choice for all of us!
was denied appt B4 for good reason. U don't have the balls 2 listen 2 @SenWarren b/c your shame is 2 gr8.
Unless you're MLK's widow. Shame!!! Shame!!! Shame!!!
Yeah, Sen Sessions showed his deep reverence for the law by trying to ban blacks from voting.
RACIST BIGOTS!!
McConnell, are your eyes brown?????
his goal is to restrict voting rights and restablish the white majority
to all "white" Americans? Right! Right! 
Virtually everyone not licking Trump's boots disagrees with you.  He is a documented racist.
Telling a woman (Sen.) to shut up? Yeah, tell your wife that turkey neck. Not a smart move.
Thank you @SenWarren . You and Sessions are an embarrassment to the Senate.
who are you kidding says the leader of sexism in the senate
What a load of crap.
Two racist pigs in a pod.
You can tweet about this all you want and we decline your endorsement since you lack integrity.
Sessions was unfit in the 80's and he hasn't gotten any better.  Embarrassment!  #ShePersisted #LetLizSpeak
Senility has set in, Yours. Sessions is a racist, as evidenced in word and deed. U must be blind and dumb.
What about the right to free speech on the senate floor?  Does he believe in that? Do you?
Why do you suck so much? Its embarrassing really that you are  a senator... smh
So, that's why in the best imitation of Diosdado Cabello yet. senator Warren is denied the senate floor
Nasty old white men stick together. I support Senator Warrens.  You're just plain wrong.
Make them work the weekend
then why the problem in letting @SenWarren speak!
That's pure Kentucky bull!
says his fellow racist.
What bubble are you living in to come to this conclusion? Try being fair and objective and then tweet that.
Here's an honest and real question: why are you and @SenatorSessions still so sexist?
He's a good ol' boy with the prejudices and racism once so prevalent in his home state. He can't help it.
- Sessions was NOT confirmed in 1986 for GOOD REASONS: Coretta Scott King's words R valid.

He like you is a racist. I was in AL during the Sessions crap against blacks that went on.
Time will tell.
Unless they are minority and elderly.
Untrue.
Character limit got ya. I believe you meant to add "white people" to the end of your tweet.
you forgot and he's a proud redneck racist!!
is a racist homophobic WRONG person for the job. Vote No.
Every day seems to be a new low in US politics #LetLizSpeak
You're wrong Leader McConnell your racism, bigotry, misogyny are showing Opportunistic hypocrite Shame on you
@Cynthiastruth @SenatorSessions we now .@elizabethforma is lying!
#letlizspeak! Make sure your constituents know that you and the GOP voted to poison their water.
except for people who aren't white
Did Coretta Scott King think so? If only we had a way of knowing, like a letter she wrote to Congress...
You expect us to believe that after his own words say otherwise?
if being a racist homophobe is qualified you have sold ur soul if you ever had one
U rebuke Warren, but barely a word from any Repubs against DJT's outrageous comment on Russia.Shame on U all.
It must be nice to live in alternate reality! Remember no vote on domestic violence against women bill. Shame
You are both #collaborators for supporting Bannon's lily white #Nazi vision for America. #ShameOnRepublicans
Baloney! He is on record for his racism. Stop supporting him, you old prune.
He only White People should get a fair ride not us Black People that you use the N word
"He believes strongly in the equal application of it to all." Except for black people. What did I win?
.@SenateMajLdr @SenatorSessions  If you actually believe that, then maybe you're unqualified for your job too.  #ShePersisted
