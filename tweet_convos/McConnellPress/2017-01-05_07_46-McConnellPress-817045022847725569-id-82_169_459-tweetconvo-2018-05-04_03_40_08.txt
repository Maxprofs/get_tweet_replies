Please pass term limits we would like to see you go
@transition2017 @RepMickMulvaney oh! all of a sudden you want to get busy, what about the past 8yrs.



You Mcconnell, passed every Obama dream budget.  You are a suck up traitor to your party.
Put your country ahead of your politics sir. We pray you do.
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney You spent millions repealing Obamacare and don't have one of your own after 8yrs
Only things you evil minded republicans ever do is destroy, lie, steal, cover up, and manipulate voters! 
$19,953,000.000.000.  It's about time.
I look forward to DC putting America first again and eliminating the terrorist IRS.
Rubber stamp.
Same guy was in bad housing deals with Trump. Yeah, he will fix things- FOR HIMSELF and Un-American repubs
@transition2017 @RepMickMulvaney Mitch past 8 yrs u've done what? Outside the beltway optically ur part of the GOPe problem.
@transition2017 @RepMickMulvaney #MAGA
@transition2017 @RepMickMulvaney Hoping you are a person of your word...watching closely
@transition2017 @RepMickMulvaney By lowering taxes on the rich? Mythical "supply side" economics? Bring on the sanity.
Remove Sec of Treasury as Managing Trustee of Social Security trusts. Conflict of interest
@transition2017 @RepMickMulvaney only if you are rich
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney Like when the last bush had it 
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney and make sure we don't know anything but what you liars say. Destroying ACA will cost bigly!


translated from republicanese that means more tax breaks for the top, less support to seniors and vulnerable
what do you know about sanity?
wait I think I know the answer to this one.... is it... uh... increase military spending and cut food stamps?
I look forward 2 you being jailed for #Treason You cost U.S. billions by obstructing; w/Benghazi + PP BS #UneththicalMcConnell
When did you ever work?
So repealing ACA, adding $1Tril to debt is smart n responsible, LMAO
please to not take us back into the great Republican Recession,almost 2nd Depression we were in 8 years ago!
Repealing AHC is wrong! Inhumane +will cause Trillion dollar deficit increase. Pride goath before a fall!
Tried 2 think of something witty/cutting 2 say. Realized I didn't have enough $ 2 reach you 
You mean the same budget and deficit @POTUS reduced by 1 trillion??!
ironic you use the word sanity!
Your plans are tax breaks for the rich and pressuring and hurting the middle class. GOP kills middle America
Great ... but we like our food, air, water, drug, banks etc. to be protected from corporate profits, ok?
Carefull Mitch you can't blame the deficit on Obama any more, and you know well that it is going to skyrocket
@SpeakerRyan how is repealing ACA going to affect budget? Talk about that!!
bullshit
why were you not more vocal about the Russian hacking? Repeal @SenateMajLdr
He will be blocked at every turn, sir. Not unlike the blocking of President Obama's nominees.
Harry Reid passed the nuclear option to benefit dems.  There will be no blocking. #payback
Getting "fiscal house in order" means funnelling more money to rich people and increasing deficits. The definition of insane.
Translated you mean toss out bank, safety, health, environmental regs and to Hades with people & planet!
The resolution already released by GOP shows a $10T debt in 10 years!!! - YOUR plan!
Tool
So you're planning on working?
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney lol the GOP discussing sanity that's funny you old #dinosaur Time to end #paytoplay
@RepMickMulvaneyIn other words, continue to reduce the budget deficit and keep our water/air/food/etc... safe?
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney Yesterday was a joke. Read @RandPaul  proposal. Actually discuss budget. Be a CONSERVATIVE!
So you're keeping Obamacare then?
Obamacare repeal, which will affect millions adversely, will cost 350 BILLION
why is it you #COWARDLYLIARS always and ONLY speak in what's wrong w/out identifying it, and NEVER w/ a FIX?
Hahaha oh man that's hilarious!! We know that's not true at all but you still have the spirit to lie! I  u
The difference between and you is that is more intelligent.
the news will never treat you nice. So stop trying. Good news is ppl don't care about network news anymore.
so you don't have to keep trying to get good headlines. Just do what needs 2 b done fastest way possible.
if things get better the people will like u if that's your issue. U control money so y worry about elections
Just cut filibuster and treat Dems the way they treated you. That way ppl see what happens..Dick.
interesting. @RandPaul seems to have a different view of the budget the GOP is preparing.
Taking a page from your playbook "Leader" McConnell. #ResistObstructImpeach... from Day 1. #SixMonthPresident
you must also look forward to working with Putin, traitor
And you win the award for falling for extremist left propaganda.  Or are you one of them?
- why didn't u say any of this with Obama?
I BLAME U, McConnell for this country, GOP refusing to work 
Even your fellow Republican senator from KY doesn't believe the shit you're slinging
What will the first order of business be for the new Republican majority? To pass a budget that never balances. 
How will you do that you unbelievable ass?
Please stop blocking hearing's on Russian Hacking.Stand up for America
