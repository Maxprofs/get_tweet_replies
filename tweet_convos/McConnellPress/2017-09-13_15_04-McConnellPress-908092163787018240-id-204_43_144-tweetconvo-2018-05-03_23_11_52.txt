60 minutes may be bad for tom Marino
Leader? that is a riot
Fighting the epidemic? You should be ashamed of yourself. #insomeonespocket

Spending to keep never-Trumper @JeffFlake in office & knowing @kelliwardaz leads him by 26 points, you ready to get on the Trump Train yet?
The Trump train is moving with our without you, Mitch McConnell. Are you behind our MAGA movement? So far the answer has been a big fat NO.
No vacations until entire Great America Agenda is passed maybe u can work on thanksgiving ever like we do. Do t stop until the job is done
Then you should build the wall. Where do you think 90percent of drugs come from
Most addicted are those getting scripts from their doctor. So to answer your question, The drugs are coming from big pharma,  His donor's
So your denying that pot, cocaine and other drugs coming across border? Border agent friend showed photo of where houses full of drugs
Where did I say that drugs are not coming from across the border. I was just pointing out that the drugs  described  come  from big Pharma
#NoAmnesty Spend our taxpayer resources to help OUR citizens, not illegals & their children who invaded our country&stole taxpayer resources
Can he fight $25K/hour gov plan ride. HEARING? Sec Mnuchin requested gov jet 4 European honeymoon - http://abcn.ws/2joPp4O  via @ABC
You and him are part of the reason for the crisis. You are complicit!  Marino’s bill and you helped pass it. I don’t know how you sleep
Pathetic! This is what's wrong with this country!
Build the wall to stop Opium!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The only thing that means is that there will be more dead Kentuckians #OpioidEpidemic #IncompetentPoliticians
This afternoon I met with Tom Marino, @POTUS' @ONDCP nominee who’s focused on fighting the #opioidepidemic in #Kentucky & across America 
1 MILLION TRUMP VOTERS IN DC
WE VOTED 4 TRUMP & GOP HOUSE & SENATE 2 DELIVER THE FORGOTTEN MAN AGENDA NOT DACA 
https://www.motherofallrallies.com/ 
Strange, considering the law you signed into action shown on @60Minutes tonight. Pathetic.
Who is this joker!
Why are you taking 11 days off, with so much to work on?  Lead or get out of the way.
Did you stay at a Trump luxury resort by any chance? Seems like there is compromat all over the RNC, god you guys are a mess
Are you delusional!!!!!!!!! @60Minutes
This is the same guy who allowed drug company to fuel the opioid epidemic
Sure. As long as Big Pharma gets paid it doesn't matter who gets hurt does it Mitch? We know how you really feel.

It's time for you @SenateMajLdr to REPEAL/REPLACE Ocare! We do NOT want socialism care either! State run healthcare! Stop being a traitor!
Did you meet with your lawyers? You know, about your involvement with Russia. Just a thought.
I know there is a heroin problem and that some people get addicted to opioids. But what about the people with chronic pain that you vilify?
Making life as difficult as possible for sick people is an @GOP platform plank.
The opioid crisis exists thanks to Marino and the Republican Party. You should all be ashamed for filling your pockets while Americans die.
Mitch,
The GOP Hasty substitute for ACA HURTS AMERICANS. Fewer benefits, hurtful $$$ for
Folks w/ preexisting conditions! Stop this NOW
Another of your nothing burger photo ops?  I will be so happy to see you out of office
So sad for both of you.
You can help fight the #opiodepidemic by stabilizing insurance markets and keeping addiction treatment as an essential benefit.
SCREW YOU MITCH. WE WILL DUMP YOU IN 2020 FOR SURE.

How about repeal and replace and building the wall. The wall would go a long way in reducing opioids. 
Great. How did you find the time with all the excessive expectations of @realDonaldTrump ? Repeal and replace, tax reform and build the wall
Look, I know there's a real problem, but STOP focusing on this problem as much and GET TO THE PRESIDENTS AGENDA! Good grief, really?
Is he planning Grand Wizard Sessions' #failed Durg War back?
Approval rating of 18% in his own state of Kentucky? You're fired Sir. Stop blaming our President for your apathy. Accomplished anything?
Please get Obamacare repealed liked you promised.
You are breaking this country.  Judges must be able to be blocked.
Besides Garland, McConnell's GOP Senate blocked over 61 Obama judicial nominees with blue slips leading to a 4600 federal court case backlog

This is America under your lead. https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=vJCmklbWUOQ …
Do your damn job!
No obamacare repeal......FAIL. Move the @POTUS agenda forward. Tax reform should be done now
But if we only knew what created this horrible epidemic, say the stockholders in the Pharma industry.
Come on Mitch America first we pay your way
Your comments about the PRESIDENT WE, THE PEOPLE ELECTED were INDEFENSIBLE, IGNORANT & BORDERING ON SEDITIOUS. Resign and show some dignity.
You have BETRAYED the American People AND our President. WHY AREN'T YOU PASSING WHAT YOU PROMISED THE PEOPLE YOU WOULD? PAY OFFS? WHAT?? WHY
After all that's pretty much your core supporters. You don't want to wake them from their stupor, they'll realize what a joke you are.
BullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshit UGH
REPEAL AND REPLACE RINO mcconnell @SenateMajLdr time for a change!
Whoremaster McConnell:  Your state leads the nation.  You are a failure.  Your party is a disgrace.  Resign.
So what's he waiting for? A cape?
Like you care about your constituents, who stupidly elected you, back in Kentucky. You are so fake.
Your improvisational potus has done it again. You all should have backed someone who isn't so improv. 
That wants taxes done healthcare what is wrong with you if you had a regular job you would be FIRED SO LAZY NOW WE HAVE  REAL PRES WORK LAZY
Retire now.  51 votes is fine as you have to get house senate & past WH veto

Sen should not need 60. Counterproductive
You need to get to work PRES TRUMP is n office now get to work he does not waste time quit going on vacation your working for a real man 1\2
If u don't get with the program, u may want to try some drugs because u will be out of a job! GET IT DONE & stop the 60 rule!!!
Screw the opioid "epidemic" & look at the suicide rate. Up 83% for middle age white women & 43% for white men. We are without HOPE!!!
@FoxNews @TheDemocrats @NancyPelosi @CNN Start with the biggest drug dealers big pharmaceutical companies

.@SenateMajLdr must be having a total shit as Trump snubs him and the #Failing @gop
Get to work! Stop dragging your feet!  You were elected to do a job. GET IT DONE!!!!

He doesn't use @POTUS, please use @realDonaldTrump to ensure all tweets remain and cannot be deleted. Common sense Senator McConnell
If the McGOP was to vanish off the face of the earth, the opioid epidemic would leave on it's own.
Total Bullshit!
You need to be retired by the people of #Kentucky

WHY ARE YOU LETTING MUELLER GET AWAY WITH THIS?

WHY HASN'T COMEY, LYNCH, HILLARY BEEN ARRESTED YET?

#LockThemUp

WE DEMAND JUSTICE!
That's really great..my afternoon dealt with a failed refrigerator...I think I had a tougher day Mitch.
Owned...
Don't you run a Opioid disbursement center in your basement. Keep it next to the lettuce
Too bad #GOP will cut Medicaid funding for all States in order to enrich 1% 
#godspeed
Never. Makes fabulous money for simply lying.
Still no comments from GOP on passing of Edie Windsor?
all you have to do is lock up the drug abusers and crime will go down
You need to do your job and pass tax reform
When will POTUS get all his appointees? Come on, this is a joke
Great choice
Now if we can keep that crap off Chinese ships coming to America....right McConnell?
Sure hope he's not an opioid denier...that would suck.
This morning I met In the DunkinD bathroom with a homeless man and we made out
How's it feel to sell your soul to the #TrumpRussia cover up?
Please support Pres Trump. Repeal Obamacare. Build the wall! Revise the Tax Code! Thank you!
Work!  What do y'all do pass PRESIDENT TRUMPS BILLS THAT IS WHY HE WAS ELECTED!  ARE YOU BEING PAID OFF!  SO SAD GET leader off your name!
You are a putz
All well & good, but if you don't pass a bill to #defundPlannedParenthood you will be effectively useless. You have 17 days. @SenateGOP
Who cares what u do. It amounts to NOTHING. #51 MAJORITY
Yet you will knock their feet out from under them if you continue to undermine ACA.
Marino is a horrible congressman. Glad he will be gone!
Build the wall
Secure the southern border
Why don't you quit trying to figure out how to throw people in jail and figure out a way to make them productive members of society.
You'll probably stab him in the back on this too. I need opioids to ease my pain from listening to @GOP RINOs like you and @SpeakerRyan .
focus on opioids? BUILD THE DAMNED WALL & NO DEAL on DACA!
When is that gonna happen?? In a decade?? TAX REFORM NOW!!
Build a WALL!
...NOW YOU BLOCK DEMS TO GET YOU WAY. YOU ARE A "OLD" ROTTEN FOOL
Good for you Turtle man. More people die each year from alcohol related deaths by a long shot. GOP war on drugs is another waste of tax $

WHAT YOU DID IS BLOCK ANYTHING IN YOUR WAY, TO GET WHAT YOU WANT. YOU SAID "I WILL NOT GRANT OBAMA ANYTHING HE PROPOSES" BLOCKED &,BLOCKED


Let's see there is one big problem you have.... the truth.... stop protecting trump
If only there were a guaranteed right to healthcare that would keep people from self-medicating pain and treat addiction.
We would like the wall thanks
Who are you leaving for Trump or Obama probably Obama
GET TRUMPS JUDGES THRU NOW!!°!
You have time for him, yet you refuse to stress the debt, tax reform, entitlement  junkies, and Ojihadcare. Sounds like soros is funding you
How about establishing a nationwide opioid registry to keep track of scripts and abusive purchases...like what is done with pseudoephedrine?
Has @realDonaldTrump declared it a crisis yet?
"Wars" to solve human problems and secretive terrorists is ridiculous and very expensive. But that's why you love them.
Keep fighting the drug war. Keep fighting the ridiculous "War on Terror." You have already lost.
In the 70's their were qualudes, preludes and Halcon. All very addictive. These drugs were taken off market. This is all abt big Pharmacy $!
Stop posing for photo ops. It's pathetic. All . No action. #neutered Everybody hates you. Retire. Resign.
Nobody gives a shit what you think about anything. You'll be gone soon.
Huhhh?
Another feeder at the government trough!
Geez just made that WISH and BAAAAM!
Every 3 weeks we lose the same amt of people from opioid addition that America lost on 9.11...think abt that! Take them off the market.
Slow down Mitch dont wont you to overdue it
The federal government shouldn't help Kentucky
I don't want my taxes going towards drug abusers in your state
Hi penis
Legalize marijuana. It will help your state and your country.
The information you're withholding is the bribes you receive from big pharma. No public thank you to them, I suppose.
You need to get on the TRUMP train and get something accomplished. Tired of your delays and patting yourself on the back for it
We need tax reform now to get our businesses growing again. We need health care we can afford and you forgot to pass
Just grow a pair and go nuclear so we can GET SHIT DONE! Or just go away.#DrainTheSwamp
@McConnellPress no no no to Graham-Cassidy

HEY GENIUS YOU CAN'T FIGHT HEROIN EPIDEMIC WITHOUT CLOSING THE GOD DAMN BORDER.  #BUILDTHEWALL
Heard you are stepping up to the plate to appoint quality judges! Thank you!
Why don't you make sure Americans have healthcare, so they can get needed treatment.
Isn't this a States issue? Why is the Federal govt involved at all? Protect the border & leave rest 2 States.
@TenthAmendment 
@TPPatriots
More importantly GET RID of #Obamacare people  dying waiting for the promise #fullrepeal. Expanded Medicaid direct tie to Opioit addiction
Soylent Green to be made out of Kentuckians. #ThanksMitch
Move to Russia Mitch. #RussiaGate #ImpeachTrump
I'll bet you 2 know a lot about opioids given the gold lace trim on the ceiling and photo op acting like anything gonna change! Save it MM


Maybe if you took some opioids you would have some energy to do some actual work

Isn't @SenateMajLdr dead?
Do you think it angers
#GreatLeaderTrump that you
call yourself Leader too?
Isn't @realDonaldTrump our
only Leader?

 #DumpTrump 2 #MAGA




Majority Ldr these ppl r n pain thru no fault of their own we must help them
Amen!!


So you don't believe in the constitution do you? Changing senate rules is a desperate move to please your Lord and master Trump.#VoteThemOut
Is Donald Trump biggest opposition!
If the GOP opposed trump he would already out. They are all making ALOT of money. Not going to bite the hand that feeds them.
I know exactly how to stop that problem but I won't say it openly
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayerNow

Hate to be THAT #TedCruz Staff member now  

Focused?? You announced it over a month ago & still have done nothing.
