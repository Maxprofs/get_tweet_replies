It will be like it was before the ACA: people w/o coverage will go to the ER at the last minute for help. Who pay$ bill?
Hospitals go bankrupt or get bailed out by ... taxpayers/ government. Which is more $$$ in the long run. #Trumpcare #MAGA
who cares about people dying...they are poor and old and minorities anyway...right you SOB?
kill millions but the deficit will be down
You omit why premiums are lower. We would go back to ins companies covering a lot less. Reduces taxes on wealthy #GOPfail
. Meowwww
If you're writing fiction, I suggest you start with children's books.  At least they can't vote yet. #AHCA = tax cut for rich.
I just hate people who critics but don't suggest better ways
Any way u #spin this, it's a duck
Single PAYER MEDICARE for all!
try to lower cost of elderly. 2% of rich (over 1,000,000.00 a yr.) income to elderly medical.
and reduce that pesky insurance coverage. Get ready for emergency room visits as the primary
#TrumpDontCare
Can you redact the lies first. Probably be easier to read that way.
Is the House and Senate once again intending to ignore constituents, @SenateMajLdr? Will ya'll never learn?
#BitchMcConnell YOUR premiums won't change. Everyone else's will. God, you're all such liars. How do you look @ yourself?
hahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahhahahahahahah ha
So do you really buy into your own BS, or are those potential tax cuts at the cost of America's health too good to pass up?
Reduce taxes? Yeah, YUGELY for the 400 wealthiest families. Strips coverage from the poor & elderly.  #trumpcareSUCKS
a 64yo @ 26.5k annually pays $1700 in premiums per annum vs. #trumpcare $14.6k. You don't give a shit about anyone but the 1%
good numbers...but do u have suggestions to make it better
Mitch doesn't care about shitz. Blocked announcement of Russia interference. Priorities are skewed. A lying rat.
This is simply untrue. #AreYouLyingOrJustDumb
@McConnellPress lower premiums for the top income brackets.  Way to help Americans mitch
But how many people are going to lose the coverage they have now?
what are you getting out of this deal? #greed
Sorry, I don't read #fakenews.  I'll read the #CBO report instead @SenateMajLdr
it fails if the oldest & poorest pay the most..u need a better plan on that point.
we want the exact same coverage you 535 Congressmen have you traitor. Trump will be exposed by the Russians. Let's call them WikiLeaks 4 now
Putin puppet? You betcha You're gonna look so cute in your prison jumpsuit. Like somone dressed up a pet turtle like a pumpkin
You can "statement" all U want, but it's not true.  STOP perpetrating the lies & ADMIT U LIKE OBAMACARE & power ovr healthcare
sorry Senator, the real statement is your bill "sucks like the Washington swamp." #followthefacts #resist #investigaterussia
it will fail minimum wage workers everywhere. It will fail. You have failed.
Lowers premiums in 2026 older people will be priced out of the market, immediately raises them by 15-20% in 2018. Garbage.
And remove choice for women, and take people off healthcare. This is about health, not money. HSA no good if you don't have $.
TRUMPCARE
.@SenateMajLdr Lower premiums because those age 51+ can't afford and will lose insurance. Risk pool will be younger and less sick.
You left out the part about how many MILLIONS of people will lose their healthcare.
NOPE. Lies.
It won't cut taxes as you are giving more uneeded tax breaks to rich stiffing middle class & poor!
TRUMP-CARE IS A SCAM, JUST LIKE THE SO-CALLED PRESIDENT! The budget numbers are in! MILLIONS of Americans will lose their CARE
And leaves millions uninsured & others cost goes up more thanACA!
liars and thieves
Finally Tax Cuts for the RICH now avail in #TrickleDownTrumpCare! Evrythng FAILED is NEW again! #GOPLies #UnamericanRepublican
#alternatefacts #CBO
Attending a rally with Trump this weekend? Good. Keep aligning yourself with his admin. We'll be rid of you all the sooner.
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY SOMETHING FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT,EVEN IF IT IS $10 OR $20. AT LEAST SOME MONEY IS BEING RE-TURNED !
It looks like the republicans are willing to lose their majority in 2018 over Ryancare! Shame on all of you! We won't forget.
You couldn't pay me to read this crap, Droopy Dog. Curious, how did you spend the MILLIONS healthcare execs gave you?
Just because you state it doesn't make it true.
Not for sick & older people. Your BS is not needed. You haven't cared about Americans in years if you ever did
you better not fk me over!! I'm 64 and have worked since I was 16..I have paid my dues old man!!!
well if Mitch says it, it must be true. .. NOT!!!!!!!!!
that'll be a hard sell to people who actually read and understand you're just paying off CEO's and not actually improving he.
Your statement cherry picks and put together amounts to lies.
Aren't u leaving some things out? 24 million new uninsured $600 Billion tax cut 4 ur rich owners Soaring rates 4 older workers
Bourbon has effected your brain / lowered your IQ 24 million lose coverage to pay for Tax Cuts to Delusional 1's rich buddies
Your plan covers abortions!? Cuz, like you said, it will "give Americans more control over their own health choices."
nope. You're lying again. Just stop it. http://on.forbes.com/60188kaz6 
It lowers premiums all right, by kicking older, sicker ppl out of coverage they can afford. #ACHA "choices" are unaffordable.
your AHCA is a death certificate. Terrible. You and Ryan are monsters. Hope you enjoy your last term!!
Where are the fiscally responsible republicans? $42 million month for melania to live in NY & Trump golf weekends=$540million
Competition won't lower premiums because they r not derived by throwing a dart on the wall. Medical costs r out of control.
Even your "followers" and "likes" are a lie. Why would we read your statement?
BS - it takes away healthcare from 24 million people and gives a big tax break to you rich people. #LIAR
plans that cover nothing. More $'s and tax breaks for insurance companies.Your own constituents left out. Monster
without a takeaway, your plan like Obamanationcare sucks. The uninsured add tremendous costs to premium development. Seriously
by kicking people off healthcare.  You are Satan in the flesh.
Bunch of monkeys.
lies, lies & more lies. There's a special place in hell 4 U & Lyin Ryan. #morallybankrupt
Hole
we shall see but I think the only people w. Coverage will be the senate, congratulations!
Just BS. It will lower premiums by increasing co pays and deductibles. Work with dems to improve ACA.
read this - you're not getting re-elected @swingleft @IndivisibleTeam
you can write, talk, says whatever you want and I won't believe you!
Your own CBO pick disagrees. Will Trump fir him too?
@joesonka you forgot #alternativefacts #lies

Outrageous. REpeal & Replace congressional healthcare.Put them on ACHA and see what GOP does then. This is a national disgrace
Corck of crap! THis bill is a disgrace.Only protects the rich!This is no replacement plan will cost Am more $.
giving more control over health options- I'm sorry, how is trying to control women's bodies giving them more control?
wait let me put my bullshit boots on first
Will it cover the operation to fix your jowls? Oh, that's right. You get premium health care. We don't. #trumpClownShow
#PREMIUM P-Pricing R-Regarding E-Efficient M-Measures I-Insured U-Usually M-Maximize
you forgot "will drive the poor and uninsured back to the ER for care, people will die with up to 24 million uninsured"
just give it up; the coal miners you represent are against you...your time in govt is limited
U could have been a real leader, one for the people instead of one for the lobbyists! Disgusting how U ignore the will of ppl.
We are sick of YOU #RINOs padding your pockets with Lobbyist money. Deals for your buddies and screw the rest of us!
You should have retired when you had the chance, now you are going to be ousted publicly. Get your popcorn ready!
LIAR. We want YOU gone! Time for a new majority leader. We want Ted Cruz as Majority Leader! You should have retired McConnell
awesome awesome been trying to find a spot for Cruz!!
Ted would be terrific. Can you imagine? It would be great. Trump and Ted would make a great team. #MAGA
14M people losing coverage. Please do better.
Liar liar liar....... you deserve THE HELL you get in future
#GOP declares war on poor:
+ 24 million lose coverage
+ Tax reductions for rich
+ Quality sacrificed for cost
So many negative replies. Are you getting the picture yet? The American people don't believe your lies!!!
if trust #CBO before GOP any day!
24 million PEOPLE (some of them your voters) with no insurance.  Something you can really be proud of.
AHCA is a bigger disaster than ACA, FIX ACA
Ass
LIAR! My God Man - do you have any self respect? You spent 8 years obstructing a President for no valid reasons!
I am going to be paying 15-20% higher premiums for ten years then I get a 10% premium decrease.  You get $800 billion tax cut
millions lose insurance. Good plan.  #GOPCon
cutting over a trillion $'s to cover the needy and giving almost $800 billion back to the rich, no wonder you are smiling
u Trump & others allowed greed 2 blind u so as not 2 c lives u will destroy with more lies of help & hope WE WILL NOT 4GET
Ur AHCA will hurt coal miners & others u & trump promise 2 bring back coal jobs 4 using USA STEEL but just bought Russia steel
Include subsidies to purchase insurance, which would maintain sufficient demand for ins by people with low health care expens.
CBO and JCT estimate that, in 2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured under the legislation than under current law.
As long as I pay for your wife and you to have the best health careAs long as I pay 3 million aweek for Trump family vacations
As a sebior you made sure I will neverhave healthcare again.But as long as the rich get a big tax break and kick back to you
The evil which is conservatism is now on full display. Love money above all else!
Lunacy is Lunacy no matter how you package it. These is about tax credits for the rich.
Your days in office r numbered.U r in the same league of liars as Kellyanne,trump, &spicer.may God forgive u,we won't.
.@SenateMajLdr Nice plan in 3 points. This not what you have put on the table. Trumpcare AKA AHCA does not fulfill these 3 points. Sad!
You're a liar and a killer, and the American people are paying for YOUR f$&king health care. #REPUBLICANDEATHPANEL #SAVEACA
You disgust me. You will have to answer to God about what you are doing to Americans. He'll is where you will be.
"Access" to care is always the #GOP heartless approach. How about EVERYONE covered #SinglePayer the only way forward!
yeah I'll believe you! NOT
Lies Lies Lies
and 24 million lose health insurance. Tell the whole story
and leave 24 million uninsured. You had 6 years and this is your best? Resign.
that's utter crap & you know it. In the meantime, a reminder to the majority of your duplicity
If 24 million people lose their insurance coverage, I suppose that is a premium reduction. #GOPgenocide
If you murder people, it's an anti aging treatment?  #GOPgenocide
@McConnellPress can't trust you with a history like this
The only thing that plan does is benefit insurance cos & give take breaks to the rich.  Congress should lose all their hc bens
Steal from the poor and middle class. Nothing new from the Republicans. Disgraceful senator.
Your #Trumpcare is a disgrace. What do you disrespect the poor and elderly of this country?
The poor and elderly are just lazy and don't deserve to live... I think?
and not cover 24 million Americans
please DO NOT TAKE $ FROM MEDICARE TRUST TO GIVE TAX BREAK TO THE RICH.
lowering by 10% is nothing. Mine is $700/mo. Needs to be <$400/mo.
@McConnellmPress can't wait to have you replaced.
well what else can you expect from #republicans who couldn't stomach a #black man being #potus they were so bz hating no time
puppet, you lie
Could you highlight the #alternativefacts you included, and how you justify stripping healthcare from 20+ million Americans?
It will raise premiums for the elderly ten fold!!!   Have you no shame?
And kills tens of thousands of Americans because of your greed. #Disgraceful
No, it will not. The CBO says the opposite, & I 4 1 believe them & not U. How can U perpetrate such a disaster on the People?
Winter is coming! #2018 #Wewillremember
if 'ENTITLEMENTS' are not reformed, Medicaid will not exist along with the Federal Government also.
in its present form, the 'ACA' will self destruct.  A new plan is needed.  Good luck with the new plan.
NO  #FullRepeal Ocare    No govt replacement
hahaha thats quite a joke
Nyet, just nyet.
by leaving millions uninsured and uninsurable?
AHCA? Oh. you mean Trumpcare. #trumpnotcare
Really? @GOP is proud to cut healthcare of 24million Americans? You have no shame! Repeal your healthcare! @Impeach_D_Trump
Again with the money over people, party over people. Where's your conscience? Why do you hate America and her people so much?
no need to hate when ppl are too dumb watching football & drinking what do u expect? Don't vote don't care play ball
Everyone let this sink in: @SenateMajLdr is BOASTING about stripping poor, sick, & elderly of insurance so premiums of a select few might ↓
Meanwhile, premiums are just 1 of MANY out-of-pocket expenses. Copays & co-insurance costs will increase for the disadvantaged
you & @SpeakerRyan are persistent in lying to Americans about your bullshit healthcare plan. #hypocrisy is free flowing in DC
you are so deceptive....it does so by depriving people of insurance.  Just stop already.
liar
