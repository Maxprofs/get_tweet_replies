MITCH MCCONNELL & PAUL RYAN FUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD & OBAMACARE NO WALL FUNDING 2018 #GOP #Conservative #MAGA #Trump http://sck.pm/Xpf  
Are you asking them to start actually paying their employees, instead of having them beg for tips?


How in the holy F'ing hell DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT YOU'RE A GAWD AWFUL LEADER, and not step down.... along with @SenJohnMcCain @JustTerrible
Great - get back to Washington and support the presidents agenda and quit bickering - Repubs need to represent the people who voted for them
Good job on finding some women to pose for the photo. Now try locating a few black folks, Mitch.
Was KFC there?
Mich is a cull nothing more he lies and is deceitful and doesn't intend to keep any promise made.. who hangs out with people like this..
OH YES THEY DID! THEY ACTED LIKE THEY DIDNT BECAUSE OF BILLIONS ACCEPTED BY TOP RUSSIAN OLIGARCH TO PUTIN!
Ex-CIA Dir. Brennan complained that McConnell, Cornyn didn't "appreciate the gravity" of Russian interference. https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonleopold/some-in-congress-dont-get-the-gravity-of-russian-election …
Bet U R dreading return to DC.
@SenateMajLdr

Any questions?
What up MITCHY?
Also your Highness, how about dropping the shameful immoral tax on social security, YOU ARE ALL TALK ZERO ACTION
Good Morning Princess, Please do something substantial this week, Health care sell across state lines, tax CUTS, NOW
8 years of obstruction, 8 years of non governance, 8 years of incubating white supremacy, The GOP is the Party of the Alt-Right Trump
Sen, do not forget about healthcare.  Do it while the traitor to the party is out. Dem Sen at trial. It's the right time. Do it.
Why don't you support our president slimeball?
Term Limits.

Mitch say goodbye to labbist
Perfect theme round and round and u get nothing done
Please Sir change the Senate majority vote to 51!!!!!!
Try to look important but it doesn't mean you are. You had tools to get that last "Skinny Repeal" vote but you refused to use it. FRAUD!!!
Bet they are all chain restaurants, no Mom and Pops?

Staying out of those town halls McTurtle head. Don't worry we got your number.
McCONNELL SHOULD GET BACK TO DC & DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. NOT PARADE AROUND WITH A BUNCH OF PRIMA DONNAs in the "Do nothing Senate"...

MCConnell is a coward sell out who only has his own special interests that come first! There is no debating this fact!
Hopefully you will finally support immigration reform. Without immigrants, there is no hospitality industry. #ImmigrationReform
So who is going to benefit from tax reform McConnell u & the 1% ...Kentuckians r short changed by their Senator everyday
Was turtle soup served ?
maybe you could spend time fixing heath care you failed to get through, rather then seeking more handouts from business

Stop pretending like you are busy


McConnell is disgusting as shown by his effort to rip away healthcare from millions of Americans. VOTE THIS FILTH OUT OF OFFICE!

DUTCH MITCH!!!!!! TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where is the Colonel?


His crying voice echoes in our ears till this day. 
Our hearts were with him every single moment until he got to the hospital. 
Putin is ok with Nazis. Is GOP ok with Gorka? #FireGorka #GOPsilent
Christoph Hörstel, the leader of the German anti-Semitic party "Deutsche Mitte", visited Russia-annexed Crimea and met with Putin. 

.@HouseGOP - With Trump's record on #Nazis, answer this for your constituents: Would you vote for him at all, in any election, today?

Trump Adviser Gorka wearing nazi ally uniform-the nazi group says he swore lifetime oath-so a nazi's LITERALLY in the WH!

#RestInPower Heather Heyer, who gave her life today in defense of liberty and justice for all. We will not forget you. #Charlottesville 

"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..." 
The @GOP helped this man come to power.  McConnel kept the Russia hack quiet. Refuses to censure the president.  All complicit in this evil.
Actions speak louder than words.  And you show your quality by how you speak.
Why isn't your name on this letter?! Do you support white supremacists?!??

Democratic Senators are asking DHS why the Trump administration repeatedly de-emphasizes domestic terror attacks. 
Ditch Mitch!
Seeing how many more ways you can serve up bullshit, @SenateMajLdr ?
sir how did you respond when 45 treated your wife as a game show display model before he went off on his latest rant.
Mitch McConnell: Sad Legacy of Obstruction, Corruption and Collusion. ,,,,, "Nevertheless she "PERSISTED" Sad, Sad little man
The GOP have shown they care more about loyalty to a weak and mentally unstable individual than their own principles, or even the law.
The only industry we have in Paducah is restaurants. How about loosening regulations so that KY can bring more jobs in?
