@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr  actually I think republicans have done an astounding job with dysfunction!
You get nothing done.
@SenateMajLdr says the guy blocking Scotus vote. You are a poster child for term limits
@SenateMajLdr Disfunction, like not confirming a Supreme Court justice? DO YOUR JOB Senator Yertle.
@SenateMajLdr  Excuse me??  Blocking and opposition for any progress, that's ultimate dysfunction.
@SenateMajLdr They same applies to you and the GOP. At least the Dems did something. What have you done? Tax reform? No. Immigration? No
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Pot calling kettle black, but the kettle is simply on the right side of the stove. The GOP trashed the USA.
@SenateMajLdr says the political party with Trump as it's front runner... How is the effort to stop him going?  #hypocrite
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Republican viewpoint- hysterically funny!            
Say, @SenateMajLdr - that's insulting not constructive.  in times past I have voted for Republicans - but not now, not with this approach
@SenateMajLdr Now, stop whining, and get to the #SCOTUSNominee Mitch.
@SenateMajLdr "My soul purpose is to make him a 1 term Pres." You failed! Your leadership has been a total failure.
@CosmicWrangler @tcp25 @SenateMajLdr you failed at that, failed KY, I'm for wind and solar power, you promised miners help and didnt
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress you republicans have been dysfunctional for almost 8 LONG YEARS...MEET DONALD TRUMP!
@SenateMajLdr with you as leader everything is dysfunctional
@SenateMajLdr Really? You're one to talk. The republican governor of Illinois is just as ineffective as the rest of you republicans.
@SenateMajLdr  "No, you are"  "No YOU are!" - that game worked in pre-school, Mitchie. But we're adults here.  Well, SOME of us are at least
@SenateMajLdr Please Mr McConnell, don't be so mean! You're starting to sound Trumpish
@SenateMajLdr WHEN YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF OBAMA'S ASS... THEN SOMETHING WILL GET DONE!!!
@SenateMajLdr I really think the last thing you want to do is bring your party's record into the spot light here, even by comparison.
@McConnellPress #WalkYouTalk dems were voted in by AMERICANS
@SenateMajLdr you need to take lessons from Harry. Stop acting civil to them. They won't return favor. We have been chewed up and spit out.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress YOU ARE DYSFUNCTION!
@SenateMajLdr If your Dem colleagues jumped off a bridge, would you?  #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr why is the single biggest roadblock to bipartisan politics complaining about gridlock in partisan politics
@SenateMajLdr  You are the greatest obstructionist of all time & you did it for $$$
@SenateMajLdr how the hell did YOU get on my Twitter feed?
#go away
@SenateMajLdr - so are YOU!!
@SenateMajLdr forgot to mention his filibusters while in the minority. Stop trying sound innocent you disgrace #VoteThemOut #Election2016
@SenateMajLdr sounds like the pot calling the kettle black!
@SenateMajLdr Your hypocritical arrogance is astounding! #DoYourJob hold #SCOTUS hearings! #WeNeedNine
@SenateMajLdr And if you don't lock up the government completely, you start handing gobs of cash out to corporations, and wealthy donors.
@SenateMajLdr Every time your party ends up in the majority there is some giant catasro-fuck where the government grinds to a halt.
@SenateMajLdr Put simply sir you are FULL OF SHIT and nothing but a hack who needs to #DoYourJob or better yet resign and go away
@SenateMajLdr Yet you reign supreme
@SenateMajLdr I don't see the Dems being told to #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr But are leaps and bounds behind the dysfunction that is currentlyaffecting the GOP. You are imploding to a record-making level
@SenateMajLdr  you mean when the @GOP caused mayhem and did everything they could to block the democrats and shut down the government?
@SenateMajLdr Dysfunction? Really?  Do your job!
@SenateMajLdr The GOP strategy of continuous surrender to POTUS/Dems to increase election chances will cost them the WH, Senate, & SCOTUS.
@SenateMajLdr .LIAR!! & you #GOPLosers are have gone over & beyond anything the #Dems could have dreamed up! #DoNothings
@SenateMajLdr did they not have hearings on EVERY SCOTUS appointment? Yes they did! #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr 

Pot, meet kettle. 

Two appeals court confirmations this term. Ten vacancies. 

Unprecedented.
@SenateMajLdr um, pot calling kettle black much?
@SenateMajLdr : what a great statement from someone who is a shinning example of why we need term limits in Congress.
@SenateMajLdr what an amazing, willfully ignorant statement, senator
@SenateMajLdr let's get behind president @realDonaldTrump and do this.
@SenateMajLdr wtf ??? Wait ... Yes u do know abt dysfunction and cowardly inaction.
To bad you didnâ€™t do the same to them when they were in power instead of caving all the time @SenateMajLdr
"Our Dem colleagues were great at dysfunction when they were in the the Majority & they're pretty good at it when they're in the minority."
@SenateMajLdr I can go on for days Mitch, I think you get my point. KY miners not behind u anymore. You lied to get elected and left them
@SenateMajLdr @twright55 not so bad yourselves, buddy. You guys are hovering just north of 3% passed legislation. Stones and glass houses
@SenateMajLdr now Ryan is the new puppet. Trying to keep the GOP relevant. Not working Mitch
@SenateMajLdr GOP is all but done, and we will be so much better with you guys.  Boehner knew he better be out while the getting was good
@SenateMajLdr and how about all the OBSTRUCTING you do?  You need pink slip. Union County KY here Mitch. KY not happy with you!!
@SenateMajLdr not to mention shutting government down, to prove point, and lost millions in revenue because of
@SenateMajLdr oh give me a break, REALLY? Really gonna go there? Talk about dysfunction, GOP nothing but that.
@SenateMajLdr Right.  Let's talk about Dennis Hastert.  Who else amongst all you smilers and dialers?  Time to clean House (and Senate).
@SenateMajLdr their dysfunction was trying to work with Republicans. Now that we got rid of the Blue Dogs we should be good
@SenateMajLdr OMG cannot follow you any longer, your comments are so pathetic and embarrassing to both the @GOP and all Kentuckians,you win
@SenateMajLdr And what great accomplishments can you refer to since you've been majority leader???
@0NickyFlash0 @tcp25 @SenateMajLdr there r none
@SenateMajLdr interesting...sure can't tell you have the majority...you and @SpeakerRyan have done nothing to stop obama and the democrats.
@SenateMajLdr Pot. Kettle. Black.
