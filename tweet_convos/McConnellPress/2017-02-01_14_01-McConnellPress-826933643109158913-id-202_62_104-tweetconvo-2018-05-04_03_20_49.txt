More lies from the GOP, when is Garland's hearing scheduled Mitch?
Name another SCoTUS in the past 80 years that was confirmed during a presidential election year.
Regan 1988. Google it.
good try. Not comparable though. The vacancy was open in 87, he was prez thru 89
Kennedy appointed Nov 11, 1987. Less than a calendar year before election.
#fakenews
sorry bud this isn't #alternaivefacts land
Scalia died unexpectedly 9 months before vote. Hardlycomparable #Readdetails

@McConnellPress @PostOpinions Stinking F-ing hypocrite! Court was fine W/ 8 justices for a full year, now a rush. U disgust!
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions It's not a question of his qualifications. It's how you destroyed the process. #hypocrite
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions  Senator McConnell, we belive we will wait a a good 9 goddamned months before voting on SCOTUS
How many judgeships did MM block last term?
McConnell is a spineless worthless politician who pouts and cries and is only interested in himself.
@PostOpinion. I hope Dems fights McConnell on everything!!He says this but refused to even meet w/Garland for a year!
Vote no!
not all last year
Shameful. You have no honor, no respect for America and its founding fathers. Shut up.
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions McConnell needs to explain how this is any different than what he did by blocking Obama choice
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions Stolen seat. #GOPThieves
.@washingtonpost @PostOpinions Hypocrisy redefined. Garland not on Supreme because this guy put party loyalty over loyalty to country.
McConnell is exactly why we need term limits & He should be fined for refusing to do their job!!!
this is garland
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions McConnell broke SCOTUS nom procedure. Garland was nom'ed 1 yr ago. #No1butGarland #StolenSeat
Mitch is the walking definition of an obstructionist hypocrite. Retire already!
I want this old woman fired! He owes the American people what he got paid for 8 yrs! And his pension
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions Wouldn't you agree?   Oh, you have led by example, have you not, sir?
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions Remember Merrick Garland? Thou shalt not fill this seat! Period.
just a plain hypocrite-is one disgusting read. He refused to hold an up/down vote for a whole yr for Garland!
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions Do you think historians will look at you as a great man for not giving Garland a hearing?
@MitchMcConell has some chutzpah. Refusing to consider #obama's legal nominee and now bitching at #democrats!
He's a Liar! He's not working for the people! He's got to go! No pension!!!
@McConnellPress this is a joke right? You're in on your own joke right? #shameonyou #mcconnellhypocrite
Does he have no decency, honesty, and sense of shame left after decades or Washington politics?
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions Man, the difference of McConnell actions with a republican president, such irony. Sad really.
You are such a hypocrite!!
Sorry Mitch, not that easy.
A stolen seat. A corrupt Congress. A lunatic in the White House. Sounds apocalyptic to me.
can we start a #RepublicanHypocrites ?
It depends on when he said this, it could mean two entirely different things.
@SenateMajLdr since he's the end of our political world, we won't stop denouncing him.  Get over it
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions They SHOULD. Look what you did to Obama for his scotus pick!  You all stole it! Hypocrites!!
you stole that seat from America!  The majority of us wanted a liberal to fill that seat and you know it!!!!
u all started a year ago &you all stated if Hilary was elected never vote in a judge karma crooked republicans
#Rhetoric is much better than ignoring your #constitutional #duty to hold a #hearing for #Garland.
@MitchMcConell planned an unforgivable deed against Obama on his first day as president. #Lostintegrity
Are you going to take those fools Collins and Murkowski to task for stabbing school choice?
That's mighty white of you, Mitch! Glad to see hypocrisy isn't something that bothers you.
chinless old obstructionist lecturing us on propriety?  What a hypocrite.
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions Mr. Turkey neck is a two faced liar.  How bout Garland? Your ish stinks to high heaven!!
After #MerrickGarland gets one.
Republicans just left the conversation in the past. Quit playing with our govt.
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions

Seems they worked hard to capture McConnell's better side.
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions Stop being a hypocrite!
Nuclear option only! Screw the bastards!
Mitch shouldn't complain because the republican did this to Obama. Take a dose of ur own medicine.
It doesn't belong to pinheads like you either.
Sorry Mitch no body is buying your faux outrage 
Dems will follow the precedent you set
 Delay and obstruct
@McConnellPress @PostOpinions what an asinine statement.  There will never be consensus.  Politicians drive me crazy!!
can't wait to 2018 elections
first come first serve. Merit garland needs a hearing and vote before Gorsuch! Only right thing to do!
Hey, Mitch, what was it you said when Pres. Obama nominated someone for the Supreme Court?
There are no words for the hypocrisy exhibited by Republicans. We do not forget Mr. McConnell. #GarlandFirst
.... christ Mitch what a spineless hypocrite u are
@SenateMajLdr if SCOTUS is apolitic why did YOU block consideration of Obama's candidate?
The turtle is slow to realize he is the one who showed how to be an obstructionist.
Apocalypse was u & ur Pub buddies abrogating Constitutional duty in not hearing Garland. U should be impeached
Why did the lying @SenateMajLdr conveniently omit any reference to the Hon. Merrick Garland in this piece?
you are a crook and a liar and a horrible person
talking about Garland?
Exactly Mitch. It doesn't belong to either party. Also, it's not "Scalia's seat". It's the vacant seat.
Who would listen to this person. He works tirelessly to disenfranchise everyone
Go pound sand, @McConnellPress, along with your swamp dwelling wife and the rest of your deplorable ilk.
hypocrit
We never got a chance to a hearing with #MerrickGarland a man as deserving. You drop the self-righteous BS
It's interesting. Most republicans I know despise McConnell.
That's correct, it does not. I wish you and Send Grassley would have recognized that fact last February.
*Senator*
If that is true then why did the GOP refuse Judge Garland a hearing & a vote. Old Mitch has gone feeble minded
The only way McConnell is going to get Gorsuch confirmed is by using the nuclear option. Period. The End!!!
There is no smug face on Earth that begs to be slapped around with a large fish more than Senator McTurtle's.
@McConnel_leads has been in Congress too long. Time to take out this hyprocrite racist.
Republicans gave up any right to complain about Supreme Court nominations last year.
/2 So, how does McConnell get a free pass to act & write as though open S. Ct. seat "belongs to" Republicans?
@SenMajLdr really, you worked very hard to ensure it belonged to the GOP. Hypocrites Maj Leader.
1/ FYI "Scalia" did not own a seat on the Supreme Court.
shaudup
That #SCOTUS seat was stolen from Garland by the @GOP. Garsuch can get in line behind Garland.
You taught the playbook, Mitchy boy.  Block and obstruct even decent nominees.  Suck it up, buttercup.
mitch you started it! Now live on the other side.
Give us a jurist that reflects the will of the majority of the PEOPLE, not the fringe fanatics.  NO THEOCRACY!
does he have to plug his nose to be able to stand the stench of his own bullshit?
I only stop laughing because i am weeping.
No hearing, no confirmation until voters speak in 2020!
Deplorable Mitch McConnell!
@SenateMajLdr Just shut up McConnell. I give up. You're just a terrible person.
I keep telling you all, Mitch McConnell is a real life Lucius Malfoy.
such a spineless hypocrite!
.@SenateMajLdr certainly decided this seat belonged to his party. Hypocrisy without bound. @washingtonpost @PostOpinions
Had enough of Mitch's conveniently pandering opinions. He doesn't need a newspaper.
Scalia's death should be investigated.
Well isn't he just the little pot calling the kettle black. SMH
What a fucking hypocrite!
.@washingtonpost @PostOpinions I'd say something like "shame on you" @SenateMajLdr, but we know you have no shame or decency or integrity.
I'm sorry - bitch McConnell is the wrong clown to be giving this lecture
history will forever put an asterisk after the next @SCOTUS justice's name, a monument to their illegitimacy.
You sir have no credibility as you held the position hostage for almost a year!
POTUS Trump
@SenateMajLdr we would rather ditch you #RESISTANCE
hahaha you're hilarious #mitchmcconnell @MitchMcConell How dare you expect to be taken seriously after Garland
I have two words for this ass-hat: MERRICK GARLAND.  FU Mitch McConnell.
Why did it belong to Republicans last year when there were no hearing or meetings with Merrick Garland?
His wife just got a nice position to help pay for his cooperation. he will lie, cheat & steal to pay for it
this dude is a hypocritical ass wipe that talks out of both sides of his red neck...
McConnell, what a idiot, do you think we have forgotten what you did?
That bullshit sentiment is not in the constitution! Old goat
Fuck Mitch and his seat stealing
@SenateMajLdr He is the absolute LEAST credible person in the WORLD to make this argument!  #Hypocrites
McConnell is a total hypocrit!
why would you let him write a column? So he can spew lies all over your paper? Come on. Terrible move
Doesn't belong to 1 party? Then why refusal to vote for last 6 months? Sure seems like Rep. think it's theirs
That's why we took it away from Obama. It doesn't belong to anyone Democrats, it's mine! Mine mine mine!!!
Droopy Dog made some noise. Gooood boooy. Who's a good boy? You're a good boy! Now lay down and stop barking.
Dump Trump and this Pruneface!
#MitchMcConnell: "Our top priority is to make Obama one-term president."
@washingtonpost
McConnell: "Democrats, ditch hyperbole on #Gorsuch”
shut up
@SenateMajorityL @mitc Apparently you think it belongs to GOP since u held it open for months.
Oh but it does because you changed the rules, again, to suit only your party. And you know it.
Watching him lastnight & felt like Gorsuch is the US Pres 4 his eloquent & graceful speech...I was like wow!
The cutline under the headline of this picture is beyond parody.
McConnell TRAITOR ASS
@SenateMajLdr I am concerned about your mental health. It appears you are getting very forgetful. You should get to a doctor
WeThePeople follow no such but fine with eight
If that's what you think, @MitchMcConell y did deny it to Obama, and threaten no vote for 4 yrs. if HRC won?
It's not like no one's listening, or no videos of you saying those things.
um, no. You have overseen the most judicial obstruction practices for 8 yrs, esp.re.Garland
McConnell is the biggest hypocrite in US political history
He's also a liar! He needs to go! We want our money back for 8 yrs and we want your pension!
Mitch McConnell is hypocritical and frankly, an obstructionist.
i couldnt hear him through his turtle shell
One inspired thing to see Gorsuch speech was solid, humbled & very precedential...
Mitch McConnell is a dinosaur that needs to go.  Breaking the rules to push trumps yes men thru confirmation
nope. You guys started
he's quite possibly the most dangerous person in government today
Is the pull quote above Mitch McConnell's attempt at defining irony?
.@washingtonpost That's the same guy who intentionally stalled on Merrick Garland for a year JUST SO THAT Obama wouldn't get a win, right?
Didn't he block the last President from appointing a Supreme Court Justice ? Or did he forget that..
Senator M McM: Shut up about anything having to do with fairness or decorum. You have Trump as your model.
go President Trump!
That's fucking hilarious!! Now what did he really say?
*rolls eyes, makes jerk-off motions with right hand*
That's exactly how you felt the entire past year right mitch?
Sure thing, Turtle. NOT.
Hypocrite
Is McConnell holding a vote on Merrick Garland?
Too bad Mitch!  I hope they obstruct everything you want!  You started this!
- I hope, for his sake, god is as gullible as Trump followers.
Obama wasn't given a chance to make an appt. in his last year in office, why should it be any different for @POTUS? #ITMFA
the hypocrisy of this leader is unbelievable
like McConnell is in any position whine about Dem obstruction.
so then the Senate will finally hold a vote on Merrick Garland for the seat? He's been waiting a while now...
Piece od Shit McConnell hope your pick is blocked hope Grim reaper visits u soon
the irony of that opinion and Republican hypocrisy is staggering.
why I want him..i love him...again he wanted his best friend..i wanted him back
"Scalia's seat" doesn't belong to Scalia in perpetuity. Once he died, @Potus44 had the right to a nominee.
A hearing was not held for Merrick Garland, so what is the rush after all it is a stolen seat. @SenMajLeader
it's @senmajldr the one you tagged is a fake
willing to play with #SCROTUS
hiqw about we ditch and KY gets rid of him
He knows what happened all of last year, right?
hypocrites don't see their own hypocrisy
in Trump's pocket. Gave his wife a job.
finally, a voice of reason...
NO THANKS
