@McConnellPress The people spoke in 2008 and 2012. Arbitrarily shortening our President's term isn't your job.#doyourjob
@McConnellPress @USATODAY
@McConnellPress The people had a voice when they re-elected President Obama in 2012. Please consider the President's SCOTUS nominee.
@McConnellPress @USATODAY you are an embarrassment and shame on the idiots in Kentucky that reelected you I surely wasn't one
@McConnellPress @USATODAY absurd. Your  abuse of power will not be tolerated.

@McConnellPress @USATODAY The people voiced their opinions in 2012, the term is for 4 years!  @BarackObama did his job now #DoYourJob !
@McConnellPress @USATODAY . Ah, do you mean the people who elected Prez. Obama, Senator? Or, some other people?
@McConnellPress @USATODAY You are so full of it. Why don;t u do your job. You gonna find yourself on the outside looking in.....
@McConnellPress @USATODAY I voted for Obama in 2012 based on his 2 SCOTUS picks. Senator, you are denying me a voice in the process.
@McConnellPress &because U failed US we are about to elect dem senators 2replace McCain,Ayotte,Kirk & 5 others . Trump followers want U out.
@McConnellPress @USATODAY "Let people have a voice"? I voiced myself 4 yrs ago. Don't disenfranchise that vote because it doesn't suit you.
@McConnellPress your bottom lip connects to your neck. What the fuck happened to your chin ? Where did it go ?
@McConnellPress The people spoke when they elected Obama to a FOUR YEAR TERM
@McConnellPress @USATODAY  let trump bring a kkk riot to the Republican Party convention
.@McConnellPress We used our voice in 2012 when we elected the @POTUS for 4 more years to do his job. Do yours.
@McConnellPress @USATODAY...your disrespect for the President of the USA...hurts the American people...so now we have "President Trump"
@McConnellPress @USATODAY This is so disrespectful to our country. Can we focus on moving forward to better our country? Not hold it back?
@McConnellPress @USATODAY Obstructionist - unthinking -rude - stubborn - hurting our country. More of the "Let's not move forward" mindset.
@McConnellPress @USATODAY The people chose in 2008 & 2012.  Now it's your turn to do your job by having a fair hearing.
@McConnellPress @USATODAY We used our voice 2 deny GOP presidency in 2012. We used our voice 2 elect Obama 2 pick SCOTUS 4 us. #DoYourJobs
@McConnellPress the people have a voice and elected you to do your job.  People in Washington wonder why voters are flocking to Trump???
@McConnellPress @USATODAY IF YOU WANT MY PRESIDENTIAL VOTE,DO YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL JOB
@McConnellPress @USATODAY Yes, let the people have a voice.  DO THE JOB WE VOTED YOU IN TO DO AND CONSIDER THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE!
@McConnellPress @USATODAY Clearly, Mitchy's character is as weak as his double chin #DoYourJob #doyourjobMitch
@McConnellPress @USATODAY How ironic that Mitch is disrespecting the constitution as the process to replace the "originist" Scalia begins.
@McConnellPress @USATODAY the people have  decided..twice!  You failed to make 44 a one term Prez.   Stop the  temper tantrum  over  @POTUS
@McConnellPress @USATODAY The people did express their voice, they chose President Obama and the president chooses the SCOTUS pick
@McConnellPress "Give the people A VOICE in filling this vacancy." William F Buckley's ghost didn't write that line of swiss cheese logic
@McConnellPress @USATODAY The Supreme Court is to be above politics. The Senator has an obligation to do his job and vote yes/no, not stall
@McConnellPress @USATODAY the people have a voice when they elected potus twice! Do your job!
@McConnellPress @USATODAY They did! What about that are you not getting? Oh yah, your seven years of spite and denial. Do YOUR job!

@McConnellPress @USATODAY  "let the voters decide,".... Hillary can nominate President Obama to fill the vacancy!!
@McConnellPress @USATODAY he has no respect for the people unless they agree with him
@McConnellPress We twice voted for a voice instead of Christian ideology, and you’re taking that away
@McConnellPress  The people have a voice and this obstructionist behavior will not be forgotten when your term is up. #DoYourJob

@McConnellPress @USATODAY @CongPalazzo @SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@McConnellPress @USATODAY The people decided in 2012 when they reelected Obama overwhelmingly. Stop standing in the way for once.
