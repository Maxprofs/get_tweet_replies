You mean the #lesstaxmoredebtplan ?  We don't want any part of that!
An 1 page.. double spaced piece of paper is NOT a plan Really such a joke
He is going to sic the FBI after you if you continue to post this pic. I'll post your bail though.
thanks EJ! There is no excuse. No normalization
You need to clean up this Russia and tax issue before you do anything else.  Illegitimate government.
You got about as much chance of getting that plan through congress as I do playing in the NBA hahahahaha

It's going to ratcheted up the deficit.

But you don't care now that Obama is out, do you?
Trump white house refusing to provide Flynn records to Congress. Media should cover nothing else! #Trumprussia #illegitimatePresident shame
You have sold your soul Addison and for who? @realDonaldTrump who would sell you for your seat to put in a family member ?
Support our @POTUS We voted on his agenda.  That includes your voters
Impeach your @POTUS. He has no agenda but what benefits him and his family of Grifters. You were duped.
You are so jaded by media you cannot see that he is helping Americans including Democrats  It may not be your climate change but other ways
one page does not make tax reform. It took Reagan longer and he spoke about it to the american people this guy is a joke
Supply side economics has been tried many times over the last 60 years and has proven to have long term devastating effects on the economy.
Too bad we can't trust the Party of God & Corps.  If u cared, u would compel @POTUS to disclose tax and holdings for past 10 years.  Sham.
Before ANY legislation is passed we must see Trumps taxes. Also we want independent investigation on Russia/Trump ASAP
No tax reform until Trump releases his personal tax returns for the past 10 years. What is he hiding?  We demand this before any vote!
The Laffer Curve does not agree with your assessment. Trickle down economics does not work. We have been down this road before.
Ive an , try something new @SenateMajLdr. Uv been n office long enough, try new way. What didn't work in 80-88, def won't work now. #MAG
I'll see a tax hike 4 my CA fam of 4 w/$106k AGI due to higher C.O.L.  A 15% tax jump from 50k to 100k NOT relief for my "middle class" fam!
if Dems try to shutdown the gov, then Mitch should go nuclear to pass all legation w/ no holds or delays. this will force the Dems to work.
Can the @GOP actually pass something without tricks. Budget recon, dynamic scoring, and nuclear option. A joke! #CantLead #FailBigly #Shame

Tax cut for the .01%. You are not for the people of KY or the USA but only looking out for yourself. @Heritage handles your money: >$25M
Trickle down doesn't work friend
Aftr reading 2  by Lincoln, My disappoint n U is Ur calculative uselessness 4 ALL. When did u  believing n what's right? #MAG that sirs
How you ask for a bill with NO DETAILS? This is nothing but #ACA but it's okay bc @realDonaldTrump a supposed republican wants it???
I know Schummer controls the senate. You may as well step aside
Greedy Old Pervert. Start serving the American people not just the 1%
Here's a better plan: #RepealAndReplaceGOP
This is a tax cut not tax reform
Take the leadership role and get it done- - please.
Where is #Trump taxes. Before he tries to change the tax laws he should have the decency to show his tax returns #Treason #VoteThemOut
How much will multi millionaires like @POTUS, & ex-Goldman Sachs execs @stevenmnuchin1 & Gary Cohn save from @realdonaldtrump #taxreform?
And Senator. We will hold you to the task. Support our President and get the legislature done.
Sounds good. Too bad that theory has proven to be wrong, over and over again.
Get It DONE!!!
Bush tax cuts on steroids...how'd that work out turtle neck?
Term limits ... Come on K Y vote McConnell out.. Casey County Boyle County my friends and relative's vote him out
How about you get Donald to release his taxes then we can hear his tax plans.
#TrumpLies #Russiagate #releaseyourtaxes
Boy, good thing those liberal elites aren't in charge or else the billionaires would be getting all the tax cuts. Oh, wait...
Taking care of the top 1%? Look down here at the little folks. Oh I forget, the GOP hates the middle class and only cares about the rich.
I want to know how all of u entitled old men plan on paying for this "tax cut"? Do u EVER think about ANYTHING u propose?I think that is NO!
McConnell makes money off the blood of American troops.
GOP=lie, cheat, steal, repeat. There is no evidence 2 suggest that growth will pay 4 this massive giveaway to top earners. DJT will benefit
Oh you mean highway robbery by the Repub Party. Officially now the traitors of America @AP @ABCPolitics @NBCPolitics @MSNBC 
#TheResistance
@McConnellPress @SpeakerRyan @senorrinhatch @RepKevinBrady @POTUS REFORM!? ROFLMAO! #ELITEGIVEAWAY #BrokenPromise #crookedgop
.@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS  Force this through & destroy the GOP for a generation. #ELITEGIVEAWAY #BrokenPromise #crookedgop
You are all liers!  Not worth the air to keep you alive!
Poison pond Mitch
@McConnellPress @SpeakerRyan @senorrinhatch @RepKevinBrady @POTUS #ELITEGIVEAWAY Weather outside is frightful. THINK TWICE
Very few details by design. My guess is they want to bum rush the bill and encourage everyone to trust the Trump crime family#noway#thieves
Just another @GOP plan to screw everyone but your rich donor base..#Failure
Good. I assume you plan on eliminating the 60 vote cloture rule. @stevenmnuchin1
2018 is coming Mitch, you and your do Nothing about Russian interference comrades are going to be tossed out on your asses
Before all this, let's see @realDonaldTrump taxes so we can see how this will benefit him and his family.
You're a wretched old man and history won't be kind!!! That's your legacy!!!
GOP plan to con't screwing working Americans is so .. GOP.  Tax cuts for the rich...silence on Trump tax returns.  GOP = Party Over Country
Vote no or vote the swamp out
Release trump tax returns now!
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
They'll love your 'purdy' little mouth in prison. #RussianMoneyLaundering #TrumpRussia #PrisonMitch

I know this country "elected" @realDonaldTrump but how blind do you think we are to @GOP greed?!!


Can't wait to see you behind bars for money laundering. Traitor, liar, sinner.
NOT TAX REFORM..... IT'S A TAX CUT !!!!
No sort of "reform" should ever happen until Trump releases his tax returns so we know just how much legislation benefits HIM! #VoteThemOut
ABSOFUCKINGlutely!
Stop calling yourselves the conservative party.
Tell the American public why you and the rest of the Republican leadership are so weak. We should be cramming our conservative agenda.
It's simply a plan to provide massive cuts for corporations & the wealthy. Who benefits most? Trump and your wealthy donors? #VoteThemOut
Hi
More of cut mid class programs and cuts on taxes for rich . Same ol stuff different yr.
i wouldn't call it grows mitch tbh i have a feeling it won't be very popular among general population call it a hunch
Nope. Release his tax returns. Nope. Not gonna happen. Release his tax returns!!!
#geterdone @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan THIS is why we elected @realDonaldTrump as @POTUS We are small biz owners & are grateful for 15%, etc!
$4 Billion cash crab for the criminal in chief
WH reporters asked how it would impact Trump? Just on estate tax alone, if Trump worth what he says  - a $4 billion tax cut for Trump family https://twitter.com/genebsperling/status/856958641391378432 â€¦
Trump is a small fish in the rich people's world. Why don't you concentrate on what is good for job creation instead of hatred.
Trump should heed that advice. How does eliminating the estate tax foster jobs?
Why should the govt tax you on everything you accumulate and then tax you on it again when you die. Dems never saw a tax they didn't like.
Complicit Liars all of you. Corrupt to the core
Riposte!
