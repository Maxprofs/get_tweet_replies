Pretending that shoving YOUR particular religion up our vaginas is "religious liberty" is a bunch of bull crap. 

But the living deserve to be unprotected from sickness & madmen with automatic weapons
So that’s why you let chip expire 
Yet you kicked millions of children out of healthcare the other day? Anyone who supports you is a fool
It's after they are born that we don't give a fuck.
Pro life is a sham. Pro lifers are mostly pro war pro gun and pro discrimination.
That's right! Right until they are born and then they are on their own. No help from you if they need help with school, medical, insurance.
@SBAList @LindseyGrahamSC politicians make terrible doctors
Until there’re actually born, then we’ll cut Medicare/Medicaid, Chip, Snap, and every program for children, once born there’re on their own!
Love it how I'm hearing it's just a clump of cells! Ok well my clump just kicked me
Time for Mitch McConnell to retire!  Need some young blood in the Senate!
We all feel the pain of you in office. VOTE THIS FILTH OUT OF OFFICE!
Sure "protect" the unborn while letting children's healthcare protections expire. Hypocrites! This has always been about controlling women.
Where is  the compassion after they're born?  Will you protect, support them then?  So far you 2 are not stepping up.
What about the innocent lives in #LasVegasShooting ?? Wheres the bill for that?? #GunControlNow #DitchMitch

Research: Bans on abortion after 20 weeks disproportionately affect young people & poor people #NoAbortionBan http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/4521013/full … https://twitter.com/ReproRights/status/914897770560888833 …
When as females do we take a little responsibility for our bodies? With viability sliding into the 23-24 weeker, don't say it's just cells
You know who else deserves to be protected? Women.
Unless they are born to a minority mother, then to hell with them. Pull health care from that live fetus. You are evil. All for profit...

Until they are born, and then their on their own right?
.@McConnellPress Hypocrite!Unborn are precious, but once they’re born you don’t care about them or anyone else who’s not in your tax bracket
Impeach #45 before he starts WW3
Protect the innocent that will be killed by guns too
How about you protect all the lives lost in Vegas? Gun control!!
The lives of the born are preciuos and deserve to be protected
SOB
Is that like the bill the "honorable" Tim Murphy introduced in the House?
But you are abandoning them once out of the womb!
Unlike the born
Ask the wounded in these mass shootings about pain you po
It all about controlling women & poor women rich
You are not PRO LIFE YOU ARE PRO FETUS PROVEN OVER NO HEALTHCARE GUNS EVERYWHERE CUTS TO SOCIAL PROGRAMS TO GIVE WEALTHY MORE
Until they're born and need public assistance...then you don't give a SHIT!! HYPOCRITICAL CUCKS!!
Why didnt you good for nothings keep healthcare for 9 million kids?? All u fucking worry about are fetuses!!!
But actual live, out of the womb humans don't deserve to be protected. #KeepKidsCovered
True pro-lifers would protect those already born from slaughter by mass murder, from war, and give access to health care. U R NOT PRO-LIFE!!
You when they feel pain? When they're hurt. Too bad 9 million of them won't be able to see a doctor. But, pro-life, right?
Life is precious until it needs assistance, education and healthcare right Mitch?
Don’t be fooled, the “Pro-Life Movement” is just an extension of the hate and racism of those who opposed equal rights for all Americans.
Really A$$HOLE?
Based on lies. Again. Do you EVER tell the truth? 
And once they're born...they need to pull themselves up by their bootie straps. That's the GOP way!
Pro-lifers suck. Care only about their sharia-like religion & fetuses. To hell w the female“vessels” who have no life, liberty or happiness
"but I'll continue to slash programs to help those babies once they're born because I'm a hypocrite" - finished that for ya
Control over a women’s body has no place in a govt that encourages guns for all!!...u do not value life
So give them health care as toddlers, adolescents and teens!
The lives of born children are precious too. Please protect them from machine guns. Such arms are weapons of war not for personal protection

and of course, ur not accurate with your science, but that seems to be an @SenateGOP characteristic, make shit up to support your agenda
As do the rights of women who deserve to make their own choices regarding their bodies.  Not the government!!!

WTF? 
Never mind the unborn,
What about victims of gun violence?

Oh that's right,
I'm tweeting a guy that's owned by the NRA...

Pathetic

Hi Rep. Trent Franks. I’m a researcher and abortion provider. This isn’t actual science. I’d be happy to educate you about it if you’d like. https://twitter.com/RepTrentFranks/status/914889566825385985 …
I say this all the time in my school system!!
#TheyFeelPain is #FakeScience. This is all about controlling women. Next you won't let them drive.
