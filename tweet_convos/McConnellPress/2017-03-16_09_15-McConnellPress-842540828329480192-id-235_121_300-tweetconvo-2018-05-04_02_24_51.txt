No nomination during this 4 yr LAME DUCK administration. Obstruction .
@KazmierskiR @GorsuchFacts @senjudiciary   Praying for him and asking God to supply wisdom and guidance!
I have disagreed with Republican policies before YOU have made me HATE Republicans. You cheat!
Nuke the bastards Mitch! They are playing nasty games.
Mitch didn't permit procedural vote for Garland. Mitch is in trouble
how long will you allow the clown to circle the drain? Building up such a current hes goin to take every GOP when he goes
McConnell, delete your senate seat. You are such a hypocrite! Gorsuch will get what Garland got.
Trump is a lame duck President. Nope on vote. @SenateDems aren't voting.  Wait til 2020.
GARLAND!!!
Stolen seat. Garland should have had procedural vote. Mitch blows up Constitution
Cecil TURDle needs to be voted out of office. I hope his constituency wakes the f up.
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts @senjudiciary confirm Gorsuch!
Confirm GARLAND 
@SenateDems aren't voting for Torture Gorsuch
Never Forget 

2018  2020

@SenateMajLdr supports Trump and Trump FULLY SUPPORTS Putin and Wikileaks over US.
@GorsuchFacts @senjudiciary
.@SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts @senjudiciary too late for you to have any balls
We should not be advising or consenting on a SCOTUS nomination during @POTUS last months in office
Watching Intel Cmte now; who the hell put @DevinNunes on this cmte!? He's useless! Schiff is running this show. 20 min. opening lies!
APPROVE HIM!
Finally!  This is a good thing.
No it's not. Mitch didn't permit procedural vote for Garland. It's unconstitutional
First Garland, up or down vote, have some courage Mitch!
Mitch is lawless. Advise and consent not important if the President is Obama.
@KazmierskiR @GorsuchFacts @senjudiciary about time
~ @SenThomTillis #gorsuch & #SCOTUS & use #nuclear & move on. @SenSchumer is #Obama #OFA in #gov.
Timed 2 distract from comey. why did you rush confirmations on criminals?
Why did Mitch McConnell rush Price's confirmation vote before he fully disclosed his finances? To cover this up. #draintheswamp https://twitter.com/ProPublica/status/842801593951178754 â€¦
When will the mines reopen tho?
what happened to no SC nominee interviews during a campaign? Isn't Trump campaigning again?
Trump never stops campaigning.  You broke the system McConn, now live with it!
In Gore-suck himself. Sides w/business polluters & follow his RAY-gun mom's tries to kill planet.
None backed by oath/govt breaker Bitch rates hearing. Accepting is proof of no sense of justice...
All @SenateDems must vote no. Turnabout is fair play.

#ShameOnYou for toying w/this QUALIFIED man's life to spite @POTUS
#HowDoYouSleepAtNight 
is the reason you want him to hide the fact that u didn't disclose Russia before election?
asking for a friend- come clean Sir.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump  YOU in the GOP need to get TOUGH! The Dems are running the show, not you. Do whatever you can do now. Screw Them!
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Just get the Judge through! The Dems are embarrassing the GOP; Americans are sick of it! Use NUCLEAR NOW!
This is a Circus Act! The Dems ruin it all. Dragging it all out! JUST PUT HIM THROUGH; quit playing the Left's Games! NUCLEAR OPTION! BOOM!
Do you have any intention of doing your patriotic duty? Or are you going to continue to allow Russia and corporate interests to govern US?
@randytuggle @GorsuchFacts @senjudiciary Time to go
GOP obstructors. #McConnellKnew about #TrumpDossier
Hi! I'm curious to know how it feels to be part of the most. despised. administration. ever?

Gore-suck is an embarrassment for the entire besieged judiciary unless he recuses to Garland...
Lets see if he can get thru it without lying. It seem to be standard in the tRump WH
where is Judge Garland?  His hearings come first.
@patriotguard007 @GorsuchFacts @senjudiciary Liberals play through court interference against Govt and Ppl. They r winning.

another liar thief and bigot that we the people will fire
hope the senate is a little faster on this one
Gorsuch should lambast you for repudiating the Constitution by refusing to vote on Garland
you're a bad man.
It's about time this Ppl should have already been in place.
Glitzy ads don't fool. He is as bad for us as your budget.
about time
Thief! This stolen seat on the Supreme Court will bring the Republicans horrendous Karma.
Mr. Gorsuch is flattered, though you'd be tweeting the same for any old sock #POTUS drug in.
There is a special place in hell for GOP leaders who violate the constitution to steal SCOTUS pick
Merrick Garland's seat.

We get it. You love him. You know what my son loves? PBS. Can you leave those of us who spend $ on healthcare, not cable, PBS?

@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts @senjudiciary sorry but we can't put him in while Trump is still campaigning 
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts @senjudiciary Hey Mitch didn't President Obama nominate someone for the SCOTUS?
Zero credibility. Zero integrity. This will no doubt be your last term in office
2/2 Oh, wait, that ONLY APPLIES to Black Presidents! #failure

1/2 YOUR RULE, No hearings during the campaign, Trump has filed for re-election, NO HEARING!
You misspelled "I am exhibiting stunning hypocrisy.

.@SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts

: let's keep in mind President Trump can hold recall petition rallies in any state or district and garner enough signatures
confirm Merrick Garland.

Congress should work the entire month of April. Work as hard as the President!
A hearing you expressly denied the eminently qualified Merrick Garland!
This is a guy that hates women's rights, hates anyone that isn't rich like the good ol' boy crowd.
