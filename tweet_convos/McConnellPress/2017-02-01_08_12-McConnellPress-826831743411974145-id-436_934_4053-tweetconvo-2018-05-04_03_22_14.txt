@McConnellPress @VP @POTUS kinda like your racist boy Sessions or the unqualified DeVos?
He's as illegitimate as @potus AND YOUR WIFE.
As if McConnell knew anything about being outstanding.  How reliant can it be coming from the most hated man!!
@McConnellPress @VP @POTUS you stole this seat you sorry republicans will pay. Your slime should make minimum wage
Hello, to the men with no memory.  We cannot accept ANY SCOTUS nominee from the illegal regime of Putin and Trump.
.@SenateMajLdr @VP @POTUS no, he will not be a Justice. He'll get as much consideration as Merrick Garland did.  So.....none.
Nuke option. Already got 7 Dems on the table. He'll be confirmed, you'll cry and we will laugh 
I love watching these bitches cry.
Not nearly as outstanding as Merrill Garland, you hypocrite. Your on deck, #Gorsuch, but not up yet.
Oh, look -- the Three Stooges are back!
#1FTIn & not getting closer to heaven. WWJD?
the God that you know nothing about is going to show you your deeds and burn that smile on face...
what will judge do with the 13% BlackLives since he is an originalist?
Remember how you did your job giving Judge Garland the time of day #hypocrite
McConnell looks like Mason Verger from Silence of the Lambs
@LanceSilver1 @VP @POTUS now solidify your spine you weak suckup! #draintheswamp, repeal 16th & 17th amendments!
'So um Rex is it? So Rex, think you can put a good word in for me with Vlad? I love oil. Tell him I love oil.'
Everything you and your GOPs do should be held up without reason. Just like you did to Obama. No GOP SCOTUS hearing
Go nuclear. Confirm Gorsuch.
@bellevuepastor @VP @POTUS Get it done! Great choice.
How would you know?
You are all nothing but a puppets on a string.
Merrick Garland would have been an outstanding justice as well. #stolenseat
Outstanding choice for Justice of the Supreme Court.#NeilGorsuch.
he's great 4 corp. business & taking away woman's rts, not 4 the people u r supposed 2 represent. #TheResistance
@texasfrederick @VP @POTUS Id I just tweet? Thanks staff. Get on n do the right thing. Nukem. Show strength.  Dems would.
More WHITE GUYS! Just what the country needs.
Ha! Sally and I go way back.
Whatever you do, don't put a pube on her Coke as a joke. Past history in my profession clearly shows it'll be bad
I have much better grooming habits than Clarence, and a better sense of humor as well.
Cut the meeting, vote to confirm; Reed would be laughing at you guy, and telling lies. Move for March 1
So Mr. McConnell is ready to accept a Republican nominee? How American! #JudgeGarland
should delay this vote just like you did with Obama pick.
Scary photo--too much to see all at once. Maybe you could post individual photos in the future. This is too swampy.
"Look at us! So old! So gloriously white! So smug! Time to start slapping restrictions on women's reproduction!"
Yeah that's terrible. Women might actually have to buy their own shit. Oh my God the audacity! 
Tommy isn't good at talking or thinking or stuff like that.
do you even have a soul?
Please share with us why Marrick is as good. Thanka
Only for old white men like yourself. Why do you hate the rest of us?
then do your job and get it done in a month or resign
Outrageous that Obama who received 5 million more votes than opponent in 2012 was denied his choice!
Saying it doesn't make it true to the MILLIONS of Americans watching you all in horror #UnholyTrinity #RESIST
you are what is wrong with America
I hoper you can give Eddie Slovik a posthumous pardon due to all the miscarriages of Justice in his trial.
Ridiculous idea of stolen seat. Garland was NOT confirmed by the Senate. #WellDone

can't wait to watch your interview, know you will be awesome
WHY IS RYAN JUMPING AHEAD OF NEW ADMIN COMMENTION ON FOREIGN RELATIONS ON TV - TRUMP NEGOTIATES OUR DEALS NOW !?!?!
stolen! Stolen justice! You are all cowards of the worst degree and I'll say it to your face. Let's meet sometime.
Hypocrisy! The Republican trait!
Like any dying thing you get one last burst of energy, enjoy it, gentlemen, the GOP will never rise again.

So would Merrick Garland but you couldn't even bother to meet with him. #StolenSeat
@POTUSsick to my stomach. You allow Trump to destroy our democracy
Not for the American people.  Then again you never have for the people.
Hey, whatever happened to that other guy?  Oh, right - the constitution could be ignored a month ago.
MERRICK GARLAND
GET OFF MY TWEETS!!
"leader" of what?  Obstruction for 8 years? You are a malignant tumor in American politics
Merrick Garland would have been an outstanding justice, but you didn't even let him have a hearing you HYPOCRITE!
How's he different from Garland, the man you wouldn't give a vote for 255 days? @maddow @cavuto @foxandfriends @GOP
Great team in place to make OUR America Great Again!!! In you, we trust! God bless all!!!
We need to wait for the election cycle to be over to confirm him. Trump already put in his bid for 2020.
@Mike_Beacham @VP @POTUS Senate needs to ratify Congressional legislation to lower corporate tax, fix boarders...
@veganvecoh @VP @POTUS Glad you Finally came around...Finally.. #MAGA
Did Putin tell you to?Support a judge who doesn't like birth control or respect a women's right to control her body

You stole his seat from President Obama. Shame on you.

@tjalm @VP @POTUS #Dump McConnell but I love Trump's Supreme Court Pick.
if you approve, the country should worry.
thank you Senator !

Don't let Dems absenteeism hold anything up. Not allowing votes because of cowardice is unacceptable!
@ACrob98 @VP @POTUS Sir take off the gloves! Serve USA, stop BSING, I'm tired of all the babbling & red-tape in D.C! Work 4 US
YOU better get him confirmed even if you have to use nuclear option or you are FINA SHE & a coward
Too bad hatred of @POTUS44 got in way of common decency towards whom others described a humble man. #ChristianFAIL
#NeilGorsuch in a RIGHT-WINGER who will NOT be unbiased. Of course. Because it's ok for @GOP to pick activists. @SenateMajLdr @VP @POTUS
You are the most disgusting unethical obstructing hypocrites to ever infest America. GARLAND WAS QUALIFIED. @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
Why wait for Dems to stall confirmation just go nuceluar now!
And yet you didn't have the balls to meet with Merrick Garland. For shame! @SenateMajLdr @VP @POTUS #coward #chicken #boo
Change the rules and U will be out.  We will work on getting U out in time becuz u R the one that was corrupt in16
kiss Ass
I don't know how you sleep at night
With his head inside his shell.
@joeinthejeep @VP @POTUS 
Merrick Garland. #FakePresident #RESIST
@McConnellPress @VP @POTUS 
Sir, recommend you just go ahead with Reid Option/Rule.. it will save precious time and taxpayer money.   Thank you
Get him confirmed ASAP.
Thank you, Senator, for all you did for the American people in making this SCOTUS nomination possible.
Can we not have religious nuts...We already Have Tom Pence...He believes Jesus will land in Indiana in 2040.Ha, Ha.
. McConnell needs to retire or be replaced too many old ideas.time to sit on your porch on your rocker. puppet
I am so happy you are supporting our President, Senator. He is a great man, and will do great things for America.

Thank you!
@sullivanradio @VP @POTUS how many gays did you electrically straighten out. Or was it just a cross burning day?
If Sen. McConnell gets all of the Cabinet nominees confirmed by Friday, 2/03/2017, he might be a leader.
yr gross
Of course you HAVE TOO.  Trump gave your wife a job. How about supporting the people who give you a job?
Be concerned about Bannon. He's in a meeting & Dumbbell Trump kicks out the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff?
How come Cheeto-Hitler gets to pick when you racists illegally stopped the last president from his pick?
@tjalm @VP @POTUS don't blow it; nuke them
do what you need to do to get him through, please!
rubish!!
Not as good as Merrick Garland, though. Hey, that's Gorsuch's new nickname NAGAMG
MERRICK. MERRICK. MERRICK. scum. Hypocrites #NoBanNoWall #handsoffmybody
what else a #hypocrite would say after his wife gotten a new job with Trump??
Shame on all of you if invoked the Nuclear option. You are all useless bowing down to the illegitimate president.
as @POTUS has already filed for reelection I feel that it would be inappropriate to allow the nomination to continue.
Thank you.
you all need to be sent into permanent excile from the USA since your so UN AMERICAN #TheResistance
if you go nuclear you will be the biggest hypocrite alive.
You dug in and had no hearings for Merrill. What are you doing? Are you conducting a kangaroo court?
#StolenSeat #MerrickGarland #hypocrisy
So put on your big boy pants and go NUC..do not allow demrats to crush him & his fam!
why no hearing for Judge Garland? Obstruction of the Constitution. You hypocrites!
@DJT4POTUS @VP @POTUS Please give PA a good candidate for US Senate in 2018. We WILL vote Casey out. Tired of scare tactics.
@DJT4POTUS @VP @POTUS Do what you have to do.
for the rich like your self & the racist.
thank you for standing behind our President and out Vice President
You and your cronies are reprehensible.  We will not allow you to drag this country back to the 1800s. #RESIST
And yes, let's do give him the same consideration you gave President Obama's nomination - NONE. Karma.
I hope you lead with a great offense instead of having to maintain a defense.
If he can influence Kennedy, his former mentor, the GOP can obtain majority.
Thanks Leader McConnell. Sorry but the snowflakes are busy on this site today.
What do you know about reputation.  Americans will get fed up soon!!
But he is NOT WORTH UNDERMINING OUR DEMOCRACY. PLEASE DON'T GO NUCLEAR.
He will be indeed! Keep ignoring the haters; they will hate no matter what; Proud of the job you are doing! :-)
you've make a laughing stock out of this country.
Mitch, get your team together. As leader no one should not vote yes on any Trump nominee.
