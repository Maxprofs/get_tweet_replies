@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid there is no valid reason not to other than being an obstructionist. That's all you are.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid I get that you guys are refusing to back down and won't let this move forward. I just don't understand why.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid â€œby and w/ ...the Senate, shall appoint ...Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the U.S."
@SenateMajLdr you sound like someone saying "there's no law that says I can't be a stubborn jerk." 

@SenatorReid #MerrickGarland
@smrzle @bloomingdale_2 @SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee #TheWorldisWatching
@SenateMajLdr: I come from a long line of DAR Republicans. They'd tell you and the Senate, "Be more open minded." #SCOTUSnominee #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid But Constitution requires Prez 2nominate ("shall") & Senate 2process nomination ("advice&consent") not go fishin
.@SenateMajLdr  You sound like those petulant fools we all work around at the office: "That's not in my job description!" Get back to work!
@AaronVirtual @SenateMajLdr but this actually is in his job description.  People would be fired for this sort of behavior at my company.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid Constitution doesn't say a lot of things. Doesn't mean you shouldn't #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid I think does require you to hold a hearing to qualify or disqualify the nominee, DO YOUR JOB!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid Do what is right, not what is political.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid If you don't believe in upholding your constitutional responsibilities Mitch then you should resign. Do your job.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Hey turtle, let me know how it feels when you lose the majority in the Senate. Bye bye!
@KellyAyotte @SenRonJohnson @SenatorKirk @SenToomey don't let @SenateMajLdr hurt reelection chances by positioning you as do-nothings
@GOP
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid The American People are speaking in these comments.  Are you reading them?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid Doing nothing is right up the GOP's alley.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid The people elected Obama to a 4 year term. Respect Garland enough to vote.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Advise and consent. #Doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid No it requires you to hold a hearing. And your constituents also require you to #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid So what you just do whatever Harry Reid does?  Oh wait. He never blocked anything.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid  U won't even consider Garland nomination bec you"re afraid how far the process will go if it's allowed to begin.
@senatemajldr @senatorreid classified. If you call my commander and chief a nigger again, I will see you get tar and feathered myself...

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid YOU LIE SIR &YOU KNOW IT
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid suggest you consider the fact that we the people pay you to do a job and not behave irresponsibly
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid it's as if someone other than the actual current president was trying to make a Supreme Court nomination.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid how about doing the right thing?  GOP is going to shoot itself with another important election, and deserve it.
.@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Same logic: If elected rep potus appoints nominee, dems can hold off until 2020, right? How about forever, moron
@SenateMajLdr you want Donald Trump to nominate the next justice? You are truly a half wit.
.@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid What do we pay you people for? #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid So, you need someone to explain the difference between rubber-stamping and due process?

@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid But they always have. Remember, you said "Our job is to make him a one term President". People spoke in 2012.
