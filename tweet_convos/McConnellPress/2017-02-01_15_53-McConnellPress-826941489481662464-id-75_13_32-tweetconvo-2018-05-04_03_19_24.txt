Let's all hope that Sen McConnell has the courage and resolve to change the rules on filibuster
Big question: Will the jobs follow?
Please keep the soot in Kentucky's streams.
YOU SHOULD GO WORK IN THAT INDUSTRY.  Get some black lung.
You want to allow streams to get more polluted by overturning regs. You are happy with cesspools.
