.@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Except that Bush had no opportunity to make a nomination?! relevance? #MootPoint #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer That was then, and this is now.  Grow up!
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Remember: Justice Alito also received hearings, a vote and a confirmation b/c dems did their jobs #DoYourJob #duh
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer  The was NO opening in the final year of Bush's term! Fantasy. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer that is because Bush abused the system and he should have been arrested for war crimes by POTUS
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer wrong then, wrong now....logic flawed. Resign, sir.
@SenateMajLdr Remember: Schumer & Co. still advised, voted, and eventually consented. Your argument is hollow.
.@SenateMajLdr do your job. Hold the hearinf @McConnellPress @SenSchumer #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Again. Two wrongs don’t make a right. Get off your high horse and do your job.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Unprecedent in US history 4 Prez 2 leave office w/SCOTUS vacancy.  What's different about this Prez than previous?
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Never stopped hearings. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer   #YOUBUM
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer But he didn't actually do it!!!!  He didn't do what you are doing!!!  You are a bit touched to use these examples.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer @McConnellPress 

If @SenSchumer jumped off a bridge, would you?
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer @McConnellPress Do your job, advise on the nominee
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Remember when your parents told you two wrongs don't make a right? You are wrong now, so get it right. #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer Tit for tat is it? How about doing your job. I don't give a flip about how big your pkg is!
@SenateMajLdr Yeah, @SenSchumer was wrong, too. Two wrongs don’t make a right. Stop playing politics and #doyourjob.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer and that RIGHTFULLY was shot down! As will you be! You can't change the Presidents length of term! DYJ!
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Yeah, he was an idiot, too. "There's a precedence for stupidity so I'm okay acting like a moron" is not a defense.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer you say the Democratics started this war. Keep it up. What will you say when Trump is the Pres.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer  - you use someone else's bad behavior as an excuse for your bad behavior - where does it end!
@SenateMajLdr Two wrongs do not make a right. Stop further embarrassing the GOP and #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer But it never happened. No SCOTUS was nominated under Bush so we are talking about "what ifs".
@SenateMajLdr the fact @SenSchumer wanted to play games instead of doing his job doesn't make it ok for you and yours to do the same.
@SenateMajLdr  @SenSchumer the right response to sand being kicked in your eye is not to kick sand back. Have some self respect. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer you guys got a judge though. So…as I would tell them, #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr You act like its a playground and you want to take your ball and go home.  #DoYourJob #idontgetpaidifirefusemyjob
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer does not make it right. This is not elementary school. Please grow up.
@SenateMajLdr  How can you claim to be the better party if you play the same old political games? Be better... #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Y'all can vote him down if you want. That's your right. But refusing to vote is wrong. I thought you respected the Const.??
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer so what? Do your job.
@SenateMajLdr What @SenSchumer DID say: "we were not given the most accurate picture of the nominees..were presented a misleading portrait."
@SenateMajLdr That's not what @SenSchumer said. Not due to timing or closeness of election -- rather, due to political activism of nominees.
@SenateMajLdr  not leadership
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer WAAAAA HE GOT TO EAT A CUPCAKE BEFORE DINNER TOO WAAAAAA
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Yes but Bush was a drooling moron.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer It was wrong then and it's wrong now. I suppose if Chuck told you to jump in the lake you'd jump in the lake?
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Methinks the majority leader doth protest o'er much. Do your job. Your continued harangue reeks of justification.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer U sound like a 5 yr old:"he did it first." Ur a senator; act like one or go home! What a joke!
@425Michele @SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Michelle's right and we don't let our kids get away with nonsense lets do the same w congress!!
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer this isn't kindergarten #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer - Get a chin !
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Provide the full context, then point to any nominee denied a hearing. Just one, Yertle.

#DoYourJobMitch
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer STILL CONFIRMED.
@SenateMajLdr you need to step up and be our leader, be bigger than the Dems. This is a nominee we can live with. We lose the election???
@SenateMajLdr they're right. Do your job! #NoHearingsNoVotes @SenSchumer
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer He was wrong too. No excuses. #obstructionist #juvenile
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer and yet.... Bush still got nominees past when presented. You're just a GOP Bully who has done nothing but obstruct
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Over 80% of Americans want $$$$ out of politics. What are you doing for the people??
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer - And yet it still happened. Schmuck. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer The GOP of today is just an obstrutionist -- no value to America.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress #DoYourJob or confirm Hillary's appointment next year.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer oh...they did it,so we will too?That is so lame.Stop with the politics and have the damn hearing.  GOP losing it
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress The POTUS did the Job he was elected to do, now do yours! Call a vote!
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Lets not forget that he and the Dems actually did their job unlike you and your clowns #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Are you in third grade? Move on. Be the better man. This sounds like my kids. They're 6, 7, & 9 years old. #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer spare me. Just do ur damn jobs
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer  So what? You are all acting like idiots! With your kind of leadership adios rep party
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Wait, I get it!  They tried to take your toys away, now you're mad. Elementary school bullies. umadbro?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer And I'm sure you said at the time what a stupid move that was.
The box you're in, @SenateMajLdr, is totally of your own making. Stop blaming others. That approach got us @SenWarren, though, so thanks!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress So What! Two wrongs make a right? Grow up and do your damn jobs! #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer and people change and he probably realized he wasn't doing his job but now he will.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Regardless of what was or wasn't said, I'm TIRED of this pathetic, childish finger pointing. Enough! #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer ACTIONS matter more than words. When did your side NEVER get to pick anyone?  answer....NEVER
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer But they did in fact consider and approve anyway.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer And yet they heard and approved all of his appointments.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Remember: you're bigger than that. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer but they voted. #graspingatstraws
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer #DoYourJob
.@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer  Yes, it was pure bluster but calmer heads prevailed and the consitution won.  There was no block
@SenateMajLdr Politicians say all kinds of ridiculous things, it's all part of politicians game. Thought you knew. Now do your job.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer We have spoken! 2x Obama had been elected knowing this is part of his job. He's doing it so now #DoYourJob!!!
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer and yet wasn't there a vote and a nomination?? Hmmm
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer other people's lack of leadership justifies yours? You must love 10% approval ratings
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer Doesn’t matter today. Did Senate actually refuse Bush nominee then?
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer AND THEN THEY HELD A HEARING, HAD A VOTE, AND CONFIRMED ALITO. ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer oh, I see, this is all about revenge, then?  Seriously, #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr WE THE PEOPLE ELECT OUR PRESIDENTS FOR 4 full terms! #potus #doyourjobs
@SenateMajLdr this is the reason why the Republican Party is falling apart. Do you job. #dirtbag
@SenateMajLdr Good point: the other guys did a poor job governing, so we’re going to do a worse job. Well played, sir.
@SenateMajLdr @DividendMaster @SenSchumer Reps...remember Robert Bork...do nothing with this Administration....
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer you are going to lose so many seats during the selection thank you for galvanizing the Democrats
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer DO YOUR DAMN JOB, look tortoise they conformed  him anyway,so shut up and do what you paid to do.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer He may have said it, but you are actually DOING it. Very different. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer tired of making up rules as you go. How can you be for the Constitution when you dont follow it? #turtlespeaker
@SenateMajLdr stop trying to ruin America you fascist. The people did speak 3 years ago so why don't you respect their voices?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenSchumer Shame on Republicans and endless obstruction. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob you #jealous hack.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer but it came to a vote, you hack.

@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob That might be that GWBush might have been the worst President ever if you have forgotten already. Stop the Drama!
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer you want to give the people a voice. People did not support Bush at all. Obama has our support, now do your job.
