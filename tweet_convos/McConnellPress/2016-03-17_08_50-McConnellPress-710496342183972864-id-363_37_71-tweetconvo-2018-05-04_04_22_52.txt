@Lucas8429 @SenateMajLdr Nonsense. It works for Trump.
@rabidbadger @SenateMajLdr How is Trump's rhetoric helping the general discourse? Most Republicans are not evil. Most Democrats are not evil
@Lucas8429 @SenateMajLdr I disagree. Republicans are evil. See also: all of my tweets.
@rabidbadger @SenateMajLdr I can find 100s of accounts that will say the same thing about Democrats and the awful things they have done
@Lucas8429 @SenateMajLdr "accounts" are one thing. Facts are another.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs #SCOTUS The People elected @POTUS in 2 consecutive elections. Hold Hearings. Vote. It's not hard, really.
