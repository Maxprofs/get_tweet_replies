You have never shown yourself to be honorable. Crook is more like it.

You misspelled 'dishonorable.
Unless you will publicly denounce our racist-in-chief, AIPAC should reject you.
"Honorable"? Really?
Garland, Merrick Garland - and how you engineered the stealing of a Supreme Court seat - what's honorable about that ?
Honorable?  No not at all.  These guy's are bought and paid for.  Honorable has nothing to do here.

Please stop using the word honorable.  There is nothing honorable about you and you MUST not se that title.
I don't think honorable means what u think it does
Stands with AIPAC but does not stand for American Indians and their protection!  WTF??
"Honorable Mitch McConnell."  Now, THERE's an oxymoron describing a simple (non oxy-) moron.  Sad.  #traitormcconnell
.@AIPAC @SenateMajLdr - I'd rather drink Draino, but thanks for letting me know!  #Trumprussia #NunesMustResign #KremlinGate #flipthe6th

@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr GLOBAL Warming is REAL - calling you "Honorable" with all your Coal/Koch $$$$  is f#{k'in SAD & Sick.
What is AIPAC's position on a 2 state solution?  If you think it is a good idea, I won't join.
men without integrity wisdom compassion plus liars are unacceptable leaders
I see this banner. Honorable?  Not a word I would associate with anyone been in congress that long. All are underhanded
Are you going to mention that DJT has a hard time condemning threats to Jewish Centers here in the U.S.
I didn't know you liked the Russians?

probably how to get more of OUR money and the great tax breaks for the 2%ers
Honorable? That is a joke!
Honorable? Hardly. This is a man who used to rail against the influence of  in politics, only to come consumed by it.
Nope
