@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Repub hypocrites:
@SenateMajLdr Did this argument work with your mother when you were a kid? "If Joe Biden jumped off a bridge, that doesn't mean you should."
@SenateMajLdr POTUS nominated an older white man, the racist obstructionists should be happy
@SenateMajLdr Did you swear an oath to uphold the Constitution, or the "Biden rule?" #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress and you look like a dimwit and not a leader. Not bad for a bitter angry loser leading a dying party.
