I agree!  Please act responsibly and SHOW US THE BILL!!!  We have a right to know!!  Do the right thing!
Your secrecy is effecting my life - stop it now!
YOU ARE THREAT TO THE AMERICAN TO PEOPLE. WE KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.
Stop taking healthcare from sick Kentuckians.  I am converting myself and friends from R to D.  Can't wait to vote you out for betraying KY

Act on what exactly? I don't know how Kentucky puts up with you.
Your Twitter plan:

1) tweet something asinine;
2) repeat 1 with worse grammar;
3) repeat 2 with no punctuation;

Important: make NO sense.

One word.  KOCH.
Lobbyist money over American lives. It's the republican way!Isn't that correct, Mitchell?

Old white people should go the way of old white people.
Not sharing trump cares because So top secret because you cannot defend trump Care? Were you elected to keep secrets from Kentucky voters
When did the Dems say they didn't want to work with you on healthcare? You're doing it in private without them. Partisan hypocrite!
You can act with the input of Democratic Senators. By writing this bill in secret, you're denying a voice to half the country.
You're so shady. Let us see the bill if it's so great.
You're a hypocrite w/your secretive healthcare bill. Don't you know we have youtube & can compare your behavior in 2010 to now? #ditchmitch

You are bad for America.
#Hypocrite
In 2009 and 2010 you said there should be 100% transparency while AHCA was written. Now you're crafting your bill in total secrecy.
You don't want Americans to see how damaging your healthcare plan will be. How do you sleep at night?
You're an evil & vindictive person to the core. I hope your healthcare bill fails & your healthcare fails you for all damage you do to USA
This man is going to Hell for what he personally has done over the decades.
YES I AGREE WE HAVE TO ACT SUPER FAST BEFORE THE AMERICANS CATCH ON. LET'S SCREW THEM REAL GOOD. WE JUST MADE LOTS OF $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
What a lying HYPOCRITE! In 2010 you were complaining that Democrats were working behind the scenes to jam a healthcare bill through Congress
Praise be Commander. I realize the secret plan is to provide affordable universal coverage and reach over 95% citizens covered.
Quit hiding the healthcare bill! If it's so GREAT, why done in secrecy w/ no amendments or debates? 10 hours before vote? SHAME ON YOU ALL!!
The Republican Party is NOT what it used to be. It has been taken over by repubs only interested in lining their pockets from NRA and CEOs
History will NOT forget Mitch & neither will the American people! I'm ashamed to say I was once republican.
McConnell failed to answer repeated questions about whether the public should see details of the health care bill http://abcn.ws/2rNHu4E 
Country BEFORE Party!! You will FOREVER go down as the one who brought this bill with NO debates or amendments. 10 hours is NOT enough
We have to ACT on U!!! And the republicans. Shame on YOU! I bet you call yourself a patriot. You're only for your party and pockets!
#ShowUsTheBill

We are all very scared. Millions off, pre-existing exclusions and Caps leaving the rest of us w/o too.  Don't do this to America.
You should be acting to protect and expand the ACA. Your work in secret is terrifying. We are afraid of what the Repubs are doing.
