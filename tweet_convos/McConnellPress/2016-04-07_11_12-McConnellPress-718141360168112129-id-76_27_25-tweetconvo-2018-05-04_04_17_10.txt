@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP why don't you just #DoYourJob?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Your actions are unfair, undemocratic, partisan obstruction to filling the highest court in America.  Sickening.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP #DoYourJob and bring this country together
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Not a rule! #DoYourJob or lose it!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP do your job. Stop looking for excuses.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP it's not a rule. #doyourjob.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS @VP You're kidding, right?  Democrats are masters at hypocrisy, and smooth-tongued twisters of facts!
@SenateMajLdr Politician used to be an honorable profession until YOU were elected.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP  in that case, the nominee had hearings and vote in the end.  Get to hearings and vote on nominee!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP you kind of sound like @realDonaldTrump right now. "He started it" why are republicans 5 year olds?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP  Biden's rule didn't catch water! YOU won't even let senate debate it! Maybe YOU should listen to POTUS!
@SenateMajLdr Except what Biden did doesn't matter because no such case came up, you are just looking for an excuse to justify your actions
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP it's not a rule!!!  Tired of you obstructing everything. Union county Kentucky here, your pink slip soon!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP so ninties...2016...MOVE ON! #ADVISE&CONSENT!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS @VP There is no Biden rule. Biden never blocked a nominee. You're out of line. #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr you just keep repeating yourself!!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS @VP SCOTUS nom-Obama using foot in the door technique.Force Senate vote and target vunerable Senators
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS @VP Obama warns GOP of retaliation if Supreme Court nominee not confirmed!  We The People warn Obama!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress McConnell blocks votes wholesale, in order to keep critical jobs vacant, & to undermine the government itself.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP @McConnellPress Just a few months left till Republican senate majority is history. There is still time to doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP In literally the same speech said that he would consider a more moderate candidate. Or one the Senate helped pick.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP You're like Gretchen from Mean Girls. Stop trying to make #BidenRule happen. It's not going to happen.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP "Biden Rule" is not a thing. "Lame Duck" doesn't happen until after the election. Stop trying to make this a thing.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS @VP .  Senate get off your ass, hold a hearing and vote! Need senate/house term limits! Congress sucks!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Of course not, because Obama is a sorry SOB.  Keep blocking any nominee he puts up. He has screwed us enough.
@SenateMajLdr there is no Biden Rule, but there is a Constitution.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP THE "BIDEN RULE" IS NOTHING BUT A SOUND-BITE McCONMan, AND YOU KNOW IT.  #DoYourJob OLD MAN.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress  "Leader McConnell" is quite an ironic name for someone who has accomplished absolutely nothing the past 7 yrs
@SenateMajLdr you really are an embarrassment to the senate and the country. @POTUS @VP
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Perhaps and read the complete statement. U only used the past u liked. U R just obstructionists. U lost moral path.
@SenateMajLdr  @VP There is no #Bidenrule #POTUS has a 4yr term not 3. #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr Why would he, there is NO Biden rule? Will you do your JOB? We don't want 2pay you to do NOTHING!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS @VP Its  played out Mitch,folks realize that a old speech by Biden doesn't equate to a Sen/house rule.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS @VP Certainly a rule you&your GOP knuckleheads would use.Unless of course it benefits your evil cause
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Why doesn't Senate have a hearing & take the high road. No need to point fingers with a 'he did it first' attitude.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Will the POTUS bring up the Chairman Grassley rule (2008). His rule supersedes the older
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP  Just do your job you were elected to do, ok!   Quit playing games.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Nice try, Mitch. There is no such rule. There is, however, a thing called The Constitution. Read it #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP There is no damn Biden rule. You are a liar and an obstructionist. Know that history will not treat you kindly!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP asked my senators to list their priorities for the yr, doubt I get a reply @FoxNews @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Will you bring up Grassley's opposition to delays today?  @ChuckGrassley
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP There is no #BidenRule. Stop bringing it up. One man's dumb comment from years ago does no a rule make.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Actually, he may go there, just so he can add: 'He was Just Kidding!' Yes! The Hypocrisy is that Evident!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Biden is gone...carry on since when you do what Democrats say?? Try again fool
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP 
Turtleman. 
Turtleman. 
Turtleman.

#DoYourJob
My gawd you whine too much. Get to work skippy, time to #DoYourJob instead of trying to bully your superiors. @SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress  There is no Biden rule. Attach link to Biden's speech on floor of Senate so all can listen in its entirety
@SenateMajLdr How about the McConnell rule? Anytime the Senate leader wants, he can bring up an historical note that isn't applicable.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS @VP 100% HORSE SHIT
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Why do you make things up, Turtle?  Enjoy a touching moment from a recent GOP debate.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP Mr. McConnell, be different and quit being an obstructionist and do it job for once!!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP The repubs do like imaginary things like "The Biden Rule", god, a right-whinge balanced economy etc
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP or you could be the bigger person and put this bipartisan bickering behind you. Stop acting like a 5 year old
@SenateMajLdr no more judge picks for Obama. He has destroyed enough already
@Blob_Fish @SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP If 80% want more background checks, why did only 60% vote for it in very liberal Washington state??
@Blob_Fish @SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP The 1988 confirmation was a continuation of the Robert Bork fight from the summer of 1987
@Blob_Fish @SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP What about the 2 leftists the Senate confirmed for Obama?
@Swampbeast777 @Blob_Fish @SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP What? Did they confirm them during his last year in office or just doing their job?
@3168Deus @Blob_Fish @SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP After nearly a 2 year process yes. Apples and oranges.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP The REST OF THAT STORY! Advise, hold hearings, and up or down vote. FOLLOW THE REST OF THE RULE GOP!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP No Way!
