it's women like those you call idiots, ie @SenWarren, that fought for your right to be the naive haughty princess that you are
SHE FIGHTS FOR NOONE!! Least of all females that REALLY need a voice!
They are living in the dark ages and must be stopped. 

This is a stolen Supreme court seat. You are poisoning senate atmosphere.
Merrick Garland!
are you going to give Garland a fair hearing?
They should do a 4 year filibuster.
you should have confirmed Merrick Garland 8 months ago.  Stop being a hypocrite, Mitchy.
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts  Don't. Do. It. You miserable political hack
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu this virulent virus is not a leader; he is a old ugly demented obstructionist.
And We The People object. Get a clue. U R corrupt, treasonous.
Drain the swamp so all of you snakes   can slide in.
get over yourself and accept you did this to yourselves!

- Yes, because he isn't a Democratic pick. Obama's pick should have that seat.
At this point, they would filibuster their own mother.
God Bless Jake... His face while you spew BS!!!
We will never forgive you for Garland. NEVER. No compromise until you are GONE GONE GONE GONE.  Shame on you!

you stole that vacancy! You have no right to fill it!
Merrick Garland
Yet you would not give Obama's choice even a hearing.
no because you are a brat that blocked Garland so no
And we were all impressed by your lack of near-term memory.
Gorsuch maybe a good man whose name will forever be sullied by connection to yours, Mitch.
MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts 

You must have forgotten Judge Garland.  We haven't.
@Loxodonta_s @jaketapper @CNNSotu why are you taking to CNN & Jake Tapper they will just report fake news?
God Bless President Trump
We are also Couldn't have picked someone better. 
These old dinosaurs need to move out of the way for progress in this country.
Americans demand a full review of this nominee. Merrick Garland deserved respect
@Ward4Anderson @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts The fact is u refused 2 even meet or speak with Garland. Time for u 2 retire
Sir, Remember Merrick Garland!
Better grow a spine McConnell! Stop cowering from controversy. Be a man not a wuss! #maga
HYPOCRITE!!
You also made 1 statement I agreed with about Putin & Russia. Dangerous man & killer.
CNN-jt U ALL R full of greed likeRepublicans.Y  did'N Uspeak up 4 @POTUS44 @MadisonSiriusXM
Too sad, Too bad. We stopped watching CNN months ago. Your association w/them dubious.
What do U say re:Trump 's Hate America First Putin kills & we do too? KY poverty rate19% we need Medcaid SNAP
#garlandmakes9
You also spoke about Trump's appalling comments on Russian.Why don't you post that?
Do what it takes to make it happen.
We went a year without this filled-another year won't hurt, right?
so sick of this partisan hack. Bad for America.
U didn't have an urgency last year, so screw ur agency now!  BLOCK, BLOCK, BLOCK.  RESIST.
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts no, power grabbed Obamas nomination. Constitutionally wrong!!!! Garland pls
So did President Obama pick an outstandinng man.
If he is truly a God-fearing man of honor, he will NOT take #Garland's seat. The world & the voters are watching.
Your words & actions are not republican or American. How can you live with yourself? Change please, we need you to be better.
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts There is no reason to delay Judge Neil Gorsuch confirmation. Gett'er done
yup REALLY IMPORTANT (Merrick Garland)
@realDonaldTrump U better use the nuclear option or ur finished!
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts Americans are grateful you let us choose the nominee with our vote
Hypocrite. I'm ashamed to be your constituent.
so NOW it's important? U R a hypocrite. #filibuster #Resistance
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts  when Merrick Garland has hearings then Gorsuch can! Crooked McConnell '
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts ya and GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL COAL lover...
traitor!
you are finished we will make sure to see you ppl in 2018
You stole the pick through obstruction, that is treason. Trump, you, others will be removed
Shameless turtle-y hypocrite!
You should have plenty of energy after sitting on ur ancient, petulant a$$ for 8 yrs. #Garland #LyingGOP
@Gorsuch Talk about this.."We’ve got a lot of killers. What do you think-our country’s so innocent.” DJT
My goodness, you may be the biggest hypocrite of the GOP. You had some stiff competition.
GOP is simply reaping what it has sown. Shouldn't be surprised at the harvest.
Do you remember when you told us your only job was making Obama a 1 term president.
I REMEMBER!
Do you have amnesia. You blocked Obama's nominee for almost a year.
Merrick Garland!!!
It is in fact more important to filibuster and block the nominee for a more mainstream one.
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts Another tax fattened hyena. #TermLimits
If it wasn't important for nearly a year previous, why is it so important now?
The problem is GOP proved to America that we can go without a full SC for 9+ months
, you mean have a vote and see if he gets confirmed, just like Garland huh, Hypocrite.
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts Vote you out do not confirm what happen to MERRICK garland
What happened to Garland's up or down vote? Hypocrite.
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts Where were interviews when Judge Garland was nominated?  Obstructionist?
that seat belongs to Garland.
@McConnellPress @jaketapper @CNNSotu @GorsuchFacts that'll do it… you always have such wise thoughts mitch
you need to wake up to see Trump is betraying the entire country and YOU to benefit Putin
You're the Senate Leader. What is power if you don't use it? Impotence! Get it done.
, NO @SenateMajLdr Stealing a Supreme Court Seat is an obscene abuse of power and a crime: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/opinion/make-the-republicans-go-nuclear.html?_r=1 …  You're a CRIMINAL.
And you would've gotten it had you not played a game with Garland. But you did so they do.
McConnell is a hypocrite and an obstructionist.
Hope The Dems come up with some novel idea to block the GOP agenda just like McConnell did with no hearing for Garland.
First ask: "Judge Gorsuch, why the h$%& do YOU have a right to a confirmation hearing?"
Even you don't believe what you're saying, or you'd have confirmed Merrick Garland.
an up or down vote SHOULD have happened for judge garland! #wheresmitch see in 2018
how about get all the cabinet picks voted on.push the lame dems
Seat Merrick Garland First as #SCOTUS, @SenateMajLdr!

#WeNeedNine #JustUs #OurRevolution
Saw u "distance urself" from Prez on issues. Ky wants u 2 back him. Speak truth, but don't give "them" fodder
No
well I'm sure that will help . What an enormous waste of time..but as long as you are happy
When Trump's house of cards crumbles, I pray to God it takes you too as an accomplice.
That seat on #SCOTUS should belong to Merrick Garland. @SenateGOP obstruction.
When Merrick Garland is proposed first then we will confirm.  NOT Gorsuch.
Stand up to the President and Bannon.
you did not confirm Garland so Gorsuch is illegitimate nominee. no mandate to nominate!
YOU HAVENT DONE YOUR JOB FOR 8 YEARS, AND RAISED YOUR OWN PAY. Yeah, Dems should play along
@GOP Your failure to give a hearing to Garland proves you are not capable of representing America. Gorsuch is not who we want.
You obviously do a poor job vetting people. Gorsuch leans white. #THERESISTANCE Alt white.
.@SenateMajLdr Gorsuch will be given the same respect you gave Garland If you think we're going to be pushovers come talk at a March #Resist
Same thing could be said about Garland CV. Really sir, the flip flopping example of leadership is sickening. Sad
Merrick Garland had a sterling background too.
Ask Merrick Garland...awkward!!
HOW ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EVEN GIVING GARLAND A HEARING. SENATOR HYPOCRISY HAS NO BOUNDS
I think Tapper's face says it all. #illegitimateSCOTUSnominee
hmmm... That's the way I felt about Garland...
I hope DEMS don't waste political capitol on Norsuch, save it for 2nd SCOTUS pick.
GOP must pull a Harry Reid and Dems nuclear option SCOTUS nominees majority vote Only way

There is pretty much nothing you can do that will convince me you have any integrity left
You should get the same courtesy you afforded to Merrick Garland. Fair is fair.
@TheDemocrats the @GOP has no urgency, Merrick Garland was ignored for 10 months
and not what you want you do represent all Americans not just your interests
And the complete unimportance of fulfilling my constitutional duties (re:Garland).
- Appears to be a leftover coup by the Obama W.H. Holding The Clock -
Phony partisan politician, still can't save coal industry.
they better filibuster this judge.  Merrick Garland 1st dictator @SenateMajLdr
Did you tell em your a hypocrite for not giviving Judge Garland his just due ? Survey says?
get on board or get out of the way fresh blood is what we need if your going to be a
a dem in disguise we have a mandate make it happen stop your idiocracy and do what the
This republican says you owe the country a hearing on Garland first. ARE YOU HEARING US!!
Why is this such a priority to the  @GOP Thugs? How about conflicts of interest & dirty ?
What's important is BLOCKING your dirty deeds when opportunity presents itself. #hypocrisy
you need to have a backbone and stop being democrat like remember we have a mandate so
McConnell  Bannon
Sorry Mitch. Karma's a bitch and you're a hypocrite owned by Trump.
How are you coming on the cabinet? It's time to get them confirmed and working for America!
How about the importance of doing ur job? Leadership Malpractice!!
Wow a lot of love here. NEITHER SIDE should hold up American system. People paying price.
MERRICK GARLAND #StolenSeat #StolenElection
have you met a guy named Mitch McConnell?  Looks like you but was saying the opposite
and yet you wouldn't even look at Garland
Merrick Garland was a moderate, compromise choice. Gorsuch is extreme. Filibuster deserved.
What about Merrick Garland?
Why are these confirmations taking so long? Pres Trump said to go nuclear. We need these men to start working!
Public servants are supposed to serve citizens. Why do you hate Americans? Investigate.
But not important to give Judge Garland the courtesy of a hearing that the Constitution mandates.
You forgot to say, "The same could have also been said last year about Judge Garland."
Vote to confirm Merrick Garland the rightful nominee
I call BS.   FIRST consider Merrick Garland.   MIch I hear Bannon calling you...
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
should have appointed Obama’s pick then!
You're a hypocrite Mr Majority Leader and are acting as accomplice to Trump/Bannon
As youve already proven
It's not at all important Wait until the next President to decide
Yeah - kiss that shit goodbye.  YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON DENOUNCING BETSY DEVOS RIGHT NOW.
fact #StolenSeat  #MerrickGarland  not his seat
too bad you didn't do this a year ago but you only follow your partisan agenda SAD
how do you live with yourself spinning and lying to America it's transparent and SAD!
you are a sad excuse to America, Americans and humans how you lie and scam transparently
can you even look in the mirror - you truly are a disappointment to the country
you can really post things like this after what you did last year with the nomination SAD
you are a child!
And you will never be elected, #BidenRule #DealWithIt
GO NUCLEAR.
you're the biggest hypocrite in American politics
I think you spelt MERRICK GARLAND wrong Mitch
HAHA No he didn't.
