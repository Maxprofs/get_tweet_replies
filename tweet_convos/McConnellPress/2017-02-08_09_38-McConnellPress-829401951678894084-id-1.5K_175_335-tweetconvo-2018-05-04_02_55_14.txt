.@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Perhaps because they're grossly underqualified, billionaire bigots with horrible conflicts of interest? #GOPdontcare
I have yet to see the GOP risk national security by putting politics before the American peoples safety.
how bout Russian hacking. Knew in Oct but mccon refused 2 let it be published so his guy wins!
LOL! I bet u think the Russians interfered in the Superbowl 2 don't ya? What a lie that is!
that's a pretty idiotic tweet deplorable, but then again,  expected 
not as idiotic as believing Russia interfered in our election
again another head in sand silly statement. It's been proved little girl. #deplorableshavenoclue
at least I'm not in the party of treason... Demoncrats are #evil
i bet there is a reason for that
GEEZ I wonder why? Hmmm.? He is going to kill us and all Republicans care about is policy! U should B ashamed of yourself.
Because he, and you/your cronies are the most corrupt EVER
That is serious BS! You need to go nuclear on all his nominees! The self-centered dems are putting our safety at risk!
@McConnellPress @POTUS  So-called President Trump has appointed the most incompetent cabinet in history. Shame!
pretty sure Obama had to wait till April
Trump should have selected candidates who can get their paperwork in on time, are qualified, and without conflicts.
lies.
And for very good reason.  We need to ensure appropriate vetting and avoid corruption or security risks.
.@SenateMajLdr .@McConnellPress .@POTUS This is the Democratic process in action. Obstruction is legal. #YouWorkForUs
That's because none of his nominees are qualified. Most of them bought their nominations.
unacceptable.
stop making poor choices
because of issues with their ability to do their job and serve, lets not even go into #ConflictoIntereses but hey $ 4 u
Good! We need better candidates. These are the worst in history!!!
Maybe he should pick folks who are actually qualified then.
They are unqualified.  Pick someone else!  BTW, learned obstruction from GOP!
@McConnellPress @POTUS 
Warren shutdown was disgraceful--would not have happened if she were a man
@McConnellPress @POTUS Speed it up Mitch, forget them! Nuclear option for Scrotus!
- you're not whining, are you? He also has the least experienced and most conflicted cabinet since WASHINGTON!
should have picked competent people.
that should be an indication of how opposed most of us are to them. #ResistTrump #midterms2018
We NEVER want the bastards confirmed, The people just cannot afford you. We need a Congress for the people.
You are the guy who wrote the book on obstruction, even though Obama nominated qualifed ppl. these nominees are unfit!
Not true.  Look at President Obama's term and what you did.
@McConnellPress @POTUS Maybe because all of his nominees are classless rich kids with no common decency?
Maybe because it is the worst cabinet since George Washington?
I wonder where they picked up the habit to decline or slow the hearing of @POTUS nominations Oh Wait, that was YOU!! #Garland
Trump should take twice as long as George Washington give the moral quality of his picks
liberals are like ticks all over anything republican trying to suck life out of country
because they do not care about the people just protesting like their people in the streets
# the Repubs have a GREAT opportunity. Keep up the momentum!! Together we will # MAGA!!! 
and don't act like we didn't see how you behaved with President Obama.  Now you act appalled and avoid questions.
stop spreading lies
you know this is not true.  Obama, Clinton, and W. Bush didn't have their cabinet until April/May.  Stop lying
# Continue to follow the Constitution and laws of our great nation with Civility and Trust in God Keep up the great job
George Washinton never told a lie! THat's more than this GOP administration.
well then maybe POTUS should have nominated ethical, upstanding, honorable grown ups
it's also the wealthiest cabinet ever, go figure
Maybe that's because they don't know anything about the jobs they're appointed to. And they're shitty people.
Yes. Beacuse they suck.
Because unlike you and your cronies, there are actually people doing their job of protecting the citizens they represent.
There is a major reason for this...
Perhaps that's because @POTUS nominated such horrible people? Just sayin.
yeah because they are the worst nominations ever.
You mean people don't want to hire unqualified, corrupt applicants for their job openings? Curse you democrats!!!
The suggested cabinet members did not get their info in to check points before inauguration or Conflicts of interest
Plus, not naming people until January doesn't give them time to do what they have to do.  So don't blame @TheDemocrats
actually this is untrue.  Look up how long y'all took to confirm Obama's cabinet and get back to me.
that's because nominees are fools w no proven capability to do their jobs. Americans expect @gop to produce qualified peeps
LIE!!!! Absolute fucking lie that can be fact checked in five minutes. You have no shame sir.
fake news
Now that we know Dems will obstruct/slow walk everybody, just line up the rest and skip the hearings w/up down vote.
obviously not true
Maybe it's because they shouldn't have been nominated in the first place. Duh
.@SenateMajLdr To be clear, that's a LIE. And @POTUS got it from YOU. Clinton cabinet confirmed 3/11. Bush Sr. 3/17. Obama holds record 4/28
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL TERRIBLE, Tortoise-face!
I can't begin to imagine how hard it is on all of you. Warren proclaimed they (dems) are now the obstructionist party.
considering you were around in Washington's time; you'd remember he wasn't big on lying
Because he is INCOMPETENT at getting his nominees vetted in advance as Obama did!
What is your point?
Garland comes to mind. When radical people are nominated they have to be vetted. That's the way it works. Deal with it.
because @SenSchumer sucks and is nothing more than a petulant child
This is because every single one of them (except possibly Mattis) is incompetent, bought, or both.
Uh, this is a good thing, since all the ones who have been confirmed so far are dangerous and unstable.
So you let MEN read the same letter for which you castigated Warren? Your sexism is showing...
Is it because so many are unqualified and/or blatantly corrupt? Obama nominated knowledgeable people not billionaires
Just move on with these issues and leave dems in the dust. Lets keep Rep in control for at least 8 years.No excuses.
Well Mitch, if they would turn in their ethics paperwork on time the Dems wouldn't have to question so much would they
Iâ€™ve assembled cabinets from IKEA with higher IQ.
The villany you
teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
will better the instruction.
you mean like the @GOP slow walked every @Scotus nominee? Talk about double standards.
Yep, not doing such a great job bringing good candidates to the table. Business 101 - hire good people.
That is because they R as dangerous to Americans as the president and yourself. Grow up & grow a pair & stand up for us
Use the nuclear!  You need Gorsuch confirmed right away!
maybe it's the poor choices.  And maybe they took a page out of your playbook that wouldn't consider Garland
Payback sucks, huh?
If you don't like political games, don't play them!
@POTUS
- I wonder why... Could it be that they're not qualified?
Radical Dems continue obstruction, most in History,they keep loosing votes
I would think that would b important but I guess not.Taking care of billionaires is a priority while we struggle.Priorities?
A kindergartner would b more qualified.I was told this administration would look out 4 people like me&I would think the poor 2
She's an under qualified billionaire.I'm just a middle of the road conservative, lower end of middle class nobody.
because they suck
not true, but facts AMIRITE
Your man sucks. He is anti-America and mentally unstable - people do not trump like you do. Get over it. @POTUS
that's telling Congress what people think of the nominees
because  he nominated unqualified jacks. DeVos bought you and the GOP. Matthis got through because he is qualified.
But he has Kellyanne hawking Ivanka's wares from the White house...outrageous!
maybe you guys need to open your history books and stop spreading #alternativefacts
Mitch you are the problem,   getting back the grief you gave President Obama . You are the poster boy for term limits.
Obama's last cabinet member was on the Job  in APRIL! Stop making shit up!
The GOP rushes to fulfill DT fantasies and their own. Nominees don't reflect what THE PEOPLE believe in. TRAINWRECK4GOP
- that's b/c they r the worst in history & many refused to complete ethics paperwork or disclose financial conflicts.
you would remember you are that old
cry me a river mr 1 term President. Just wish u would pay attention to a pres who is flaunting the norms! DIVEST or go!
Is it because of all those grizzly bear attacks?
maybe that's because they're all incompetent & unworthy just like yourselves. You ought be ashamed of your behavior.
Because you and your white male cronies spent 8 years not governing. So we're giving you a taste of your own medicine.
Your statement in prior years came back to haunt you
This is a lie, actually.
worst choices ever who have ma$$ive conflicts of interest and don't complete paperwork.   Can't imagine why. #NoDAPL
because his nominees are swamp rats
maybe because 99.9% of them are unqualified.  Ever think of that?  Maybe buying a seat at the table doesn't work.
Perhaps the president should have nominated more qualified and capable individuals then.
well that's because the nominees are not suitable cabinet members. Billionaries and inexperienced individuals.
Because of his choices. Where are the experienced, well rounded choices.
@McConnellPress @POTUS amazing how you speak about obstruction after what you did to Pres Obama
Could it have anything to do with how many fewer Cabinet positions there were then? #LouisvilleLiverSpot #KYJellyfish
George Washington had a grand total of 4 in his cabinet. I know Republican math is "SPECIAL", but 5 is LESS than 4 TWIT
So unqualified people who want to destroy departments he chose them to run should just be rubber stamped? No @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump
AND the least qualified! Yay!
Racist Sessions, plagiarizing bribing DeVos, fracking Pruitt, insider trading Price. You have a shitty cabinet choice
we waited 1 year for you to do nothing about Merrick Garland so stop complaining.
.@SenateMajLdr @POTUS I seem to recall you vowing to resist Obama every step of the way. How's it feel to be on the other side of this ploy?
please ask God for forgiveness...tomorrow is not promised. Donald is the Devil. Don't be evil Like him. #TStime
you're full of it turtle neck.
waaaaaaa.  Aren't you the fragile little snowflake.
Good
Wait, were you in your shell the last 8 yrs when obstruction was the rule of the land?
Well Sen. When you work with idiots there, DEMOCRATS, they intend to slow things up. Vote them out. Start 2018! DO IT!
because they are corrupt, inept, and refuse to fill out ethics paperwork
Because, like you POTUS sucks. #TURTLE
why are you repeating this lie? It's verifiable that what u are saying is false
@McConnellPress Obama went much longer and couldn't get a Supreme Court consideration. Hypocritical. Think we don't notice?
maybe because most of them are terrible picks? Don't you wonder why so many Americans are upset? Man up and address it.
because none were vetted and few fit for the job. A$$ kissers all of you.
Because t
ey are unqualified & have not submitted basic ethics paperwork, plagiarized documents & left off information.
conflict ls of interest, qualifications and that whole "contributions" to the senate thing. Worst cabinet ever
Alternate reality. Your lies will be judged.
who's fault is that, really?  what have you all been doing for the last 11 months?
is slow confirmation of historically bad candidates something to blame on Democrats?
At least they are having hearings, which is more than I can say you did for Merrit Garland.  Such a disgrace.
what can be done to accelerate the confirmations?
watching you on the Senate floor s/b R rated , I wouldn't want children to realize this is how govt works. SHAME ON YOU
Getting a grasp on what obstructionist politics are like, are we? You Republi-cons invented it. Get used to MORE of it!
In 2018 GOP swamp will be drained
So maybe if the choices actually had something to offer the positions it would go faster.
Not true, you liar! We will not be gaslighted by you or the craven cowards you lead.
because his choices of nominees are not properly vetted. You R have an agenda. Not what's good for America! #2018
Hey hypocrite, get facts, stop lying and retire.
... and none of them are qualified.
self interest is not serving the USA public where are the champions on his team?
How dare you criticize a @POTUS administration as incompetent and slow. Washington didn't have to Make America great again!
LIE!  @SenateMajLdr Just because @POTUS uttered the words does not make it true.
because you and your party are not listening to what THE PEOPLE want, only what serves you and your wallets best
Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland.
The Democrats are money grabbing dividers. They want nothing good for our people.
Not surprising when you nominate a cabinet of persons completely unqualified for their jobs.
@McConnellPress @POTUS Are u crying about this, little special ? Recall your joy in obstructing Prez Obama's picks??
remember that cat Merrick Garland? How long did he have to w... oh yeah.
