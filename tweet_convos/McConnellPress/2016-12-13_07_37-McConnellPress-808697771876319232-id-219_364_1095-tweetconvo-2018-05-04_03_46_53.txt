He will also bring conflicts of interest -- Russia & #climatechange to start. @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump
@PatDollard @realDonaldTrump I hear you and Cornyn are trying to sabotage the obamacare repeal.  Why?
I think you need to step down. You have almost destroyed the Repub. side of Senate your wife an influence?
He will also bring decades of partnership with Russia at a time when our country's intel thinks hacked US.
. Youre kidding!! Tillerson is an Exxon Mobil oil baron w/ deep ties to Russia and no foreign policy experience.
Can you say Conflict of Interest?
way to go senate leader. Get behind Trump & his cabinet. They are all strong leaders MAGA.
Thanks for getting on board.

You are a two face.. So glad you aren't a senator for my state! Can't handle a liar!
#factsmatter @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
yes another member of cabinet whose big fan of Russia and our supreme leader Putin. Thanks GOP.
This clearly points out what a complete sellout you are. Grow a pair and stand up.
good to hear! We need experience
@SpeakerRyan You're engaging in a treasonous coverup. This will be your legacy if you don't act immediately.
You better be climbing on the Trump Train!
@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Rex is bad! Supports carbon tax.  Climate change is a fraud!
.@SenateMajLdr not hearing this Foghorn Leghorn's voice is impossible
all of you are Joe Wilson
#Tillerson will be Vlad's date for the White House Ball #Trump is going to throw for the Russians.
Finally a heavy duty SoS...
MITCH NEEDS TO CHARGED WITH HIGH #TREASON AGAINST THE REPUBLIC AND DRAIN THE REST OF THE #SWAMP
He also has years of experience being #PutinsPuppet, just like you and Treasonous Trump.  #LockHimUp
The Libtard's are upset, so Mitch did something right.....
Did Putin write that tweet for you? We need an INDEPENDENT investigation of Russian interference !
mc connell glad something positive ty

@veganvecoh @realDonaldTrump if the left is crying he's good
You poor confused man. Plz! grow a spine.
You can't be a suckup to everybody.
stop endorsing my moves! You're the reason #congress is awful. #draintheswamp #termlimits PATHETIC
about time, get to work.
apparently you don't care about our democracy if you help confirm Tillerson.  shame on you
- What a pathetic endorsement for such a lousy pick by @realDonaldTrump. Time to retire Mitch.
You deserve each other
Yep, he has been friends with Putin for a long, long time.
Blatant hypocrisy. Russia meddling needs bipartisan grp. Stunning you don't agree. Party b4 country - evil
hopefully they all find their way to jail
seriously, how do you sleep at night. Why does GOP purposely want to hurt America? 11% approval rating wasn't your sign?
you r clearly suspect being involved with the Russian coup. 75% of Americans did not vote for Trump. Forget that if you want.
Trump is aligning US to Russia, aligning US to war crimes. America will be a fascist nation under him  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38301629 …
You're full of it Mitch. TERRIBLE CHOICE! It's all about money and wealth and you're in the middle of it.
Not his buddy do ur job what u r supposed  2 do investigate Trump/ RUSSIA from Dec 15, 2015
You got 2 be freaking kidding
@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump tax cuts now!
I don't often like what you do in the Senate. But thanks for backing Tillerson. Confirm all Trump's pics.
well nuts. If GolbalistScum McConnell likes Rex then it must be bad for America.
Your support for 1) an unqualified crony and a 2) Russian stooge is completely outrageous. Shame on you.
@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Senate Majority Leader McConnell you and Senator Paul need to stop this garbage HRC is in on
Yup yup Make Russia Great Again! 
TRAITOR! RESIGN!
Notice how all the Russian trolls have moved over to your twitter account
make sure your upcoming probe into Russian cyber security is focused on the that not election tampering.
Mitch you can't honestly believe that. You're smarter than this.
ALL RESPECT. IMO can't have it both ways. Either for Trump publicly or "against"
We want a statesman, not another CEO. Putin is NOT our friend, so no pals of his qualify for SOS.
I know you are a staunch Republican but I thought you were at least for America Not Russia.
Booooo B*itch McConnell. Term limits are coming. Merry Christmas. MAGA or gtfoh.
