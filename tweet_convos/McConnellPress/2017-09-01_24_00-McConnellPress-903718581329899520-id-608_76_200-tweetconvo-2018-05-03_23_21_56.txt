American Working Families, you can stop the 5th Generation Welfare recipients who are considered families with multiple fathers etc....

Don't play reverse Robin Hood games with taxes.
How can you talk about tax reform when we clearly around going to need billions to help Houston?
He don't want to hear about shelling money out to anything
2009 Tax Amnesty  top 15 cos cut 20,000+ jobs, most repatriated money went into shareholders & executives pockets.
We want the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare promised for seven years by GOP, Way before President Trump. We do want tax reform

That's Ryan, McConnell, Rubio, and Walker. All of them got Russian $$$. No wonder they are so quiet.

TRAITOR. DISGRACE

He hasn't had his cataracts done yet so he can't read anything but his bank statement

Your move, Congress. #DACA 
That would be the first time. It won't happen
You will never have a hope of being able to wash the stink of @realDonaldTrump from the @GOP unless you split from him & start to act!
Bullshit. You've made it clear you don't give a damn about this nation, its people, its lands. You've made your loyalties clear. Resign.
He needs a rally at his house call antifa
they'll all have to ask their moms first... They don't want to get grounded.
antifa ralling at his house would sure enough give him a heart attack and then we don't havta ask to resign n him say no
You have lost all support and credibility. If you actually cared about the country you would resign. #TrumpRussia #GOPCoverUp
Turtleneck isn't about to resign were gonna have to eject him
He can't even show his face in his home town or State and is hiding from his own constituents b/c he is so hated.
In Canada we tax the upper folks and reduce tax for our middle and lower class Canadians.
American RICH families, you mean to say.
OH, I'm sure you'll find 2 or 3 of your buddies to vote against it when the time comes...
RT if you agree we need to Reform Congress and get rid of Mitch McConnell.
What about #DACA since we're talking about keeping families together?
Why do I still get the feeling thst any tax cuts for middleclass will be minimal at best, and the biggest breaks will be for the top 2%
No more tax dodges for corporations and wealthy.  Middle class should not be asked to continue carrying them.
So that is why our 401k will be taxed and our mortgage deductions taxed to benefit wealthy corporations?
Don't buy your Bull for a second.
I don't think his wife does either
You mean rich American families? Reducing taxes for the wealthy at the expense of programs for the poor...
So you are going to tax American workers 401K's...how exactly does that keep American families at the "heart" of your plan?
Give it up Mitch - Your 1%ers tax reform will never help the working class and poor.  You are incapable of understanding what Americans need
For Christ's sake, talk to Schumer, Pelosi, Ryan. TAKE CHARGE! Don't stand like your wife, listening to his vile words! Do it, now!
How many dark $ donor$ (including internatl) have u taken $$ from? This is just 1 who's recorded. http://washingtonjournal.com/2017/08/04/new-report-reveals-mcconnell-ryan-took-millions-russian-oligarch-tied-putin/ …
Kinda like George Soros giving money to the Democrats , Ahh !
Tell us another whopper Mitch.
After his Kentucky bourbon
When I see it I'll believe it
U won't believe it cause u won't see it
Sounds like propaganda!  Support the facts alone.
He doesn't remember where the facts are
Corporations will not pay  more in wages because they save on taxes. Does Trump's companies pay more now because he has tax savings?
Congress, stand up to POTUS! McCain is right, Congress, exert your power. Trump is a clown marching us to destruction.
The man basically spat in all of you and your constituents faces and none of you did nothing but be silent.  what a shame on you all.
I'm trying to get antifa to hold a rally at his mansion
He could careless he moves slower than a snail to accomplish anything
AGREEING ON SOMETHING & ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS 2 DIFFRENT THINGS...



Do your job! We don't want Daca ended or go 2 war! Stop this insane man!
@DNC Support this man!!!!!
#RussiaCollusion
Start a #WeWillWork with #TRUMP Put your personal feelings aside and pass his agenda! We voted for & #LOVE @RealDonaldTrump #MAGA #USA #cnn
How are you helping US workers? You are not, I think. No platitudes. No position papers. Only facts. Prove me wrong.
He goes golfing to help the people out
Which families? 1%? Which plan? Remove every trace of our 1st black president, your healthcare only 12% wanted or a wall we already have?
Obama is a legend no matter what they do can't erase it from people's mind..turtleneck can't seem to get anything done so I wouldn't worry
Your concept of #taxreform keeps me awake at night.
I can assure you it doesn't keep him up though his snoring keeps his wife awake
Trump and the GOP are one. He is yours. You are his. Don't. Ever. Forget. That.
#FightSupremacy #IllegitimatePOTUS #Investigate #impeach #LockHimUp #TrumpObstructed #Resist #AntiTrump #antiracism #TheResistance
And don't get rid of DACA! Stop Trump b4 he kills us all w war w NK!
Labor Day. How are you helping US workers?? Promote Labor Unions, living wage, healthcare and other benefits??? Let's see this.
He's chilling out with his Kentucky bourbon complaining of excessive expectations
Then please do your job and pull the party together.
You talk a big game but do nothing.  We don't believe ANYTHING you say anymore.  Blah, blah, blah, blah
Protect us from this man. He hasn't changed. He is a liar and a bully . A narcissist. #ImpeachTrump #Impeach45 #UnFit2Rule #TrumpLies
Protect us from the assault everyday of the LIES LIES LIES. No government should lie like this to its people. Do your duty. He is a danger
@SpeakerRyan @GOP @WhiteHouse @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @WaysandMeansGOP

$150 a day of our money goes to this. 
You better get tax reform done if you want to retain control. HELP THE PRESIDENT  move country forward
yet another bot
A reminder it's American Worker's Labor Day.

Ma Joad's last words from the Grapes of Wrath.
And I just plain don't like you.
Can you pass a bill this year?
We needed Repeal & Replace Ocare. Our premium, before they left our county was $1,740.00 month for 2 healthy people. 12K deductible.
Let's see some follow through!
It'll be year's you have that kind of patience for turtleneck?
Like you did with Obamacare . You have lost all credibility.
Bullshit Turtle Man! Your plan is to destroy the middle class and poor families.
I really dislike you so much.  Don't you notice that most of the US would just like things get back to, you know, when  Obama was President
I am talking about Mitch McConnell
If u embraced Prez Trumps agenda &gave him ur FULL support, u would be respected by the vast silent majority rather than disrespected by all
We are at the heart of your plan. You're taking our money and giving it to the rich.
Where have been? He's putting in riches along with his pockets.i say we hold a protest at his home or should I say mansion
He's rode you all the way to the white house! Anyone in Kentucky still trust traitor McConnell needs their damn head examined..shame on you
Aww traitor Mitchell has something to say! Shame on you!!
If only.  #maga
How do you do that and also serve the wealthy? It can't b done
Yes it can he tunes us out and caters to wealthy and they have their fat cat dinners
#MuellerIsComing
Let's use Dwight Eisenhower's tax plan.
@SenateMajLdr is nothing but pro his pocket
A trained monkey would be a better president than .@realDonaldTrump https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/01/trumps-economy-is-doing-slightly-worse-than-obamas/?tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.748acd9ff73c …  #ImpeachTrump
Yeah yeah http://yeah.GOP  promises for the last 8 years are LIES. And you're lying now.
We do NOT want YOUR idea of Tax Reform. We TRUST & WANT Trump's plan for Tax reform. He CARES about ALL Americans. You care about just YOU!
Trump is worse.

KARMA: #RiggedElection gave Republicans #DonTheCon—who WILL #MAGA by exposing their #DeepState #ProsperityGospel #Swamp. 
All the while letiing people who cannot afford life insurance die.
Ohh now slow down #Mitch - follow your #Obamacare -insurance company sell out slow walk
Reaganomics by another name is still a failure.
You need to resign and put a conservative in your leadership.
Turtleneck shouldn't be picking anything out, look at his ties.hevwont resign theirs money to be made with the wealthy to hell w peasants
Please work with our President..Americans love him.
@maddow @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenDeanHeller @SenTedCruz @GOP Hate for Americans & Support for Your KGB Putin will Show Nov 2018
Do your job!! U see Trump is unstable! Get him out b4 he kills us all w war w NK and keep DACA. U will lose majority!
Too late for silly talk we've seen you in action for a long time you and the boys tying donor $ to congress' action are going down.
GO WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU KNOW, THAT GUY THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS 'ELECTED' AS THEIR PRESIDENT, REMEMBER HIM?
You and your ilk, are cruel greedy evil liars, who only care about lining your pockets with money.
We need to ditch you for someone that will work for the middle class
the democrats?
Rich families, or all families?  And what about those who have no family?  Are they shit out of luck?
A little less talk and allot more action
Well quit tweeting about it and sit down with both sides and hammer out a bipartisan deal that has half a chance of passing.
He's complaining of excessive expectations put on him apparently 7 years weren't long enough

lies, lies, lies it is all about special interest & 1 %!  Our people, infrastructure &future generations getting screw at end!
Pro wealthy only

Instead of giving 60 percent of new tax cuts to the richest Americans, we should expand the EITC to make up for decades of wage stagnation. 
Please Sir, go to a simple majority vote of 51.
Do you agree with President Trump? We can't trust you!
Don't talk about it...do it! @SpeakerRyan and @POTUS need to make this business and middle class tax cut/reform historic. 15% business only!
Trickle down & another recession.
Like your healthcare plan!
Lie, lie lie.
support TRUMP !!!!
Just words.  What you will do is try your best to reduce taxes for the rich.
Dear senator. Let's work on the agend so the history will place you high and remember that trump is good for American and for GOP
You will screw us again
Pass exactly what POTUS is asking you to pass. Dont THINK! You have already proven U R incapable of cohesive thought. Or, dust off ur resume

apparently you have no supporters.
The only way Americans will be better is when all old white guys retire from congress


Your a lying asshole McConnel! We saw that with attempt to repeal ACA. YOU AND RYAN OWN THIS MESS CALLED TRUMP! TIME TO RETIRE YOU JERK!
#Ditchmitch 
Your days are numbered.
Obombacare
Oh right as long as they are in the top 1%. U don't care squat about anyone who is in the lower 99%. WE ARE NOT STUPID! U R A JOKE!
Pro Growth, Pro Jobs, Pro worker. Interesting. List should be flipped around. The way you present the list is the new Trickle Down
And another recession
You need to get onboard with the Trump agenda.
Most r not paying but min or no tax. What we need is major Corp tax cut w/ reinvestmt requirmts to stimulate capit invest&jobs
Used to have faith that things like this would actually happen.  Seems like the can will still just be kicked down the road
Ditch Mitch!
Make sure you do it right & not like repeal and replace Obamacare
As long as those families make 1million or more per yr. #GOP agenda is to further enrich 1%
Please veto the  filibuster rule and get Trumps nominations through
U get the 'talking part' done.  U R weak and U R fired.  Hit the road!!!!!
Remember Dems/Schumer already stand against this. Go 50 in senate
Baloney! #GOP only cares about the 1% and corporations. The rest is smoke and mirrors and just plain #GOP lies.
Go Blow Mitch, too little too late.
Wealthy at the top of cuts, then corporations, all on the shoulders of hourly workers. NO to this plan, just as bad as healthcare "fix".
Your useless
YOU LIER AND HYPOCRITE PROOV IT
Get it done!
Raise taxes on the rich to fix our decaying infrastructure and put people to work.
Loyalty is admirable, and it's sad that ee only see loyalty from our household pets! Drain that swamp President Trump, 63,000,000 Love you!
I'm just getting ready for anothetr McConnell failure and another Rino backstabbing! Who's the backstabber this time?
Yeah, just like repeal Obamacare to help families. Tired of your words and no action. We control the Senate and u r wasting it!  DitchMitch
You will not do a damn thing to accomplish anything for American families.  Traitor
You're party and President have made the commitment to put the rich first and screw everyone else. You're not trustworthy
Let's C U do just that! Get "Trumps" tax reform bills through & on t books asap! Americans R tired of your slowwalk attitude towards RPres!
Let's reform congress by getting rid of Mitch #ByeFelicia
Your message won't get through until you do something about that hateful cheater in the WH.  Spoiler alert: he won't help you.
Here's the most important tax reform for Americans today:
Impeach him NOW
Stop talking about it & do ur job!!.u don't get it done, u don't get re-elected..u need to get behind r Prez & stop slow walking stalling
You're saying good words. Your actions belie them.
Still doing Trump's bidding, I see!You know,people aren't going to want to elect someone so closely aligned with #TrumpRussia next election.
Are you going to work w/POTUS or are you going to fight him,criticize,and deride him like you have doing.
No, we ALL need true TAX REFORM.  Quit pandering and DO SOMETHING.
@SenateGOP   A person with $7500 taxable income in 1980 pays 300%+ more FIT now. A person with $1M taxable income pays 50%+ less FIT now.
POTUS I think its time to sit down with Mitch & change the voting rules in the senate so we can get the agenda passed. please read this
That's the problem YOUR plan TOOK the heart out of ALL hard-working Americans while you made MILLIONS at our expense! We trust TRUMP's plan.
U MUST HEAR what 63MILL ppl voted @POTUS agenda=ppls agenda! STOP making donors decisions. WE WILL KEEP U accountable! @senateGOP @OANN @AP
I like your statement except "I will continue to work w/this Pres."...what have YOU done for 8 mo? Obstruct! @realDonaldTrump #URtoastin2020
Go away Mitch, and take your Rino traitors with you. Where's the wall, Obamacare repeal, and tax cuts?
Stop blocking Trump's agenda.
Mitch, you accused @potus of having unreal expectations of a republican-controlled House and Senate. #WeThePeople have the same expectations
Get to work. Support trump.
30 years of GOP "tax reform" has impoverished the middle class and enriched the 1%

...or focus on Texas ?
Mentioning heart & GOP together is oxymoron w/ emphasis on "moron". GOP is party of old sclerotic white rich guys who don't care @ citizens!
I hope it's not like your health care plan.
Get the job done for We the People now!
END DACA NOW!!!
