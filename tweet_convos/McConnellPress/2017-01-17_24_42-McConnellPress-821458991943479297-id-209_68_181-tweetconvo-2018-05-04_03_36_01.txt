Congrats to PRES TRUMP & the REP. MAJORITIES in the HOUSE & SENATE. Time to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
wow GOP needing help from BS accounts to get a positive response in their twitter feed
Happiest days in years, Trump won election & Friday getting sworn in. My Country is not turning socialist!
You will be begging for socialism after you experience unbridled capitalism.
No cupcake, we will NEVER  abandon principles of our Constitution. It's our turn to fix the mess
Better have a back-up plan, old man....if you have the resources!
You are a traitor to the United States of America.
SORE LOSER!!
Hahaha you are a true idiot.
Prefer to be a PROUD CONSTITUTION-LIVING AMERICAN than a LEFT-WING SOCIALIST. We Won!
Your guy is a Russian stooge, controlled by Putin. You are dumber than shit. You are so far from a patriot, it's ridiculous.
LMAO!  Keep it coming comrade!  I can handle it because WE WON!
Yes. You and Putin. Fly that Russian flag, dummy.

for the DEMON-CRATS !  HA HA LMAO
so comrade, does Russia pay per tweet or for whole day?
remembered as the WORST, lackluster inauguration in history. More protesters than celebrating guests. SAD! SO SAD!
Then why are so many people SO HAPPY!
Isn't it exciting how many people are flooding DC for the Women's March?! Historic, indeed, old man! #WomensMarchOnWashington
have fun with Donny. He promised not to touch S Sec Medicare Medicaid and he wants a health bill now? 6 years and no plan?

THANK GOD, THE REPUBLICANS NOW CONTROL BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS.

As we mourn the death of democracy, ethics, hope, and international respect.
Why is the entire cabinet full of ignorant Southern rednecks?  They're the only fools who would be dumb enough to get duped.
@HouseGOP sir, many of us are starting to wonder about your ability to lead! You spent your best days dividing our country!
You KNOW what Must be done for success & SCOTUS. Deep six filibuster. Reid changed rules , you can too. Not carved in stone or constitution
they'll be protesters more than anything else at the puppets inauguration. #RepublicanHypocrite #RepublicanValues
So true. Especially since most of them will be there for the #WomensMarchOnWashington! #notmypresident
It appears that Obamacare is just being rebranded as Trumpcare with some modifications...is this true?

Remember the Death of free and fair elections in America
you bet ... We will never forget, you POS! Lead destructionist ... Complete worthlessness! No, never forget!
@HouseGOP poorest attendance ever!!!
memorable? As disaster leading 2 total American ruin! You know terrorists are salivating right now, right? #Sad #UnethicalGOP
@notmypresident!

When the ppl. of kentucky find out you are eliminating their health insurance you will be voted out. Thank God
will you be on hand to personally revoke their healthcare or does that duty fall to an aide?
@HouseGOP repealing without replacing is ATTEMPTED MURD U EVIL EVIL man
you are shameless https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154978863478872&id=131182018871 …
Welcome to the week of the #WomensMarchOnWashington, residents of #Kentucky  McConnell must be so proud when you #resist
@SpeakerRyan Just thought I'd ask. Are you starting to feel uneasy knowing that Trump can launch nukes as of Friday?
it is a national day of mourning for most citizens

@HouseGOP you r an embarrassment to the south
I've heard there will recruiters at the inauguration from coal companies hiring miners, is this true?  The War On Coal over?!
Uber Fuhrer they are coming to protest! You Nazis will pay in 20!!

Just 1463 more days.
You have brought shame to our nation. Why have you abandoned the American People?
Right. On Saturday for the #WomenMarch. #Turtle #BoycotTheInnauguration #InsaneClownPresident #SpendNoMoneyOnInnaugurationDay
.@SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP Don't forget about the head of the Austrian Nazi Party!

@HouseGOP
@McConnellPress your orange thing is incapable of anything constructive, but you knew that. Problem is, you're no better.
The #emails subpoenaed by the FBI were more damaging than anything released by #Wiki. There's no proof #Russia hacked anything
And @HillaryClinton's Chief of Staff @HumaAbedin used Anthony Weiner's PC who was under FBI investigation for sexting a minor
Under CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA @HillaryClinton WAS FORCED to turn over all emails on her private server.
And in clear contempt of that CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA she and her lawyers still deleted 30,000 emails.
Still waiting for your Lord and Master Satan to take you away. Hopefully Soon™
@HillaryClinton had all of #SiliconValley at her disposal and something as simple as her own #email took her down #plainstupid
#Russia had zero influence on the outcome of this election.
Great
@McConnellPress  more will be marching Saturday across the country
Does LeaderMcConnel understand that Trump is receiving foreign benefits in VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 SEC. 9 OF THE CONSTITUTION??
How much are you paying people to show up? trump can't GIVE tickets for this travesty away. #toddlertrump #notmypresident
You screw over the people in your home state.  They are highly dependent on the ACA that you are so gleefully trying to repeal.  #KYTraitor
Friday will be a disgrace to this country.
TRANSLATION: @SenateMajLdr I'm a spineless inhuman coward who fleeces his own people #KentuckyVotersAreFuckingIdiots
#inauguration2017 will make this week one to remember as DC welcomes so many from across the country, including my home state, #Kentucky 
TRANSLATION: @SenateMajLdr #inauguration2017 wil mark the 1st time a POTUS is installed by Russia. #KentuckyNitwits
#inauguration2017 will make this week one to remember as DC welcomes so many from across the country, including my home state, #Kentucky 
I know thousands of people hope to see you on Saturday #WomensMarchOnWashington
Dude ,I hope they are bringing brand new white sheets for the occasion.
yes- the .@Womensmarch will be one to remember. Hope you hear us shout- we are NOT GOING BACK on civil rights. @UniteWomenOrg

Why is it that Repubs don't want to go by the same rules that they impose on others? U a 'friend' of Russia, too?
Kentucky mourns the days of having elected officials with integrity, dignity, and class that represented the people over $$$
hope no one gets sick while attending.
started his walk early to get there on time
will be so fun many will pee their pants and hookers.
all will remember you Sen as a traitor to the Founding Fathers dream as a man confined with self serving power
When's Putin arriving for the swearing in?

Remembered for the highest crowd of protesters?  Fully vet nominees including ethics offfice clearance. Country over party!
The same home state you promised would keep kynect while neglecting to tell them it was the ACA you just voted to repeal.
how can you continue to celebrate a man who disrespected your colleague and civil rights hero Rep John Lewis? #KyConstituent
You're a world class obstructionist and you get triggered at the slightest bit of obstruction. My sides hurt laughing at you
they are all coming for the #WomensMarch
memorable for being so lame
@JCCIC def gonna be a freak show u will never forget 
mcconnel i hope u 1  hav to look some1 in the eye & tell them they hav 2 die cuz u took their heathcare & didnt replace
You violated the US Constitution by not working with the past administration - & you expect congress *and us* to work w/you?NO
Dear @SenateMajLdr #TheResistance is growing! We are & will be doing everything in our power to make SURE you are not voted back in - EVER!
Oh yes it will but not why you think it will be.
You STOLE a Supreme Court seat and then want to cry foul when the Constitution isn't followed! WTH? You play partisan politics
WORST day in history as white supremacists, racists, bigots &  LIARS take control of our future and our LIVES! #TheResistance
Should the dems obstruct and do everything they can to make trump a 1-term pres like you intended for obama?
Yes, all those protestors flocking to the capital should get a hearty welcome. From a friend in Scotland, With love.
More protesting than celebrating. Keep treating Trump as normal & when he goes down so will you
You r a master of mealy mouthed tweets. Poetic really.
#InaugurationSoSpineless.
40 congressmen will not be there.  They should give Donald as much support as Republicans gave Pres. Obama
#CorporateownedBastards
You lie. No A list performers want to be associated with you and Trump.
I despise both of them and @SpeakerRyan - they LOVE playing partisan politics! The great divide!
History books will not be kind.  What will they say about Republican Congressmen who refuse to protect our Democracy from this
We do not celebrate the death of free and fair elections in America. Or the fact that Russia has their man in our White House.
They have NO IDEA what they have done.  I just saw a message from a Republican/she can't believe the Repeal & Medicare agenda!
I am shocked that any Citizen with integrity will attend the inauguration of Puppet  Trump.  Russia's man in our White House.
As it does every election. Now go look a veteran in the eye and tell them they don't deserve healthcare.
such the fool, when everything comes out on Mr trump the Republican party will be destroyed.
and the women who will march the day after and dwarf the crowds for #OrangeJuliusCaesar the @GOP crime family!
@JCCIC We are on our way!  Left KY this morning and about 2 hrs to go!  Thanks to your office for tickets!  Can't wait!
2017 Inauguration is LOW ENERGY!
You are so partisan and I predict that your embrace of Trump will come to haunt you!
No one will forget the first president put into office elected by Russia.No one will forget you helped cover it up.
Don't worry, no one is going to forget the week an orange ass-clown gets inaugurated.

honey please! They can't even give away the free seats who you fooling?
not going and not watching a lying, racist, immoral and unintelligent moron become Pres. Hope he's impeached on monday
shame on you! King conspirator against Obama. Willing to accept Birther Trump illegitimate presidency selected by Putin/Comey.
And @SenateMajLdr will be all made up for the occasion
you need to be thinking about saving ACA / Obamacare instead of dillydallying around.
does Putin get a nice seat way up front? TRAITOR !
It's the end of the world as we know it! Hope the GOP is happy with this egomaniac in charge creating total chaos. God help us
@McConnellPress the same rats.
Hopefully,  this Barnum &Bailey show will end with a huge impeachment. Fascist dictator in charge.
I think that is what they want! Many of us are thinking Pence would be worse! #LONGEST4YEARS ever!
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
what have you done for the state of KY other than embarrass the people? #republicans
.@SenateMajLdr your collusion w/ #Trump makes u a traitor, for which you'll someday be tried & convicted. Enjoy prison, food's great I hear
U r so pathetic. I assume Russia owns u too.
and to follow that up, I'm sure you're happy with all your white nationalist comrades
8yrs ago you did the most racist thing I have ever seen pledging to work against POTUS. had he been white u would never have
Yeah, a DAY OF INFAMY. IMMATURE, UNDIGNIFIED, CRASS.  GO, AMERICA!
YUP, one to not remember. Inauguration of an illegitimate person as president. We know you knew pre-election what was going on
Agreed, with all the Resistance & Protest going on against Racist ConMan Lying GrandBirther Trump, this inAug will b a Record.
Yes it will be overloaded with protesters for the self serving new POTUS #SAD
And we'll all be sure to vote Rs out in the next election.
Dark stain on History!
8 years ago let's make Obama fail. What goes around senator. Except @realDonaldTrump is a failure of your party.
Yes, indeed! We're all looking forward to attending the protest! #notmypresident #illegitimate #prisonformitch
you stole @POTUS @SCOTUSnom I hope dems block you and trump for four years
celebration for your wife's job,,,your so corrupt, ,how can you sleep at night, think the MAN on judgment day will believe?
.@SenateMajLdr One to remember, alright. A Russian puppet, racist, sex offender, bigot  embraced by the Senate Majority Leader becomes POTUS
Most will be there to protest, Sen McConnell. Better fasten your seatbelt.
Eh, nothing special going on this week. I wouldn't attend if you paid me to
Hope you're ready to get relentlessly booed daily, from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep in your terrarium
Enjoy your borscht.
True, I'll never forget the weekend the American dream became a gaping, fetid abyss (similar to your conscience).
How many Confederate and Nazi flags will we see at Trump inauguration. Here is one you should fly!
sure...then why ya giving away tickets everywhere?
we will remember this day in history as the day we all collectively lost our damn minds.
@McConnellPress I'd be interested to know their visit's intent. For or agin trump.
@McConnellPress the people trump is paying 2 fill seats will remember it bigly. Let's hope the bikers don't get out of hand.
#MinorityPresident #DonaldTramp
This is the most activity you've had in 8 years.  Make sure you stretch before exerting yourself
@McConnellPress #asshole #coward #paytoplay #gerrymandering
How many from Russia, Comrade McConnell?

Inauguration? No, we're calling it a wake. Time to mourn the loss of what once was a great country. The GOP and Trump have killed all hope.
Thank you 
first time Russian puppet has taken presidency.  Historic!
yes it will-be. There's a new sheriff coming to town and politicians better straighten up and do the people's work
So many protesters showing up to protest a person who won on the heels of hacking and fake news.
I'll be in the weed isle
WATCH LIVE: Gloria Allred Press Conference With Woman Suing Trump for Sexual Harassment
Not sexual harassment. She's suing for defamation. Delete your tweet and start over.
please stop forever
you know very few actually want to be there.  Hire more seat fillers
Trump is not to be normalized, there is nothing to celebrate, the opposite is true. Get out of your bubble.
It will definitely be one to remember. #GoldenShowerGate #PeePeeTape #nomandate
#acaworks #NoRepealWithoutReplace #medicare4all
You are right - one to remember.  Most coming though are to PROTEST!!
fuck me turtle daddy
You obviously know zero abt ACA. It has saved lives of millions. CHD kids. #obamacare @SenateMajLdr
