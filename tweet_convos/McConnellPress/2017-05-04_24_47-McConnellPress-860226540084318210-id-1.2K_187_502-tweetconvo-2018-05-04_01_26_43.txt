And replace it with a piece of legislation that strips the rights of women, denies coverage of preexisting conditions and hikes premiums?
Stop reading fake news. The bill protects people with preexisting conditions.
Until they can't afford the cost increases. Access to insurance is not the same as coverage.
So has the Republican version of health care.  It supports the rich and turns away the poor.  You might as well just remove it too!
WAIT UNTIL THE PEOPLE SEE YOUR PLAN!! YOU SHOULD START RUNNING NOW!!!
No...YOU have failed the American People.
I think you are out of touch with reality and your constituency.
@foxnews Write a provision requiring all Congress & dependents to enroll in Bronze plan w/high deductible & no dr/hosp within 20 miles.Done!
Spewing the same old doesn't make it correct. It is obvious that you do not give a crap about people and their health care plan! AHCA - NO!
No it hasn't - produce those millions of people and see how they feel about pre-existing (I bet most have a pre-existing condition) No faith
Make it better. I can find NO sound reason to tear it apart. I could suggest it's related to hating any action by our 1st AAmerican  pres...
Obamacare saved me... #fixit
YOU HAVE FAILED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. #IndependentInvestigation #trumprussia #Impeach45
You're unacceptable, Mitch.  Your whole sick GOP crew is unacceptable, and the flood of hate for your party will wash you all away.
The only "pain" cause by Obamacare is to people like you who can't stand successful, intelligent, capable minorities.
No, you have.
YOU have failed the American people #SinglePayer
You would rather people die, shameful.
ACA didn't fail me but the HACA plan will kill me #preexistingconditions #LupusAwarenessMonth
McConnell has failed the American people by continuing on with Russiangate coverup due to wife part of Trump's administration! @MSNBC
YOU are failing the American people. FIX ACA. NO WALL. Independent Investigation on Russia/Trump collusion. DO THE RIGHT THINGS! Not party
Your corrupted Mitch
You mean "saved" not "failed". You Senator have failed miserably as a leader.
Insurance companies profits and tax credits should not be the driving force behind a healthcare bill.
As a Republican I'm asking you to listen to constituents and experts and do as little harm as possible to Americans healthcare.
Certainly has not failed the millions who NOW HAVE HEALTH COVERAGE for the first time every.  But, hey, facts are alternative, right?
Go ahead @McConnellPress and repeal ACA the #GOP will burn, you didn't win the #Majority vote.  The #PEOPLE will #vote you out.
You are a coward who does nothing but obstruct the
Where is the diversity on the Healthcare fiasco you are going to craft?
what about millions helped by ACA-1000s in KY-fix it don't burn it down! & though i'd gain from tax cut lets use the $ to help cover people!
@McConnellPress just LIKE You Mitch
PAIN?!  How dare you speak to "pain" when you have insurance we pay for.  Have a Town Hall and you'll hear about "pain".
Because you guys could give a crap about the people it truly affects. You have got to know you are the next casualty in the next election.
You are not helping the people and why are there 13 males on the healthcare group some who expanded coverage in their states and NO WOMEN?
Yes- the status quo IS unacceptable!!!  How about including Sen Collins? Or is that too scary for you?
So why is Congress so determined to hold onto it for themselves?
Except that it hasn't, it isn't and you know it. Are you really going to take Kynect away now that it has helped so many of your voters?
Alllll white men deciding health care. Why no women? It's no wonder being a woman is considered a #preexisting condition. #evil #healthcare
Now that #Ryancare is in the #Senate to repeal #Obamacare it's still  #Trumpcare but is also now #McConnellcare you own it #McConnellcare
Ur a liar.
U have failed the American people!Ocare can be tweaked but repubs just want to brag about repealing it & lowering
the taxes of the wealthy.
just found out today I will be losing my doctor next month Praying I will find a new one 
The GOP has failed the American people by choosing a tax cut for the rich over life saving healthcare. You are the failure.
Yeah, it's provided poor people with care they never had.  That's a shame.
13 GOP white men on healthcare is not a good start. You better have some women &diversity( minorities&Dems) on this committee.
You, sir, have failed the American people. You have lied, cheated, and stolen from us. You should step down and get out of our lives
It really busts ur balls that a blk guy did better for the ppl in your state than u ever have, doesn't it? So, punish them? Yea, good call.
You are truly a disgrace: 13 men and no women working on health care! What % of the population is women! Get a clue old man!
When Samantha Bee called you a chinless dildo, she was being too nice.
FISA Warrant on you! I love it~ great day for America watching you go to jail- You chose treason over country~~TRAITOR
YOU have failed the American People-resign.  #SurrenderMcConnell
Change to single-payer healthcare insurance. House version was a disgrace.  Every American should have affordable healthcare insurance.
I include Joe Manchin.
So now the ball's in you court. We have faith in you getting this done quickly.

You are right McConnell & you will fail the American people if you don't get new healthcare in place in 2017. Let's don't have two failures.
@VP @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @KellyannePolls Voters counting times Rs say ACA DISASTER, FAILURE, COLLAPSING.
@GOPLeader @SenateGOP @Reince45
@HouseGOP @TomPriceMD @OMBPress @BudgetGOP  Voters counting times Rs say ACA DISASTER, FAILURE, COLLAPSING.
Pelosi, Schumer, Obama put a Trillion $ on the Poor, & Now they're Mad  at GOP for Eliminating it.  GOP fights for the Poor/middle income.
Why is Rand Paul not on the healthcare committee? You left out women and a doctor? Truly bizarre choices.
cancerous, venereal barnacle on the back of America's balls for so long? If it does, it might be worth it's catastrophic impact on HC & econ
McCuntall, all $138bil (Upton/Long photo op) won't cover $330bil cost, will it cover getting rid of pre-exist cond of you being a...
Please be the grownup in the room. This will be your legacy. Please **FIX** Obamacare. 
Don't touch the idiotic House plan.
You are failing the American people !!! You-->
ACA didn't fail you did
you seem to think this country is called United republicans of American, instead of the United States of America. Any thing for the rich
There was no pain, if you would have worked to make it better, but you set out to destroy, so your rich would get 700 million per household.
I love it when you use your big boy voice, my love, Mitch McConnell, father of my frog children
Appropriate for the general welfare equally throughout the USA not let states decide. The AHCA is unconstitutional
NO IT WAS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO ME AND MY YOUNG SONS!! Except for ACA - preexisting we had nothing! How dare u!
The status quo is unacceptable. The pain caused by the GOP is real for millions of Americans. We must repeal and replace Republicans like u.
Stop lying about the ACA.  Shame on you.
Sir, 7 yrs of Obama Care have taken all savings. We are 64 and wife with Parkinsons. $ gone now. Please Help
You, and your Republican conspirators, are unacceptable. I can't wait to vote you all out! #RepealAndReplaceRepublicans
You're going down, did u see what happened to LaPen today?

Universal healthcare is what Americans deserve -you vile, self serving millionaire lobbyist! How dare you harm people that need it most.
REAL MEANING: Status quo unacceptable. @GOP to #MAGA w/ #trumpcare designed 2 take US back 2 1950s & strip maternity from essential benefits
#Kentucky is an #Obamacare success story, but McConnell and Republicans call it Kynect. Now they are taking this coverage away from citizens
Price for McConnell to vote against ACA: $3.7 million from healthcare cos. Center for Responsive Politics list here https://www.opensecrets.org/news/issues/healthcare …
2/ Women need to be on the committee. What is this misogyny white men deciding healthcare?! Women have different healthcare needs than men.
You're wrong Senator. There are problems w ACA FIX DO NOT REPLACE! RepCons did nothing but oppose @POTUS44 for 8 yrs. House bill is travesty
71a) Russian elite invested nearly $100 million in Trump buildings http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/ … … via @SpecialReports
The pain of losing #Obamacare is unacceptable! It saved lives if U listen to the people.
RETWEET IF YOU AGREE

Make no mistake. #TrumpCare is an act of #Terrorism. #TrumpCare is an act of #HybridWar, designed to kill and confound. #TrumpRussia 
Your failure to guarantee affordable care for ALL will kill thousands and be your political demise! Country over Party!

Looking forward to a single payer system, then. That's the only truly acceptable replacement. Get insurance off the backs of the employers.
Obama never grabbed pussy. He has respect for ppl the opposite of the womanizer you endorse.
This is you right now
Life saving Obamacare helped many in KY, the welfare state, including my brother. Taking from poor 2 give 2 rich. Taking lives. Shameful!
@McConnellPress KARMA is b*tch Mitch and @realDonaldTrump are gonna wear it so well You dipsh*t devils
You will have BLOOD on your hands
BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY YOU TAKING AWAY MEDICAL BENEFIT FROM ALL AMERICANS
Sen Collins proposed a bill so is clearly interested in solving current health care issues.  WHY ISN'T SHE IN THE WORKING GROUP?
Go get em Mitch.we are with you. Get it done please. We (why are not getting subsidies ) canny pay $15k for deductibles too much longer

You are just another puppet for Trump. Americans are not experiencing pain from Obamacare. The ACA is not a terrible bill.
#healthcareforall
You better get it right in the senate or your party is dommed for a very long time! You're not too feeble to recall what happened to Dems!
You gave yourselves a tax cut while sentencing citizens to death, do you feel good about this? How do you feel about the kushners selling vs
You are horrid
The question remains. Is it not more painful to let people die because they can't get affordable healthcare? You screwed us over. Bigly.
Totally agree with you on Obamacare-----however increasing senior premiums times 5 is harsh.  Will lose us a lot of senior votes
You don't say?  That's only one part of the bill as well.....
Are U not ashamed ever? U r by far the most despicable creature in Wash.May U never find eternal rest.May U spin in ur grave at top speed
Hey, you mealy-mouthed twit.  How dare you call yourself "leader"?   You couldn't lead yourself out of a cardboard box.


For pete's sake--you couldn't have even one woman on your committee to write new healthcare bill??? Clearly a group of misogynists!
How the hell would you know? #Liar #FakesNews #Corrupt #Racist #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
you have no shame
i just threw up in my mouth a little while reading this.
You, your party and the president have lied to the American people about ACA!! Improve ACA don't repeal!!
No you have failed Senator McConnell! You have failed to listen to your constituents who do NOT want ACA repealed!!!
You have also failed to include women on the healthcare panel in the senate!!
No Senator you have failed! You and your Party have failed to listen to your own constituents! ACA has not failed!
Investigate Mitch for treason
Thanks for assembling a panel of 13 white men to revise the House's bill. That diversity will surely address the needs of all Americans
If you can count to ten, guess what? You REALLY have no soul.
You need to stand in front of a mirror and say that and see if you can look at yourself for ten seconds.
Justify this you repellent codger...
If people are dying before they can collect social security because they don't have insurance, that's one in the win column for republicans
Enjoy the tax cuts! People are living too long anyways!
No, that pain was there before ACA, just now they can have a Dr. look at it for them because they have insurance now.
