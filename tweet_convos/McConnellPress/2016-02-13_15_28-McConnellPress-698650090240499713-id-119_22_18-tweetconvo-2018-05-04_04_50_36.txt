@McConnellPress  do your job for once, and work to confirm a new justice. Stop being an obstructionist
@hamiljc @McConnellPress He is doing his fucking job by refusing to let the president to nominate a fucking post Constitutional Justice .
@DinobotPrime @McConnellPress watch your language, the Constitution call for the President to nominate a justice, take a civics class
@hamiljc It is the job of the Senate to tell him his nominee is not good enough and he can GTH.
@DinobotPrime @hamiljc If he or she is unqualified. NOT because you don't agree with them or because you don't like the President.
@pu5erfish @hamiljc See Bush judicial nominees  particularly Estrada or Reagan's particularly Bork
@andsat @pu5erfish @hamiljc Why, the Democrats don't like that payback is a bitch? Welcome to Politics 101, amateur.
.@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress We, the people, have already spoken on SCOTUS via the 2012 re-election of Pres Obama.
And McConnell delivers the hammer 
@Kat4Obama @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress And the American people have spoken on SCOTUS via the 2014 elections .
@DinobotPrime @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Dems never turn out adequately in midterms. That has to change.
@Kat4Obama @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Guess what, both sides will turn out in large numbers this time.
@DinobotPrime @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress General elections always bring out the big numbers.
@McConnellPress Although I respect people, but legal system& laws have to be reformed soon. I need my rights& money back.
@McConnellPress now it's time for the sitting "twice elected" president to nominate a replacement
@MarkMillerBiz @NoToPlutocracy @McConnellPress Twice elected non citizen?
@McConnellPress Stand up for once for the PEOPLE. Stay steady refusing Obama to select the next SCOTUS
@McConnellPress the public voted for Obama, not you, or your party!
@McConnellPress Be STRONG and block ALL Obama Supreme Court nominations.  Give Harry Reid a taste of his own medicine!
@McConnellPress GOP? grand old party? Should be GOO! Grand Old Obstructionist!  Which the accronym is what this country is turning into. GOO
@McConnellPress Funny last election idiots like Mitch said they are going to change for the better yet still doing the same stuff.

@McConnellPress “In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.” ~Thomas Jefferson STAND FIRM!
@McConnellPress haha. Was ok 2 confirm regan's kennedy nomination in final yr. But 4 some reason, not obama.

@McConnellPress Does McConnell believe the constitution only applies when it suits him? http://democrats.senate.gov/2011/05/18/selected-statements-from-republican-senators-on-the-constitutionality-of-filibustering-nominees-and-the-deference-owed-to-the-presidents-nominees/ … #Scalia
@McConnellPress @POTUS @cnn @msnbc @ABC You need to do your job and put to a vote whomever the President nominates, WHOMEVER
@McConnellPress You are an embarrassment to the US Senate and this country by outright attempting to change the US Constitution over SCOTUS!
@McConnellPress To be clear, President Obama was elected by majority of American people, has the right to appoint another Justice, and Will.
@McConnellPress if you want the american people elect SCOTUS, you are throwing away the constitution!  Hello!
@McConnellPress The Senate has forgotten that they are public servants.  Follow the Constitution, please!
@McConnellPress Last thing USA needs is Obama to taint SCOTUS for a generation by appointing another liberal Justice #StopObamaAppointment
@McConnellPress @McConnellPress awesome. There is hope. Please tell me that The Senate is in session
@McConnellPress
. @McConnellPress the American people spoke when they elected Obama...TWICE. The POTUS will do his job and fill the vacancy.
@McConnellPress Even the suggestion that this should be left to the next president betrays the hypocrisy in your pose of governance.
@McConnellPress 

Sen. McConnell: American people will participate in SCOTUS nomination. They elected Obama twice.
@McConnellPress 1st he signs a letter that borders on treason. Now he subverting the constitution by asking for no appointment to the court.
@McConnellPress The people spoke. Obama is in office. Remember, Reagan appointed a judge in his last year. #scotus
@McConnellPress how embarrassing. Good Lord.
@McConnellPress any senator or congressman not willing to stop an appointment should give their pay to a homeless vet because its undeserved
@McConnellPress if the folks in the Senate can't hold down their chairs for 11mos for the Constitution & six figures, our country is doomed.
@McConnellPress if Mr McConnell means what he says, senate had better not recess before inauguration. Soldiers deploy 13 Mos & work 7 a week
@McConnellPress You're just an obstructionist. You've been denying the people a voice for years!
@McConnellPress #gofuckyourself hypocrite
@McConnellPress Beware of a recess appointment by Obama; Take action now!
@McConnellPress Scalia was a Constitutional purist so he would have wanted Obama to pick his successor whether Senate confirms or not.
@McConnellPress Do your job! President Obama still represents the American people. He has a right to nominate a SC justice. #Scalia
@McConnellPress @HackersCantHide Get to work Mitch the stump speeches over the years of what's right for our republic require action today.
@McConnellPress...you MUST NOT allow an Obama SCOTUS nominee to come to the floor for a vote even if it is Orrin Hatch himself!!! NEVER!!!
@McConnellPress You are a pathetic Mr. McConnell. 2 hours and you make his passing political. But I am not surprised .... disgusting.

@Rick24516423 unfortunately ur view of scalia is quite uninformed ...hopefully u will educate urself about our countrys founding documents
@Rick24516423 he NEVER said pollution was anything if the sort..he just didnt want the big corrupt beaurocratic EPA to ruin peoples lives
@Rick24516423 lol..ok..u mean like this?..
@McConnellPress 
Americans are not stupid.
@McConnellPress how about the American people nominating @POTUS in 2 landslides? Or did you just mean "real" Americans *wink
@McConnellPress 
Kennedy was confirmed during a time of an election..Reagan was president in his last year.
@McConnellPress 
The party that's says they stand by the constitution will defy it....hypocrites.
@McConnellPress Here bozo: http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/12/us/reagan-nominates-anthony-kennedy-to-supreme-court.html?pagewanted=all …
@McConnellPress
A very sincere thank you! 
@McConnellPress Denying due process is TREASON.. The President has the obligation to nominate while he's President. Period.
And that isn't just a self-serving political dodge that disgraces the court and those waiting on its decisions, right, @McConnellPress?
@McConnellPress The senate voting record shows McConnell voted for Reagan's nominee in an election year though so... http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/16_1988.pdf …
.@McConnellPress the American people did have a voice in the selection of their next Justice: when they re-elected @BarackObama.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Whoever ok'ed this press release did a disservice to Scalia, @WhiteHouse, @POTUS, Democracy, and all Americans
@McConnellPress Goes to show that McConnell cares zero about this country! Would he say this if a Repug was President? Of course not!
@McConnellPress and you'd feel the same way if it were a Republican in the White House, right? Have several seats please.
@McConnellPress Our President Barack Obama will be choosing the next justice.
@McConnellPress Here's the chance for GOP to make it up to "We the people" #Scalia. Fight for our Constitution! Rubio's right about @POTUS
@McConnellPress What an ill-timed and piss-poor attempt to throw an elbow at the President. Once again a McC failure. #Scalia
@McConnellPress American people should have a voice in the selection.. WHAT? America got laryngitis or something? Hell No Mitch. #ByeScalia
@McConnellPress um Obama was elected 2 times just like Bush and Bush was my President too
@McConnellPress Shame on you for putting politics before country. Are you saying the Senate doesn't support the American people's beliefs?
@McConnellPress, You can't honor the corporations and the Constitution at the same time. Hence all the babble about your fake Patriotism.
No, @McConnellPress, the American people don't have a say in the choosing of a SCOTUS justice. See Article II of the Constitution. #Scalia
@McConnellPress that's not how the Constitution works, Mitch. You can't enforce it only when it works for you.
@McConnellPress Murch better nktlet a obama SCOTUS nominee reach a vote. It Shall be up to next POTUS to apoint not this Anti USA scum POTUS
@McConnellPress The American people had their say when they elected the current President. #mcconnellisadouche
@McConnellPress If we had a sitting GOP president, you'd be saying the opposite. Shame on you. Do your job, for once, Mitch.
@McConnellPress "Republicans are the party that says government doesn't work, and then they get elected and prove it." P.J. O'Rourke
@McConnellPress Typical knee jerk response from one of the biggest jerks in DC refusing to hear replacing Scalia! You'll need to explain!!
@McConnellPress you're a disgrace to our system #sellout
@McConnellPress #prick
@McConnellPress wow, you guys are heartless, cannot wait to politicize anything. Even the death of a man.
@McConnellPress That's not how the system works, Senator.
@McConnellPress Americans ELECTED @POTUS and we will remember the #GOP took this stance. Promise!

#UniteBlue #ctl #p2 #scalia
.@McConnellPress but do you have the stones to finally stand up to 0bama?
 #RIPScalia
@McConnellPress  WAIT for the next President to replace Scalia.
@McConnellPress did NOTHING

FAILING in his 1 goal

HATES @BarackObama more than

.@McConnellPress Do the business of the People.  Don't abdicate. Do your fucking job. Advise and confirm, or resign. #scalia
@Prd2bnAmerican @McConnellPress last election we had brought in a Republican Senate. You lost...
@McConnellPress Putting politics before country. Shame on you. #Scalia
@McConnellPress McConnell better have nothing to do with an appointment attempt. Anything else is just confirming rino-ism
@McConnellPress  Thank you!
@McConnellPress how very crass. Kinda like mccockell
