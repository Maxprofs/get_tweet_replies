@SenateMajLdr
Pres Obama is NOT lame duck. He's still the sitting POTUS, elected for a 48-mon term NOT 36 NOT 42. Hear his nominee& approve.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer If calling something a "rule" makes it so, then let's come up with a "McConnell Rule."
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer When did they not meet with the nominee? hold hearings? allow a vote? #WordsvsActions #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer didn't happen then, shouldn't happen now. Are you saying you agreed with Biden then? Now? What?

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer you sound like a 3 year old,"but they did it too!!!"

@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer Politicians are allowed to talk and vet ideas and they always will...no one EVER abdicated duty.

@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer The people should throw all you career politicians out!
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer If you're not going to #DoYourJob, I'd like my taxes back. Follow the constitution
@SenateMajLdr your baseless obstruction of obama's reasonable judge allows prez Trump to nominate somebody worse. Thx for killing America
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer Senators who refuse to work should return their paychecks back.. And all their govt benefits
@SenateMajLdr

@SenateMajLdr not to mention a racist
@SenateMajLdr @northmtnstates @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer Someone once said "Elections have consequences"..No is a powerful word sometimes.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer did they hold hearings, or not?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Donald should run independently.That surely divides Republican vote
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer and guess what?  It was talk. No president has ever been denied a nominee at least a hearing.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer  Do your Constitutional Duty.  The people demand that, or else you will be impeached
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer @Senate_GOPs BUT THEY DID!
none of them ever proposed to deny ANY NOMINEE an up-or-down vote @SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer   I'm Janet from KY, at this point I feel you all are ridiculously full of crap. What a waste!!!
@johnnyscar @SenateMajLdr @billpostmus @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer except they never actually acted on their suggestions.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer people spoke in 2012!
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer  But they did anyway. You know you are wrong. Stop rationalizing un-American behavior Senator M.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer Yes, oddly we are all in agreement that you should not #DoYourJob. Stop playing politics already!
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer Again, assign a hearing date of Jan 1, 2017. The Senate has the right to follow the rules.
@SenateMajLdr We all know you are playing dirty politics on orders from @koch_industries #Racism  @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer What changed mcconnell? #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr The people voted twice when they elected Obama as president so do your job when it comes to the SCOTUS nominee or be fired.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs  different circumstances. Do your job, or resign #limitsenateterms
@SenateMajLdr @VP  And yet hearing were held, votes were cast, and nominees confirmed.  Post the link to your speech from 2005! #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer and yet eventually they DID Their FUCKING jobs! #doyours
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs we're counting on you to stay true to your word. #NoHearings #NoVote
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer shouldn't you be living by the Regan standard?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Cowards the lot of you. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer It imperative to the republicans to elect a new leader McConnell failed to unify the party
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer No way, McConnell... #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer #WeNeedNine #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer Start listening to US. The voters. #DoYourJobMitch
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer If we wanted brats ruling the country, we'd have elected gradeschoolers. Grow up and do your job
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer you guys can talk all you want. What about listening to ppl that put you in office #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer do you imagine that you're funny? Do your job.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer Trump leading  show republican lost their base you McConnell as majority leader you should resign
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer @Senate_GOPs if you watched the whole speech you'd see that's not the case. Be smarter.
@SenateMajLdr  The American people had a voice when they overwhelmingly elected @BarackObama POTUS TWICE!  #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer But they ended up DOING THEIR JOB! So your point is moot. #DoYourJob #Election2016 #SenateReform
@SenateMajLdr Two wrongs don't make a right. You are shaming yourself and your office by refusing to meet with the nominee. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer maybe if the Dem in senate n house would tell Republicans presdi Obama Rejected Cause he is Black
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer let be perfectly clear presdi has been rejected 100 percent N proof of birth papers oh RacistUsa
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer 
You guys are real jerks not meeting with Garland. Shame on you! We deserve better than you.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer lets just skip over the fact that never has the Senate refused a hearing. K
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer So, what was YOUR response to THEM back then? Just askin' (for a friend). Hold a hearing.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer  Wrong then and wrong now. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer it was all senate floor bluster. Democrats have never actually denied SCOTUS nominee a vote.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer Harping on past failings of Democrats doesn't excuse yours. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer It makes you look like a whiny third grader yelling "He started it!" It's beneath you. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer but they did , what's your excuse? Wait till you have to swallow Hillary's picks.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer These lazy fed workers cost us $1.5 mil a year http://on.mktw.net/1UBSA2C  OrrinHatch #SCOTUSNominee
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer McConMan, this is going to backfire on you - just like not doing your job has with DJ Trump.
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer JOHN 2:22. You are the ANTICHRIST
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer did Republicans agree at time? Not to mention person did get hearing. Will you be doing that too?
@SenateMajLdr @VP @SenatorReid @SenSchumer .@Senate_GOPs  Lying Mitch, Be Rite!
