Next in line. The Extention of the Caregiver Stipend for our Physically wounded Vietnam Vets? We've waited 7 yrs.
I pray it means my husband can finally go see his primary & cardiologist, not drive 3 hrs round trip to the VA!
I'm afraid their healthcare bill will have vets paying for healthcare.

GREAT! now get behind Sen. Cotton and Sen. Purdue's immigration bill.  I am so tired of working hard to pay for immigrants' free EVERYTHING!
Actually legal immigrants they do. Moreover, illegals do as well as most working under a stolen SSN and use it to illegally get benefits.
Now tell McConnell to change the rules to 51 so Senate can pass more bills
Have you heard of the budget reconciliation process?  You may want to rethink your tweet.
I hope this is going to be good for vets, but based on this administrations track record I'm very skeptical

@realDonaldTrump I don't believe u.
But you never bothered to make GI Bills retro for those of us who joined in early 1980s. VEAP was not a GI Bill. We got screwed.

You worked all year to make sure republican president could not make recess appts YOU NEED TO GO IN 2020

@McConnellPress it won't work. You failed on the most pressing issue which is healthcare.  You are a joke
As predicted.  Have you considered running for public office? Congressmen are cognizant non-support of American Vets will cost them votes.
STOP TRUMP.Reason!You at leastGet a sane person at the head of your party&our country. Pence.I mayNot agree w/him politicallyButHe'sNotCrazy

When are going to find the funding and pass S422 &SConRes12 Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2017 Congress needs to get this Done
Probably not tho.
the most important reform is the one that now lets GI Bill money be wasted on for-profit scam schools
a great victory for thieves & cronies
All schools are for profit schools, including state ones!
Please continue being willfully obtuse by ignoring the qualifier "scam"
Says the party that always puts profits over veterans.

Patton ordered his calvary to charge the "bonus army". We can  do better for our vets, take some money out of defense budget.
Maybe....but your Republican President's flunky just stepped all over this one, good luck getting any press for this.
Not to mention he looks and talks like a psychopath
Thanks to Rep.
Shouldn't we have been taking care of our vets all along? After WWI MacArthur chased vets out of Washington asking for their benefits.
No, that would be YOUR reform.
