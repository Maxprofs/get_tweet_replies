@SenateMajLdr Remember this?
@AVNSher @miamidecor @SenateMajLdr and this...
@carmenvellon @AVNSher @miamidecor @SenateMajLdr  Republicans had to deal with obstruction too. Obama and Biden did it. How sad for them.
@MufasaUK @carmenvellon @AVNSher @miamidecor @SenateMajLdr Not true. Hearings were held in both cases. The dems have never not had a hearing
@christabiasi @carmenvellon @AVNSher @miamidecor @SenateMajLdr  Ds NEVER held hearing/confirm Justice nominated by R in election year Never
@MufasaUK False: 1912 ... 1932 ... @christabiasi @carmenvellon @miamidecor @SenateMajLdr
@AVNSher @christabiasi @carmenvellon @miamidecor @SenateMajLdr 1932 Hoover/Sen(R) 1912 Taft/Sen(R) Ds NEVER confirm Nom(R) electon yr Never
@MufasaUK Kennedy was confirmed in an election year.  @christabiasi @carmenvellon @miamidecor @SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr You are embarassing your constituents & the American public. US CONSTITUTION says pres noms, you hear & confirm. #DoYourJob
@TheBrofessaur @SenateMajLdr In 2006 Obama supported filibuster to block hearings SCnom Alito. Are you saying it was right then wrong now?
@MufasaUK @TheBrofessaur @SenateMajLdr Personally I am for the Senate to do the job they are obligated to do. We need the FULL #SupremeCourt
@brian_b_ @TheBrofessaur @SenateMajLdr There job is to wait #Bidenrule.And block the shill for labor progressive activist.
@MufasaUK @TheBrofessaur @SenateMajLdr There is no such thing as the #BidenRule It's not written anywhere. Biden was wrong himself.
@brian_b_ @TheBrofessaur @SenateMajLdr Is Golden Rule written? Is there no such thing as Golden Rule? It's principle. Biden said it.
@MufasaUK @TheBrofessaur @SenateMajLdr longer follow the constitution. They are hypocrites. McConnell is the largest of them. Good bye.
@brian_b_ @TheBrofessaur @SenateMajLdr McConnel a hypocrite for embracing #Bidenrule? What that make Biden, Obama, Schumer, Reid, Pelosi,...
@SenateMajLdr Remember this? The oath you took to the Constitution not to the GOP. http://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Oath-of-Office/ … #DoYourJob
@kameraad52 @SenateMajLdr #bidenrule Obama filibustered Alito, Biden Obama BOTH came down on side of no hearings when they were senators.
@MufasaUK @SenateMajLdr So?
@kameraad52 @SenateMajLdr  Did you ask them to do their job? Is Obama doing his job following law? Drugs in Colorado? Executive Amnesty?
@MufasaUK @SenateMajLdr I reminded them of their oath. In some states oathbreakers are not admired.
@kameraad52 @SenateMajLdr An oath of what? Garland does not have constitutional right to hearing or vote. Obama even filibustered to block
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr Lame excuse #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr It's easy when you take remarks out of context you reptile.
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr so if we play your game, you want the GOP to be as good as the Vice President you put down? #GOPisCancer
@SenateMajLdr Spoiler, but the #BidenRule isn't actually a rule. #DoYourJob  Besides, since when does the GOP obey Joe Biden?
@sermo_diaboli @SenateMajLdr Glad you agree I'm right, but I disagree with there being anything funny about crippling a branch of govt.
@sermo_diaboli @SenateMajLdr You should educate yourself about what Biden did and didn't do. He didn't block any SCOTUS nominees.
@sermo_diaboli @SenateMajLdr Yes he did, but read his whole speech. NE way, no one listens to what he says. Why should this be different?
@SenateMajLdr Calm down peoples.
This time the turtle will lose the race.
@SenateMajLdr Remember this--#Article2section2 the President shall nominate... Not the NEXT President. Not the white President. Do your job!
@SenateMajLdr well that seems to be hypocritical now doesn't it
@SenateMajLdr In Feb 1988, McConnell (& rest of Senate) voted to confirm a SCOTUS appointee in a president's final year in office.
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr I can't remember, whose vacancy did Biden refuse to fill or what #SCOTUSnominee did Biden refuse to vote on?
@SenateMajLdr  if you don't want to play, take your dolls and dishes and go home.
@SenateMajLdr @bekunda24 Stand your ground  Ds will make sure confirmation process is chaos Let them rant and rave BUT STAND
@SenateMajLdr Senator, I am going to ask one thing. #ConfirmGarland You can call it a win for forcing Obama to nominate a perfect judge.
@SenateMajLdr it's nice to see @GOP takes their direction from @TheDemocrats! Don't lead, follow! It's what you do best!!!
.@SenateMajLdr This never happened. Period. Who cares what he said? You're actually abdicating your duty. He was making a speech.
@dwbourgeois @SenateMajLdr that's his point. He said it. He thought it. Let's just wait till barry gets out of office.
.@froggy5172 @SenateMajLdr OH! He thought it. So yeah, that's serious then. Thanks!
@dwbourgeois @SenateMajLdr everyone is jumping all over the "right" when the "left" says or does the same thing.
@SenateMajLdr The NRA doesn't get to pick the next SCOTUS nominee, an elected President does, you know, like OBAMA for instance! #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr RespectfullySenator, the people were given a voice and chose Barack Obama for 4 years and you for 6. Presidency is 4 years
@SenateMajLdr he was wrong too
@SenateMajLdr Yup.  Do you remember that the people elected you to advise and consent and you haven't done that yet?  #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr since when have you started listening to what Joe Biden has to say? #doyourjob
As usual, you're lying. Biden did not once say that there should be a "rule" not to confirm nominees in an election year. @SenateMajLdr
What he said was, the president's conduct was so partisan the Senate probably would not confirm any nominee he puts forth. @SenateMajLdr
Biden said he WOULD support hearings "if the president consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections". @SenateMajLdr
@fawfulfan @SenateMajLdr~ Nature boy #Biden has also said that no last year in office #POTUS should be allowed to select a #SCOTUS judge .
@drmckuku @fawfulfan @SenateMajLdr Actually, no he didn't.
@PatrickH63 @fawfulfan @SenateMajLdr -You can try to sugar coat the facts but the #democrats flip flop like a fish out of water.
@drmckuku @fawfulfan @SenateMajLdr Spoken like a man who just lost the argument.  #thefactsarethefacts
@PatrickH63 @fawfulfan @SenateMajLdr -I'm not arguing. The democrats make the unwritten laws that are beneficial for their deceptive ways.
@SenateMajLdr Yep, I remember that and I also remember what you wrote in the Kentucky Law Review #scotusnominee
@SenateMajLdr #PartyofCutOffNoseToSpiteYourFace #Dickheads
@SenateMajLdr I DON'T CARE! DO YOUR JOB!!!! HOLD HEARING AND BRING IT TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE!
.@SenateMajLdr Remember THIS when your candidate attempts to nominate during an election year:
@SenateMajLdr Please do your job. This is nothing but disappointing.
@SenateMajLdr Yes, and we remember the context. The only people buying this are the same ppl who will hand your party to TRUMP.
@SenateMajLdr Just like those who ignore the 1st clause of the 2nd amendment, you've ignored most of what he said. #shame #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr A legally elected President doesn't get to nominate a SCOTUS judge, the NRA does, right Mitch? #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJobOrPayBackYourStolenSalary #ConfirmSCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr You are an embarrassment to OUR nation.
@SenateMajLdr it's nice to see @GOP takes their direction from @TheDemocrats! Don't lead, follow! It's what you do best!!! #SCOTUSnominee
Well @SenateMajLdr, you've been obstructing everything that the #POTUS of America has tried to do for the past seven years #WhyChangeNow?
@SenateMajLdr Get over urself, no such thing as the Biden rule, so what 0 approval? They put names 2 a vote, ur afraid 2do THAT, BYE!GOP SUX
@SenateMajLdr At least the Democrats did their Constitutional duty and voted on the nominee. You are sitting on your hands, doing nothing.
@SenateMajLdr that was in 1992.  Today is 2016.  I voted for @POTUS to do a 8 year job, not a 7 year job = Fair hearing for #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr not a rule, not obstruction.  A suggestion.
@gavinivester @SenateMajLdr  ok... Then McConnell is " suggesting" it too... Just very strongly ..
@WillisShepherd @SenateMajLdr refusing to even meet the guy is more than just a suggestion. Let's see if they vote, that's the measure.
@gavinivester @SenateMajLdr   Yeah... It's a measure alright... A measure of how stupid they really are...,
@WillisShepherd @SenateMajLdr That's the best you can bring?
Failure to engage in intelligent discourse is how @GOP lost ctrl of our party.
@gavinivester @SenateMajLdr @GOP  if you are defending the likes of Boehner and MCConnell.. The "intelligent discourse" is already lost..
@SenateMajLdr   Just do your job you sorry SOB
@SenateMajLdr @CottonAveSolon Merrick Garland does not deserve to be used as a pawn for political division. Do the hearings! #FAIL once more
@SenateMajLdr That's NOT a rule! People in Kentucky must really be misinformed to put you in charge. Your hypocrisy is NOT Christian.
@SenateMajLdr better not hold hearing in November if you don't hold them now. That would be completely hypocritical...
@SenateMajLdr You have a job to do. We elected a president for FOUR YEARS. We are still in that 4 year period.
.@SenateMajLdr An offhand statement is not a rule, and if it were just imagine the chaos, even worse than it is now. #SCOTUSnominee
@katiekadwell @SenateMajLdr Except for the fact that this kind of thing is not unheard of, take this man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_A._Bradford …
@SenateMajLdr Did they vote, Senator? DID THEY VOTE?Stop making up imaginary rules.POTUS is a 4-year term.Read the Constitution. #DoYourJob
@cheeseheadlucy @SenateMajLdr There are many cases when 'they' didn't vote: ex:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_A._Bradford … #ElectionsHaveConsequences
@dahat @SenateMajLdr 1872? Seriously? What next,the arguments between Jefferson and John Adams? #ConstitutionalDuty #DoYourJob
@cheeseheadlucy @SenateMajLdr So Article I, Section V of the Constitution (which you pretend to cite) isn't clear enough? #NoDutyToVote
@dahat Article 2, Sec 2.2: He shall have Power...by and with the Advice
and Consent of the Senate...appoint...Judges of the supreme Court
@cheeseheadlucy Odd how you keep missing the fact that that does not require the congress act, by not doing so they withhold consent.
@dahat You are correct. There is nothing that states they must act. But this kind of behavior has contributed to the rise of Trump. #karma
@cheeseheadlucy Actually, the rise of Obama lead to the rise of Trump. Thin resume & pomp lead to even more thin resumes & bigger pomp.
#Trump is Leader of GOP

@SenateMajLdr + #Senate GOP represent Trump.. obstructing process for #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr do your job. #scotusnoninee
.@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob Stop obstructing government! You need to give the nominee a hearing. Quit being a whiny pouty man-baby. Or resign!
@Pie_SocialMedia @SenateMajLdr #Bidenrule Obama filibustered Alito Both came down on side of blocking hearings when they were senators karma
@SenateMajLdr In other words,  you and the Republican Senate are using Joe Biden and the Democrats as role models. Fascinating
. @SenateMajLdr why does your title have the word "leader" in it? seems a contradiction, no?
@SenateMajLdr A speech does not make a rule, you moron.  Or maybe we could pull up some of Bernie's "rules" for you to follow.
@SenateMajLdr Re: #BidenRule No SC vacancy or nominee to consider at the time. Do your job!
@SenateMajLdr I REMEMBER THE MCCONNELL RULE 2008! DO YOUR JOB!
@SenateMajLdr  yes let the people decide..think you'll be losing out on an excellent choice. Big gamble
@SenateMajLdr he was wrong than you are wrong now. So you are going to be children and not do your job either? Grow up and do your job
@SenateMajLdr Stop lying and do your job. #SCOTUSnominee #MerrickGarland #DoYourJob
.@SenateMajLdr IT'S NOT A RULE!
.@SenateMajLdr really?! #NotAnActualRule Are you still getting paid? and people on welfare are lazy?! #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Since when have you ever willingly followed a Democrat at anything? forget a so-called 'Biden Rule': #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr you display/represent the worst of your party and decline of this country w your disrespect for OUR CINC.
@SenateMajLdr I remember it being ignored. What's changed?
@SenateMajLdr Hey, remember this? Alito was NOT filibustered. Kennedy was confirmed in an ELECTION year. #DoYourJob #HoldAHearing
@SenateMajLdr then his nominees may enjoy my support as did Justices Kennedy and Souter."
@SenateMajLdr And the Biden Rule is written in law, right? Oh I forgot, nothing ever came of it and it wasn't even about a death vacancy
@SenateMajLdr #BidenRule Take responsibility for your actions instead of blaming someone else.  This is your dangerous precedent.
@SenateMajLdr There is no such thing as a Biden rule.  And the Pres is not a lame duck until the election.  Tell the truth for once.
@SenateMajLdr Remember this? #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr ya except there wasn't a filibuster. Republicans are going to see the end of their party, truly the most immature adults ever
@SenateMajLdr Does your #BidenRule hashtag mean that a single U.S. Senator can make a rule to subvert the US Constitution? #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @americancracker @RaySr1946 USMC
@SenateMajLdr  there is no such thing as a "Biden Rule".  #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @davidpwil hey it's 2 pump Joe... 
@SenateMajLdr there was no vacancy on the court when he made this speech. You are literally obstructing justice.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs So, your argument is that since someone else did something; it's ok? How old are you? Five?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Play the WHOLE video! Typical GOP misrepresentation!
@SenateMajLdr I voted for PRESIDENT OBAMA and support his nomination!! Do your fucking job you ugly, Basset hound-faced freak!!
@SenateMajLdr Remember this! You're a grown man stop acting infantile.
@SenateMajLdr Finally figured out the problem with calling it the #thurmondrule? LOL.  Biden was wrong then, you are wrong now.
@SenateMajLdr So, you're going to do everything Joe Biden tells you to do? This ought to be interesting.
@SenateMajLdr what is it with the GOP? Does repetition of the same garbage suddenly make it truth? #leaderofnothing #SCOTUSNominee
@SenateMajLdr REMEMBER THIS?  #DoYourJob #GOP #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr Follow the Constitution, that's all we want. Please have hearings and a vote.
@SenateMajLdr Upset that Trump is likely Repub nominee? That's on you and your divisive, obstructionist Senate. How bout you #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Then why would it suddenly be okay during lame duck session?  #DoYourJob #NoHearingsNoVotesNoPay @SCOTUSnom @BarackObama
@SenateMajLdr oh and btw, it's because of actions like this that the Republican party is in the state that it is.
@SenateMajLdr Thank you.
@SenateMajLdr I remember when you made a speech on the floor of congress quoting Biden out of context. He recommended you confirm. #liar
@SenateMajLdr Remember taking Biden out of context and centering an entire debate around it? I do.  You're weak sauce, man, weak sauce.
@SenateMajLdr Ummm.... And didn't President Bush go ahead and nominate Justice Thomas and didn't congress #dotheirjob & confirm?
.@SenateMajLdr That was yesterday, it is now today. Let's have some integrity & get this done. VOTE! #SCOTUSnominee @GOP
@SenateMajLdr And #McConnellRule says everything Joe Biden says is policy of Congress Wow, the Tea Party is acting like terrorist #BidenRule
@SenateMajLdr astonishing to me -- and many others -- that you would obstruct consideration of nominee.  #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr This refers to a resignation in order to game the system; to ensure replacement by own party.  Not death.  You know that.
@SenateMajLdr When HRC is the next President, and we have the Senate, I hope she chooses a MORE liberal judge.
@SenateMajLdr do you ever do any work? DO YOUR JOB. The rest of us cant ignore our responsibilities for a year. #firethesenate
@SenateMajLdr Remember this? https://youtu.be/LPSj0jgF-_w  #RecallMcConnell
@SenateMajLdr That was 1992. Here's you saying the opposite in 2006: https://youtu.be/LPSj0jgF-_w  #RecallMcConnell
@SenateMajLdr There is no "Biden Rule"! Now do your JOB! #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr #CongressEpicFail. There is no Biden rule. Stop slacking on the job at American people's expense
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan not a rule
@SenateMajLdr So the NRA makes your decisions on the Supreme Court pick.  Shame on you Senator, it's time for you to go home.
. @SenateMajLdr you must be feeling guilty or you wouldn't have unearthed this video. Poor excuse to not #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr How vengeful are you? - Looking backwards to deepen the gridlock? Anyway, this never happened and the context was different.
@SenateMajLdr You are so small minded.  What a creep.  #do your job
@SenateMajLdr #BidenRule American people, fair and reasonable, elect Trump and abolish the Senate, whorehouse of hollow words and men
@SenateMajLdr How does what he said then, NOT MADE A LEGAL RULE, mean something  but what he says NOW doesn't?
@SenateMajLdr  #DoYourJob #RecallMcConnell
@SenateMajLdr I want to start a pool to bet on how long it is before you cave.
@SenateMajLdr please deliver an up or down vote!
@SenateMajLdr 24 years ago and never acted upon by the senate. You have no excuse other than your irrational hatred for a twice elected prez
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Do two wrongs make a right? http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/two-wrongs-make-a-right.html …
@SenateMajLdr This was in June. And he made the suggestion only.  He didn't actually vow to do it moments after Scalias death in Feb.
The @SenateMajLdr said this is "About a principle, not a person" but when he plays politics he makes this about a person without principles.
@SenateMajLdr nice try at deflection..end of day there has always been vote& confirmation.  66%of American feel you should do just that.
@SenateMajLdr do your job Stop being a little baby and go to work like the rest of us. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr you should be fired. Do your job.
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr Using it way out of context Senator. Republican Obstructionists in Senate ought to start packing now. NO CLUE Senator. 0 Clue.
@SenateMajLdr @Rep_Cotter Much better to pass on qualified moderate and let Clinton select an extremist. Or do you think Trump wins? Lol.
@SenateMajLdr we are in the primaries not the presidential campaign.  Meet with the nominee. He is an outstanding choice.
@SenateMajLdr president is always temporary. Four years or four months - he is still the president. Just do your job and let pres do his
@SenateMajLdr Remember when pointing out that a coworker was lazy, nearly 3 decades ago, was a valid excuse? Yeah, Me neither.  #DOYOURJOB
@SenateMajLdr There is no #BidenRule. It's just another #GOP fantasy like #deregulation and WMDs in Iraq. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr  There is NO Biden Rule!  You want the NRA to approve the nominee for the Supreme Court.  What a huge FAIL!  #DoYourJOB
@SenateMajLdr It's not legitimate legislation.  Know what is? The Constitution. #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr I remember the context that you conveniently leave out.  Do your job.
@SenateMajLdr - absolutely misleading context, senator... And you SHOULD know that!
@SenateMajLdr THERE IS NO BIDEN RULE! As for the Hastert Rule, the House should bury that with shame. @DentforCongress
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan   Server America before your party.  #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr remind me again: how did Strom Thurmond as judiciary chairman responded to this *speech*?
@SenateMajLdr  @chucktodd networks won't talk or mention this ! Liberal media
@SenateMajLdr Today would be a good day to choose not to be racist and meet with your black presidents nominee. AKA: DO YOUR JOB!
@SenateMajLdr  it was wrong then it was wrong now, do your job AND CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY just like President Obama is doing his.
@SenateMajLdr And the GOP didn't like it one bit. Are you 5? Be the bigger person and do the right thing. #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr except nothing happened this was just talk unlike what you are doing
@SenateMajLdr Unprecedented in US history for Prez to leave office w/SCOTUS vacancy.  What is different about this Prez then previous? Skin?
@SenateMajLdr It was wrong then and is wrong now NOT to #Nominate #SCOTUS  #Scalia #Textualism #Originalism "SHALL"
.@SenateMajLdr is your head in the sand? @realDonaldTrump is killing establishment Rs bc of obstruction tactics like this. You do nothing!
@SenateMajLdr Remember it was never used? Do your job!
@SenateMajLdr Not a rule.
@SenateMajLdr , if a normal person decided not to do a job they get paid for, they'd be fired. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr do your job or resign .#gop
@SenateMajLdr I remember the McConnell Rule of 2008 :)
@SenateMajLdr Please. How many months before an election was Biden speaking? We have months left in the current court term! #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr
.@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJobFriday
@SenateMajLdr no one ever said @VP was right on every issue...also, ive seen videos of you saying the converse when you were the minorityldr
@SenateMajLdr I don't see this @BidenRule in any of the articles of the Constitution.
@SenateMajLdr Be the bigger man. Two wrongs don't make a right. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr "The Frist fairness rule" and your support for 'advise and consent over advise and obstruct'. Remember THAT?
.@SenateMajLdr I don't think that means what you think it means, you obstructionist turtle looking shitbag. Choke on a bag of dicks.
@SenateMajLdr There was no nominee or vacancy and it was late June. We are currently in March with a vacancy and nominee. Get to work!
@SenateMajLdr  The "Biden rule" statement was made on JUNE 23, 1992. Not March, & certainly not February. 
It was also wrong then, & now.
@SenateMajLdr just being stupid, playground politics
@SenateMajLdr Biden's suggestion was made in the middle of summer. The current vacancy began in February. Stop obstructing! #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr Be a bigger man and just get this done!!! And you wonder why America is fed up with Congress.  It is items like this!!!
@SenateMajLdr so is it always #titfortat with you and your folk? #DoYourJob #doyourjobcongress And what if you have POTUS-elect Clinton?
@SenateMajLdr there is no Bidden rule the Constitution says President to nominate a person & congress to advice & consent #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr YEA! LET'S CONSIDER EVERYTHING BUSH DID FOR US! Like cripple our economy or send us to war with a nation under false pretenses
Actually @SenateMajLdr , I'll say this another way. Would you pay someone good money not to do the job they signed up for?
@SenateMajLdr ur behavior is disgraceful American ppl chose @BarackObama  U achieved 0 and are losing your party to trump.  Do your job sir.
.@SenateMajLdr If POTUS has limited power during an election year THEN SO DOES THE SENATE - you don't have the POWER to not do your job.
@SenateMajLdr We did have our say...in 2008 and 2012 #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr that was hypothetical and much closer to the election if someone resigns. TWO wrongs don't make a right anyway. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr remember what he said right after that?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs if you folks can't figure out how to play nice the voters will eventually find replacements that will
.@SenateMajLdr yet Justice Kennedy was confirmed 93-0. Try again. #DoYourJob
