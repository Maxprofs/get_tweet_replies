Donald Trump's craven Republican enablers: http://nyer.cm/P6R7pak  
Grow a pair, old man, or die. Stop trying to strip millions of Americans of health care so u can give tax cuts to billionaires
great tweet
That's funny since you voted to take benefits away.
Thanks. Does your wall calendar include a Presidential impeachment date? Talk, talk, and more talk, but nothing on my calendar.

#TrumpLeaks Docs: Mitch McConnell linked super PAC took $2.5 million from a pro-Putin Ukrainian businessman last election cycle #trumprussia 
If only you and @SpeakerRyan would volunteer to keep America safe by standing up to #Trump and putting country before party #DoYourJob
wouldn't that be something but considering @SpeakerRyan ran 4 re-election in Nov on QT says he's a chic shit & greedy prick NOT PATRIOTIC
With @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP given the majority @SenateMajLdr we expect immediate & swift action to declare Antifa as terrorist 2B eradicated
American's are disgusted w/the controlled narratives & lack of effort in addressing & ending the unethical tyrants in D.C.
Let's hope they continue to be volunteers.  No draft

GOP leaders are accomplices, not mere enablers as @NewYorker suggests. See: #TrumpLeaks! https://twitter.com/newyorker/status/864269287086796800 … #resist
Brave armed forces swear oath to protect Constitution against all enemies, foreign & domestic. You protect yourself, @gop. #shame #treason

I read an article about your in laws ship carrying cocaine39.8 and getting busted. Is this true

Except when you send them to war on a lie.
We owe deep gratitude to our military personnel. No gratitude for you McConnell. You are corrupt.
you are a corrupt and inept leader! Go away please!
sentence. Hope your cellmate is Jakubowski after appeals in Merrick’s VA fed court DENIED!

Sen. McConnell's father-in-law owns cargo ship that got busted w/90 lbs of cocaine

Why are you taking money from Putin?
I will bet you celebrated that money the Russians donated to your senate leadership fund, huh?  And, put your teeth in..sheesh!
Why didn't you put on your pointed hoodie & join the fellas in NC today?  I am sure they missed you, but maybe you are back home in KY
You ONLY celebrate your loyalty for the job Dumpf gave your wife, & the $600 billion dollar heist you all want to give yourselves.

Because these three venal operatives were drooling over power and Russian money. Trump will survive as long as Ryan & McConnell prop him up. 

Trump. And only trump.
If you wanted to honor our servicemen, you wouldn't have voted against increases to veteran's benefits every.chance you could get. Hypocrite
Dear Senator McConnell,
I'll bet they're in your thoughts & prayers too.  Your thoughts: How do we cut their healthcare; your prayers: Pray I don't get found out.
False patriotism again!  You only celebrate those who have/had the decency to die!
Take me now, lover!
VP Mike Pence knew about Mike Flynn as head of the transition team. He lied. Here's proof.
SUPPORT OUR CIC
Stop try to get Trump out and start doing ur job and working with Trump and for the people that elected u not ur donors
.@SenateMajLdr We say a solemn prayer that the nation might elect leaders worthy them.
You're cutting that budget, aren't you?
Yeah and today the President also signed a deal with the Saudi's , but of course you wouldn't praise that would you.. Ugh! 
getting fed up 
fix ACA, rein in insurance companies and big Pharma.Stop slapping together ridiculous legislation just to say the (Obamacare) is repealed.
How dare you feign patriotism when you prop up a Russian-backed puppet president? You are a traitor to our country and those who serve her.
They put country above politics and work together with colleagues regardless of religion or politics -think Congress could begin to do this?
And we should honor these fine men and women on this day. NOT to gain brownie points cause your a disgrace to the Senate
President Trump wants a strong military, where are u on this Mc Connell
Healthcare with unlimited mental health coverage . Especially if you're a vet and govt programs that help their family
Yes we do. Also need GOP Leadership stand strong with Trump!!!
http://www.islam-guide.com/ 
Have you explained to these heroes the President has put them in more danger? Don't you think the right thing to do is let them know?
Hopefully your buddy in the WH didn't reveal too much classified info, these heroes should be protected by us
 Defend DJT, like Pence did at Grove City College today.  When you do, you show loyalty to those who fought alone, to give GOP the WH.
Your wife got a cushy job...I hope you all go down with Trump.
Senator, you are an embarrassment to KY.
Now if we could only get Congress to work on protecting us, instead of corporations and billionaires.
You do realize that there are Veterans on the ACA you are planning to destroy. Yes, you love America.
As you and the rest of the @Gop try and figure how to screw Vets even more! #resign you are a #national disgrace
Actions speak louder than words. Do something to help our vets homeless, jobless, injured. Military is 2x likely diagnosed w/ ALS! #ALSaware
When/where did you serve?
More low-income Americans are getting better, more accessible care thanks to the ACA.
Don't celebrate us, fool. Make our sacrifices unnecessary. Vietnam vet whose oldest grandson still suffers from his Afghan tour.
What Exactly Did You Do Over The LAST 8 YEARS TO HELP VETS? Oh, Wait, Therr Was A Black Dem In Office & You Couldn't Help Him!!!! DISGUSTING
Too bad all you reps do is find new ways to screw over our military, who serve our nation bravely and deserve care when they return home.
Now if you would learn to care about all Americans and not just GOP & rich people,  that would be great.
These brave men and women love their country. You & Ryan should love USA as much as our President does! Show some guts! R U a leader or not?
Traitor!
Wanna keep out country safe?  Impeach the President!
Remember when you received a "medical" discharge from the army? Dry eyes or something....
Will you and our other senator's / congressmen ever put in a full weeks work to fix country. Should take Trumps Lead and work to fix America
This, coming from a man in the forefront trying to dismantle all the benefits we've earned!!!..another Traitor...
TRUMPCARE will keep as many as 7 million veterans from participating in the GOP healthcare plan. This is not how you treat your protectors?
The GOP are going to be held responsible for the delusional, vile, treasonous and inhuman miscreant holding office today
Today you celebrate "Idiot President Pandering Day"
GOP Lawmakers, We never said that! Yell fake news! fake news!  but, we have tape!, oh, uhm well,  we were just kidding when we said that
This  is a tweet to celebrate our armed forces of course libs have to on that tho. Trump 2020! Losers
No respect. You're a jerk.
Why don't you uphold the constitution quit lying. You want Obamacare to fail. How does that help Americans. Shame

Just concentrate on passing the Trump agenda rather than working against him.
You need to celebrate the president of the United States of America get behind him protect him speak out for him !!!!!!!
Our greatest socialist program!!!
You need to START FULLY SUPPORTING OUR @POTUS ! STOP attacks!
Don's doin it for us, the swamp is draining. Those that are silent identify themselves as the same rats as the loudest of the cutthroats are

.@SenateMajLdr you should sign up for a tour as well. Really get to know what that's like.
Let's hear about your 'time' in the forces? Why do you keep it hidden?
@tempteststorm2 God bless and protect our brothers & sisters at home and abroad.
Nice but do you care sbout the incompetence of YOUR @POTUS , lying constantly and possibly attempt to obstruct justice?
STOP the "backdoor draft" sending our National Guard like active duty.  u aren't getting enough "volunteers" because they are treated badly
As opposed to you who cares nothing for the people of this country.
REMINDER: A vote for a Republican is a vote for a fascist Kleptocrat who gives less than a  about your safety #tcot
Today, our nation celebrates #ArmedForcesDay and the men & women who volunteer to keep America safe. 
Too bad you are not among those who volunteered to kept us safe, you are endangering us.  Your support of trump is appalling.
What about those of us drafted and who served honorably? Forget  not.
Tell all Republicans including Speaker Ryan & Traitors to Back President Trump with his Agenda! Trump has what you don't; He's A Visionary!
Such willful ignorance and intellectual laziness.  A #Visionary #ROTFLMAO
Traitor

You're a self serving whiner without the courage to protect the will of the voter....just like the majority of your cut and run caucus.

Cop week,military day,prayer Thursday...woohoo!!! TRUMP'S WORLD!PARTY TIME!!EXELLENT!!!
How did you get to be the richest person in congress?
Sellout.
Keep America safe Senator--have courage and recognize POTUS disaster
Jay he will never recognize.
You mean all the people you shaft whenever vet's jobs and benefits bills come up for a vote?
Semper Paratus! Go Coast Guard Sector Ohio Valley!! They do an outstanding job protecting our rivers!
You should really focus on keeping our country safe from @POTUS.
If only you cared about our armed forces as much as you care about rich people. Maybe do something to benefit their lives/paychecks? #GOPrik
sTAND BY YOUR PRESIDENT THE PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU AND RYAN
#DumbassTroll
When will @GOP get behind our @POTUS ?
Hey Turtleman, they don't fight to keep America "safe". That's the pretext. They fight to enrich Halliburton and the oil and arms industries
I'm sure you got paid for this announcement.
Celebrating our men & women in service means protecting them from #LeakerNChief telling secrets!! Stop protecting him
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
From this 20 year veteran to you you are complicit to treason your silence is guilt you took an oath to defend this nation and do nothing
You have done nothing since this train wreck Trump started his campaign you should be ashamed of yourself you put spies in the White House
Do you JOB and support POTUS! Why do we have a former FBI director overseeing the misdeeds of Comey?
#BuzzOffFakeAccountTroll 

Too bad the entire GOP sold them out when they KNEW trump was being influenced by Russia and did NOTHING but cover it up. So SHUT. UP.
Surprised someone with such a reputation for political talent thought that tying the party's fate to that of a lunatic was a good idea
He is with the @GOP
Merrick Garland
@GOP @VP you are complicit to treason you are supporting Russian spies in the White House what will it take silence is complicit
As a military retiree, with related disabilities, I don't want you or your kind celebrating me or anything I did.   #FOAD #RESIST  #resign
Have a nice day.  Thank you for exercising your right for freedom of speech. I fought so you could do that. Oh, and please remember, #RESIST
it is time for you to LEAD!  Demand that the Senate stays in CONTINUOUS SESSION until ALL of @POTUS appointments to Cabinet are approved.
Today we celebrate the fact GOP is going down in flames !

You support the GOP? If so...
Is that your baby picture?

Until you do your job and #impeach - you trample on everything they stand for.
Geez
