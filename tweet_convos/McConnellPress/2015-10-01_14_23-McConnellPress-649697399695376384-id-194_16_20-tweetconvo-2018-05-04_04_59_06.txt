@SenateMajLdr "Thoughts and prayers" for victims of gun violence not enough when you vote with the @NRA via @CREDOMobile
@jleyser  some stupid is just too stupid. I will be able to protect myself and others. Do your homework & get smart.
@rhymeywords Do your own homework.  Switzerland OUTLAWS ammunition in homes.  Small arms (like 9mm pistols) are perfectly legal in Honduras.
@jleyser still the difference remains staggering! Silly!http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/editorials/2013/01/06/1-gun-control-has-a-clear-record …
@SarahWoodrum1 @jleyser thanks for letting me know. Here you go.
@SenateMajLdr funny, I've been praying that congress enacts sensible gun laws. Looks like neither of our prayers are being answered.
@Iamwhoismoses @SenateMajLdr New gun laws not the answer! Libs lie to make us slaves. Wake up!
@rhymeywords @SenateMajLdr Next time try doing research before spewing some chart you know nothing about: http://world.time.com/2012/12/20/the-swiss-difference-a-gun-culture-that-works/ …
@Iamwhoismoses You too sweetie. Truly hope you be a good guy and see importance of defending you and yours!

@Iamwhoismoses you block, I block.
@SenateMajLdr That's all u can say? Do u think those prayers can raise the dead? Fall on your sword & author tough gun law legislation.

@SenateMajLdr defunding the government is no answer .protect and serve in a civl manner?i.http://hansasailing.com 
@SenateMajLdr Priests and ministers are paid to pray.  Senators are paid to legislate for the common good.  Do you job.
@SenateMajLdr I do not care who changes the laws first Rep, or Dem.  The lives of those lost are not distinguished by politics.
@SenateMajLdr help them now
@SenateMajLdr & where are your thoughts on the babies butchered today? Your soul is sick! Very sick! #tcot #ccot
@SenateMajLdr Were you wiping the blood off your hands as you sent out this fake tweet? Gun legislation trumps the NRA! Don't you GET that?
@SenateMajLdr : if it was your child or grandchild, would you still ' keep them in your thoughts'? And do nothing?
.@SenateMajLdr Americans want action on reasonable gun reforms, not more empty condolences for the most recent mass murder. Lead.
@SenateMajLdr  US DEATHS btwn 2005-2015 from extremist attacks on US soil = 71; from guns = 301,797 #thesenatesthoughts #senate #guncontrol
@SenateMajLdr Do something besides pray. Take action on out of control NRA and the politicians they control!
@SenateMajLdr You all say same thing my thoughts are with the families like a script. It's NOT real when you take big gun money and pro NRA
@SenateMajLdr If truly sorry, if you truly want thoughts and prayers to count, tell congress to stop being such cowards. Stop the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr Thoughts and prayers are not enough! We Need Realistic Gun Control laws. Has the NRA bought the GOP???
@SenateMajLdr It seems that most people would not be so terrified of these semi-automatic rifles if they just read the Wikipedia entry on it
@SenateMajLdr ...and your votes are with the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr And of the NRA campaign contributions
@SenateMajLdr thoughts and prayers for the families, favors for the NRA, bribes for congress. Business as usual.
@SenateMajLdr  thought and prayers for the victims and families? Prove it. Stop cow towing to the NRA. Talk the talk walk the walk.
.@SenateMajLdr NOT GOOD ENOUGH US GUNLAWMAKES AMERICA A LAUGHING STOCK
@SenateMajLdr Really senator?  Cause it doesn’t mean much when you vote on gun laws with the NRA!
@SenateMajLdr You LOVE NRA campaign $$$ CORRUPTION that BOUGHT Congress. Your tears are LIES
@Potus @POTUSPressPool 
#Trackgunstats
@SenateMajLdr Your thoughts are not enough. Do something! #UCCShooting
@SenateMajLdr WHO CAN STAND UP AND STAY,"THIS MUST BE DONE TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES, SONS,DAUGHTERS, MOTHERS, FATHERS, ETC.
@SenateMajLdr A fairly empty and trite exercise, sending your "thoughts". Work on meaningful #guncontrol. #guns
@SenateMajLdr Prayers will not bring back the innocent dead. More funding and facilities for the mentally ill is what is needed.
@LouannTexas @SenateMajLdr Excellent points. Mental health screening for all gun owners, cops, military. Immediately!
@SenateMajLdr Let the NRA have their guns, just register, report if stolen, change registration if sold & go to jail if used in a crime.
@SenateMajLdr.  regulate guns like cars are, register, change registration, report if stolen, be held responsible if gun is used in a crime.
Your thoughts are the height of hypocrisy.  They are negated by your support of the NRA;s pro-gun agenda..  @SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr BUT don't YOU support the NRA and receive money from NRA Lobbyists?? Victims  blood is on your hands too!
@SenateMajLdr Mr. McConnell:  "Our hearts go out...our hearts go out...our hearts go out...ad nauseum.  Not put your mind/clout behind it.
@SenateMajLdr NRA=Not Right for America-get courage & do right thing-restrict ammunition to well regulated militia as FFathers intended
@SenateMajLdr The House kowtows to the munitions industry and the NRA.  Disgusting!
@SenateMajLdr but your campaign donations come from the NRA...
@SenateMajLdr Your thoughts? How about your actions!? Taking $37200 from @NRA makes you the enemy of those victims & their families. #goaway
@SenateMajLdr Need to have a better scrutineer.
.@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Actions speak louder than words. Make something happen to stop this madness in the U.S. Sensible gun laws-yes
@SenateMajLdr Stop talking and stop the killing!
@SenateMajLdr Liar.
@SenateMajLdr You and the rest of your bought off party have blood on your hands. Sensible gun regulation won't even affect my gun ownership
@SenateMajLdr  Your thoughts are with supporting the NRA Against any background checks for nut cases and violent criminals
@SenateMajLdr Bloody hell the hate being directed to you is staggering.
@SenateMajLdr  
OMG someone killed ppl with guns OMG BAN GUNS 
OMG someone killed ppl with cars OMG BAN CARS

Just plain stupid

Stay Strong
@SenateMajLdr The Senate's thoughts are with the victims? How useless your thoughts are. The victims' blood is on your hands.  DO SOMETHING.
@SenateMajLdr Why don't u at least send the NRA lobby money to the families of the victims? Thoughts and prayers? How hypocritical is that?
@SenateMajLdr Save your thoughts and let's see your action. Set a real example and take rational action to make our campuses safer.
@SenateMajLdr Do something if you care.  Congress has blood on his hands.  It's time Congress cuts its ties from the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr Sorry! Your "sorry" isn't enough. Make some meaningful change instead of empty platitudes.
@SenateMajLdr You talk the talk, but you don't walk the walk. Your words are empty...
@SenateMajLdr If you really mean this, then compel the senate to get up off their lazy,partisan asses and DO SOMETHING !!
@SenateMajLdr THEN DO SOMETHING!  Stop blocking legislation for gun control. Stop sending your thoughts and take action.
@SenateMajLdr How about maybe thinking of some solutions to the gun violence that's infested this country?
@SenateMajLdr Your “thoughts and prayers” are not enough when your hearts and votes are with the NRA
@SenateMajLdr and yet your votes are with the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr pray that you and Congress find the courage to stop being bullied by the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr Down the NRA. Up with compassion.
@SenateMajLdr  1 Nation under NRA.  You have blood on your hands.
@SenateMajLdr But, the question is: what does Congress is going to do?
@SenateMajLdr How do you sleep at night?
@SenateMajLdr Please do something to stop gun violence. Stand up to the NRA.
Is it hard for you to sleep at night? @SenateMajLdr Your gun control voting record shows blood on your hands. Is the money worth it?
@SenateMajLdr That's helpful. Try doing something other than offering prayers. Those aren't working.
@SenateMajLdr We The People don't want your insincere statements, we want effective gun laws and for The GOP to stop kowtowing to the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr Not enough, not nearly enough. We Americans are sick of congress pandering to the NRA at the expense of multiple massacres.
@SenateMajLdr Senator, you are in unique position to help. Please do. #GunReform
@SenateMajLdr If you cared at all, you would do something to end the NRA's and gun manufacturers' choke hold on this country.
@SenateMajLdr you are either insincere or your magic cloudman is pretty pitiful
@SenateMajLdr Senator, if the Senate's thoughts were really with the victims and families, you would do something meaningful to stop this.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Oh yeah !!
@SenateMajLdr Two words describe you, Mitch: disingenuous hypocrite
Thoughts and prayers are not enough. Universal background checks would be a good start. @SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr you think the American ppl are stupid? We're not. We know your thoughts are really with the @NRA and the funding they give you
@SenateMajLdr Thoughts are not going to save lives.  The Senate must act to pass sensible gun regulations.
@SenateMajLdr You won't be credible until you decline NRA bribes (campaign contributions) and introduce legislation to ban assault wpns.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress stop taking bribes from @NRA to turn blind eye to deaths. Blood is on your hands. #UCCShooting
@SenateMajLdr Let's see you put your money where your mouth is!  #NotOneMore
@SenateMajLdr Did your staff write that sterling lie for you? You don't care as long as the NRA keeps the money flowing.
@SenateMajLdr #Enough!
@SenateMajLdr  We need leaders to support gun regulations! Put your votes where your thoughts and prayers are, Senator!
@SenateMajLdr This is the last time the majority of Americans want to hear your "thoughts" or "thoughts and prayers" garbage.
@SenateMajLdr  Enough talk. Stronger gun laws NOW! Thorough background checks and tougher screening for gun buying NOW!
@SenateMajLdr  Thoughts? Think up some legislation that could help prevent this from happening every day in our country.  Thanks in advance.
@SenateMajLdr big deal - there's blood on YOUR hands until you decide to DO SOMETHING about the NRA
@SenateMajLdr Screw your thoughts and prayers! The American people need, want, and deserve ACTION to #stopgunviolence. I #demandavote!
@SenateMajLdr ooh.  I can feel your magic working.  again.  just like last time.
@SenateMajLdr Shill.
@SenateMajLdr Thoughts & prayers of NRA gunsuckers with pockets full of NRA cash? How about doing something to stop the next one?
@SenateMajLdr 140 or so characters here. Just words. Show some character and actually take action. Think that's supposed to be your job.
If that's true, @SenateMajLdr then help create laws to stop the carnage #Gunsense #USSshooting #GunControlSavesLives
@SenateMajLdr @johnthune  @marcorubio @tedcruz the money from @NRA has caused you to not act in people's best interests #USSshooting
The @SenateMajLdr is a recipient of $72,300 of pro-gun money since 2009: Your thoughts and prayers are not enough. Legislate!
@SenateMajLdr  We don't need thoughts and prayers, please keep them to yourselves. We need gun laws and responsible leaders.
@SenateMajLdr With all due respect, thoughts are not enough. You must act. You must make a change. Please. We are begging you.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress help for mentally ill
@SenateMajLdr Thoughts and prayers to Ditch Mitch :)
@SenateMajLdr Ur thoughts & prayers = near NOTHING. Time 2 do some of what all other 1st World countries r doing who DONT have this problem!
@SenateMajLdr keep you useless thoughts to yourself.  Do something to stop the NRA and whackos with guns.  Get a spine and act.
@SenateMajLdr You want background checks for people to VOTE but no background checks for people to OWN AND SHOOT A GUN. Wake up, Mitch.
@SenateMajLdr That's really sweet. The blood of more Americans is on your hands as you do nothing to change the situation.
@SenateMajLdr  Your crocodile tears are DISGRACEFUL, Sir, when you REFUSE to get SERIOUS about what the American people WANT -- GUN CONTROL!
@SenateMajLdr The do something about it!!!!!!!
@SenateMajLdr how about adding some action to back up your thoughts and prayers #ThoughtsPrayersAction
@SenateMajLdr We don't WANT your "thoughts and prayers".  We want you to listen to US!  Not the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr thoughts and prayers are not enough. Stop voting with NRA. Vote for background checks and common sense gun laws
@SenateMajLdr the Senate's thoughts will truly be with the victim's families when they work out how to make us safe. #ProveIt
@SenateMajLdr 'thoughts & prayers' for victims of gun violence not enough when your hearts and votes are owned by NRA. It’s time to act!
@SenateMajLdr Pass a law limiting access to auto and semi-auto guns.  The NRA money you receive is blood money.
@SenateMajLdr  Your prayers and condolences to the families of mas gun shootings is not enough.  Pass a law requiring mental health screens
@SenateMajLdr Your “thoughts and prayers” are not enough when your hearts and votes are with the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr and what are you doing about it!  Keep your prayers, God is NOT listening!
@SenateMajLdr Please help us and pass sensible gun legislation.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress It is past time for thoughts and prayers.  We need actions to stop GUN VIOLENCE.
@SenateMajLdr Your “thoughts and prayers” are not enough when your hearts and votes are with the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr IF you really "care" about victims of shootings VOTE for common sense gun control laws, otherwise your words mean NADA
@SenateMajLdr "thoughts and prayers" not enough when you vote with the @NRA @CREDOMobile

@SenateMajLdr School shootings-#CREDO PETITION
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress a That's him isn't it ! A dam Muslim killer!
@SenateMajLdr We don't care about your "thoughts and prayers" any longer. We care about what actions you are finally going to take
@SenateMajLdr What good do your thoughts do? ABSOLUTELY NONE. It's way past time to start THINKING about passing necessary gun legislation.
@SenateMajLdr Jeeze, that is sure comforting. The NRA will appreciate your sentiments.
@SenateMajLdr Thoughts & prayers are good & well, Sir. They do bring comfort, but we need change. Take ur hands out of ur pocket! #NoWayNRA
@SenateMajLdr Your thoughts are with the victims and your votes are with the gun lobby. Shame on you all.
@SenateMajLdr  LACK of mental health services, education and most of all EMPATHY to recognize and/or care for your fellow man GUN SALES?!!!!
@SenateMajLdr You must do better. Your thoughts are not enough when your heart and vote are with the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr Thoughts and prayers don't cut it when you're in bed with the NRA!  Do something about that!
@SenateMajLdr Your prayer is answered. God's saying, "If you keep doing nothing, you will get what you have been getting. Pass gun laws."
@SenateMajLdr The Republicans can't do anything. Their god is the support and contributions from the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr You're full of it, or you would have common sense laws!!! It's all on you!!!!
@SenateMajLdr  "Thoughts and prayers" for victims of gun violence not enough when you vote with the @NRA via @CREDOMobile
@SenateMajLdr If one of your close relatives was a victim of a mass shooting, I wonder if you would still be so influenced by the NRA.
@SenateMajLdr Your facile condolences mean as much now as they did after the other 142 school shootings since 2013.
@SenateMajLdr Your thoughts don't matter its your actions SIR your suprt for gun culture/NRA is to be blamed for continued carnage in US
@SenateMajLdr How about your thoughts be with some gun control instead.
@SenateMajLdr Prayers haven't stopped mass shootings from happening 294 times this year. #UCCShooting shouldn't be routine. #GunSenseLaws
@SenateMajLdr What the He77 good are thoughts & prayers? STOP repeated gun violence with PROPER gun control laws! @NRA #UCCShooting
@SenateMajLdr Lynette
The best way you can convey your true feeling on the issue is to vote against the NRA and for the people
@SenateMajLdr You need to be voted out of office! Votes count people. Show this NON leader how you feel at the next election! #UCCshooting
@SenateMajLdr  What will it take for Senate to enact gun control?  Would you be so unwilling if it was your kids slaughtered today?
@SenateMajLdr Instead of thinking about it, do something meaningful to stop these massacres. We need gun control now! Stand up to NRA!
@SenateMajLdr the Senate,s thoughts are with the victims ,But r daily thought is with @NRA and their Contribution to our Bank Account.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Call the shooting for what it is a religious killing ! An attack on American soil , radical Islam !
@SenateMajLdr  Your insincerity is demonstrated by your bought and paid for inaction. #guncontrol #schoolshooting

@Blob_Fish @therealdburnett @NRA @SenateMajLdr I like the way you say things!!! Straight to the point!!
@SenateMajLdr The Prez speech will be about this sad reoccurring situation and then he pivots as another reason for gun control.  Lib prgda!
@nocoolaidpls @SenateMajLdr  Yes!  Because this is why we need gun control!  Stop the massacres!
@Montgomery_bjm @SenateMajLdr Fact is every city like Chicago that has tight gun control laws has higher murder rates.  Criminals have guns!
@SenateMajLdr Too bad your votes aren't. Talk is cheap. Try leading for a change. #UCCShooting
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Shame on u. Stop sending ur freakin "thoughts & prayers" over&over&over. Pass some responsible gun control
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress OMG. You have nerve...Congress can work to prevent this horror but refuses. Congress can stop
@dberl0909 @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress We have most Corrupted politicians,they sell their wife for the money watch @ House of Card.
@SenateMajLdr Maybe Congress could actually do something about this serious issue?
@SenateMajLdr Yeah, sure they are. Lip service only. If u cared you'd do something about the 2A. #AmericasGreedyBastardClub
@SenateMajLdr more blood on your hands, sir
@SenateMajLdr Prayers would be more helpful
@senatemajldr Maybe u are saddened by the deaths, but your actions show u don't care about innocent loss of life so long as the NRA is happy
@senatemajldr Just making whomever pays for your re-election happy.  That's been yours and most politicians jobs for too long.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Maybe you should have some foresight n care about future tragedies. Pass gun control n rid us of assault guns.
@SenateMajLdr what about the babies killed at planned parenthood are you're thoughts with the babies? That you just funded pph to kill.
@SenateMajLdr school shootings in 2015: 45. Prayers aren't the answer. #UCCShooting
@Iamwhoismoses @SenateMajLdr Praying = Doing nothing. It's easy and it makes people who don't really care pretend like they are helping.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress the senate's thoughts, but not its votes.
@SenateMajLdr Then do something.
@SenateMajLdr If so, then do something about gun-violence, please.
@SenateMajLdr 
What happened in OREGON? I LOVE OREGON. LIVED THERE & WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL...SUNSET APOLLOS.
