@SenateMajLdr @POTUS then what exactly was up with not waiting until Scalia's body was chilled to announce your obstruction??
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @POTUS they already had a voice. Twice. They picked Obama. Do your constitutionally required job, Senator.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS no Mr Turtle, Obama is doing his job. YOU SHOULD TOO.
@SenateMajLdr @BrooklynMoishe @POTUS Good for the POTUS!  He has more support than you know; ''people for democracy"
@dprang @potus @senatemajldr if it was so wouldn't he rather suggest someone who shares his ideologies?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS You are politicizing bec u cant stand the idea of losing the CITIZENS UNITED 5-4 partisan majority that brought ruin
@SenateMajLdr you politicized it when you refused to even hold a hearing. @POTUS is fulfilling his constitutional obligation, unlike you.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Do your job! You're getting paid regularly, aren't you? #ConfirmGarland
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress #doyourjobMitch
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress and you are no better by holding Congress hostage. Put on your big boy pants and #DoYourJob

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress That u represent Ky says it all! u should be jailed for not doing ur job ! What a hateful ignorant man
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS And your planned response the entire time wasn't politicized?  GOP is more interested in politics than accomplishments.
@SenateMajLdr No, sir, politicizing is what you are doing. Pres. Obama is doing his job. You & your cronies r just being hateful. #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS the GOP senate did that when they showed how racist they are #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS We see what Obama is doing.  He is a lame duck pontus.  Stand Strong Sen. McConnell, we are standing with you
!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS then call his bluff and confirm - the ball is in your court
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS And We The People are not required to keep people in office that don't do their job.
@SenateMajLdr You showed your cards on this matter hours after Scalia's death by suggesting nobody would be approved. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS You, sir, are politicizing this just as much.  We know how the game works.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Bull. You're the one politicizing it. Do your job and stop projecting what you do onto others.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS See his nominee and raise him double...
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS nice try McConnell but nope, you see it that way, because that's what you doing
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Or because he knew the other party would politicize it? #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Mr. McConnell, youâ€™ve been politicizing this from the beginning. #hypocrite
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Pot, call kettle black.
That's why you got stuck with Trump.Years of obstruction.
@SenateMajLdr betting it was more for the good of the country, seeing how @POTUS has done nothing but fight against your partisan politics
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Wow. You are refusing to uphold your constitutional responsibilities. Treasonous. Move to Russia. You'd fit right in.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS It is the responsibility is imbued to the office by the #Constitution. You are falling into a trap that will lose votes
@SenateMajLdr not leadership
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS The republicans are the only ones politicizing the process. He's doing his job. Time for you to do yours. #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS at least hes doing his JOB!!YOU should try it MITCH!!!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS GOP antics have resulted in gridlock and once again you are "proud" because you won't #DoYourJob?!?  Are you KIDDING?!?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS He nominated someone incredibly well-qualified with superb bipartisan credentials. Enough GOP cynicism. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS I can see why your leader,not only can you count votes you can read minds
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS and you are blocking this nominee not with the intent of helping our country, but with the intent of blocking progress
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Maybe some of YOUR voter base buys your BS, but the rest of us don't. Stop insulting our intelligence and #DoYourJob!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS McConnell, you make Republicans look bad all on your own. Do the job you were elected to do. Vote on SCOTUS.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS do your job senator we are tired of your obstructionism
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS
"(POTUS) SHALL nominate..." Not may but SHALL. Please look up SHALL in a dictionary. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS He's following the constitution. You're not. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS You have this backwards.  Since you can't do your job we will find people that will.  Good bye Mitch
@SenateMajLdr are you insane? That is literally the job of the @POTUS .It is his responsibility to do this. Do your job.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS if he wanted to politicize it, he would have appointed a more divisive candidate. He did the right thing; you are not.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS As somebody yelled at the first SOTU address: YOU LIE. Democrats always voted for nominees. ALWAYS.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS And you're NOT politicizing this? Don't pretend as though it is anything else. DO YOUR JOB.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS He's doing his job. When are you going to start doing yours?
@SenateMajLdr you politicized this by making any comments before a nominee was even being considered @POTUS
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS The GOP Senators are the ones politicizing this. You need only do your job, not make judgments. Dangerous Precedent!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Uh, sorry, No. He did it because it's his JOB under the US Constitution. So #DoYourJob Sir.
.@SenateMajLdr @POTUS That is laughable, Yertle.

#DoYourJobMitch
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS did the people's vote in 2012 not count or something?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS them? You mean him? POTUS selected a moderate & you would not begin the proceedings. Stop the obstructionist BULLSHIT.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS because the man he tapped is so unqualified?
@SenateMajLdr YOU politicized it the moment Scalia died. Obama has a responsibility to nominate a replacement and you have a duty to vote.
.@SenateMajLdr Obama did his job. You politicized it the second Scalia died. You are a sad strange little man. And you have by pity.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS No, senator, our President is carrying out the duties of the presidency. YOU are politicizing it. Move on the nominee.
@POTUS is doing his job by nominating. @SenateMajLdr is just playing politics.
@SenateMajLdr @SurvivorMed @POTUS 
Political shananagins suck don't they.
You guys are all so good at it though.
Fuck what the people want.
@wedjim from my viewpoint the people do not want a Nominee that does not support #2A and this one does not.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS mr. McConnell you were sent to Washington to do a job now do it
@SenateMajLdr quit the bullshit and DO YOUR JOB!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Luck you, then call his bluff and confirm Garland.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Senator, your hypocrisy is sickening.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS He might as well, since you have no intention of confirming a candidate even if they are qualified.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS As usual, the @GOP is the party of obstructionists 
#DoYourJob
#SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr Have you no decency, Sir?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Must be nice to sit back and enjoy our taxes without doing your damn job. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Senator I hope you keep your word. My children deserve more than debt ridden country with loss of basic freedoms
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Yes, knowing that it would expose you for irrationally opposing him against all logic
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Whatever the reason, you are embarrassing yourself and all Republican Congresspeople right now #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS put up a strong nom. Seems like you are the one politicizing this. Stop embarrassing your constituents  #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr YOU are obstructing so you can maybe get a nominee from a GOP pres instead of Obama. So, WHO is politicizing this? #DoYourJob

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS please.. Your the one politicizing it.. #donothingcongress and you wonder how Trump happened.
@SenateMajLdr Mitch... You are the one politicizing this. @POTUS did his job.  You aren't doing yours because of politics.  This is all you.

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS SHUT UP AND DO YOUR JOB.

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS - He picked a guy, YOU already approved. #DoYourJob
.@SenateMajLdr @POTUS You're blatantly politicizing it by not even considering voting on it
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS or he did it because he took an oath to uphold the constitution...
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS  your actually the one politicizing this whole process... #goptraitor
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS it's actions like this that make people turn to an idiot like Trump. Your party deserves him.
@SenateMajLdr and other members of Congress
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS no, he was doing his job, just like you should!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Or, maybe he was just doing the job he was elected to do....
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Or because it's his job, a work ethic you seem to lack.

@SenateMajLdr this is your JOB. #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS Really McConnell? POTUS is politicizing this nomination? POTUS?!

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @POTUS Huh?  Could you not confirm Garland?  What am I missing?  Ball is in the Senate's court. #glasshouse

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS laughable. POTUS appointing one for an open seat is political, but refusing to consider anyone is not?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Well if you don't do your job that strategy looks darn good.
.@SenateMajLdr .@McConnellPress Bring It...
@POTUS made this #SCOTUSnominee because it's a part of his job. @SenateMajLdr is the one politicizing it, and for no good reason.

@SenateMajLdr its always projection with you GOPrs.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Says the guy politicizing it first w/ intent to never approve, vote, nor hear any nominee no matter who #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS no see, you did that when you came out and said you wouldnt even consider whoever he nominated. So do your fucking job
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Actually he is following the constitution and doing his job. Foreign concepts to you Republicans.
.@SenateMajLdr .@Senate_GOPs Nothing but #GOPlies and #GOPspin. Rs had no issue with nominee before. but NOW, so who's politicizing it?
.@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Yes, because what you just said totally makes sense.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS are you out of your mind?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Refusing to even consider his nomination or give him a hearing. Do your job!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Are you fucking kidding McConnell?!? You and the Republicans are the ones politicizing his nomination by
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS I believe the people spoke when they elected the @POTUS. Do your job, the @POTUS is doing his.
@SenateMajLdr
So you're advocating @realDonaldTrump or @HillaryClinton make this nomination instead?
Do your job. @POTUS did his.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Wrong! Heâ€™s doing his job per Constitution now #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @POTUS Said the real culprit in politicizing. Terrible Senator. At long last....
@SenateMajLdr Scalia's body was barely cold before YOU announced that you would reject any nominee. YOU politicized this. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS EVERYTHING you have done since PRESIDENT OBAMA took office has been POLITICIZED. MCCONNELL BELONGS IN PRISON 4 TREASON
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @POTUS Guess you don't do anything political?  Tume for term limits.  You are overpaid & useless

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Tweet less, do your job more or resign! I'm sick of Democrats and Republicans in Congress not fulfilling their duties
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS GOP totally politicizing this, not #POTUS. So you're willing to take chance on idiot #Trump nominating next justice?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @Senate_GOPs To continue to blame your shabby policy decisions on Biden and POTUS demonstrates only your obstruction!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS So then have the hearings and don't confirm him.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Do ur job or resign! Garland deserves even more respect heading Court that handles Congress vs WH disputes!
@SenateMajLdr @EvilConservativ @POTUS Keep Your Word  - No Vote For SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr YOU ARE THE ONLY ONES POLITICIZING IT
.@SenateMajLdr I am going to German suplex your cartoon turtle ass through the carving station at a Capitol Hill brunch
