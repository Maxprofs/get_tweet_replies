Why don't you put together a committee of health care professionals and health care users to come up with a viable health care system?!
How sad, I  see a whole bunch of old white men desperate for anything they can claim as a victory. Shameful
Murderers.
This is the wrong way to treat Americans. Why do you hate the middle class and the poor SO much!
What's the rush?  Why not hold public hearings so WE can decide if WE like your HC?  You do work for US! It's OUR lives your playing with!
Getting close guys! Getting close! Go! GO!!!
you are the FAILURES that need to be replaced
YOU NEED TO BE VOTED OUT!  Swamp dweller!
All medical groups decry it, no hearings, no CBO rating, cynical attempt to win
,stop the BS.
We demand a full Repeal of Obama care !!!!
Why don't I deserve the same level of healthcare that Sen. McConnell receives?
When are they going to allow the people the chance to put forward their own thoughts on potential options and open it up to a national vote?
So sad the little men are trying to destroy America and what she stands for by taking away ACA!  All need to #resign!  VOTE all OUT!
There is no replacement. You are going to hurt more Americans then any enemy ever did... in the millions. Think about that before you vote.
Small business is hurting because of Obamacare DO SOMETHING PASS THIS BILL, get your chamber in order OR RESIGN RESIGN NO MORE FAILURE
You are a disgusting human being.  Work for a bipartisan solution to fix the problems.
Bunch of trollbots pushing their objections to this with their pre-programmed responses.
Believe it only when or if it happens
You have an odd definition of failed. And leadership.
I hope for the sake of millions of Americans a few compassionate Republicans will step up again and stand with working people.
WE THE PEOPLE don't want this!
Disgraceful! Republican Party is no longer the Grand Old Party.  Just rich old men with hateful hearts now.
You have nothing better
Vast majority of Americans don't want this. Do you care? No?
The killing field will follow if it passes. It's a tax cut bill and all of you don't seem to care how many you hurt in the process. DYA
Hey Mcdickhead I see ur back trying to repeal Aca. I guess u still don't care about the people who r going to die because of this bill.
Hey I am sure you are taking this plan. I say just go to the emergency room don't pay the bill
When all else fails people can go to the emergency room . Then we all pay I hope you are all getting this plan waiting to see
we, doctors, & hospitals love the ACA, it saves lives,  cures cancer, provides preventive care, and prevents bankruptcy. shame on you!
Praying it fails. Vote you out all of you.
Ditch all of you Rhinos!!!!




Outrageous that HHS won't say who paid for these flights. At a time when health care overhaul on the table.  http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/19/tom-price-chartered-planes-flights-242908 …
Mitch you have to get rid of healthcare so you can pay for Price to travel by private jet, I knew there was something to this.
Need to replace Graham, Cassidy and Mitch. Congress should have the same health care as the people you rep.
#TrumpCare is dangerous legislation that will harm Americans. Pushingbitbthroughnin this way will damage our republic. Shame on you.
@McConnellPress R U really that out of touch with KY to push for Graham-Cassidy??? Listen to @RandPaul he has the best ideas and my vote!
What the hell is wrong with you GOPers? REPEAL!
You are a Failed Senator...
Wait till you face constituents & and inform thousands they are losing their health care. The coal minors will be devastated.
#hypocrite
Vote them out the old geezers
Old white Christian dudes with taxpayer funded healthcare don't want their taxpayers to not have healthcare, bloody bastards.
#GrahamCassidy #RepealAndReplace: No.
#MedicareForAll: Winner, winner:  dinner.
#Obamacare = #ACA § 1312
 history notes your position.
Will you resign if you fail to deliver? It's more than just talk you realize.  You are talking it to death.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Do stay alive by hiding the hearts of  uninsured babies in your neck pouch? #repealandgofuckyourself
Why do you guys lie? #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
Constantly

Sen @BillCassidy called our reading of his health care bill on pre-existing conditions false. Here’s how we read it: http://n.pr/2fAWevD  https://twitter.com/BillCassidy/status/910316563047337984 …
Why do you hate Americans? #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Stunning

Katy Tur: there are no protections for essential health care benefits in Graham-Cassidy…
