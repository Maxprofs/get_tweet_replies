If only blame could save innocent lives, & not just the jobs of cowardly Senators from the majority Party.
#shameless
Majority has nothing to do with it. Need 60 for amendment and nothing but cowards on left side
Why should #GOP oppose Murphy's proposal?
bcuz it wouldn't stop any bad guys, even Senator Murphy admitted it. Pure political theater.
Why shouldn't anyone be able to legally buy a bazooka?
OK.. I'll bite.. Why not?
What statute prevents it, & why is it deemed Constitutional?
NFA 1934 prevents it.  #2A says Arms.. Not this type or that type.. Just arms.
@RealBPhil @SenateDems Sorry bud, but giving the FBI 72 hours to investigate a no-fly gun purchase is moot given internet sales
Internet sales which are not private face-to-face require an FFL + BG check under existing law.
Nope.
Thanks. I've been misreading the ATF regs. This is good news. Now to get Congress to stop meddling in the intrastate commerce of HG.
If you go all nutters and kill a bunch of people now that you can get guns, please don't give me credit.
I've been able to get guns no prob. Every one I own, in addition to my CCW, were obtained after a BG check, except for 1 inherited.
Not sure why getting guns without a BG check is good news then. You just don't like driving to the store?
I can actually buy w/o a (new) BG check from FFL. CCW as Alternate.
Article I + Section 8 & 10A. I like limits on Congress.
hahaha! Who don't think is buying this crap u just sent out?! The GOP bills written by NRA were total bullshit!
Because they involved a court, a judge, and a probable cause hearing?
if u really want to know the time frame limit was ludicrous and if u have probable cause -already b n cus
Then you're still saying we should deny rights (ones you dislike) to people we shouldn't even arrest.
I'm ok w gun ownership but not w a gun free for all.Ur ok w suspected terrorist buying guns?Mentally ill?
"suspected", yes. Otherwise, like you said, they'd be in custody already. I happen to appreciate trials.
sorry but as the mum of 2 young children if our government"suspects"being a terrorist U should Not b able
That's a lot of faith. In people that already put newborns on these lists.

we demand @HillaryClinton is called back to testify under oath! This is not right! @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump
It's a little hard to say Democrats voted something down when you clowns have the majority.
R's do not have a 60 vote majority to pass anything they want. They need D's for cloture votes.
Oh well.  They created the 60 vote threshold for 8 years.  Why are they complaining?
You don't get to be this upset https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/745030474339323905 … about something then vote no on a similar bill.
.@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.
I agree. So conservatives should not be upset.
It proves @SenateDems are not serious about gun control further than using it as a campaign issue and fundraising.
Typical conservative clown answer.  Disappear clown.
