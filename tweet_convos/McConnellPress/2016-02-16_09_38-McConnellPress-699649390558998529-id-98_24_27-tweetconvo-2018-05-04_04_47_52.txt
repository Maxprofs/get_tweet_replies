What happened to "up or down votes, no matter who the president is, no matter who controls the Senate",@SenateMajLdr?http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/23/nation/na-filibuster23 …
@SenateMajLdr Making that statement is a good thing but U will be hated if U don't stick to it.
Don't even think about it ...GOP showing signs of backing down from vow to block Obama SCOTUS pick http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/16/gop-signs-back-down-vow-block-obama-scotus-nominee/ … 
@SenateMajLdr
@ConwayGay LOL So it is obstructing if done by GOP but not if Dems do it?? Hypocrite much?  @SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr What you're trying to do is ILLEGAL and UNCONSTITUTIONAL senator. The @POTUS has a right and duty to appoint a new #SCOTUS.
@SenateMajLdr You didn't feel that way in '01.  Flipping or flopping? #DeathToTheGOP
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress the American People ALREADY HAVE HAVE HAD A VOICE. Twice! 65 million +, remember?
@SenateMajLdr in 2005U said: "perfectly legitimate" for POTUS to alter ideological direction of SCOTUS&-The-Pres&-Pres-alone-nominate-judges
@SenateMajLdr So you're saying you shouldn't have voted to confirm Kennedy in '88 and Reagan was wrong to try and appoint him.
@SenateMajLdr as far as I can see the elected President has the right to choose - not the Senate or you.
@SenateMajLdr My voice heard on the appointment of SCOTUS justices, I voted in 2012. It is the President's job to nominate, you do your job.
@SenateMajLdr Please #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr just so I have this right...you, who holds the Constitution so dear, would like #POTUS to ignore his Constitutional duties
.@SenateMajLdr We had an election. We have a Constitution. You will lose the Senate.  https://youtu.be/LPSj0jgF-_w 
@SenateMajLdr I hope you stand your ground!  The new president should select new justice.  Period.
But @SenateMajLdr, sir, what was it you said about the President's duty under the Constitution in 2005? Oh yes,...
@SenateMajLdr blah blah blah...
.@SenateMajLdr Do your job! We don't care you don't like your boss. Make stuff happen! #GOPTownHall #GOPDebate
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr grow a pair , and block any Obama nominee  , or you're  DONE ! ( REMEMBER BOEHNER! )
@SenateMajLdr WHO WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU AND YOUR CADRE OF CIRCUS MONKEYS AS NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE?? NAMES, PLEASE.
@SenateMajLdr American people voiced opinion by 5million votes, Pres Obama should nominate supreme court justice & U confirm as is UR JOB
@SenateMajLdr, it is shameful that you spoke out against the Constitution & the 2012 electorate mere minutes after the death of a justice.
@SenateMajLdr You can blame Schumer. I blame GOP obstruction & have been writing to you for several years about the low low GOP morality!
@SenateMajLdr don't sell us out again to cover your butt, the anger on the right is from failure of GOP Congress to live up to their word
@SenateMajLdr The American people did have a voice when we elected Obama twice as president.  You are violating the Constitution.
@SenateMajLdr Mr McConnell:Real Americans elected President Obama. Face the facts!
@SenateMajLdr I hope to be surprised - to see the GOP show some fortitude.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html …
@SenateMajLdr McConnell in 2008: Senate should not stop confirming judges in election year http://wapo.st/1Vjno6K 
@SenateMajLdr Who pays ur salary? US taxpayers? Or big business? Do ur duty. Vote in a new SC Justice.
@SenateMajLdr What? I couldn't hear for the shouts and swears of GOP promising to obstruct POTUS. #FUCKYOU
@SenateMajLdr The People elected @potus for a FOUR-yr term. He'll nominate a Scalia replacement. We expect you to DO YOUR JOB & vote.
@SenateMajLdr PLEASE Mr. McConnell, PLEASE block Obamas nomination. We are counting on you. Don't let us down...
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr We the people had a voice. 3 years ago. Get off your bigoted ass & let the man we chose do the job the constitution gives him!
@SenateMajLdr Do not back off.
@SenateMajLdr do your job and stop being an obstructionist hateful person. Congressional dictator.
@SenateMajLdr the constitution that Scalia adhered to so strictly says nothing about the people having a say in selecting justices you turd.
@SenateMajLdr "prioritized text and original meaning" so you're pissing on his interpretation after his death and claiming not to be.
@SenateMajLdr we have a voice, we elected Obama, stop obstructing gov't!
@SenateMajLdr we have made our choice as to who should made the choice and that is President Obama. you racist
@SenateMajLdr Everyone hates you on both sides so do the right thing and Block it! You're the Democrat puppet on everything! Prove us wrong
.@SenateMajLdr As .@SenWarren has stated clearly, we the people do have a voice;  we elected .@POTUS in 2012.
@SenateMajLdr http://www.fireandreamitchell.com/2016/02/13/remember-democrat-blocked-scotus-miguel-estrada-for-two-years/ …
@SenateMajLdr 
Why U wanna on the  wif ur dum brayne?  U bad person.
@SenateMajLdr The people chose. Like it or not, he got voted in and it is his job to choose. Sorry, can't pick and choose rules to follow.
@SenateMajLdr you're a soft-talking radical with zero competency, good luck with your agenda!
@SenateMajLdr obstruction call into question his ability to lead Senate, blocking appointments is laziness at its apex, easier than working.
@SenateMajLdr shows his weakness & contempt for America, the only tool @gop has is to obstruct our democracy & undermine our Nation, #Limp
@SenateMajLdr Stop trying to make a joke of our political system and support the President of the United States.  IT IS SIMPLY PUT, YOUR JOB
@SenateMajLdr stick  with  your  commitment
@SenateMajLdr hey, how about you & your buddies stop acting like spoiled brats & do your damn jobs. We, the people, insist on it.   NOW.
@SenateMajLdr this is what is very true for @potus ...The wheels are now turned. @realDonaldTrump @Senate_GOPs
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr why not honor him by doing what your job is
@SenateMajLdr You & your #GOP cronies r the ones stomping on the legacy of #Scalia - serving yourselves not the people
@SenateMajLdr  The PEOPLE voted in 2008 and 2012.  Just because they did not vote for your guy, doesn't lessen that vote. #DOYOURDAMNJOB
@SenateMajLdr Why not do what the Dem senate did in 1960, pass a resolution to bar supreme court appointments during election year?
@SenateMajLdr You heard our voices loud and clear in 2008 and 2012!  Now listen to them!!
@SenateMajLdr The American People had a voice - that's what elections are for. Do your damn job.
@SenateMajLdr The American People did have a voice in the current nominee, they elected Obama.
You read this shit?

@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr @RandPaul Yous shoulda WON2012 Pres election 2control nomination to the Supreme Court-but you LOST..SO
@SenateMajLdr ...You make these grandiose statements then surrender..Cowardly GOP leadership is responsible for the popularity of Trump.
@SenateMajLdr : If you want to respect Scalia's love of the Constitution, you should abide by it and allow the nomination process to work.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress   You've finally gone off the deep end, McConnell.
@SenateMajLdr U represent ALL of us, not just ur party. If u can't, please leave, u don't serve us or the Constitution
.@SenateMajLdr  If @POTUS chimed in first with: "I'm passing this onto the next pres.", you'd accuse him of neglecting his office! FFS!
@SenateMajLdr The people do have a voice @POTUS was elected by the people. He just isn't in your political party & u are hoping for a change
@SenateMajLdr read this https://medium.com/@cmclymer/scalia-was-confirmed-right-before-election-day-452447e734b1#.8jjgv3yya …
@SenateMajLdr How about waiting for the Current Pres to first noniate a person before jumping in. There is a process under US Law.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress  YOU DO THIS AT YOUR OWN PERIL,AND YOUR PARTY'S ,NEVER FORGET .
@SenateMajLdr hypocrite.
@SenateMajLdr @MarkRuffalo LR article written by A. Mitchell McConnell, Jr. https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST/pdf/GPO-CHRG-REHNQUIST-4-23-1.pdf …  #yourownwords
@SenateMajLdr Does this mean that you support direct elections to SCOTUS? If you want to give the American people a voice...
@SenateMajLdr I AM AN AMERICAN PERSON.  I voted for Obama- twice. I have a voice.  You need to respect MY voice. #POTUSISPOTUS
@SenateMajLdr "Article II, Section 2 clearly provides that the President, and the President alone, nominates judges"
-You in 2005
@SenateMajLdr What we really need is for you to go next, good lord that would be the ONLY good thing you could do for the USA
@SenateMajLdr please send condolences to the constitution also as it calls for the president to nominate judges
@SenateMajLdr Again, the exact opposite of what youy said last time. Eat dye and shit blue, Yertle.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Would you have this position if Romney were President?
@SenateMajLdr you honor Scalia by ignoring the peoples votes in 2012 and refuse to perform your constitutional duties. #Irony #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress thank you! This will make more than half the country very happy. as always pay no attention to the loud msm
@SenateMajLdr The American people Do have a voice and it elected @POTUS President Obama TWICE. Or can't you count? DO your damn job old man!
@SenateMajLdr You should be calling for an independent investigation, but you won't.
@JoePesky @SenateMajLdr LOL man ppl are dumb. They did one in Texas already. Why waste more $? #gop is good at frivolous things that waste
@JoePesky his personal physician doesn't argue w/ it. Texas, where foul play was ruled as "absolutely not a factor" gop and their unicorns
