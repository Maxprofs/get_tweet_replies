So you're going to move ahead and #ImpeachTrump then? Excellent!
On what grounds?
High crimes and misdemeanors, eh?
Proven guilty when? Or is "innocent until proven guilty" not in the lefts vocabulary anymore?
During the impeachment proceedings, that's what they are for. It's like a trial. Look it up!
When is this taking place?
Soon, we hope!

In case it seems kind of complex, you could read this:

GROW a backbone & #ImpeachTrumpNow  He DOESN'T represent American values.Banning transgenders from serving our country? Pardoning criminals.
You need to add BLM and ANTIFA for the hate groups.
What about Antifa? You should  condemn them also
I can tell that most of the people tweeting are anti-tromp

You stay on the sidelines and only give lip service makes you 100% complicit and supportive of RACISM. That's what History will record!
Trump is not racists.
With Hitler he would paint stories of the Poles-raping women against a pole. Trump does this with immigrants. Stories of them slicing women.
Your President winks and gives the very low down signal that there are good people in the KKK, Neo Natis, and other hate groups, okaying..
Be a real American.
Why not, YOUR President leads the way to hate and intolerance. Stand up to HIM or let someone who will lead for KY!
Ok,  so now denounce trump for supporting this hatred. Stop your trump over Country attitude.  Enough that your wife will stand next to him
R we going to change the constitution because of a few A HOLES? If so let's do it. But get ready for Pandora's box.
And by A holes I mean kkk and the likes.
Here is my statement do not raise them up! Do not acknowledge them. Do not cover them in the media.
Is that all you got! Why didn't you call out @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Are Country isn't safe. #StandUpToTrump
Yawn. @gop has courted these voters 4 years. What are u going to DO? We know u  hate @POTUS & it's mutual. ACTIONS - ur words r meaningless.

The tears, as I watched this. This is the hate #Trump defends   - 
Now stand up taller and start a move to REMOVE THE PRESIDENT
2 late u @PRyan @mike_pence @VP @GOP hitch ur Wagon 2 Trump backed him just 2 win noing how he was. #ImpeachTrumpPenceRyanMcConnell @cnn
Pick a side Senator. The American people who r against neo nazis and white supremacist or POTUS who is obviously one of them! POTUS must go!
Pontius washes his hands; imagine this dupe could be our @POTUS soon #ImpeachTrump #Resist @Resistance_Feed
@jaketapper your wife stands by Trump
And you will not take any action to condemn a racist, incompetent president?  Sorry to bother you.
SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF SAYING WHAT MAKES YOU LOOK GOOD TO MEDIA
Support a Nazi. Nope.
Time to impeach and replace otherwise GOP is doomed!
You need to name @realDonaldTrump in your statement ... why is that so hard?
YOU have responsibility to stand against hate- demand Trump resign! You & wife will go down as collaborators. #ImpeachTrump
And ZERO about the @POTUS giving cover to white supremacists while your wife giggled coquettishly at his side. "I stand by my man," indeed.
you have to stand up & take action. This country deserves a real President. Work on impeaching Trump now!
When will members of @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan call out @realDonaldTrump for HIS VOCAL SUPPORT OF RACISTS!
When will you denounce the Nazi in the White House?
He won't. Trump must have something on him.
Putin has something on him. Don't worry, it's Mueller time.
and what if Mueller finds nothing impeachable?  we are counting on a lot from this & we may get nothing...then what???
How many months w/ nothing?????
Seven. And in seven months......nothing.
Nothing from nothing = nothing
Takes time to untangle all the grifters. You'll see.

Say his name.
Say her name too. #HeatherHayer

Your leader is inspiring this hatred. Emboldening. He is a bigot #ImpeachTrump #RemoveTrump It is your DUTY Trump is a bigot like his father
Sadly, it was those values that helped get DT elected.
So when are you going to stand up to the nazis in the White House? If you can't do your job, resign!
Senator a major problem is Trump is a neo-Nazi sympathizer who happens to be the prez this is an abomination  People will not tolerate this
All talk, no action still results in THIS@
Actually the democrats invented the KKK and Hillary's mentor sen bird is a klansman
So delusional
No your delusional
Lindsey Graham 
Speaker Ryan

Kasich 
Jeff Bush 
Cowards ! Traitors

@conservative132
Yes they all NEED TO GO!! Have y'all heard Ryan, McCain, McConnell, and some more are getting paid thru Hillary

Poll: Mitch McConnell Has Lowest Approval Rating of Elected Official with National Profile: 19% http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/24/poll-mitch-mcconnell-has-lowest-approval-rating-of-elected-official-with-national-profile-19/ …
If trump us not stopped soon, he will pardon all who are being investigated for crimes against democracy!
By stand against hope you mean counter protesters who feel compelled to be counted? This JEW will stand against them ANYWHERE they show up!
Thank you for your statement.  Now get that embarrassment in the White House to resign. Doing less condones the violence and hate groups.
Dallas shootings suspect Micah Johnson with his fist raised in what is known as the "black power" stance.  Obama said nothing.

you are not a leader McConnell.. your eyes are firmly looking at your shoes and not the horizons of the American Spirit.. just stay home.. A
You are a coward! Stand up for America and kick this racist nazi out of the WHYou will still have Pence to do your dirty work!#ImpeachTrump
Blah blah blah - by not opposing @realDonaldTrump, you're complicit.
#NazisInTheWhiteHouse #hypocrite #NaziInChief #ImpeachTrumpNow
Will you also publicly condemn black lives matter, antifa and all extreme leftists who actually started the violence at #Charlottesville?
Ok, more terrorism in Berkley and attacks on free speech.  Where are you two fools on condemning? Cricket speech for you!
It is a technique. Do not forget he kept a Hitler book of speeches by his bedside. He is truly a dangerous horrible man #ImpeachTrump
Trump has more Character in his pinky than you my Friend.
Better watch out for those liberal hate groups that destroy property and damage people everywhere they go! Oh, do you two fund them! MAGA!
And you are now standing by @POTUS having pardoned Arpaio and banning transgender troops. It shows that you are supporting hateful ideology!
Five Dallas police officers killed by BLM supporter.
#Congress @SenateGOP @SenateDems MUST censure Maria Chappelle-Nadal!
She should be removed from office and investigated by the Secret Service. Where is the MSM outcry?
Trump deals in rhetoric that is hateful -scapegoating. I have studied WWII history extensively. He follows Hitler's playbook. For shame
https://goo.gl/XVlQXp  #spacedout Je suis programmé pour vous admirer pendant $val $unit
You bring a club to a peaceful protest.
MSM PRETENDS JESUS CHRIST WAS  THERE TURNING BOTH CHEEKS.. 
THIS IS WHO WAS REALLY THERE..
BLM ARE KNOWN COP KILLERS..NOT PEACEFUL AT ALL.
Frightening...so what are Baltimore citizens with kids in school DOING about this??
Did it take you so long because you had to run the statement by Charles and David Koch?
UR president has pardoned a racist so he can avoid facing justice. U unleashed this monster on our country. UR condoning it. UR responsible.
Support POTUS
Do your job 
We don't care about NeoNazis
Do your job
We don't care about Russia 
Do your job
Hate groups come in all colors and political stripes.
Still waiting for u to condemn Antifa violence in Berkeley and other places!  No problem criticizing @POTUS though, right?
All you have people tweeting are Democrats against trump

We've been covering Joe Arpaio for more than 20 years. Here's a couple of things you should know about him... 1/many
I agree as far as you went. You failed to mention Antifa.  PC fear or ignorance?

Breaking: Scuffle ensues between antifa and police outside North Center courthouse 

... a country divide. There is nothing you can do about that, but make no mistake that's what you've got.
https://twitter.com/master_gutmann/status/902564915893768192 …
You must oppose it on all sides! You should have supported @POTUS and his remarks. He was putting the blame where it belonged-on both sides!

Peaceful protest bring pepper spray
Wow there must be al lot of us racist to include @AlvedaCKing . Because we condemn ALL hate and violence as does @realDonaldTrump
Condem being against ALL violence. Does that make u complicite in black supremacy violence ANTIFA BLM. You seem to accept that. ALL is wrong

You can stop it. @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr & the @GOP are the ones in America who have the power to stop the supremacist misogynist 45.
Not enough! Until U name potus and denounce HIS SUPPORT for racism, Nazi, white supremacy, you are enabling him & those groups!  SHAM ON GOP
You did this. You created it. You fanned the flames. You need to own your part of this.
Why'd it take you so long to respond? @AlisonForKY beat you to it. Why won't you call out @POTUS specifically for equivocating?
Amendment 25 - PLEASE! We need courage from our Senators! Please find it and stand up to him. I beg you!
There are no good presidents that defend Nazis.
Repudiate the president...America is lead by a nazi and @GOP JUST SITS THERE
You hold the power to impeach trump for his hate speech. Get to work
Statements with no action are bullshit, as will be your legacy unless and until @SpeakerRyan and you #ImpeachTrumpNow
Politicians who say they're outraged over Donald Trump's disgusting behavior, but do so in the 3rd party, are absolute cowards!
#SayHisName
You have AGAIN...taken the WRONG side!  If you do not support our PRESIDENT....STEP DOWN!
words are easy.  so what are you going to DO?  disallow ALL guns at any public demonstration.  i am outgunned when supremacists advocate war
WOW! Talk about too little too late!! Shame on you!!
Turtle, YOU are a hate group. Go back to your pond.
Glad you had so much time to work on this statement - no like the Senate is actually doing anything...
No removal of Conf Statues in KY. STAND UP  for Once !!! TELL Jim Gray NO !!!
DO SOMETHING ABOUT @realDonaldTrump! You literally do have the power to stop him. Enough words. It's time for action. #25thAmendmentNow
No room for hate unless it comes from the president, then we must give him a chance 
It's great 2 condemn hate groups; words are easy, actions are harder. What you need to do now is take a moral stand & rid us all of Trump.
Now is the time to remove 45 from office. Take that Nazi sympathizer out of the office! You will never have more support from the people.
this is your group too Mitch. We all remember.
Good start! now say his name.
Support our President by shutting up and getting something done
If you really cared you would #ImpeachTrump #TrumpIsANazi
Start by condemning Trump.   #GrowSomeBalls
Antifa & BLM are HATE GROUPS
And still, absolutely no condemnation of  trump himself by name!  You have no cojones Mr  McConnell. #Coward #NotALeader #PartyOverCountry
Nice try coward
Can you finally respect *all* Americans? Will you have the moral courage at last to denounce the man who gives aid and comfort to these?
WHY DO WE KEEP HAVING TO PROVE WE ARE NOT RACISTS? DEMS PLAY YOU LIKE A FIDDLE.
You should remove the word "Leader" from your title.
Where is your statement against BLM n Black supremacy who are kill white americans n cops? Doesn't white lives mater as much as Black lives
Sir You are now grandfather and must know that Alt-left and ALT-RIGHT WERE INVOLVED. BLAME BOTH SIDES EXCEPT YOU ARE HIDING SOMETHING
Too little, too late #Coward. Your statement carries zero weight until you #DenounceAndRemoveTrump Why are you stalling? #TheResistance
Please begin impeachment on that fraud in the WH. He must not represent this country!!!
You refuse to take a stand against trump...You will regret...In 2018 he will be the scarlet letter on your forehead.
Until u r willing to step up and condemn YOUR 'President''s shameful equivocation on this, your empty condemnation of these groups is BS!
Voted for you.....too bad.
Statements are nice, but we need action.  trump must go and you must work towards this goal!  Protect the American people!
Grow a pair and toss this clown out of office!  #racistpresident
WE DUN STAND FOR BIGOTRY OR HATRED!
McConnell:  Totally blew opportunity of a lifetime.  Time to get out swampy
You and #RINO #Kasich are both losers and weak leaders. Leave #POTUS alone or suffer at the ballot box. We're just getting started. #MAGA 
Joke. Nothing.
Too little too late. You should denounce @POTUS immediately. Call to action is now.
@SpeakerRyan Too little, too late!! As a Republican I abhor your placing a tax agenda above the moral future of our country
Time to demand Maria Chappelle- Danal
Are you kidding?  Is the GOP more important than the Country?  Call out trump by name.  If you can't then you are no different.  Coward!

NEW POLL: McConnell's approval rating plummets to 18 percent in Kentucky http://hill.cm/3REFv2t  
Why does Matt Jones know about a rally but police say they don't. My friend works by the statues. She deserves to know.
Mitch, you don't give a shit about anything except trying to remain in favor with voters. You suck.
Nazi and KKK are animals, why sir have you not stated in public the same for groups like ANTIFA, BLM, and the cong prog that perpetuate this
Say it to his face.  SAY IT TO HIS FACE.  Say it to Trump.
This is THE REALITY of Trump's inability to represent ALL Americans 
Now when exactly are you and Ryan going 2grow a set and stand up 4 true Republican values against the racist maniac that hijacked ur party.
So stand like a man with a moral conscience and do something about the scourge you call president! #ImpeachTrump
Try to stop this madness!
Call it by its name. Your president is a racist and by not naming him so are you
Go away you fool! We don't care about your bashing of our President! Get back to work on things that we do care about! MAGA! TAX CUTS!
Chicken didn't say Trump name ballless, you are guilty and responcible for what happened and what will keep happening.
This is a start. 
Please call on them to ACT by censuring Trump and supporting the Voting Rights Act amendment. #ActionsNotWords
#PutHisNameOnIt call 45 out for his bigotry and white supremacists loving man that he is!

1) @SpeakerRyan We deserve an answer - do you and Speaker Ryan support & condone Antifa and their violence? @POTUS was exactly right to
And....?
Pompous failed "leader."
President Trump did not say there were good neo Nazis. Listened several times. He said not all whites there were bad at the rally were bad.
Important u look to who is inciting such violence.  Impeachment is only answer to save republicans
Means nothing until you disavow your party's leader. #humiliationcompoundeddaily
"We all have a responsibility to stand against hate and violence, wherever it raises its evil head." Does this include the White House?

U also condemn 6mil Jews dying in Europe in the 30's, '40s. But you know they weren't killed in a natural disaster, right?! #codemnnazitrump
If you denounce one group and not the other, you're part of the problem.

@SpeakerRyan   25th Amendment
I don't think she was a card carrying clan member
This is an America you helped create.
Get something done!!! For a change!!!!
I've disagreed with you on nearly every issue, but at least in this statement I can concur. Maybe try to explain this to @realDonaldTrump
You better clue in President whatshisname.
2. neo Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans
#impeach45
Thank you Sir.
Time for the McConnell to disavow Antifa! And Repeal Obamacare! McConnell needs to support his President!
Not good enough. Name @realDonaldTrump. Call him out for siding with Nazis and #ImpeachTrump
It hasn't gone unnoticed that our leaders in the @GOP STILL cannot bring themselves to denounce the president BY NAME!
McConnell is Republican leadership and his state receives more federal welfare pmts, than any other state in the union.  McConnell IS SWAMP
