You are corrupt, treasonous, the WORST of our nation. SHAME!

Garland had no opposition on earlier appointments either and what happened to his up or down vote? Hypocrite.
Since when did you give a shit about what Democrats say?
What about Merrick Garland? 
Who?  Oh yea, that guy under the Biden rule. To bad 
so was Garland. You are a hypocrite.
The same was true of Merrick Garland.
What about Merrick Garland? Your hypocrisy is disgusting and the #GOP will suffer for it in 2018  and 2020
harder for a greedy rich corrupt puppet to make it into heaven. THANK GOD for this You and Gorsuch aren't going

I wouldn't bet on it.
Putins puppet
buddy-how about #garland?

Screwed yourself due to Merrick Garland's treatment.

No. gorsuch is an illegitimate nominee. you stole rightful nominee Garland.

Yes thats what we the American people need another crook that make decisions that only benefits the GOP
you better get him confirmed or you are out of there. Republicans can protest your leadership. What us do it!
True Dems voted him in, now @realDonaldTrump will USE him for self gain.     @GorsuchFacts
hey, let's ask some republicans about merrick garland!
Confirm Garland like you should have done you hypocrites.
what about Garland? #300days
Excellent choice on the angling of the camera.  Keep it off the neck ;)
absolutely NOT!
He is just as qualified as was Judge Garland.
A white supremacist is easy to confirm?
Like his rulings on the disabled? I get it. Some of us are a drain on the economy.
So was Merrick Garland! Just ask the Democrats!
Yes and Gorsuch also thinks that Garland is imminently qualified yet no vote. #votethemout
Merrick Garland is the type of Judge who the Senate should have give a fair hearing and easily confirmed to #SCOTUS
Hey, @SenateMajLdr, if u resign now & cooperate w/ law enforcement, then maybe ur sentence won't b too long in #traitorklink.
#TheResistance
Look in the mirror. No, really look.
I can see in the picture, McConnell is leading a strong contingent 
just as Merrick Garland is
you are a hypocrite. You selectively follow rules and laws. You should be fired. You're bad for Kentucky.
. So was Merrick Garland, just ask Neil Gorsuch! Hypocrites
Merrick Garland is the type of pick the Senate could approve easily too. U should have talked to him.
Liar. Hypocrite.
So was Merrick Garland! Obama was actually elected by the people and not by some arcane rule based on slavery,
Hmmmm.....funny. So was Merrick Garland.
Not impressed by video.  Times have changed and NOW the BASE SCREAMS NO! Time for negotiation is over.
Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland, never forget we won't #Bigot
just like judge garland??
WRONG!  He's a corporate puppet like Scalia!  #NoRoeNoGo  #mcconnellforretirement
Merrick Garland. Remember him? I guess you work for whoever pays you the most
You say Pres can't nominate SCOTUS during last year in office. @POTUS shouldn't be able til Constitutional violations resolved
but for judge garland
he's not for women or children with disabilities, he's not for us. Period
Leader belongs nowhere near your name. Most unethical Senator yet. Your behavior is criminal.
GTH, Turtle Man!
go nuclear
but you scrapped everything Obama wanted to do. Shhh!
replace that name with Merrick Garland and you would have yourself a truthful statement... for once.
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts President Obama had the same kind of judge and were did that get him?
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts So was Garland, just ask some republicans.
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts NO tht should have been Merrick Garland
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts  and Judge Merrill Garland wasn't? Hypocrite
.@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts he's the kind of judge that will get as much consideration as Merrick Garland got - NONE
@McConnellPress With the partisan gamesmanship you brought to obstruction over the past 8-years. I hope you reap what you sow.
And Merrick Garland, why did he not get a hearing. Perhaps you can remind us all on your next TV interview Mitch
Kinda like #MerrickGarland, no?
#PrimaryThemAllOut2018, especially Mitch!
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts amazing amount of hypocrisy!  What about Merrick Garland?  Stolen seat!
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts I hope you've got a firm support mattress.  Sleeping w/o a spine or conscience must be difficult
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts yes,  agree
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts if say, you hadn't obstructed the last administration on multiple SCOTUS  &federal appointments
Fascism Forever!
.@SenateMajLdr You, sir, are a huge hypocrite. #NoJustification
@clanceman65 @GorsuchFacts  BEFORE nomination they were REFUSING HIM. THEY DON'T WANT 2WORK 4AMERICA, THEY WANT TO DESTROY IT
Like Garland?
you turn my stomach Mithciepoo.
Please place a revolver at your temple and pull the trigger.  Thank you Mitchiepoo.
We are still asking YOU, "Why did you cheat & take away Obama's right to have a hearing for his SCOTUS nominee?"
MERRICK GARLAND
so was merit garland. Were is his up down  vote?
thank god you are old
not if you're a women
McConnell delete yourself
--Hey Mitch! Payback is a bitch! Confirm Merrick Garland.... that would be the right thing to do!
You are one of the worst people to have ever lived on earth.  The worst.
So was Garland, you chinless hypocrite.
no way I hate fascists.
pretty sure that Merrick Garland was as well.  #StolenSeat #hypocrisy
like Garland, you mean?
I hope they fight you tooth and nail, you deserve all the #Resistance you get
@SenateGOP  @SenatorSchumer GOP has used sketchy procedures, lies, alt facts & delusion to pass nominees!?!?
Merrick Garland*
You will all have to answer for what you do and didn't do when you face your maker.
Mitch will you please #resign you have inflicted enough harm on this country!
he clearly is a good person. Seems not to want to politicize his role. You Swamp King did politicized the nom process. SAD
A fascist???!
you blocked a just as qualified judge for political reasons. What did you think would happen?
Just ask some Repubs about Merrick Garland. He should have had hearing but once again U put party above country #hypocrite#
They would have, but McConnell set new norm 4 partisan non-cooperation w/his deep discourtesy 2 Garland. O well!
So was Garland almost a year ago.
yep and how about Merrick Garland facts and your obstruction #StolenSeat
Probably as equal qualified as Merritt Garland was don't you think Mitch? Hypocrite!
To the intern that wrote this tweet: Is your boss always this two-faced?
now that we are fascist government  w/a supporting GOP it stands to reason u support Gorsuch another fascist!
so was #MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland for SCOTUS. #resist
#AlternativeFacts #Garland
hypocrisy pure and simple

He might be a good judge but like other people in government CAN he keep his religious beliefs out of decisions?
So was Merrick Garland. if Gorsuch was any kind of man or Christian he would decline until Garland treated fair
@DaliDager @SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts block his appointment.any politician who works w DT needs to b voted out in 2018
how about you quit stumping for your failed party and for a United America?  #TermLimits #DitchMitch #enjoyitwhileyoucan
impeach mcconell...obstructionist
MERRICK GARLAND HEARING.
Why should he be confirmed, when Merrick Garland wasn't?
@EdMorrissey @GorsuchFacts It has been suggested that we need a t-shirt that says "Nuke them, Mitch"
Garland was one the Senate should have confirmed, except the corrupt GOP refused to do their jobs.  GOP=Party of Corruption.
hahaha! You stole that selection from Pres Obama. No way in hell you will fill that seat!! Obstruct! obstruct!
u know that 60 votes isnt needed 4 SCOTUS lets get him & the rest of the nominees done already grown ups are in
do you have this tweet on robotweeting?
So was Merrick Garland.
so was #MerrickGarland but you & your cohorts decided party over country was the way to govern #TheResistance
Since @realDonaldTrump filed with the @FEC for re-election, I think we should wait for the people to decided.
You're a fraud and everyone knows it.
hoping they fight you every step of the way for blocking Merrick Garland. We haven't forgotten.
@hughhewitt @GorsuchFacts What will the Lib Leftists DO, I wonder?! They hate GOP getting a SCOTUS Constitutionalist Jurist!
@hughhewitt @GorsuchFacts It will be wonderful to have a full court again and a Constitutionalist.
Listen Flip Flop McConnell - you made a mockery of process when you and your pals refused to discuss #MerrickGarland Hush now
So is Merrick Garland.
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
I had actually never heard your voice before, but after seeing this video it's exactly is dorky as I pictured it
you are a traitor.
a man who created a fascist club in his private high school should never sit on the Supreme Court
no way, u dispicable thing! #hypocrite
He may be qualified, but this seat was stolen from Merrick Garland. Thanks to you!
same could be said about Merrick Garland oy spineless noodle
I'm starting to think this is a parody account. No one could possibly be this hypocritical.
So was Merrick Garland.
a r joining his club fascism
you said you liked #MerrickGarland too
#MerrickGarland is the type of Judge who the Senate should easily confirm to #SCOTUS. Just ask some GOP. cc: @SenateMajLdr

you stole that SC nom from President Obama. Now instead of MG we get an anti-LGBTQ, anti-woman pick. No thanks #imwithdems
Everything you say was said about Merrick Garland.  Have you no shame?  Try looking in a mirror.
Yeah, you get what you give - so kiss that shit goodbye.
you are sub-human.
Quick complaining that you are getting treated the same way, you treated Obama, you sniveling toad.
So was Merrick Garland, but you didn't. Just ask, well you. Its not about qualified, its about retribution.
So was Merrick Garland, Senator...
Well the republicans senators are still whining. All talk no walk. You could have had the whole cabinet in place next week
I meant last week. You still prove even with you majority democrats are still running the senate just like the last 8 years
