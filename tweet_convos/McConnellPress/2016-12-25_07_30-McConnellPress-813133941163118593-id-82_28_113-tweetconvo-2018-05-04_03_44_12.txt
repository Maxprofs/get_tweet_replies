.  @GOP traffics in hatred, in petulance, in resentment, and now it's ruled by tweet. Sad
you will be a traitor to your country if you don't investigate trump's russia connection.   shame on you.
I've  laughed at most of your ignorant tweets
you do not have a mandate. Now get some answers for those that truly care about our great country. We deserve true leadership
Merry Christmas to you also. Now when you are you going to be a true leader and get some answers about an investigation

If you are a Christian, why Christ on this greeting?
Hypocrisy abounds
A Merry Christmas would mean u approved a select committee 2 investigate the Russian hack.

@realDonaldTrump Only a few more days left of laughter and joy before we see GOP destruction and ruin.#saveourcountry.
If you protected America from Russian hackers we might be able to enjoy the holiday.
we will enjoy the holidays regardless of the spineless leader that he shows himself to be
look forward to helping you #MAGA w @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @GenFlynn @peterthiel & @PRyan
