@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr its not so much how they did it, it's more concerning who did it and why it is allowed to continue..MITCH!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr The senseless inability of you to act responsibly defies explanation.
YOU DISGUST US!! these KILLING are on your shoulders!! Keep taking your blood money!!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr It does not defy explanation. Research teaches us how to prevent it. You legislate ignorance. #PaidForByTheNRA
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Your "thoughts" should be about steps to take to stop this carnage. Your "prayers" should be for forgiveness
I have an explanation..the gun lobby bought you outright. Save your prayers vote for gun controls. #nrapuppet
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr This is the same as a husband who kills wife sending a tweet that calls the death senseless. FU #StopTheNRA
the "explanation" is assault weapons in the publics hands, the G20 dont have this regular carnage....
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr "defies explanation?" you didnt do your job helping the people of this country, sold yourself to the #NRA
@GOP @SteveDaines If you aren't with Trump, you are against the real GOP base. Get busy repealing Obamacare.
Not so "senseless" when you vote against ban of high capacity magazines-Don't bother w  "thoughts". Pitiful
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan All noise, ZERO action. Cut the BS and pass the Zadroga Bill already. #WorstResponders
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Get your greed under control & maybe you'll b content w/doing whats morally right where gun legis is concerned
@Blob_Fish @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr
@ChadHarvey7 A thing about the size of a mouse compared to the elephant that is violent gun death in the US.
@jackdicktator Also if you remove gang violence cuts out 1/2 Gangs will have guns just Ike in France
@ChadHarvey7 Oh no! The law won't be 100% effective! Might as well ditch it, along with ALL OTHER LAWS.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Sooooo sad that you are a giant reason why these tragedy's still occur. Words without meaning. #SanBernadino
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr shame on you
When is something going to be done about assault rifles and large capacity magazines?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr But you hate America because the Saudis own you, But you won't give then a dime. Scrooge
fuck you.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr they don't need your thoughts. They need to know you will not let it happen again. ban assault weapons!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Paid for by the NRA at a price tag of over $900,000 in campaign funds to NOT protect the US. #OwnedByTheNRA
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr and nothing more because you like NRA money more than people's lives. You are devoid of any decency.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr My hatred of you will never cool.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  #NRA doesnt pay for you to sympathy with shooting victims #repealNRA #WorstResponders #301sinceColumbine
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Sen McConnell received $922000 in expenditures from NRA voted against backgrounds checks 2 keep us safe
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr The senseless loss of innocent life was you fault. You allowed 9/11.You are owned by the SaudisYou hate jesus
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr You are all traitors and belong in gitmo getting water boarded.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr You must stop the carnage, stop taking NRA bribes, stop your shameless hypocrisy, or resign.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Actually the explanation is clear: Your cowardice in the face of the NRA.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr 
Do something. 
Refuse NRA bloody money.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Thoughts are cheap, meanwhile NRA dumped $922K in your pocket. Nice. What did you buy?
I think only DEDICATED gun owners will even want to try ... :D :D @D0NNIE_BRASC0 @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr ACTUALLY, the $992K donation you rec'd from NRA & your refusal to back gun safety laws explains quite a bit.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr here`s the explanation YOU want to see and hear #auspol
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Ooohhhh I dunno senator! I'm sure if you think real hard you could come up with an explanation... #guncontrol
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  When was the last time you heard of a person protecting his home/family with a damned assault rifle?? NEVER!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Forget the "thoughts and prayers" rhetoric. Climb out of the NRA's hip pocket and actually DO something.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Please explain voting against denying known terrorists the ability to purchase weapons  #accountforyourvote
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr because thoughts and prayers will solve EVERYTHING, right? #fail
.@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr I think the explanation is the #NRA owns you. And you do as they wish. Not what the American public want.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Terrorists can legally purchase weapons in the US.  This is on you and your NRA cronies.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Senseless lack of willingness to stand up to the NRA and enact effective gun control laws.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr You have 922,000 reasons to only think and pray about #SanBernadino. #NRAWhores
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Now this is REAL leadership!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr #PledgeToStopGunViolence
@McConnellPress  the explanation is @SenateMajLdr took ton of money from the gun industry and can't lead as a result. Blood on your hands.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr if only you were in a spot to affect change.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr You voted against bill to keep guns from suspected terrorists - HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr You got more than $922,000 from NRA. They own you. Give $ back and do your frickin job. Thoughts & prayers???
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  the senseless lack of action by Congress defies explanation My prayers are for courage in our leadership.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr So is this the price Americans have to pay for status quo gun laws? #LessPrayerMoreAction
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Disgusting hypocrite, you are bought and paid for by the #NRA. Over $900K of blood money. You are a disgrace.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr First your family is involved in a drug shipping scandal, What's next, gun running?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr you should be ashamed of yourself for choosing you own personal financial gain over the safety of US citizens
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr gag
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr you voted against gun control today
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Is that all you've got???
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr I've got an explanation Mitch:  NRA donations.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr "But humans have created this problem, and now we are asking God to solve it. It is illogical." ~Dali Lama
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Haha, "thoughts". You're one of the most powerful people in the US, and all you can do is think thoughts?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr perfectly timed tragedy to help turtleman evade the 9/11 responders camped outside his office
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  even Reagan was in favor of the assault weapons ban. You could use your power for good.  Why not try?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr 'defies explanation' if you choose to take bribes from the NRA to not use your brain and do nothing
@McConnellPress I wonder how it feels to take so much money to do nothing &watch the names of the dead you could have saved #bloodnyourhands
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr you weren't elected to send thoughts. You were elected to enact policy reforms to fix issues.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Your thoughts do nothing when you have actual power to do something.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr it doesn't defy explanation at all. It's the GUNS.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr need an explanation? Don't know what to do? End the ban on researching gun violence!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr You should pray for your own soul as you will certainly end up in hell
@McConnellPress 900K?! Wow, you're not going to do anything more than "thoughts and prayers" are you? At least you made a ton of not caring
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr - "..defies explanation"? What part of it obscures explanation? That terrorists were able to get #guns?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr you take big $$ from NRA.  Grow a conscience!!!!
@McConnellPress Senseless loss over and over. So do something about it. Oops! I forgot about the pocket stuffings from the NRA
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  What are your plans to help stop this from happening? Does that plan include money from the @NRA?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr you are useless
. @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Actually there's an easy explanation: you get paid by the @NRA to give thoughts instead of gun control laws.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr senseless yes but not priceless. You got ver $900k from the NRA
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr perhaps something more constructive than prayer would be appropriate. Lead. Do something.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr what defies explanation is your unwillingness to pass legislation that the vast majority of Americans support
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr We know where your thoughts are, Big Coal lackey.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  What' senseless is your blatant neglect when it comes to enacting common sense gun laws. Shame on you.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Your thoughts are misdirected. Please retire.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr so the $922k you got from @NRA means you have less campaigning to do & more free time to pray for an solution?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  mcconnel sold his soul a long time ago..doomed for eternity
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  when you get done praying there, rip up the check you received from the NRA.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr WOW, not even 1 person on here that agrees w/McConnel.  How does he keep getting re-elected?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr The NRA pumped more than $922,000 into Sen. Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) 2014 re-election campaign. #sjhameonyou
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr the explanation is simple:  easy access to guns.  What part of that do you not understand?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  Get off your ass and DO something about it. It defies explanation that you do NOTHING. Shame on you.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  Wow Mitch, that $992K the NRA donated bought a crap ton or prayers & thoughts from you.  #PrayersOverLives
in fact there's a very simple explanation for this, senator. pls be brave and accountable and do something. @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr
Dear @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Does the $922k you rec'd from NRA have anything to do with your inaction on this issue? #emptythoughts
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr guess that million you got from the NRA prevents you for admitting the explanation-no gun control.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr "defies explanation". Apart from the ease at which these lunatics can arm themselves? Good grief.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Lawmakers who accept gun lobby money are quick with condolences after the San Bernardino mass shooting. JERK
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  It's your fault for accepting NRA funding; you traded money for people's lives. #StopTheNRA #NRA U caused it
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr   Shame on you. Guns and bullets were used. Don't risk NRA $ by telling the truth about senseless violence?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Better to eliminate assault weapons that tweet condolences
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Of course your thoughts are with the victims. All our thoughts are with the victims. What are you going to do?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr No, it doesn't. The @NRA gave you more than $900k to get reelected. There's an explanation right there.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Almost a Million $$$ in NRA blood money, how does that feel this morning, you monsters. #PrayerDontStopBullets
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr why do we need ASSAULT weapons? your judgement and morals are clouded by $$$$$ from the NRA. Disgusting.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr how about you be a leader, stop taking nra money and actually do something then?
@McConnellPress defies explanation? nah, I can explain: the accessibility of guns makes it easy for (usually white) nutjobs to kill people.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Your willful inaction brought to us by the NRA.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr NO! OBSTRUCTION to protect your #NRA donations defies explanation! #ThisBloodIsOnYou.  Pray less DO MORE!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  https://youtu.be/V4DnNKKIfrM 
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  WHY DON"T YOU ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING TO STOP THIS SENSELESS CARNAGE INSTEAD OF OFFERING ONLY LIP SERVICE.
.@McConnellPress .@SenateMajLdr then please grow a pair and enact some meaningful legislation to stop these tragedies #GunControlNow
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr What defies explanation is sending thoughts after these incidents when you know solutions that can save lives.
@McConnellPress The only senseless thing defying explanation about #SanBernardino is the inaction of Congress to address gun issue in the US
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Didn't you get the memo? God actually wants you to ANSWER the USA's prayers & enact #GunLaws!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Do something about it, then. Stop taking NRA blood money!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr No, the explanation is very clear. You're just ignoring it for political gain.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Just going to think about the victims? Or maybe do your job and find a way to fix this so it doesn't happen
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr 
Stop accepting money from gun lobyist groups and do your damn job to protect us from becoming victims of guns
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr actions speak louder then words.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Doesn't defy. Easy access to assault style weapons high capacity magazines. Senseless is your support for each
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Your "thoughts"? The "senseless loss of innocent life" is easily explainable: Congress is led by NRA toadies.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr I think you meant that you will pray for an additional $78,000 to make NRA contributions a cool $1M
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr. #turndownnramoney
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr no one wants your prayers. We want changes made to gun laws.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Does it also defy sensible legislation? #GunSense
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Stop cashing checks from the NRA.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr There is explanation: Muslims and politicians bought by the gun lobby.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr unexplainable? How about lifting the ban on research that might explain this phenomenon? You have the power!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Your thoughts may be with the SB victims today. Which victims will you think about tomorrow?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Yet you will not do anything about gun laws, assault weapons. Follow the money . . . .
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr 
All you idiots combined lack any degree of logic! You took a $922,000 bribe from the NRA
NRA dumped $922K into @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr re-elect bid, so when it comes to preventing gun violence all you will get is a tweet.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr http://www.theonion.com/article/no-way-prevent-says-only-nation-where-regularly-ha-51444 …
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Your thoughts will not bring back their loved ones. Do more than pray!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr It is easily explained by your voice being bought by the @NRA. This is your fault just as much as the shooters
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr if you cannot understand common sense, please resign, retire.  You are face of inaction and hatred.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr $922K from the @NRA - so does that mean innocent American die, so that your pockets are full- #NRAPuppets
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  Pretend to be a statesman instead of a NRA suck up.Fix this.Our descendants deserve more than a war zone.
"This defies explanation" says a monster complicit in why mass shootings run rampant.@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Your thoughts mean nothing!  NRA BOUGHT YOU WITH $922,000 IN CAMPAIGN FUNDING.  Their blood is on your hands.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Easy to explain: America has a #gunproblem #wakeup #everytown #MomsDemand What r U gonna do about it?
Awe can't Handle the pressure on Twitter blocks ppl hmmm says a lot about the shovel @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr thoughts are 1 thing, action is another. ENACT GUN CONTROL MEASURES NOW and be the leader your title states!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Liar. Over $900K worth of ur "thoughts" brought to u by the NRA. Liar.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr You're FOS.
@McConnellPress Corrupt NRA stooge! @SenateMajLdr You should be in jail!
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Doesn't defy explanation at all. You're in the NRA's pocket. YOU'RE the explanation.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Senator what defies explanation is why you refuse to do anything about guns.  How can you sleep at night
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Unfortunately your thoughts end at passing responsible legislation, so what are you in office for?
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr - Blood money from the @NRA or your god. You can't serve 2 masters. Which is it? Your god is not listening.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr  Keep your thoughts and prayers.  Bought and paid for by the NRA---you and your cohorts are a disgrace.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Do something. Most people from both parties want YOU TO DO SOMETHING!
@McConnellPress I have an explanation by observing how these things NEVER happen in other developed countries: guns. #BoughtByGunIndustry
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr Hi, aren't you embarrassed to pump out crap like this and see your boss do nothing decent or meaningful?
@McConnellPress ...and $922,000 or so of the @SenateMajLdr's contributions are from the NRA. But I'm sure that the Senator can explain.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr #NRA-funded #hypocrisy #uspoli #GOP #thoughtsandprayers
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr 
The NRA bought you for just under a million dollars.
Do you need to clear your tweets with the NRA first, or do they just trust you to toe the line? @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr So let's DO something. Quit taking money from the NRA and enact with a sensible solution (hint: there are some
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr It doesn't defy explanation at all!! The explanation is our weak gun laws, AND YOU KNOW IT!! #ShameOnCongress
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr How much money have you gotten from the NRA?... You've chosen Money over American Lives..
@McConnellPress you are why this happens.  i hope you are happy with yourself.  how is that NRA money rolling in?
