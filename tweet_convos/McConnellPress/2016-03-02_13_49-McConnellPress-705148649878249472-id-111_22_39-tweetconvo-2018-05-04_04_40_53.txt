@SenateMajLdr The people did decide... In 2012 they elected Obama
@Upshawstin @SenateMajLdr Thank you Austin for liking my tweet. The Senate has a duty to carry out, President Obama should nominate now.
@lynnroe52 @SenateMajLdr Exactly. I'm very frustrated with the GOP's attitude on this.
@Upshawstin @SenateMajLdr absolutely frustrating to deal with. I'm fed up too.
@senatemajldr @senatorreid #DOYOURJOB
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid U work for us, act like it
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid @McConnellPress  Mitch is a yuge Dick. Tracy.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid The people decided in 2008 & 2012 when they elected @BarackObama Senator McConnell do your job or resign! #POTUS
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid follow the constitution and advise and consent on a supreme court nominee.  quit being partisan phonies.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid we already decided #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr The same constitution you vociferously argued did, when the POTUS didn't have black skin. How transparent?
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid they did the second time POTUS was elected or do you have selective memory loss
@SenateMajLdr no where in the constitution says you should be paid for not doing your job
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO WHAT YOU TWEET ABOUT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE!
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid ah gop the wicked web you weave, hope you enjoy the bed you made. You are so oblivious.
@SenateMajLdr Prevaricator
@SenateMajLdr #LetThePeopleDecide shouldn’t be just be a slogan, nor should it ever become a shibboleth of the right
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid So you mean let them elect a president and a Senate to engage in the process?
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid #ThePeopleDecided #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr #letthepeopledecide if @realDonaldTrump wins the delegates U better support your party and quit trying to undermine him.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid where does it say in the Constitution Article II Section 2 no SCOTUS nominations in election year #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid no don't let him do anything more to hurt are country thanks
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid #DoYourJob #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr the GOP estab, Romney approach Pres election, gonna end up biting y'all in the behind
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Do your job senator.  Why do we pay u 174k a years again? Hearing and a UP AND DOWN vote for the nomination
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Rather than an extremist from either party. Not acting at all is a true disservice to the American people.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid We the people did decide. We decided in 2012 with the reelection of Barack Obama. How about a moderate Justice?
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid did the people make you majority leader, or just a shitty little redneck state.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Does it say that the Senate should pass a budget or manage by continuing resolution? Neither of you have any cred
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid you took an oath to "well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter." Do it.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid nowhere does it say to obstruct. The people decided in 2012. Stop using us an excuse for your obstructionism.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid It does say that the Senate has the responsibility to Advise and Consent....not wait till the next President.
.@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid #LetThePeopleDecide except for the NOMINEE for the party yet in IRAN their votes count.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid There's a reason SOTUS justices are APPOINTED!! The people decided in 2012 OBAMA would appoint them. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Turtleboy says he doesn't have to do his job in a right to work state. Buh Bye Turtleboy.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid So this time we go 8 months...next time we go 12 months.  Please be something other than part of the problem.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid It also doesn't say that you should put partisan wants above the needs of America but here we are...
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid @SenSchumer @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Your brain is dead, time to quit. go to a park and read a book, stop holding progress.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid #LetThePeopleDecide They did. They elected a president to nominate and a senate to consider. #DoYourJob.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid Yet you were perfectly comfortable doing so in Reagan's last year of office, hypocritical much?
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid So why dont u be the bigger person and do what the majority of the nation expects? Enough w/ the games! #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid if there was a Republican president right now you would rush to hold hearings, and there lies your hypocrisy.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid You've proven there is just the façade of a 2 party system. The gig is up for all you lying/Nazi's. #AlwaysTrump
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid it also doesn't say that you shouldn't. President nominate Senate hold hearings it's just that simple.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Sntr McConnell, why run for office if you won't do what the job requires? #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Sntr McConnell, why are you inciting the masses?  Do the job you were elected to do and stop whining!
@SenateMajLdr McConnell's afraid of the assholes voters and congressmen he propagated. Your chickens are home to roost.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Constitution does not say a lot of things. It is a foundation. We need leaders not tweeters who waste a year.
@SenateMajLdr People! Rise up! The power is your's!
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid How many times have both parties also said each deserves an up or down vote? Hypocrites, all of you.
@SenateMajLdr Are you that terminally stupid? The People have decided. And they say you are wrong. WHY DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THIS?
@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse @POTUS President of Senate @VP @JoeBiden should schedule & process most Senate proceedings
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid can you fools actually read? Vote all you #jackasses out
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Hang tough don't let Harry bully you this time.He has pushed you around enough & we all see this.@StopObamaCourt

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid no where does it say let the people decide SCOTUS nominees
Thank you, @SenateMajLdr Americans, Republican and Democrat, appreciate using our votes to decide what is best. @McConnellPress @SenatorReid
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid It does not say that you MUST do your job. Just collect your check and stay home,great gov't job.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid true, but GOP should hold hearings, grill nominee, take opportunity to educate electorate, then reject nominee.
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob Using election as pretext 4 non-vote subverts constitutional  principles #SCOTUS #LowMoments #LawlessMitch
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that POTUS should be subjected to 7+ years of congressional obstruction!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid No but it does say you should give them a hearing so that you can give "advice" and "consent".
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid they already did twice and will again with @HillaryClinton in 2016, so you might as well do your job now!
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid the Constitution doesn't say "Let the People Decide". Mitch McConnell has degraded the @Senate_GOPs.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid .yes it does, #GOPLoser! read it again!!!
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid. The Constitution says the President of the United States has a duty to nominate a Supreme Court Justice.
@SenateMajLdr nowhere does CONST. say that the people may decide #scotusnom ; only @POTUS & #senate mentioned #SCOTUS #LowMoments
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid with this kind of nonsense, how is it a surprise that Republicans have nt won the presidency in recent times
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid   That's why in the end you probably will cave again and say we're governing..
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid This sort of behavior is why the GOP is in the position it is in now, Mitch.  You need to stop.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid
1905 Precedent Lets Obama Appoint SCOTUS Judge without Consent
@KarenLee1956 @SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid   Wrong
@bigwheelsusa @SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid And you're a expert?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid McConnell is just an obstructionist ass!!!
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid the people DID decide...in 2012 when THE PEOPLE, by popular vote, elected President Obama. Do your job.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid ,"to vote" but to "advise and consent" -Yes, they do. How do you "advise & consent" w/o hearings?
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Nice smokescreen, Mr. M&M. Obama elected & re-elected decisively, so u can drop "#let the people decide" crap.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Advise and consent now or deal with a recess appointment later. #YourChoice
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid also, can't wait till this leads to Hilary's SCOTUS nominee. It will be Obama. You'll have him for life as SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid McConnell is a fraud. Let's start a people's petition to remove him from the Senate. #LetThePeopleDecide
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid and you're dream of being Sen Maj Ldr will be over, because Ky won't reelect you after this, plus what Bevin does
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid you realize you're likely going to screw over your POTUS nom, bc your stonewalling turns voters off to GOP?
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid (cont) Originalist Scalia would likely think that the Founders mean when @POTUS noms, you "advise" & "consent"
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SenatorReid Where does it say to BETRAY THE PEOPLE?
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid how about you go look at YOUR Law Review Note in #KentuckyLawJournal?? It said "with advice and consent"(cont)
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid #PeopleDidDecide in 2008 and 2012 - and by millions of votes.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid We already decided. Twice.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorReid Good for you. Keep it up!
