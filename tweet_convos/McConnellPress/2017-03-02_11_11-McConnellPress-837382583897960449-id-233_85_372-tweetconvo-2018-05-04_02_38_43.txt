he did a better job on DWTS.
Man knows nothing of this department. Can't talk energy, nuclear. Doesn't believe in Climate Change.
Yes, it sounds like you and Republicans did another bang up job with cabinet approval. Thanks- Not!!
Wasn't that one of the departments he forgot he wanted to disband?
Fox in the Hen House!
Gov. Perry can promptly forget himself.

FBI director James Comey asked Justice Department to refute Pres. Trump's wiretapping claims, sources say. http://abcn.ws/2lPFHFh  
Lead it down the tubes.
we need an independent investigation into @realDonaldTrump #russian oil oligarchs, #putin, #wilburRoss
@GorsuchFacts stop the BS #DOYOURJOB @POTUS impeach this AHole in One  @realDonaldTrump fire @jeffsessions Enough is enough!
Politics over country once again.  Incompetent Perry will let polluters write regulations
You must be so proud.  Did he promise to dance at your retirement party?
You mean the guy that didn't know he'd be in charge of the nukes when he accepted?
.@SenateMajLdr will @GovernorPerry remember where his @ENERGY office is? Or what he does?
Sessions must resign. Our NATIONAL SECURITY is at stake.We need an independent investigation #Russia
Only proves what a farce this is. Perry couldn't even name the agency or understand what it involved. Unbelievable.
@SecretaryPerry Do u have a Russian agenda to dismantle @ENERGY? We wants to know. @DHSgov @FBI @CIA #scaryperry
#conflictofinterest What does a soul go for these days? 
You mean what used to be the DOE.
@SecretaryPerry Are u implementing a Russian agenda to dismantle @ENERGY? Americans want 2 know. @DHSgov @FBI @CIA #russiagate
Perry is  an embarrassment. He is a party hack picked for his loyalty to Trump & business. Corrupt!
@realDonaldTrump Let's get on with confirming the rest. #DoYourJob GIVE POTUS HIS NEEDED STAFF. AMERICANS deserve no less!
@McConnellPress @GovernorPerry @ENERGY Congrats, what about the other nominees.
and the end of days has begun.
another #unqualified #swampcabinet pick. #SessionsMustResign
.@SenateMajLdr @GovernorPerry @ENERGY how long till he shuts them down?
congratulations!
.@SenateMajLdr @GovernorPerry @ENERGY  Maybe Perry will rise to the occasion. I sure hope so. Still, a mediocre and unwise choice.
what a disappointment

pathetic
Thanks 4 confirming Zinke; he knows more about federal lands than anyone I know & will be a great!
Any Republican that rolls with a Dem, will go with the Dems. Do not accommodate their insanity!
their tactics and propaganda campaigns, the better. We are proud of AG Sessions & our President.
Stand up to everyone of these Dems & do not give an inch. The sooner they realise we will not tap to...
Perry is clueless.
Another nail in the coffin of democracy & our sacred environment.
Oh, I'm so proud. Does the good governor even know what the Dept of Energy does?
Why r u allowing delays on POTUS cabinet. Get them confirmed!!!
Don't let him near those bombs.  OOPS....
NOTHING TO CELEBRATE.  FAR FROM IT.
Don't you mean the Department of OOPS?
please investigate the Russia connection!!
is that your way of distracting the people? Sessions must resign!
Sessions... Russia
To lead the Dept. of.....Hmmm, let's see....Wait, ummm...
We now have a NINCOMPOOP in charge of our NUCLEAR ARSENAL! God help us.
And you're HAPPY about that??? #Un-American
hope someone will explain what they do at DOE. He wasn't aware the they build the country's nukes.  Sad
Didn't the guy before him have a Phd or a Nobel prize? Yeah, this dip shit's the man for the job.
Mitch why do your cheeks look so droopy did you have a stroke. You should bang that war baby of yours
people that are qualified.
Another Texas yokel.
confirming perry for dept of energy is the worst move you can make next to trump. How about getting
have you explained what the job is?
@McConnellPress @GovernorPerry @ENERGY 
What. You guys couldn't find ANYONE more qualified than Rick Perry? Are you serious?
- He doesn't even know what the DOE is.
You mean destroy the Dept of Energy, way to go Bannon, or as u r known also DEATH on SNL
Confirm them faster!  Glad to have another great patriot aboard!
It's like a new reality show The Real Confederacy Of Dunces. It's embarrassing to the American people.
all need to be confirmed last month what is wrong with you mitch?
How long before he has to resign?  The others only last a couple of weeks.
When he discovers there's no dancing involved he will quit.
congratulations.   Keep the confirmations going!!
let's dance with the stars in the aisles. Another incompetent cabinet member.
Blindly approving unqualified nominees is disgraceful to the long history of your legislative body.
what a shame. No disrespect but under qualified.
good. Stand behind the rest of the admin. including Sessions.  Trump needs to move forward. Do it!
sad.  Wrong.  Hopefully he'll be able to remember the department he works for going forward
Whoops!
Get the Russian Spies out of the WH - NOW.  DEPUTY DAWWWWWG
Great another unqualified person to lead.
*destroy not lead.  I understand typos happen even to the best of us.
How sad for our environment.
does he remember this still or do you plan on reminding him?
Another bad choice from Trump, & another black mark on GOP 4 confirming a man who would shut down DOE.
Big Mistake!!! Shame on you!
You mean that Dept.  he wanted to abolish, forgot the name of, and was clueless about its function?
Just hope he can remember which Department he is in charge of.
Then the US is SCREWED yet again by you f*cktards.
the man who wanted to get rid of it, who is clueless about the department does.
He's a moron.  Congrats once again on the lowest quality cabinet in history.  @GOP #PartybeforeCountry
A man that couldn't remember the name of the Dept., but wanted to close is now in charge of our missiles.
@GOPLeader @jasoninthehouse  Today is Sessions, tomorrow can be you: Are you being blackmailed by the Dems?
@GovernorPerry not a bright addition to WH administration. Nothing to congratulate here.
#sessionsmustgo
#racetothebottomoftheswamp
so he can abolish it oooopps
old fossil fuels like the crusty old white men ruining our nation
the only reason you fools don't want to tweak the ACA .1) nothing is free In America . ACA doesn't
We get energy from meat, right? No? Can I make that a policy now? What's that? No, you are.
good, now he should eliminate it
Holy mother of god, are you f-ing kidding me??  You put @GovernorPerry in charge of our nuclear arsenal? @SenateMajLdr @ENERGY #shameless
@McConnellPress @GovernorPerry @ENERGY #SwampCabinet
@GOP I don't hear you talking about the trump investigations. That is JOB ONE
The guy IS A moron.  Terrifying.
yet he knows nothing about nuclear weapons. Not a wise choice.
Another Trump bozo who has no idea what he's doing
Does he know Uranium is bad, you can do some bad things with it???
@McConnellPress @GovernorPerry @ENERGY So we are pretty much fucked..
2/2 ...the Department of Magical Thinking maybe.
@McConnellPress @GovernorPerry @ENERGY most Unqualified Cabinet in US History AND YOUR  proud of it?
1/2 Young Earth anti science people should not be allowed to run science centered depts...

This guy is taking over a person's job that had a PHD in Nuclear Physics...?
A very sad day indeed.
#incompeteny #profitsbeforecountry #OklahomaEarthquakes
ahahahahhahahaahahahhhaha!
Senator, Please do something with the democrats who are falsely accusing our new AG Sessions! Ludicrous
-  the guy from dancing with the stars ???   Seriously??  You guys are such jerks!
#FireSessions #investigatetrump
Look for another AG. Sessions is racist, bigot, and a Putinite. Do you job for our country.
you do know that @GovernorPerry has no idea how to run  @ENERGY.  We can see you and hear you #YourLastTerm
You keep acting like these are tidings of joy. I guess for your rich supporters it is. What about AG?
the guy who wanted to eliminate the dept? Good move
According to Bannon, they want to remove everything.
Perry is the least of your problems. Biggest scandal since Watergate brewing .
I want an independent commission to investigate the administration and campaign ties to Russia
most hated senator. Why r u covering up trumps ties to russia. U are UNAMERICAN
delete your account
God help us all.
I see the business of deconstruction is moving along smoothly.  #TickTock   @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @GovernorPerry @ENERGY
Shame on you, You call yourself an American, you sold your soul for power. Shame on you.
#StandWithSession #MSMCorrupt #FAKENEWS @Potus  @VP  the #AmericanPeople support #Sessions #DoNotBackDown !! #DrainTheSwamp
god help us!! another cluless idiot.
Governor Perry isn't qualified to do anything
 He couldn't even run his state correctly
What is Russian tie.What day do you confirm Putin .?
@McConnellPress @GovernorPerry @ENERGY juvenile democrats obstruction is ending in futility as was their ineffective reign
@McConnellPress  @ENERGY How Chuck Schumer Caused the Second Largest Bank Failure in US History
The guy who got a C in 'meat' & who wears glasses to look smart is now in charge of our nuclear assets.
And there is a lower ring of Hell reserved for all those who voted for him. You're first, Mitch.
@McConnellPress @GovernorPerry @ENERGY way to "swamp it up" #refillingtheswamp
The guy who wanted to destroy the department that maintains our nuclear arsenal? This should go well.
God help us all.
Oh lord! The idiots loose again!
"@GovernorPerry has been confirmed by the #Senate to DISMANTLE the Dept of @ENERGY." I fixed your tweet.
Now someone show him to his office & and tell him exactly what his job is, that'd be great!
Has he figured out what his Dept does, yet?
Step 1-Take government dwn by appointing idiots. Step 2-Start master turtle race & take over the world
You need to Be a little more forceful pushing back against Schumer and Pelosi. Step up pls and shut Dems up.
#repealandreplacemitchmcconnell
youve been confirmed as a turtle
Does he at least know what it is now?
Wow. A twofer fail for Americans this week. Thanks Mitch baby. How about them Russians, hmmm?
Great! Oh wow! This is great news!!! Whose other ass will you wipe and suck up to next?
@McConnellPress @GovernorPerry @ENERGY Any comments on these shenanigans?
this is a joke. He doesn't even understand the position.
It's about TIME!
Did trump put another $20 in your g-string? Stop pretending everything is fine and get to impeachin'.
Another republican mistake!
Perry vowed to destroy the dept of energy....well once he remembered. Hate to see you go. Its coming.
 @SenateMajLdr @GovernorPerry @ENERGY
fire up the drills boys
