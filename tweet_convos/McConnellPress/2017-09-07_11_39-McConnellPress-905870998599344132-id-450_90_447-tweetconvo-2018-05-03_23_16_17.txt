Good job Mr McConnell.  We want President Trump's agenda passed.      ALL of IT!!!
No we don't.. people with a moral compass do not
Sadly you will be very angry for the next 7 1/2 yrs then.
Ask Bannon what's up with him . U will find the swamp that needs drained that he can't stand for us to say.
Do one more thing for America, put a 3 term limit on congress, even our 1st POTUS knew this was the right thing! 70% of voters/support!
Will you and Congress be putting together a relief package for the earthquake victims in #Mexico?
Yeah, we'll send them their workforce back so they can rebuild
Get out of the way. You are failing badly. Put the country before yourself. Thanks for your service but time to leave.
Meanwhile you sell your country out on the debt ceiling issue, and then lie to the voters about why you want it raised. You like SPENDING!
@SenJohnMcCain (Juan Keating5 I hate Trump) @OrrinHatch @LindseyGrahamSC ￼ Mitch listen to Voters Not K Street or Suffer #2018 #2020 #MAGA
I want 2 kno how much pork spending was tacked 2 emergency aid?Can we pass single themed legislation?Both side need 2 stop hijacking country
Chuck Schumer should take your place! You and Ryan made promises! The Grift is over!
GET OFFyrDUFF FATSO MITCH&CNFRM ALL TRUE CONSRVTIVE JUDGES @realDonaldTrump pickd.WE KNOW MMc=TRAITOR &R REALLY A RINO/DEM/PROG. UR HATED!!
No choice for you. You,re on thin ice.
We American’s are NOT HAPPY, that you didn’t DO YOUR JOB, and PASS HEALTHCARE REFORM. Your word means NOTHING. Leaders get the job done.
No thanks to you or the GOPIGS
Big of them
Bought time something good is done now do your job and support the POTUS and pass tax reform, build the wall, pass immigration rules/laws
Senate should not have taken longest vacation in non election year. You should have stayed and worked like Americans wanted and expect.
@realDonaldTrump CAN NEVER EVER TRUST MM4 WHAT MM DOING 2TRY 2 MAKE DJT FAIL.MM MUST RESIGN &GO HOME!WHR IS NUCLEAR OPTION2 DO WHT R'sSAIDwd
Either start producing or u will be removed...On 11/8/16 DJT created a new party in America, u can either join, or b cast aside. It's up 2 u
You want to come together and do something?  Enact term limits for Congress!  Then retire, you're useless 
the only way we can get things done is you stepping down...Trump was the one who saved the day...you should be ashamed of yourself
Here's an emergency Obama care cost me $800 a month with a $7000 deductible and what about the wall and tax reform.
How many people on your policy? Live in a state refusing to set up an exchange? Ask Mitch why he thinks Americans with no insurance is ok.
Just me went from ppl, pos now HMO the cheapest I can get .
Healthcare is expensive. With the ACA prices would be hire. Fed credits have kept pool high w/ greater savings. Single payer is only answer.
It is called DOING YOUR FRIGGEM JOB JERKO.  Stop celebrating after 8 years of obstruction.. hypocrite
Clearly, term limits are needed. It's not a life career sir. Move on and get out of the way. Clown.
Mitch McConnell supported of the import/export bank and gave obama nearly everything he wanted during his presidency! He sells us out daily!
Mitch McConnell has always been a rhino his entire career! Notice how hostile he is towards conservatives!? The man is a fraud!
#noshitsherlock. Should I be proud of myself for paying my bills? #doyourjob this is #easystuff. #dosomethingreal
Only because of the president, not because of you.
&U AHOLES SHD HV DONE IT AS SEPERATE GD BILL!!! THIS IS BUNCH OF LOSERS TAKG ADVANTAGE OF CRISIS & @realDonaldTrump SHD HV BARGAINED4 MORE!
You promised to repeal Obamacare.  Do it.
You're just happy to see anything pass under your leadership. What a wacko @potus we have to deal with. Clear that @GOP endorses a nut job!
So great you can come together to spend money
Smooth liar
This was a gimme. Do not brag about doing your job. Now, GET OUT OF OUR PRESIDENT'S WAY. You are a hindrance to all of us who want to MAGA.
You did not come together.. You were told, like an incompetent employee, what to do by the Democrats. You get 0 credit for this
Yes we are too, thank you DEMOCRATS
No thanks to you and the GOP it was passed.
Here's an emergency...DRAIN THE SWAMP and that includes YOU and Traitor Lyin Ryan!!  DRAIN THE SWAMP! #DRAINTHESWAMP
NOW GET TOGETHER FOR THE AGENDA OF POTUS OR LOSE YOUR SEAT
https://townhall.com/columnists/timothydaughtry/2017/09/08/polls-warning-for-gop-back-the-trump-agenda-or-face-defeat-in-2018-n2378797?amp=true …
Hey Mitch - "Drain the swamp" buddy.  Hahaha
Maybe you should go back to what you are good at.
Hypocrite. You fought against aid for Hurricane Harvey victims. You aren't worth the juice squeezed out of a whore's soiled tampon.
"Drain the swamp" means getting rid of you.  I'm a solid Kentucky conservative and we will get you unelected.  You're an embarrassment to us
Why does anyone vote for @SenateMajLdr McConnell? His leadership gives us Obamacare funding, debt increases, amnesty, slow walks appointment
PP funding, no wall funding, no tax cuts. What can this turtle do? He is working for someone and has surrendered leadership to
Chuck and Nancy. Why should we even vote. I look back and can not find just ONE reason. He has done nothing we voted for, not one thing.
We are all happy to see the #Senate do ANYTHING! GET BUSY, GET IT DONE WHILE WE ARE ALL YOUNG ENOUGH TO ENJOY IT!
Retire
Ditch Mitch the Dick
With all respect, that's the least you people should do.
you liar! after seeing what bannon said about you and ryan...both of you deep swamp creatures need to be rousted!!
Hey SenateMajLdr, We're still going to Drain The Swamp! Okay.  #DrainTheSwamp
Now how about cutting taxes. Then you will have something to be really proud of. 15% Corporate Tax. NOW

Kind of got a face slap by the Trumpster didn't you?!?
U Will Be Fired!!!
Does Chuck know you're using the title "Leader"?
Do you honestly believe that one good thing happens, i will change my mind about you and your whoremongers?
https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/905442975370670081 …
Yeah sure you are Trump showed you fools
U didn't help.
WHERE ARE YOU WHEN OTHER THINGS NEED TO BE DONE? YOU REPUBLICANS SIT AND DO NOTHING ! WE VOTED FOR TRUMP AND HIS AGENDA, AND YOUR THERE TO
HELP HIM WITH IT, ALL THE LAZY REPUBLICANS WITH NO SPINE WILL BE REPLACED IN 2018, THE SAME WAY TRUMP GOT IN, THEY WILL GO OUT.
Kind of a no brainer but you finally accomplished something
Oh goodie finally did something but we are so sick of this Tax Reform, Healthcare, Wall if you want to keep you job We the People Demand it
You r the swamp. And we are going to vote your ass out!
Glad for possible victims of hurricanes.  Not happy with debt increase limits.  McConnell not much on supporting Trump , supports liberals
You realize, of course, that this happened IN SPITE OF YOU.

You have lost control, it is time for you to RESIGN.

Move out, Mitch.
January 2018 shut down!
Where  country going
Lot more  come

Food tamp  53% babies 8000k
Amen to that ...
So glad Trump will drain the swamp. I hope he starts with McConnell @SenateMajLdr. #TermLimits #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA
And you wonder why #Senate  has a 12% approval rating… it's because the 12% doesn't know what the senate is. LEADER McConnell ...pathetic
U people have ur own agenda and it does not line up with POTUS'. Know why?  BECAUSE UR ALL CROOKED!!!!
We are happy to see POTUS took the bull by the horns and GOT SOMETHING DONE!! SHAMEFUL OF ALL OF U!! STEP DOWN PLEASE!!!
Work with Trump! Make America great again!
PENCE PRESIDENT is BETTER for GOP.
Sorry Trump gave it to you again.  Why not give IMMEDIATE CITIZENSHIP to DACA kids?  But Trump will be mad cause he hates Mexicans.
Get your act together and pass tax reform NOW
Tose same people need TAX cuts to put their lives back together!!
Yeah, NOW get busy on Tax Reform/Cuts! STOP PATTING YOUR SELF ON THE BACK. end filibuster NOW!
You better get that wall funded loser
You did not repeal Obamacare and you don't back POTUS. I do hope you get primaried when you are up for reelection.
Now come together and BUILD THE WALL, REPEAL HEALTHCARE AND REFORM TAXES!!!!
Don't forget actors singers and every average working American is also raising money and supplies to help... probably more than government
Hey, Mitch, you r only working 12 days in Sept. what 1 thing r you going to focus on bfr the next vaca? Is Trump going to do your job too?
My grandparents started the Repub Club in '61. Family donated heavily since. 
Now, I am disgusted by @GOP @RNCResearch Work w/Trump!!!
Drain the Swamp!!  Starting with Flake,Heller,Corker,Hatch & Ryan! You will be in next group!!

Drain the swamp
#RINO you really are an undocumented Democratic. You've been Monstered by the VOR.
Duh!
Please work to come together on all important issues that impact American people.  Put differences aside, find common ground-for all of us.

When you actually bring the Senate together to do something meaningful that didn't need your help, then brag. Otherwise, get back to work.
SWAMP
Until Mitch grows a pair & gets rid of cloture & filibuster rule Schumer (D) is The Acting Senate Leader!  (D) #Resist killed Senate Decorum
Now get to work on the tax cuts!!!!!!  No BS like you did on "repeal and replace" Obamacare you sorry crook!!!!!
No thanks to you and @PRyan  you are both hypocrites and obstructionist.  Alt Right sympathizers

How about keeping your promise to repeal ObamaCare.  Ya .. we... know..  You like to spend MONEY.
And so quickly! Thank you!  It can happen!
It took Trump having to go to Dems!  What is that? 8 yr GOP do nothing! Waisted money!
Don't worry there's no global warming. Conman need to quit peddling to special interests. @billmaher @DRUDGE_REPORT @FoxNews @POTUS @MSNBC
Please  treat tax reform as an emergency and get it done. Also read this
We all know you don't give a shit
YOU came to nothing but a democrat idiot. Now #POTUS has gone democrat.  NO DACA - period. You will be voted out!
DRAIN THE SWAMP

GOP setting a BAD EXAMPLE for our children. Teaching them to not work with others. Ruining our American ways. VOTE THEM OUT.

Dear Humans,

Please find shelter. I don't want any of you innocent, wonderful people to get hurt.

Gutless wonder MCConnell needs to Help President Trump, #DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheSwamp
You should have done that yourself. You can do more and faster than you think.  Compromise & get stuff done! If Trump can, you can.
Fund the wall and repeal O-Care like you promised. If you can't deliver GTFU!
first concern after the election. Thanks!
Are you really? Seems like you don't want anything to go thru if its what the Prez wants! Tired of you! Go back on vacation!
There's no "I" in team, get on board with Trump or get out of the way!
took the Dems to get it done!! GOP appears clueless. WE are tired of excuses. Get on Trump Train!
Really,  what about the millions upon MILLIONS you have betrayed by failing to repeal OBAMACARE. THIS ISSUE IS NOT GOING AWAY.
But my taxes are still going way down, right?

Shit-for-brains
Why don't you try acting like the leader of the GOP and get it together!I wish Trey Gowdy would run for Senate he would be an awesome leader
That is awesome, now why don't you get the rest of the GOP together and support our president! You're supposed to be the leader of our party
Mister jokester....funny he can't lead!!!
I will be happier when we have the wall and no obama expensive insurance!


Some how I think big business harmed by storm just received TAX PAYERS funds 4 damage 
Mitch Y is that? Think RINO u are has something2 do
Mitch it's time for u to go. We r going to #DrainTheSwamp.. thank u for ur service

You would be able to accomplish more if you took less time off.
You've stood against Trump too many times, Americans are getting very frustrated with you... shape up or ship out!
Nice if you would actually vote as a Conservative like you campaigned!! LEAD as a Republican. No DACA Amnesty. Rule of Law!
Drain The Swamp!

Why could you not do the same on healthcare?  Taxes?
Really?  Better deal if GOP could get its act together and support POTUS.  Made Schumer a hero to Dems. He should thank you.
How about the western states that are presently burning up? Where is their relief?
Get behind the President NOW  You are part of the SWAMP and we know it.  Back our President ASAP
Drain the swamp..
Why wouldn't McConnell .@SenateMajLdr @mcconnellpress want to #draintheswamp? bc he's 1 of top swamp critters https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/905930620215468032 … #MAGA

It is not @realDonaldTrump you oppose it is every single American that voted for him. We see who and what you are.
Come together?  Was that a hard sell?
We'd be happy to see you voted out of office! 
And how much will you pass next week for Puerto Rico, US Virgin Is., FL, GA, and NC. R u going to still build the wall? Cut taxes for corps?
Looks like Trump rediscovered a concept that eludes you.  It's called bipartisanship.
Thank God @POTUS  , @NancyPelosi & @SenSchumer figured this out!  You and @SpeakerRyan can barely pass a law naming a post office.
STILL A LIAR EVEN IN THE FACE OF PEOPLE ABOUT TO BE IN A REAL EMERGENCY!
Do something for Ky Mitch
He has! You're #1!!! Make sure y'all keep electing him!!
