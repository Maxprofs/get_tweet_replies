VIDEO: Ronald Reagan makes the case for why Senate must confirm Anthony Kennedy months away from election year. 
@SenateMajLdr Schumer was wrong then (and wasn't the Maj/Minority leader) and you are wrong now (and are).
Schumer wasn't Senate Maj Leader and situation didn't arise to test what would have happened. You are wrong sir. @SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr He was right. What he and his forehead was trying to say was in the best interest in social progress and liberty.
@SenateMajLdr Again. Another idiot. Why would you want to put yourself on that same low level? Rise above it. Govern for the people not ego.
@SenateMajLdr Wait until the next President to confirm a Supreme Court Judge to the Supreme court. Please
@SenateMajLdr If you give in to #SCOTUS choice we will leave for a nationalist party. I refuse to allow you to sell out yet again.
@SenateMajLdr you are an obstructionist cunt. You & Congress are part of what is wrong with America. You're RUINING the Republican Party.
@SenateMajLdr It was wrong then, it is wrong now. Do your job!
@SenateMajLdr-you working for the Dems? In 08 you gave them  "making Obama a 1 term Pres." Now "Republicans won't take up any Obama nominee"
@SenateMajLdr 2 wrongs unfortunately do not make a right. Dems are not impervious to poor decision making, but GOP currently has monopoly.
.@SenateMajLdr What does a former Republican nominee Supreme Court Justice think? FILL THE VACANCY NOW.
@SenateMajLdr ok tho 4 bho to boycott in the past and yo0u too HYPOCRITS!!!
@SenateMajLdr... the president and the president alone nominates judges.
@CalebRapoport @SenateMajLdr yes they do, however the Senate has the final say!
@AscendantMaster @SenateMajLdr thought you're anti government?
@CalebRapoport @SenateMajLdr I'm for small controlled by the people government as our forefathers intended, not the monstrosity we have now.
@SenateMajLdr Mitch, did you get beat up by girls on the playground as a kid?
@SenateMajLdr "Reversing the presumption of confirmation" is vastly different than completely obstructing the process for 12 months.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Save our Constitution! Stand firm against any nominee that Pres. Obama puts forth for Supreme Court Justice
You keep forgetting majority of America DIDN'T elect Shumer, but we did elect @BarackObama.  Do Your Job @SenateMajLdr
Who are you going to listen to, a do nothing Senator or a President your party adored?  @SenateMajLdr

@SenateMajLdr why post this when you appear to be caving to the Dems? You and your rino cronies might as well switch to the dem party.
@SenateMajLdr doesn't make it right. Do the fucking job you are being paid to do

@SenateMajLdr Fox News poll: 62% say take action to fill vacancy now, 34% say wait.
@SenateMajLdr  Please Explain This
But do you recall @SenateMajLdr when you said this?
@SenateMajLdr so that justifies You obstructing?
.@SenateMajLdr Senator Mitch McConnell: https://youtu.be/LPSj0jgF-_w 
@SenateMajLdr -1)despite Schumer comment, Alito&Roberts confirmed  2) Schumer = wrong then; McConnell = wrong now #FillTheSeat #UpOrDownVote
@SenateMajLdr Must NOT give Democrats their way on this. Backbone...
@SenateMajLdr  Congress is denying Pres.Obama his rights as prez, but, more than that, they’re denying his power to appoint a SC Justice.
@SenateMajLdr don't give in, for Liberty's sake!
@SenateMajLdr Please hold the line. Obama will appoint no "moderate" #Justice, no matter how appointee may answer questions.
@SenateMajLdr Sandra Day O'Connor: Do your job: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sandra-day-oconnor-scalia_us_56c5313be4b0c3c55053c6d9 …
@SenateMajLdr do not capitulate and give into Obama we cannot put a far left Scotus on the bench. For the sake of our country stand strong
@SenateMajLdr Yes, and don't forget the Obama filibuster! Don't cave!
@SenateMajLdr Guess what? The US Constitution is LAW and that is the only precedent to follow. #DoYourJob or resign.
@SenateMajLdr because he did it, you should too? Grow up.
@SenateMajLdr Don't even bring the nominee up for hearings. You can't trust your caucus to do the right thing.

@SenateMajLdr if u don't like Schumer's past stance why not rise above it AND DO UR JOB?!?!?!
@SenateMajLdr @vjeannek Why don't  you also put up Obamas' speech of his ideology in 2006 leading filibuster against Alitto. Be Brave 4 Once
@SenateMajLdr @vjeannek Stand united and strong against Obama and Democrats on SCOTUS nominee. Let people elect president who will decide.
@SenateMajLdr @vjeannek 
Time to do your job and protect the country from a liberal, activist appointment.
@SenateMajLdr now that you know Matt Bevin or whichever Tea Party guy is gonna beat you next time you wanna act tough. You lied to @tedcruz

@SenateMajLdr "Leader"? U don't know the meaning of the word. Your little turtle head is retracting into your shell.
.@SenateMajLdr Don't forget Republicans are expected to have 24 seats up for election in 2016. You will lose the Senate. This helps Hillary.
@SenateMajLdr Constitution is on the line - no Obama appointment hearings!  Conservatives will work tirelessly to defeat any Rs supporting 1
@SenateMajLdr Listen to the base that made you Majority Leader.  Caving in to Obama will make Reps a minority in Congress for a generation!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress is that how Justice Kennedy was appointed?
@SenateMajLdr Careful, this sounds like you are actually willing to follow a precedent set by a .... Democrat!  <GASP>
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress well Bush was a retard so his point is valid.
@SenateMajLdr You've obstructed. That's all you do. DO YOUR JOB. You get paid way too much to just OBSTRUCT.
@SenateMajLdr Pond scum clump together
@SenateMajLdr I should think THE DEATH of a Justice on #SCOTUS warrants such an occasion right now  #SchumerStandard
Memo to @SenateMajLdr u better help fund the campaign against Chuck Scumer by the @ChairmanEdCox & @NewYorkGOP remember 2006 & 2008 !!!
@SenateMajLdr @MAnotGinger too bad the democrats get slowed down with the past truths. How about the press remind everyone!!
@SenateMajLdr These posts on twitter are well and good, but should be shouted on press conferences and news. GET YOUR NARRATIVE OUT!
@SenateMajLdr And that has what to do with this? If you don't do your job you should be impeached! #VoteOutGop
@SenateMajLdr You're a Seasoned Politician, so why did you allow The GOP to force you to show your hand before Obama made a move?#MorningJoe
@SenateMajLdr McConnell in 2008: Senate should not stop confirming judges in election year http://wapo.st/1Vjno6K 
@SenateMajLdr The keen observer will note that Schumer is one guy, and the Democratic party did confirm the appointment.
@SenateMajLdr Oh bullshit.
@SenateMajLdr LOL so now you want to act like a Democrat? You seem to agree with him.
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr You must be tough! No hearings and no Senate recess until the next president is sworn in! Hold the line!
@SenateMajLdr  the #Reagan standard is much better wouldn't you agree? http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4580714/president-reagan-constitutional-obligation … #SCOTUS #Scalia #PoliticsToday
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan 
"Constitutional Obligation" or 
Strict Construction = "Whatever I Want In The Moment"
@SenateMajLdr Stand your ground. 0bama has done enough damage. Left is just crying because we are using their playbook against them.
@SenateMajLdr Delay, Delay, Delay of the R party is done, Senator
@SenateMajLdr Oh burn.
@SenateMajLdr I pray to God you fade away. I know I am feed up with you not doing your job and acting as a small spoiled brat child

Religious Discrimination at the Supreme Court

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress  ICE GETTING A LITTLE THIN MITCH ??????
@SenateMajLdr stop being a child. They did it too, kinda almost, but mom! You have been caught as a hypocrite. Uphold your oath, do your job
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr 265 days until Election! 338 until term expired! NO Obama SCOTUS! NONE!!!
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr @johnroconnor Schumer said do not CONFIRM. You guys are saying the President should not NOMINATE. Latter is  AVOIDING your JOB
@SenateMajLdr #Barack Hussein #Obama Legacy  http://bit.ly/1vcw688  If That's Really His Name!
@WhatAboutBob7 @SenateMajLdr just curious, do you say Raphael Edwardo Cruz, or just Ted? #hypocrisy?
@SenateMajLdr "He started it!" is essentially what you are arguing.
@SenateMajLdr @mariedowler And this poor excuse for a Senator wonders why politicians are now detested in this country.
@SenateMajLdr  He may have said it. but it didn't happen.  BIG DIFFERENCE.  #racist
@ScottCarmichae1 @SenateMajLdr Yeah - Alito was CONFIRMED ANYWAY
@SenateMajLdr Yeah, but he wasn't his party's leader then, but you are yours now. You have a Constitutional obligation.
@jpj1421 @SenateMajLdr And, correct me if I'm wrong, Justice Alito was voted on, confirmed, and is now sitting on the #SCOTUS. #DoYourJob
@GetRealPolitics @SenateMajLdr Exactly. Should be an up or down vote.
@Blob_Fish @SenateMajLdr 
Follow the rules, except when you don't want to!
@SenateMajLdr Saying "You do it too!" doesn't make your doing it right. Any reference to the Thurmond rule should die like that old racist.
@SenateMajLdr Nice distortion. How about doing your job, instead of trying to cover for your initial stupid comment?
