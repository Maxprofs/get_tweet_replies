@SenateMajLdr @WCPO The American people decided 3 years ago to elect a president to a 4-year term. You don't get to change that. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO @SenateDems. You can't cherry pick the constitution where it suits you.The prez SHALL The Senate do hearing & confirm.

@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO Absurd that u n ur fellow Republicans think its ok to leave judiciary hamstrung over a year. #DoYourJob
@GStanley71 @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO I was in that third branch Mitch. I loved it dearly. Like The Constitution...
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO The third branch is determined by the duties and actions of the other two.
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Two branches are determined by popular election. The third branch is not.
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO The people decided twice asshat; by 5M votes.
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Interesting fact, there are 3 branches of government. It's crazy, but it's true!
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan    
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Ever heard of checks and balances, Mitch?
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO get rid of all the Senators that refuse to do their jobs and have broken the USA Supreme Court
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO The Constitution is like.. Awesome!  Have you ever read it? Article 3 was pretty good, right?
Dear @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan come talk to us when you end up with bat shit crazy @realdonaldtrump as your candidate. #clowncar
@SenateMajLdr You know what I miss most about being alive? The Constitution.  Don't you also like The Constitution, Mitch?
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO the people already spoke - now it's time to do your job and fill the seat
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO Speaker Ryan.. There's absolutely no precedent, constitutional of otherwise, to "let the people decide"
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO Too bad it's all been disproven already https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbIBwjiF7sg … @iamjohnoliver
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO Why ignore what the people who voted for our current prez want? #PeopleHaveDecided
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO @Morning_Joe Senator McConnell, Just follow the constitution it's all about an up or down vote. We look bad
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO @SpeakerRyan The people have already decided. We want our president to fill the seat.
#LetThePeopleDecide 
#FillTheSeat
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO The people did decide you fool.
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WCPO maybe the new USSC Justice can secure the border. Oh, wait. No. They can't. #ChangeIsComing
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @WCPO u need to stop bashing gop potential nominee. Look in ur own house before casting stones
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO The people decided.. you know.. when we voted in our president - twice. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress The people decided in 2012 - through January 2017. You are a disgrace. #doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @WCPO the people did decide, in 2008.
@SenateMajLdr DO YOUR JOB!
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO The people did decide on a president for 8 years, not 7; your a bunch of babies throwing temper tantrum
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO President's elected for 8 years, not 7, your an obstructionist and the GOP are jerks
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO you have I me for an op Ed but not for fulfilling the duties of your job?? Nice role model #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr stop using the American people as an excuse for your continued obstructionism. We spoke in 2012 when we elected @POTUS
Hey @SenateMajLdr! The American people ARE having our voices heard! We elected a @POTUS 4 yrs ago who is still doing his job!! NOW DO YOURS!
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO you've shut down GOP led Congress for 6 years. Now you want to shut down Judicial branch. No wonder Trump has lead.#GOP
.@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Do your job or resign.
.@SenateMajLdr @WCPO The American people did speak. They elected @BarackObama, twice.
@SenateMajLdr Read the constitution! Don't wave it around!
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO The people will remember your partisan obstruction in Nov. Quit putting your party first.
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO  Sir, you were elected to follow the laws and the constitution. DO YOUR JOB. The people HAVE spoken. Obama is Pres now.
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO The people decided when they elected Obama to a 2nd 4-year term. #DoYourJob
My op-ed for @WCPO: Why a Supreme Court nomination should wait for a new president http://www.wcpo.com/news/opinion/op-ed-heres-why-a-supreme-court-nomination-should-wait-for-a-new-president- … #LetThePeopleDecide
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Let me sum up your reason  OBAMA = BLACKENSTEIN
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Didn't the American people choose the President and the Senate? How does that not constitute a voice?
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO #DoYourJob #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO The people have decided, twice. And with the clown leading your nominees it will be three times by November. Do your job
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO this dirty, reprehensible tactic is beneath EVEN YOU, sir!The American people already decided in 2012! SHOW SOME RESPECT
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO DO YOUR JOB.
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO don't need a lip tard
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Psst! The people already decided -- in 2012.
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO already chose the president, 1YEAR=25% of job, all of you need to grow up, fulfill your duties, compromise, compromise
.@SenateMajLdr @WCPO "Because Obama is President" that's not really much of a read you know?
@SenateMajLdr @mikedebonis @WCPO President Clinton and her Democratic Senate? Ok then!
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO you are justifying a desperate political manuver and everyone knows it.  Say goodbye to your control of the Senate.
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Thats right and let the people pick republican presidential candidate
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO No one in #America wants to listen to your #Obstructionism anymore!
@SenateMajLdr @mikedebonis @WCPO The people decided and @POTUS won so please get over it.
.@SenateMajLdr @WCPO the @GOP wants the first black #POTUS to have only 7/8ths of a presidency.  Very originalist
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @WCPO Last time I checked we already have a president that was voted in by the American people.
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Not what the Constitution says, Mr. M &M. Nice try, though.
@realtrondump @SenateMajLdr @WCPO Really? @HarryReid's take, on consideration of Priscilla Owen:
@SenateMajLdr Time to stop BS politics. You're acting like Democrats did under GW Bush. It was BS then, it's BS now. #fracturedrepublicans
@Blob_Fish @thejohnsalley @SenateMajLdr @WCPO Obama did the exact same thing to GW Bush...
@SenateMajLdr @WCPO Why don't you do the honorable thing for the country and leave? Do what the Japanese do. How do you look at ur evil face
