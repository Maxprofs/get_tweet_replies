Tomorrow, I will keep my commitment to vote to move beyond the failures of #Obamacare. I will vote yes on the motion to proceed.
You made a commitment to take away millions of people's insurance. I wish we the people could do the same to all in Congress! No insurance!
Sir, The American people are tired of the RINO's, we want action, or you and many Repubs will lose 2018. Trump won't, but you will.  REPEAL!
Mc Connell will lose if he does repeal. More voters in Ken.want ACA &  undersd that the hlth cr. bill is actual. a tx cut bill.
You only care about the giant tax breaks for the rich in your bill.  You could care less about American citizens. You're a bad man.
A bad, white, rich, southern racists old coot.
you won because you lied. Talk to the majority of Americans.gerrymandering could go the other way.
all u care is tax cuts to rich donors. Talk to all Americans
You know damn well that the PEOPLE don't want your dirty Bill!  This is all about #taxcutsforthewealthy #Doubletalk and #lies. #shameonyou
No one cares Russia has overthrown America because all of you are part of it just to get what you want!!! Evil spoiled brats all of you!!!!
It's very simple MITCHY... REPEAL IT or suffer the consequences... Two words: Eric Cantor! 
Your responsibility goes far beyond the people of Kentucky. ALL AMERICAN'S lives are on the line. We are begging you. Don't repeal #aca.
Come on Kentuckians, is this piece of shit the best you have to offer?

premiums go up and choice goes away because you will not pay the companies $owed.
Repeal the ACA...thats what we want...thats what you and the GOP have promised for years...you have proven to be just as slimy as the dems!!

Don't fall for the line: "I'm voting for the MTP so we can have a healthy debate or to get to a bill I like." Today's vote is THE vote.
What a crock of lies McConnell. ACA is failing bc u are forcing it to fail bc a black pres.tried to help all ppl. POWER TO RICH. SCREW POOR.
Thank you for fulfilling your promise. You can tell any Republican who votes no, that their time in Washington will soon be over!
Nothing less than #FullRepeal #RootAndBranch.
No matter the version, #Trumpcare means millions lose health coverage while millionaires get a tax break #ProtectOurCare
5 people in WH will receive those great tax cuts.
 Trump and Jared are two of them.
God does NOT want 23 million American citizens to die because they lost their healthcare. May God forgive you. One day you will be judged.
Stand firm 4 #FullRepeal! Stand #UnitedForFreedom & get it done! No more gov't overreach! NO 2 socialized med. https://www.facebook.com/GlennBeck/posts/10155570642523188 …
No health care 4 u unless we have healthcare!.husbands life depends on Medicare. NoTax break 4 the 1%!U act like my 4 yr old grnd daughter!
Americans can't stand the swamp you swim in.  You will LOSE!!!
Which you don't care, because you will keep the status quo & screw us! REPEAL
I am listening to your speech in the Senate live, and I must say you are disgusting. KYnect and it's wildly popular. You are a liar.
You are the 2nd worst human being on the planet. I hope you fail to pass this round, like you've failed over and over. #resign #ditchmitch
You could do this by amending the ACA and help the ppl of KY.
We voted you spineless worms in for repeal NO REPLACE!
I thought your commitment was to vote to do what was best for your constituents? When will you put America before Republican?
You are sick. Flying in a dying man to vote when you refused a sitting presidents scotus nomination #sickfcuk
Politicians need to get OVER themselves and get OUT of health care. #FullRepeal #FreeMarketSolutions #UnitedForFreedom
Are you a Senate Leader or a game show host? I hope the @SenateGOP picks the right door. 1) death 2) more death 3) start over and legislate!
It is time to stop this NONSENSE! #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom We demand our liberty be returned!
So your promise was to destroy the middle class and working poor? YOU ARE KEEPING YOUR PROMISE TO YOUE RICH CONTRIBUTORS. Stop lying!
##REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! #UnitedforFreedom!
We know you will vote yes, but we will Vote NO for you!  Support your opponent will be our goal!  #Resist NO #RepealAndReplace


Do not let us down! Senate needs to vote to repeal,  period. Get all in board. Don't fail us or our President
Now we know why you won't investigate Russian interference w/election. Its Rs only hope to win a minority/majority.
#ACA the failures are made by our Republican Party.
You & trump are destroying our democracy. History will shame you
TRUMPCARE = tax break for the 1%
Rich guy w/no values sticking it to middle class & poor! You are not a leader but a moocher off our tax dollars!
Sir, I fully encourage you to take a look at the accounts of other Senators. There are 1000's of people, terrified of your bill. #studyup
Haven't you already done this about 50 times?  U know the definition of insanity right?
Then why don't you vote to REPEAL ONLY?!  GET GOVERNMENT OUT OF HEALTHCARE!
Glen Beck has it right! #fullrepeal #noreplacement #nosinglepayer #freemarketsolutions #unitedforfreedom
https://www.facebook.com/GlennBeck/posts/10155570642523188 …
Shameful!
Kentucky deserves better representation than you. #PartyAbovePeople #DrinkingTrumpKoolAid.
You sir are the main reason for our problems. You.
You didn't commit to taking healthcare away from millions
Do your job sell out!
The child that was saved by health care is still there

I know you have a heart 

Find that heart
Has the south arisen yet. Mitchy you know you see stars when you walk into bars
If you do, millions will be left w/o health care!
FIX This mess! How long have you been in office?
There's nothing better than watching the R's humiliate themselves by their inability to repeal OCare with a R Senate, House and WH.
Quit sabotaging the ACA, you liar! Do not get rid of our healthcare, your party is going to regret this 2018! We will remember!
conmittment? you're deserting Kentuckians, disgracing an office you've held far too long.
I don't think you understand what they asked you to do.  I don't think any of your constituents asked to be reamed up the arse.
No August recess! No recess appointments for AG! You held it over Obama so I know you can do it! #ConferOnly
Shameful to have Senator McCain rush back to Washington to vote on who knows what even after surgery and learning that he has brain cancer
GIT-R-DUN!
You people are not human,im convinced. All you care about is if the person your dealing with has an R by their name. Our country is screwed
Which way did he go...
Turtle...your state has done well under ACA...guess u REALLY don't care about ur state. Only urself like your president
No, my state has screwed small business owners! Two health ins. Options! Premiums $18,000 year + $6000 deductible (fam of 4).
McCain's return could be a game changer.
2nd coming?
Wake up & smell the coffee, Mitch. Americans DO NOT want you to mess with Pres. Obama's brilliant, beloved health care coverage. @MaddowBlog
You did not make a promise to the voters but to the interests of the wealthy. Please be honest
It is time for strong leaders. If you cannot do the job and fail the republican voters who want the OC repealed it may be best if you resign
Republicans had SEVEN YEARS to come up with a better plan and FAILED. They don't have a clue. #TRUTH
Fixing healthcare takes putting us, we the people, before your party! Either fix the #ACA or give us #MedicareForAll.
“What if @SenateGOP had started with ‘how can we help people?’ instead of ‘how can we repeal our enemy’s legacy?’”
Don't you mean to say:  You've made the Commitment to Kentucians to be #Committed?? Why havent you come out #AgainstTrump?? #ByeByeMitch.
Watch the rainmaker tonight senator. You may have the money but ACA is in the right and we will win in the end.
You need to start leading your party. I'm from Kentucky and if there aren't changes, you will no longer get my vote. Bunch of money grubbers
And you will fail. You failed as a Senator during the  Obama Administration. You have damaged the Senate and your country.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
What if we dont want you to?
Start looking for a job
I can't wait till 2020, when the people of KY wake up and replace Mitchy boy.

THIS WILL BE YOUR DEMISE!!! MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WANT THE ACA FIXED, NOT REPEALED OR REPLACED BUT YOU ARE AO HELL BENT THAT U CAN'T SEE!!!!
IT REALLY IS A DISGUSTING, SHORT SIGHTED MOVE ON YOUR PART!!! FIX THE ACA!!!!!!!!!!
Mitch McConnell: Sad Legacy of Obstruction, Corruption and Collusion. ,,,,, "Nevertheless she "PERSISTED"   Sad, Sad little man
Pass or fail, Trumpcare will hurt Trump supporters real bad, why do they want to do that? Money? Power? Both?
