No, Rex Tillerson's knowledge is all about Exxon and Russia drilling in the artic.  Stop lying!
Stock tip of the new year? Buy ExxonMobil
You finally got a president we trust and is strong and u can't get anything done. Pathetic.
@McConnellPress @StateDept oil barons ride again. Who will b horse and who in saddle?

He needs to clear the Ethics Committee. C'mon! Russian enterprises.
Do you have any thoughts of your own anymore or is it just whatever Trump tells you to think.
Bad choice. Buds with Putin, Putin not our friend, must sell Exxon shares or conflicts of interest will doom him and us.
Do not confirm this appointment.  We have enough problems with Russia in our business.
An excellent choice for Russia?  Has the @GOP totally sold out America in its thirst for absolute power?
can u say: conflict of interest- r u in denial? Or do u believe what u say? This is the conservative curiosity
@McConnellPress @StateDept  Please make sure that all candidates are fully vetted before the confirmation hearings begin.
All nominees need to be vetted by the ethics office before approval
 #ethics #conflictofinterest
really? Give me one reason? How will it Make Americas Climate Great Again? How?
@McConnellPress @StateDept He has done biz w/ terriost States & had ties to #Putin HOW CAN YOU CONFIRM?! #hypocrite #shameonya
you r clearly a #Trumpbot that puts #PartyBeforePeople vs doing right thing 4 citizens #NoEthicsNoHearing
Really? So we can be at Trump/ Putin's command.  are you nuts??
Treason.
If health bill does not pass thurs,there will be a dem in the whitehouse in 2020. I'm disgusted with fighting.
#Putinspuppet #TrumpsLapdog way to lead. How's it feel being on a leash?
Your actions of late are an embarrassment to the good people of KY. You should be ashamed. Last term for you!

When Trump is impeached maybe Mich will move to Russia with Trump. We wont miss him in KY.
@McConnellPress  ..shut up Marco
All nominees need to be thoroughly vetted and have all ethics reviews submitted prior to votes. Your rules 2009!

@McConnellPress @StateDept
Mitch McConnell to Reid in 2009: nominee "financial disclosures must be complete... prior 2hearing being scheduled." 
Not to mention how much he will do for Russia. #Kremlincandidate #TheResistance #IllegitimatePresident
Please support the McConnell rule YOU  had for Obama nominees. Did you forget? We didn't.
finish ethics  investigation bf hearing or US will come after you.
how much money are you making by selling your country to Putin?
and he is a friend of one of the worst dictators who kill his own people when he doesn't like them.
@McConnellPress @StateDept you really hate this country don't you!
warmed up to #PutinsPuppet @realDonaldTrump quick after he bribed you with a post for your ol lady #crookedbastard
sure after @realDonaldTrump  bought you off with a cushy post for your wife #hypocrite #PutinPuppetMcConnell #liar
why don't the @GOP give the @dems more time to review the nominees applications?
Reminder..you refused to hold hearings on #SCOTUS you POS traitor
I'd like to hear a bit more of what he and exxon did in Chad.  And Russia.
conflict of interest #russia
Hold your breath until you're blue - oh by the way you've done enough "service" RETIRE!!!
@McConnellPress @StateDept  No!!  Another Putin puppet. WRONG choice.
Mitch you have your head so far up the oil industries ass that it's comical listing to you justifying Trumps pick.
LIAR!
Russian Puppet with goal to lift Russian sanctions for personal gain  opening oil Russian reserves + the world.
really, his ties to russia only lead me to believe you are a traitor to our democracy.
and fluent in Russian, you traitor!
if all of the nominees are so awesome, why are you hiding them in multiple hearings on one day?
His ties to Russia distract from ur payoff(wife) 4trying 2 stop independent investigation into #russianhacking
Feed the wealthy!
another Putin Puppet...
Yet you won't be wanting his tax returns or a full vetting of his Russian entanglements?
@McConnellPress @StateDept No it won't! #Block
you are the reason term limits were invented.
Russian puppets stick together.  Do your strings hurts?
comrade McConnell let's make Russia great.
@SenSchumer Rex needs to be very thoroughly vetted. His deep involvement in Exxon and its probs is a serious concrn
.@SenateMajLdr @StateDept Excellent propagandizing comrade!
ahh the guy with Russian ties. Gotta play nice to keep your wife's new comfy position.
Great choice if you live in Russia.
Stop Rex Tillerson's confirmation. His conflicts are overwhelming.
and it helps get another Putin buddy in the Federal Government.. It's  WIN WIN!
Rubber stamp sucker.
@McConnellPress @StateDept
Are you insane? He is friends with Putin. I gorgot, so are you. #mcconneltraitor #collusion
Yes, his close ties to Putin should prove especially beneficial to Russia, our trusted friend.
Bootlicking lackey.
@McConnellPress @StateDept and we hope it is blocked all the way.  Delay delay delay
Rex is a great friend of Russia's Putin who u claimed is not 'our friend'now talking from both sides of your mouth
Toy for Putin?
Yes, he's a great Russian patriot which is what your party wants now!
oh so you are a Putin lover too. Good to know where you stand.
Could have gone with this pic instead
NO WAY He's part of Comrade Trumps & Putins Mafia circle. I know u owe Comrade Trump 4 hire ur wife
@McConnellPress @StateDept  hand over our government  to Russia nice hope you never get elected  again
Won't happen without full financial disclosures. Fool us once.
.@SenateMajLdr @StateDept This picture is in the dictionary under Conflict of Interest.
@McConnellPress @StateDept finish that thought, so he can polish Putin's shoes and ruin our environment.

@McConnellPress @StateDept when are you going to finally die, how many newborns have you pulped for your vitality pastes
Tillerson's ties to Russia in the face of Russian hacking make him a danger as SOS. This is Crooked Rex. Hypocrisy
So do you get a seat in the Duma for this, or how are you compensated?
And Putin loves him!  Do you think that @realdonaldtrump is a traitor?
given @SenJohnMcCain has said he won't vote for confirmation,his intent is to put on a show. He should cast his vote&leave.
Bad choice and you know it.  Investigate Russian hacking with select committee and you may earn my respect!
Does he speak Russian too? That'll probably come in handy...because, you know.
Tillerson has the friendship award from Russia.U know that country that helped the Russian er GOP win the election.
@McConnellPress @StateDept any democrats that don't block what yall good old boys are doing will lose seats
Especially all experience with his friends and connections in Russia, eh comrade?
you both are selling out American for more money in your pocket and screw the working man. Your time is coming.
Wat experience are you referring to?
You don’t care much about the future of the environment since you’re very old #PutinsPuppet
Watch how fast Trumpsky and Tillerman lift sanctions on Russia. Then watch how fast Russian rebuilds their military
probably the stupidest thing I've heard in a long time - traitor
You look forward to your bank account swelling...
@McConnellPress @StateDept Americans wont tolerate dems blocking SC nominations? R u serious??  Hypocritical windbag
@McConnellPress @StateDept release taxes prove he is not entangled with Russian Government or know you are failing citizens
.@SenateMajLdr @StateDept You forgot to mention, comrade, that he and your new dictator, Putin are BFFs.
He is a Putin toadie, but since you are too, you clearly don't have a problem with that.
So you can rake in more corp. and oil money at the expense of citizens. You are corrupt and a shill and a thief.
@McConnellPress @StateDept Looking forward to Russian investigation the same as millions of others. Tillerson? Big oil. Sure.
Did he show his shiny friendship medal from Putin?  We are not Amerussia. Stop this before it's too late.
yeah sure a corporate CEO in bed w/Russia perfect 4 u & ur know nothing Party if rich old white men #mitchslug
plus he knows how to kiss Putin's ass!  Great pick.  #BetterWay #maga #dts
@McConnellPress @StateDept BS. Tiller's in is nothing but a Russian Shill.
@McConnellPress @StateDept it's hard to find someone less qualified to represent the US without literally installing Putin...
. @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland
his greed, avarice and ties to Putin make him an excellent addition comrade.
An excellent choice for Putin, for the rest of us, not so much. @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @StateDept
@McConnellPress @StateDept 
I expect nothing but the worst from Senator McConnell. And he delivers again and again.
re-election is fast approaching. We will not allow you to go any further.
Exon swine!! Nuff said. Money talks in DC though. Isn't that right!
@McConnellPress @StateDept
His ties to the oil industry and friendship with Putin should disqualify based on current concerns with Russia.
Is that what Putin told you?
Guess which one is a Russian sympathizing traitor? Trick question - they both are.
Excellent choice for stealing the world's oil you mean. Repubs couldn't be more corrupt.
and ties to Russia.
That friendship award from the Russians is cool, too. I can't wait until the US is as nice to live in as Russia!
Eeeeeeeexcelent. Another unqualified billionaire!
Fossil Fuel magnate. Just what we need, but then again, your side is full of climate deniers.
So you like Russia's hands in the US Fed'l Gov't pockets.  You are a Putin Puppet too, MMcM.  Outrageous!
Our Democratic leaders will do everything in their power to block and they have our full support.
TRAITOR. YOU ARE NOT A TRUE AMERICAN.
and you love his allegiance to Russia
this man has too many ties to Russia and big oil.
His head is so far up Putin's ass, he can see Sarah Palin!
Tillerson can't wait to get paid for selling out the American people! Looks like you got your reward already.
how about his ties to Russia, that probably makes him a great asset to your comrades as well.
une 2008, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson attended the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, Russia’s answer to Davos
What about Rex Tillerson's conflicts of interests with his involvement with Russia and Putin? Very bad!
Does the weight of the overwhelming amount of bullshit and lies ever wear out your conscious?
And his oil connections with Russia
remember - drain the swamp...
Don't forget about his private partnership Russian business & his ability to help Putin withhold damning DJT info
Drain the swamp
oppose all trump appointments 
McConnell=swamp things
no trump SCOTUS
BLOCK IT ALL
Great blow job
Welfare for Billionaires for war, making people so poor they can't pay for healthcare. Is Treason!
2 clowns in communion
so his financial ties to a foreign state is OK with you?  You would really sell out ur nation for a few Rubles!!!
The fuck are they smokin on the hill?!?
@McConnellPress @StateDept wow look at all the dinosaurs in the swamp!!! #paytoplay #termlimits
Stop playing around with  fake Russkie Hacking Lies. Get the new Government agency heads CONFIRMED
Have you saw his ties to Russia and oil? Stop playing dumb

should we address him as Comrade Tillerson?
How much are you getting for his revived drilling deal? You're a traitor to your country.
no
@BonnieBengal @StateDept Bullshit
@McConnellPress @StateDept investigation into hacks.  How do you look at yourself in the mirror?
@McConnellPress @StateDept No it doesn't.  Just as your wife getting her position as a payoff for suppressing govt
ARE you serious, You're not fit for the job you have. RETIRE
.@SenateMajLdr @StateDept There is a reasonable doubt that he is a suitable candidate for SoS role due to his  business ties with Russia.
Oil Shill
you're both going to end up in jail for supporting Russia over the United States. sweet dreams!
Will Tillerson have to return Putin's major award, the Order of Friendship? Or is that not a conflict now? @SenateMajLdr @StateDept
his ties to big oil and Russia should not make him eligible
How does it feel to devote your life to oil, greed, corruption and ruining the planet?
LOOKING FORWARD TO REX TILLERSON BURNING UP THE PLANET VIA RUSSIA!  YIPPEE!!
don't forget to kiss the ring, history will not be kind to you sir
Yes, and what a happy coincidence for Trump that he's a buddy of Putin's too...and a big oil guy to boot!  
Plus, he's a friend of Putin, and all Republicans now bow to the Kremlin, because it owns Trump.

You are useless and need to move on for the sake of purpose. You had proven to be lacking this quality
no problem with conflict of interest (EXXONMOBIL)? No problem with close russian ties?
you are a hypocrite - block Garland for months and then think Americans will believe you NOT
Rex Tillerson's conflicts of interest only pale in comparison to those of the PEOTUS. Bad choice.
The people hope YOU will ease ALL confirmations, using all the tools available to the senate. Minority is bent 2 obstruct
conflicts of interest
So you're okay with his Russian connections?
His knowledge and experience in navigating the corruption of Russian government contracts?
I remember a time when the Republicans were not in bed with the Russians. I miss those days. This is unamerican.
Leader McConnell appears to accept Trumps willful and intentional acceptance for foreign prohibited emoluments
Gotta protect his wife's new cabinet position.
This guy is as corrupt as they come. Make sure you protect your wife's job. Damn puppet!
The most worthless partisan hack on the hill. He is always #partybeforecountry
LAWYER-UP:   Dems setting up PACs, lawyers to thwart Trump's admin. to perform will of the people thru loopholes in laws.
