Doubt that, he's a bigot
Did you have a straight face when you wrote that? To go a long w/ him, what's he have on u?
Coretta Scott King
Coretta King disagrees.  You are corrupt.  Treasonous.  We know you.
Who are you trying to kid?
Bullshit.
Black Americans? Ask Corbetta Scott King about Sessions.
#LetHerSpeak #LetLizTalk #ShePersisted
You mean white Americans.
...all except black, brown ,red  Americans
all white Americans with a few"Asians" thrown in.
Asshming they are rich, white, Christian, men
Why isn't the senator answering any of his phones or listening to voicemails?
The worst choice ever.
And if he isn't, will you have the backbone to stand up to him??? Doubt it.
sorry but you are a fool. An arrogant one at that. You are afraid of CS King?? Lame!
You mean since you abuse your position to silence opposition debate. #shameonyou
USa has the right to know what type of man Sessions is. #LetLizSpeak  #LetCorettaSpeak
he is a racist as is the President and you sir.   #LetLizSpeak
Sessions is indicted by his own record. Silencing the truth makes it obvious to EVERYONE.
no he is a vicious racist!  And support for him means support for racism!  We persist!
how do you define "all Americans?"
Except minorities, women and voters.  Long live the words of Mrs. King and Senator Warren!
McConnell's disrespect for women is appalling.  She persisted & he showed his bullying, sexist self.  Thanks for publicity!
Edit: white straight male Americans
Let Warren Speak!!!!
said no one
Another LIE.
.@McConnellPress @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept If by "All Americans" you mean white men who ache to get back at women & hate Blacks.
. Sessions will not be for the people. He'll be for the president. There's a huge difference. Vote NO on Sessions.
Sessions is a blatant racist. SHAME on you , Mitch!  Do  you have any shame? I think  not!
Love when a guy tells a woman to shut up and sit down. My god. Did u not see Womens March?
Why shut down @SenWarren but not her male colleague for the same behavior?
Sessions is a racist jerk and should never have been nominated. He's unfit for the job!
That is an out and out lie. How can you hold your nose in support of Trump and his policy
he is very biased and has shown he is bigoted. He will easily be manipulated by POTUS
Let me finish your sentence--unless you're a person of color, of the Muslim faith, etc etc
You should be real proud yourself for putting the little women in her place last night.
you haven't been paying attention. If the GOP sen confirms a racist, you are all guilty too
telling EW to sit down and shut up using King's words...guess you finally got your chance
Blatantly untrue! Sessions is prejudiced against blacks and women. Not qualified for AG!
Nothing in his track record says he will be. Ignoring the past gets us no where.
we've already established that is a LIE you are trying to sell. #shame
would you like some bread so you can make a sandwich with all this Bologna?
*disclaimer: a woman is NOT going to make the sandwich for you, as I'm sure you expect us to*
.@McConnellPress @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Except women, and black or brown folk. But they don't count, do they? #AmericaInDanger
You & your staff have ABSOLUTELY no credibility- all lies, half truths and Alternative Facts, we are watching & listening
God help us all. #letlizspeak #resist
minorities in general and constitution lovers in particular will benefit by Sessions
mcconnell- too bad lynching is not legal for you and your " fiends"
fascist!
chauvinist!
Bullcrap,just for conservative,that's not all Americans!Try representing the rest of us too
#LetLizSpeak  #McConnelisScared!
Except victims of sexual assault or immigrants from Muslim majority countries, right?
We're not so sure about that.

@SenateMajLdr
Coretta Scott King was right!
*unless you're black, brown, female, or any other minority....
....who are white and male and answer to Comrade trump. Now the statement is true.
Jess Sessions will be an Attorney General for All White Americans. Fixed it for you
I call BS and you know it. Sessions will be a racist nightmare.
except for old black people that he intimidates.  McConnell you are evil
your censure of Sen. Warren was reprehensible. No exception for facts? Perfect for liars.
no he won't. The hypocrisy of this statement is monumental.
you should be ashamed of yourself for silencing @SenWarren reading Mrs. Kings letter you sir are a racist just like potus
NO! Vote No
Unless you are black, or a woman, or worse yet, a black woman.  #AuthoritarianRule=EndMitch
that are white!!! Disgusting Mitch! #theresistance
another racist, misogynistic to add to the swap
NO HE WONT! ANOTHER MISTAKE! You've brought enough HATE back to America!
if this happens you will be turning back time. Listen to the American people.
Yes so why didn't you #letlizspeak?
all Americans who agree with you or all Americans?
Where is the record to show it? Qualified AG noms dont require such simplistic reassurances
bg suggests he will hurt #VotingRights, diversity in #Kentucky, US #DividedWeFallKY
As a #constituent from #AllenCounty I urge you to respectfully,fully hear the case against @SenatorSessions
If @SenatorSessions had the integrity you claim, then why silence @SenWarren? Let our fears be heard #Kentucky #constituent
The Republicans, especially you! Need to stop going against the people, siding with Rump!
"The Party told you to reject all evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command." Orwell "1984"
@JohnCornyn @tedcruz Vote no on Sessions.  We need a AG who can and will stand up to Trump!
Jeff Sessions will be AG for ALL WHITE RACIST Americans. He is the Devil #letlizspeak
Not close. He represents Alabama at best. That's it for the George Wallace clone.
He's been a racist and a bigot.  What changed?  How did his heart turn?  Why?
I disagree
Only the ones who keep their mouths shut, right?
