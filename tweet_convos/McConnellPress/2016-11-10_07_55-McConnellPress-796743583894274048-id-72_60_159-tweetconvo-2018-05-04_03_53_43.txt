May Plans be Decided for First 100 Days

You and trump can have a circle jerk.
I'm sure you'll all learn a lot off each other & will have a compounded effect in the results
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence 
Remember we elected #TrumpPence2016 your role is to carry the water so the reforms happen
@mike_penceAre you going to block everything this president wants to do?
die
Don't you even think of NOT building the wall!
You find the money!
The trillions u waste!!
You're all pitiful. McConnell, you're a snake!
if you don't want to lose your Senate Majority Leader you will try to pass the border wall
@McConnellPress Great power  great responsibility. Everything is going "nuclear" -we hope the filibuster is not one of them.
At this point you don't know if you are coming or going. Dysfunctional old man
#McConnell
the country will be watching who you nom to the SC. Thx for blocking Garland. #shameonyou
@winatdelmr @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Weak McConnell needs to learn from Trump/Pence how to be strong!
You are http://slime.You  nominated a fascist con man groper.Joke's on all of us.
Mitch McConnell is part of the SWAMP.
Interesting isn't it that when Pres Obama was sworn in you vowed to destroy him and stonewall him
Hope you feel that way when you meet Satan on JUDGMENT DAY.
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Polish your nose.
hopeflly those convrsations nclude introducing legislation requiring mor than 2 political parties
Praying for Action to help the American People! 
Don't mistake kindness for weakness if Trump don't get the deal he wants he'll chew u up & spit u
Term Limits Term Limits!!!!!!!!
You said infrastructure is not a top priority. Civil engineers disagree. How do you square that?
Country is not unifying cause all you did was to obstruct President Obama.
If your such a political genius, how is it you keep meeting newly elected GOP pols you didn't really want elected?
First test @realDonaldTrump, rec MM is the "elite", demand your repl. MM: #enemy#1 to all Americans since '09.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress
Make the most of it and get behind Trump.  Do not squander this opportunity like u did before!!!!
Give same respect GOP afforded Obama. GOAL: Trump is a 1/4 Term POTUS. NOTHING passes. No SCOTUS we don't like. IMPEACH NOW.
.@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence  Also, I intend to give Trump the same respect that all of you gave Pres. Obama. NONE.
.@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence  Just remember, Clinton won the popular vote.  Trump has no mandate here.
Except for having two houses of Congress as coattails, right?
.@JohnDanneskjold  Again, Trump has no mandate. @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence
Will that be ok?
calling on all Dems 2 work with Trump same way Repubs worked with Obama & in Congress with DEMS
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence You'd better get behind him or get bounced out on your arse. U r why GOP is dying
could you tell them to tell their supporters to cool it on the threats of race-based violence? Thx
just have a stroke or massive heart attack and die already. #Satan has gotten his dues already.
ALLOW TEMP INSURANCE for full year contracts-Obamacare limited it to 3 MONTH.
Do something about healthcare. Seriously.  Now.  Look at my 2017 "Bronze" premiums and deds
will be my pleasure to help vote you out of office mark my words we will not forget nor forgive
Weasel makes me sick!
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
@McConnellPress career politician.  You are what is wrong in America. @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence
First item of business - repeal Obamacare.  The @GOP now has full control
Term Limits!!!!!!!!!!
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence I can't wait to make this PIG a 1-Term President.#NotMyPresident #AmericaMourns
Trump is going to rally the country against you and you will be recalled.  Term limits or bust!
ChaIr Makes McConnell Do the Republican Committee sign up sheet.

-appoints Democrats in January
ummm wasn't you against him getting the nomination? Might be a little odd lol
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence YOU SUCK!!
@SpeakerRyan You have a GREAT chance to improve the lives of ALL Americans.  Don't mess it up!!
Mitch it will be up to you to Carry the Ball, Get Joe to move over to Expand numbers
I suspect this won't be the Republican dream, but gridlock. Cruzing attacks from the right.
build the wall no excuses!!!!!!
trust it will never happen and they know it. Mexico will not comply
Looking forward to supporting your R challenger. YOU MUST BE REMOVED, RINO!
What will you do to ensure that 20 million people who now have ACA continue to have healthcare?
hopefully nothing.  The nanny state must end.
Or just let them die. Who wants worthless people anyways.
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence  don't touch my rights!!! http://www.nomblog.com/41186/ 
you have no rights, this is America.
. Hopefully he tells you to step down Turtle
