is that the best you can do? Like all others , protecting Muslims? Voters  know the game and that's why we want #Trump2016
he was born here, his parents were not. He had terrorist ties. Trump is only one who will stand4America
you are not talking sense , are you saying it's ok let them overrun USA and kill us all , set up sharia?
cut off the money, jobs , that will help, work to remove the criminal elements,make sure they no can't stay !
whether Jihadist or not....
And how much $ did you receive from NRA???
.@SenateMajLdr Forgot to add: Meanwhile, my party & I plan to continue our unconscionable practice of blocking possible solutions. #yousuck
We don't need your prayers. We need you to stop siding with the damn gun lobby & pass gun control laws! You are responsible!
blame guns while we allow 1000s of anti American Muslims in the country.  Get a clue
The shooter was BORN in America.
Amazing how fear creates hate & ignorance in people. They don't recognize it but project it.
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE DAMN GUNS!!!  I DOUBT THAT YOU EVEN PRAY.  DO SOMETHING FOR THE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF JUST FOR YOUR OWN FINANCIAL GAIN!!
I would be honored if you would listen to this perspective on the need for action.
how about doing something as well? Take action. We need to study gun violence as a health crisis. We CAN do this. You need to.
I think we need to talk about how this was able to happen. Republicans, stop blocking the fight against assault weapons!
Why don't you retire, old man?
@SenateGOP Our prayers would be answered if we limited the kinds of guns that could be purchased in the USA.
@SenateGOP  Prayers are good, but we need action to come to bi-partisan solutions on gun control, now.
@SenateMajLdr
may you rot in hell you pos hypocrite.
How many more prayers do we need before we get a congress that does something about it? #GodHelpsThoseThatFirstHelpThemselves
@SenateGOP DAMN UR MOMENTS OF SILENCE SILENCE ON STOPPING EASY ACCESS 2 AUTOMATIC WEAPONS N ALL AMMO THEY WANT IS KILLlING US!
Your prayers are hollow. NRA bought you for $9900.  You have blood on your hands. Shame on you and your NRA colleagues.
@SenateGOP keep your prayers, ban assault weapons
No more gun laws. Try to remember "shall not be infringed" No more, we're done giving in on this.
Save your prayers and moments of silence. Just pass effective gun control and stop bullying the LGBTQ community.
@SenateGOP #Enough with prayers. Do your job. Vote to end gun violence.
.@SenateMajLdr cram your BS where the sun don't shine. Hope you go to sleep each night thinking about the blood money you take from #NRA.
i am at a loss for words, you continue to disappoint. Where are your values? Your morals? #NRA #Orlando #blame
no no no - wrong: enforce #gun control you bonehead
we don't want prayers we want gun legislation.
You. Do. Not. Speak. For. Me.
@McConnellPress Follow that moment of silence with moments of legislative ACTION. Please take away assault weapon violence.
Coming from U they're not.Stop BULLSHITTING.U could give a RAT"S ASS as to what happened in Orlando.
You have power, prayer is not sufficient. Gun reform. Actions speak louder than the lies you spew.
you need to step down. Trump is correct!
You are dis honoring "we the people". Shameful
NO MORE PRAYERS! Do something! Oh, I forgot, you take NRA and blood is on your hands!
Instead of prayers, how about you stop pocketing money from the #NRA so there's less blood on your hands? #OrlandoShooting
@McConnellPress prayers don't save lives. help stop this from happening again by supporting gun control laws. please.
@McConnellPress To go after Americans right to self defense in the face of an attack is the act of tyrants.
@McConnellPress "my prayers with you, but try to forget that $1.2mm @Nra blood money."
Enough of your hypocritical "prayers."  You have blood on your hands.
We dont want your empty memorized prayers! We want ACTION! #DoSomething! Where's the vote. #GOP allows these murders.
you send prayers to the families yet voted to keep their loved ones from getting married and voted to let the killer get a gun
@SenateGOP prayers are not enough. Pass gun control laws!
We're sick of your prayers after a mass shooting has occurred. How about some common sense gun laws re: AR-15s?
@McConnellPress @NRA #fuckyourprayers #divorcetheNRA @FCKH8 #weareorlando #blacklivesmatter
your prayers aren't working, but your hatred towards other human beings are
@McConnellPress just not my support in the congress. You sir are sad!
@McConnellPress You and your cronies are hypocrites. Nobody needs an assault weapon to defend themselves. #NRA  #Orlando
Right..  as you collect your bazillions to protect the NRA.
How about you quit praying for victims of gun violence and do something about it
McCONNELL says" And I Will Continue to  Push 4 Americans 2 Own Assault Weapons"
@SenateGOP the LGBT Community
There is blood on your hands. How DARE you say anything but "I'm sorry I think it's ok for civilians to own assault rifles."
There's blood on your hands & the hands of every obstructionist who bends to the gun lobby behind closed doors #YouHadOneJob
WTH? You are not permitted to be part of the problem and portend to be part of the solution #BoycottNRA
worthless as per usual
But you won't monitor gun ownership, will you.
hopefully you won't be bought by @NRA into allowing terror suspects to buy assault rifles
gun control now!
Homophobia, your brand of homophobia to be exact.
Empty statement with empty despicable intentions to distort and continue to be the most vile politician. #ISoldMySoul2TheNRA
you're pathetic for not saying that LGBTQ people were targeted & for blocking gun control #rethinkthe2nd
Prayers are NOT enough.  Do your job. #Orlando
You took millions from the NRA and you say you pray for the victims.  You should pray for forgiveness for being a hypocrit
@SenateMajLdr
GAY PEOPLE WERE MURDERED. QUEERS. STOP ERASING US.
@McConnellPress Try passing some basic gun legislation with that!!
@McConnellPress If only  you could actually do something - like pass gun legislation
@SenateGOP Here's what we know about the victims of the Orlando shooting http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orlando-shooting-victims_us_575e0bebe4b0e39a28adf8cf …
Save your prayers. You don't believe in God.
What are YOU doing to ban assault weapons??? Thoughts and prayers don't stop bullets from an AR-15
your thoughts & prayers are meaningless. GUN REFORM NOW.
your actions helped cause this tragedy Mitch. All the money in the world won't wash off the blood on your hands.
.@SenateMajLdr Your "prayers" do not align with your votes. Do something useful. PASS UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ALL GUN SALES.
How will that help since the terrorist probably passed a BGC? @SenateMajLdr
voted AGAINST blocking people on terror watchlist from buying firearms. show your support through actions. #ashamedofyou
@SenateMajLdr
received over $900K from the NRA to allow terrorists to buy military grade weaponry
Ban those murder weapons NOW!
.@SenateMajLdr More pathetic platitudes. We need an #AssaultWeaponBan - #OrlandoShooting #gunsense #BanAssaultWeapons #NRAKills #VoteBlue
#VictimsRightsMatterMore than #prayers stand up to the gun lobby and homophobia
It's a meaningless statement unless you take action.
Typical turtle talk that means nothing.
if it wasnt 4 THE PEOPLE the @NRA wouldn't give a  about U. The PEOPLE placed U there. Do Your Job! #GunControlNOW
You and your cohorts are just as guilty as the shooter.
fyi, you and your party’s rhetoric are responsible for this, not international terror groups.
.@SenateMajLdr, you'll understand our revulsion at your statement after you've voted against those same victims' existence over & over again
Very sad event there.
I don't know how you sleep at night.
@McConnellPress UNBELIEVABLE. You personally rolled out the red carpet(w/other officials) & let this happen. #OrlandoShooting
Because your prayers are always so helpful. Said no one, ever.
After the prayers can we talk about funding and allowing the CDC to study causes of gun violence in order to reduce it?
@SenateGOP Fuck your prayers. Stop blocking common sense gun control bills that the majority of America supports. #nrawhore
I Hold you personally responsible for failing to keep the offending weapon out of this criminals hands. Your prayers = ZERO
So now you support #LGBT people? Skip the prayers and make some action against #hatecrimes and #gunviolence.
also, the people spoke when they elected your obstructionist ass to the senate. Do your job and hold confirmation hearings.
Explain to us why allowing folks on the terror watch list to buy guns is okay.  Don't need ur prayers, need u to act.
But you won't actually do anything about this because of the @NRA right?
perhaps you taking $933,000 from the NRA WILL STOP? Ban assault weapons
@SenateGOP Stop your candidate who is taking tragedy for campaign purposes. GOP is sad no control
@SenateGOP hypocrite! every Republican who refused to ban assault weapons is an enemy of the people.
@SenateGOP Stop supporting your NRA terrorists & getting yr kickbacks,with your non-sense 2nd amendment!
IMPEACH OBAMA!! Americans demand you protect us from this tyrant traitor.
@McConnellPress You admit DT "knows little about the issues". BE A LEADER AND WITHDRAW YOUR ENDORSEMENT!!!
Now act and NOT on behalf of NRA. Look at US Mass Shootings Index first. That should give you a great clue where to start
I DONT SEE ANY MENTION OF LGBT PEOPLE IN HERE YOU WALKING PIECE OF ACTUAL DOG SHIT
@SenateGOP YOU AND THE REST OF YOUR REPUBLICAN CRONIES HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS
You personally put the gun in that man's hand with your decision to ensure terror suspects can buy AR-15s. Congratulations.
It was pretty firmly connected to your refusal to pass effective #guncontrol legislation because of your @NRA blood money
So effectively you will monitor the situation so that you can do absolutely nothing? Do us a favor and choke on your lunch.
$922,000 from the NRA says you have blood on your hands AGAIN!
#nrawhores
@McConnellPress stop doing nothing you are an NRA puppet
You foment hatred against gays but NOW you care? #TooLittleTooLate
you voted against stopping people on terror watch lists from buying guns, #bloodonyourhands
Dear Sen. McConnell, kindly take your sentiments and shove them up your A@@!!!

Your finger was ALSO on that trigger!!!
Why didn't you vote for LGBTQ protections?
You are phony as a $3.00 bill!  How do you look at yourself in the mirror? The blood of all these victims is all over you!
You need to address your gun laws , how many next time? in the UK we had Michael Ryan in the 1980's the UK government acted !
What have you done to challenge homophobia and hatred??? Nothing? Save your fake tears.
@SenateGOP AYDEH MY WAY OR HIGHWAY COMRADES
coward.
voted for ban of same-sex marriage & against adding sexual orientation to hate crimes. 
STOP VOTING AGAINST #LGBTQ2S EQUALITY
in other words; you'lldo nothing but keep receiving money from the @NRA
my copy got cut off, please retweet with the part about "hate crime against gays" ...? #GaysBreakTheInternet
YOU TOOK CLOSE TO 1 MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE NRA TO KILL THE BILL AGAINST WATCH LIST NAMES BUYING GUNS. THIS IS ON YOU .
you did this
Prayers are with victims, and as someone who's long been owned by @NRA, you're accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando.
@McConnellPress your Orlando prayers mean nothing; you received more than $1,200,000 from NRA.
.@SenateMajLdr You know what would help more? If U had voted to stop terrorists from being able to purchase guns. NRA=WIN, 50 families, LOSE
BLOODY BLOODY HYPOCRITE - $922K worth of NRA #bloodonyourhands
You have no moral authority and you make no sense. Disingenuous.
you don't care about those victims or their families. You have been bought by the NRA. You don't do your job. You just block..
you're a hypocrite
Your prayers are hollow. How much do we need to raise to buy your vote for common sense gun laws. A cool $1M from NRA.Shameful
no more prayers -- you have the power to take action -- assault rifle ban!!!
you are bought and paid for by the NRA so you're part of the problem. Please just shut the fuck up and go away.
stop with the hollow prayers. Pass laws to restrict military weaponry to the military not citizens. #TimeForGunSafety
Can you stop praying and pass laws to stop these massacres?
