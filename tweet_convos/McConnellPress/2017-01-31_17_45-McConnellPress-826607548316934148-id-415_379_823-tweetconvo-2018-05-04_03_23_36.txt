You unconstitutionally stole a supreme court seat, that will always be on your head. History will remember this shame.
Glad he did so aftwr seeing all your libtard tears!
oh my gosh Abraham Lincoln traveled through time and is now on twitter, how eloquent!

a true statesman!

Truly feel bad for McConnell at this point, he has to pander to people like you
Did they teach you how to be an unwashed, New Yorker-subscribing weirdo in the socialist reeducation camp?
I hope he gets the same treatment you gave Garland, you should resign
@SenateGOP @POTUS Merrick Garland
.@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Merrick Garland would have been a great #SCOTUS too, but you wouldn't even give him a fucking hearing, you HYPOCRITE!!
What a hypocrite! Garland was robbed. How do you sleep at night????
.@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @SenateGOP Give Garland a Vote! Give Garland a Vote! Give Garland a Vote! Give Garland a Vote! #MerrickGarland #Resist
Merrick Garland

Hypocrite! Garland was also a fine choice, all you did was sacrifice democracy at the cost of the people! Resign!
Dems need to block this nominee. The SCOTUS pick was Obama's. #resist #obstruct
You need to step down turtle man. Your a traitor.
You wouldn't do your job to hold a hearing for Merrick Garland, but now want Dems to do so. #hypocrite
hypocrite, hypocrite, hypocrite, hypocrite.  You wouldn't even let a hearing for Garland proceed.Time for you to go.
@SenateGOP @POTUS enjoy your time in power while it lasts. The blizzard is becoming an avalanche. We are not backing down.
whoop!!
#Deplorables voted for this mandate. It's time to get tough and use the #LiberalDemocrat nuclear tool.#AmericaFirst
You utter hypocrite. You are a traitor to your country.
Dem Senators should vote no on any nominee until @realDonaldTrump re-nominates Judge Garland.
Remember, you asked that he be treated like Obama's nomination.
@McConnellPress @POTUS time for you to go Mitch.
Thank you Mitch McConnell. Neil Gorsuch is a great choice. You have restored my opinion of you as a leader.
Just wow. You are the example to the children of America, how NOT to behave. Lies and hypocrisy.
@SenateGOP @POTUS  votes your way for big money & corporations. The Lyin Leader.
@SenateGOP @POTUS  After denying us our constitutional rights with Judge Garland. You disgusting liar would want a Scalia who
You are a "Cuckster"
NOW GIT 'ER DONE !!!!
hysterical Democrats  untrustworthy dragging feet #confirmgorsuch #NuclearOption a must!!!! #MAGA

MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND #hypocrite
Have your self dealing frat boys answer the phones y'all are obstructing Americans from communicating with all of you!

@SenateGOP @POTUS McConnell you suck. Go retire.
I think no vote should be held until the next election, so the people may speak! We are an election cycle coming up.
Neil Gorsuch should receive the same treatment that Merrick Garland received. SHAME on you Republicans. Shady.
And Merrick Garland was not qualified? Your partisanship and hypocrisy know no bounds.
#DoYourJob we have not forgotten. Whatever you say. I don't read lips.
chock on a chicken bone or pretzel you obstructionist! #filabusterGorsuch
@bab_tinkerbell @POTUS I agree! 
@SenateGOP @POTUS perhaps because you are the problem
You are a lying, obstructionist. Your agenda is not America. Democracy is America. You Sir, are a sociopath. #GetHelp
@SenateGOP @POTUS you aren't
@McConnellPress @POTUS I'm just gonna leave this here
You shame the great state of my parents birth.
@McConnellPress @POTUS I saw we wait for a nominee made by someone elected by the majority of Americans.
The president is in his last year so we should wait until the next president to pick a #SCOTUS.
@McConnellPress @POTUS he is due the same respect and consideration you provided to Merrick Garland.
Merrick Garland was the best pick Repub Congress is corrupt & does not represent USA U should be ashame u are vile man
@SenateGOP @POTUS pathetic
Democrats should simply treat Gorsuch the same way the GOP treated Garland. No better, no worse.
@SenateGOP @POTUS So don't let the dems delay it. If they do, go around them. He needs to on the bench by March
CONGRESS--U all NEED TO lead US TO A TRUE BIPARTISAN WORKING GOVT. we do NOT care about party!
@SenateGOP @POTUS Do you get how much tape there is of u refusing to hear MG out of SPITE? & now you're destroying the cntry..
You already voided the Constitution. Why does it matter now?
i refuse to believe anything this hypocritical weasel says
@SenateGOP Pls require every Sen, who accepted campaign contributions from DeVos fam, to recuse  #ethics  #draintheswamp

You have lost all credibility to speak on the subject. #MerrickGarland
@SenateGOP @POTUS @SenateDems should #FilibusterGorsuch for treatment of @POTUS44 and Judge Garland.
Amen. Holy is the Lord Jesus.
@SenateGOP @POTUS Be prepared to share the crime for abortion men,Women can't get pregnant by themselves
@SenateGOP @POTUS 
No! You wouldn't even grant a hearing for Garland! Obama was elected by the people too! 
#Obstructionist
@SenateGOP @POTUS.. Are u finally on the Trump Team? Or afraid of government spending cuts for Lobbyists?
@SenateGOP @POTUS don't let the liberal socialist democrats con you on their vote. Remember what Schumer did.
@SenateGOP @POTUS Sir, do you care about me? A gay man? My black brethren? The women whom have shaped me? Our VETS. Our dis..?
.@SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @POTUS since you stole this chair from dems, maybe both should be placed.  No set # of judges over history.
You are the absolute worst!
@SenateGOP @POTUS 
@SenateGOP @POTUS your review is coming up and I doubt you will win reelection #TakeNote
@SenateGOP @POTUS now make sure he is confirmed.
You are excrement incarnate, McConnell.
. Demand president release his tax returns
LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL No
Will you ask him to explain his opposition to women's rights and why he favors corporations over workers?
@PutinRF ex-KGB chief -MI6 spy's dossier @POTUS http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/27/mystery-death-ex-kgb-chief-linked-mi6-spys-dossier-donald-trump/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw â€¦ @telegraphnews #ChristopherSTEELE report on his desk!
@realdonaldtrump DO NOT let this nominee wither on the vine more than a month-USE the nuclear option.
@TammieW76139285 @POTUS Now go get him confirmed!  Nuke if you must - dont delay too long.
you two are two peas in a pod and we are watching very closely. Beware of the next election cycle.
@McConnellPress @POTUS Lier lier lier lier lier!!!!!
@McConnellPress @POTUS The constitution and law don't matter to you. You cheat lie and steal your way to a result
@McConnellPress @POTUS you're funny the lies and deceit still goes on what a mess!
you stole a pick, support a fraud, Nazis, corporations in gov Constitutional laws being broken daily. You are a traitor
YOU have a loser mentality, talk is cheap! Get going with the confirmation of @POTUS cabinet or get out!
Judge Garland was excellent choice as well, but GOP had 2 play political games w/America's future. Legacy of NO 4 USA.
No leadership shown here.  Only disdain for the Constitution was shown by non-leader McConnell.

Agree. Please push the confirmation through quickly, Mr. Senate Leader!
@McConnellPress @POTUS you failed to uphold the Constitution when President Obama made his choice. You have failed America
Merrick Garland would have been good. No complaints when you get opposition.
@McConnellPress @POTUS Democrats will offer the same consideration YOU extended to Merrick Garland.
he is not gettinfmg a vote, go ahead and try to change the rules and see how real Ameeicans respond
you have failed the majority #impeachtrumpnow #unfittoserve
U obstructed Merrick Garland from even being heard. Outrageous that u expect anything else in return. U should resign.
It is good choice. The Dems should approve. The next one will be the one to fight. Hopefully after midterm election
Russia is blackmailed no hope m and you Ryan and atrump are now know as the unholy Trinity! There will not be. GOP after this
so proud that your alt facts are big we have Americans hating Americans while you quietly screwed your own constituents
feeling happy you put a king on the throne? Selling your soul
don't protect trump he really doesn't care what you say he is the king
I really don't know how you help Americans when you work for yourself
He should be granted the same respect you showed for Merrick Garland.  I trust you will remain consistent.
Merrick Garland was picked for this seat. Hopefully the Dems will listen to hearings on Garland, not Gorsuch!
RETIRE!
You're a hypocrite.
- how could we possible trust your read of the constitution? You've lost ALL credibility on that front.
Your legacy, continued...Worked very hard to repeal ACA, so that Culling of the poor can start.
it will be very interesting to see the legacy you leave behind...A great obstructionist! A hypocrite of all times!!
@McConnellPress @POTUS you refused to consider Obama's SCOTUS pick & set a new precedent.  The court has operated fine with 8.
Your pathetic, you sit by while our country is put in imminent danger by trump are his orange brigade & do nothing!
Can you explain what this is suppose to mean? Got it off of Mark Cuban timeline.
Will he be a SCOTUS justice?
WATCH â†’ Merrick Garland will be a great #SCOTUS.I applaud @BarackObama for his excellent pick to our nation's highest court.
what the fuck is up with your face
Gorsuch ruled bosses make calls on women's repro-health. If he'd ruled men's bosses could say vasectomy or nothing, you'd care
Why on earth should Dems support this nomination when Obama's third pick wasn't given the time of day?
and to you sir I say Merrick Garland....you will not get by this one not with what you did to him
The @POTUS cant do that for same reason Obama couldn't. He's in last yr of presidency.
Fine, now do your job and get this done NOW not a year from now.
FILBUSTER SCOTUS. Only 8 justices needed
Just like Merrick Garland,Gorsuch is a respected  judge.He  should receive same type of fair & honest consideration in Senate.
You openly admitted to doing all you can to block Obama on everything. We'll gladly treat you the way you treated him.
