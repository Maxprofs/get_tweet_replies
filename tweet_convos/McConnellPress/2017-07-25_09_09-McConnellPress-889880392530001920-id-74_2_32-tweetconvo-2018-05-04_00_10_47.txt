You don't care about the American people.  You care about rich people.  I don't like you.  I'm sure you don't care about that.
Your better to OBama care is getting rid of pre existing conditions, women's health checks for mammograms and uterine cancer screenings.
I wish you the best of luck. You have a tremendous task before you!
YOU can't do better if ALL YOUR REALLY INTERESTED IN  is your rich Insurance Co CEOs Donations.
Free enterprise is better than Obamacare.  Medicaid is welfare, not an entitlement.  Repeal, repeal, repeal.
How is it you've had 8 yrs to find a better plan and you have nothing?
Work on Improving ACA/Obamacare. All other industrialized nations have single payer healthcare.  Your interest is a tax break for wealthy

You are a liar this is because you hated president Obama now you are stuck with president bannon
NO BAILOUTS FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES EVEN THOUGH THEY GIVE SENATORS CAMPAIGN $$!!!! #MAGA #DRAINTHESWAMP
Better for who?  Not the American people.
You dont know how
First step, hell after 8 years you'd think we'd be a little further along than dragging a cancer patient in for a  1vote margin on a tax cut
disgusting 
Republican senators acting so incompetent. Repeal, hear EVERYONEs suggestions and GET IT DONE! Not rocket science!!
You do know what 'debate' means, yes?
We can do better than the Republican party. If they repeal healthcare vote them ALL out.
"Skinny bill" is what the vote is on 15MIL LOSE INS & PREMIUMS GO UP 20%! How is that better th a n ACA?
Please tweet link to detailed description of ur better than Obamacare plan, which u & GOP have been working on for past 7 years.
Come on Kentuckians, is this piece of shit the best you have to offer?
Will the mines reopen soon?
Sir, you have no intention to do better! U have a responsibility to protect the lives of the American people which the current bill does NOT
If today's vote does not, the GOP is burned toast. You may as well retire.
Wrong again. You are not listening to the majority.
Throwing sick and dying people off of #Obamacare isnt the step in right direction. fixing #Obamacare is. #BetterCare is not #Trumpcare .
And you are a liar
What's the replacement Senator?  America doesn't trust you to do the right thing

Senator, if you have the authority to change the majority vote in the Senate to 51, please do so. A majority should be 51 "yes's!

Don't fall for the line: "I'm voting for the MTP so we can have a healthy debate or to get to a bill I like." Today's vote is THE vote.
The ACA has saved lives and provided a lifeline for many, you're sick and twisted to want to rip this away from people
could PRESIDENT PENCE help UNITED States?
#eatabagofdicks
Repeal now get the party together or there will be a blood bath 2018.
GOP had a hugh hand in demolishing our military during President Barack Obama

Now you are trying to kill us
If you can do better why haven't you offered anything better in the past 7 years and why is BCRA such a shit show?
WE can do better. You can't.
Seize the moment to slash Medicaid and hurt millions of americans. You are a vile man.
https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2017/7/25/1683732/-McCain-interrupts-taxpayer-sponsored-cancer-treatment-to-vote-to-take-care-away-from-millions?detail=facebook …. Exactly. @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorIsakson @sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump
After 2681 days running your mouth I don't think you remember what it is like to do a honest days work.
Mr. McConnell, what'll happen to my family if you repeal ACA? We have health insurance for the first time! I am sick & need medical care
*crickets they simply don't care
I realize that...
you should have the same healthcare as your constituents. Then we would see real healthcare progress. Hypocrite.
I don't know how you dare do this to the American People. You should listen to Chuck Schumer. He has common sense!
I really hope you're voted out in 2018. All this for a tax break. Be honest.
taking away healthcare is not the answer. Try and fix what's in place. Grow a brain.
hum. because your original plan @SenateMajLdr was to fix Odamnitdidnot care, only NOW do we face a full repeal ...waste time erode support
No sir, voting against starting debate is voting against taking care from millions. Vote down MTP, then bipartisan solutions to improve ACA
We've seen your better & it was a deathbill. So no you can't do better.  Only reason you want a debate is to bully/bribe those that vote NO.
It's time for you/Trump/Pence/Ryan to resign & let more competent ppl get things done right.
Zombie Man, you repubs are the reason ACA is hurting. Obstruction is all you animals know. What u pass, you must comply with also.
The Trumps are in bed with Russia if anyone in the GOP is in bed with the Trumps America will vote you out! NO Trump LEGISLATION EVER!!!!!!!
@GOP @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP U will pay for this... Americans r outraged when u take their care instead of making it better - ur voted out!
Go ahead and kick millions of people off of health care, and we're kicking ur ass out of office!! Pick ur battles!!
Do away with the archaic filibuster Rule now! It isn't in the Constitution and it is counterproductive to progress at any level.

With no CBO score there should be no vote on this worst legislation in American history!Removing 20 to 30mil people from healthcare is wrong
You had 8 years to come up with a better version. If you were serious about it, it would have been ready long ago #ProtectOurCare
Where was our responsibility during the ACA's creation Mitch?  We could have done something then to prevent this mess, why wait until now?

How many Americans lose #Medicaid under various House and Senate #healthcare bills?

12/12 @senrobportman thank you for your time. I sincerely hope you reconsider. My kid depends on it. 
You didn't mention what the new health care would offer. Only complain and lie. Many survived because of O-care, fact!

You can do better, but you haven't.
