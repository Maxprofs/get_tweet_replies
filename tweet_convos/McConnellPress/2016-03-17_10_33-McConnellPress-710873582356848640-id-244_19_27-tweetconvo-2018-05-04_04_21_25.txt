@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @USATODAY McDonnell slime
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress the people spoke twice 2008 2012 #truth #coward
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @USATODAY it's not about you and your feelings or what you think.it's about what the voters want period.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY We have spoken - TWICE. We elected Barak Obama POTUS, not you or the NRA. His term lasts 4 years, not 3. #Doyourjob
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY Bull S***! People already spoke in 2012 and elected President Obama for 4 yrs...1/20/17. DO YR JOB! Vote of Garland.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY having the American people have a voice is a good idea. Listen to the voices that said yes to Obama 8 years in a row
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY Shocking how Mitch is ignoring the VOICE we gave POTUS in '08 AND '12 despite his efforts to thwart him. #DoYourJob
@cheeseheadlucy @SenateMajLdr Lucy: UR ignoring that the Nation elected a GOP Senate majority. As POTUS said: "Elections have consequences."
@TXCOL7 @SenateMajLdr And they are ignoring their CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY that Republicans love to scream about. Senate flips in NOV #DoYourJob
@cheeseheadlucy @SenateMajLdr Sorry, Lucy, the CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY you cite is your opinion.  It is not in the Constitution, Art II, Sec 2.
@TXCOL7 @SenateMajLdr You and I clearly are interpreting this differently. As is McConnell. Difficult to believe you'd prefer a Trump pick
@cheeseheadlucy @SenateMajLdr Lucy, the great thing about the Constitution is that you have a right to your opinion.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY  You meant "give the NRA a voice."
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAYgive people a voice selecting a president.  You are trying to take that away by going against the front runner!
ICYMI, @SenateMajLdr & @Senate_GOPs, #WeThePeople who pay your salary+benefits are saying #DoYourJob #Now=hold fair #SCOTUSnom hearings NOW.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY #DoYourJob .how hard is it to hold a hearing and Vote NO? You're not going to vote yes in the 1st place#obstruction

@pinksurvivor70 @jrpaws  @USATODAY
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY You and the entire @GOP are an embarrassment to logic and basic decency. #DoYourJob #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr the people had a voice in 2012 and elected President Obama. He's doing his job and you should do yours. #doyourjobfriday
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY First there's Donald J. Trump.  Now Senate refuses to #DoYourJob.  Last nail in the GOP coffin.  RIP, fools.
@SenateMajLdr The people are voicing their opinion! In polls, on Facebook, on Twitter, news articles. Open your eyes and #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr, then why not let the people's elected #senate take a vote???
@SenateMajLdr The people used their voice when re-electing Pres Obama. And, he IS STILL president after all. Doing his job. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY Look what your party has dredged up for president-please don't pretend to speak for the American people #DoYourJob

@SenateMajLdr just do your job
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY Hey Assclown. The people spoke in 2012. Do they teach a different version of math in the rock you crawled out of?
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @senrobportman @KarlRove @ChrisChristie @SpeakerRyan @SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @SenTedCruz
.@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY like when they elected Obama, that voice? Or all the voices telling you to sit on your hands for 10 months
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY the Senate doesn't need to give the people a voice. They chose a president to do that
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY We had our voice! We voted for @BarackObama @POTUS. Now do your job. #SCOTUSnominee .
@SenateMajLdr just retire already
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY you are a disgrace.let the voters decide?We are telling you we have had enough of the games.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY The people had a voice in 2012
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY what a pile of steaming bullshit.  Partisan nonsense.
@SenateMajLdr i am happy to see @USATODAY disagrees with your unconstitutional opinion:
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY You are nothing but a dictator.  Rather see Trump At least on the up and up.#powermonger
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY we voiced our opinion, TURTLE!  We elected Obama to choose for us. Now GET TO WORK YOU LEECH!!!!!
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY THEY HAVE A VOICE!!! They used it in 2012. Your disingenuous mantra is BS Senator, and we all know it. DO YOUR JOB!
@SenateMajLdr The people did speak 2x & @POTUS  was and is our choice. Do your job and schedule a hearing for his Supreme Court nominee.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY I think you are a hero to try and apply your personal political agenda to the highest court in the land!
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY It's ugly, I know. People just don't understand why your politics trump the system. Some may call you a hypocrite
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY If you applied this logic before my court I'd tear it apart, but your politics work for me
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY we already made our voice heard.  We elected @BarackObama #DoYourJob #doyourfuckingjob
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY Again, Mitch, thank you. It's hard making such an argument based on personal wishes but not grounded in fact. Thanks
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY why not listen to the people who we want for president?????????
@SenateMajLdr These are the people, and this is our voice! Stop disrespecting the job you've been given and fulfil your duty #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY Convenient to pick &I choose what the 'people have a voice' in though, isn't it? Failed to hear us on #GMOs...
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY What you dont understand is that by saying #GiveThePeopleAVoice u are insulting those who used their voices in 2012
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY the voice we the people need is all new Senators. You OLD FARTS have to go. You are NOT working in our best interest
@SenateMajLdr So you'd feel the same way if a Republican was in the White House? The people have already spoken. #DoYourJob
.@SimonReadBooks @SenateMajLdr He was in office when REAGAN appointed Kennedy at the same point in his term-so he has no REAL objection.
@mrshellwinger @SenateMajLdr Exactly. The guy's an obstructionist.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY @SenateJudiciary 
Today's Republican Party:
https://youtu.be/ltUG0fPHdOo 
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY get off twitter and do your job
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY without a republican base you are representing who? trump is an outsider you should consider retirement
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY I'm good with Garland. Thanks for checking, though! Now, how about doing your job? You got your paycheck, right?
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY which provision in the constitution directs the Senate to delay "advise and consent" pending election? DO YOUR JOB
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY we don't need an op ed. We need you to do your job, SIR.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY we spoke!  It's called an election.  How dense are you, really?
@rodreyes49 @SenateMajLdr @USATODAY
@jrpaws @SenateMajLdr @USATODAY Harold lirette @LouisianaEagle
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY Yes, ASAP, like next week. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY in my 65 years I have never heard of anyone obstructing the US government like you! Are you an Isis supporter?
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY with all the drug money you and your brother-in-law have why don't you get a chin tuck?
@SenateMajLdr have you forgotten why people elect officials to public office? #DoYourJob #representUS
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY Bullshit. Without a ninth justice we may have a Constitutional impasse worse than 2000.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY People voted OBAMA 2012 by 9M votes.  We want the Government to work.  You have new rules for BLACK Presidents.
@SenateMajLdr Stop hiding behind postures and calling things rules that aren't. Just #DoYourJob and get us a #SCOTUS that can do its job.
@SenateMajLdr This political obstructionism is why the people are frustrated w/ Congress who just says no instead of doing work. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY It's wrong that the Republican leadership would refuse a hearing for a well-qualified nominee. No two ways about it.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY the people spoke when we elected Obama to the presidency.  #DoYourJob
ICYMI US Senate has the #duty to #AdviseandConsent. So #DoYourJob  please. @SenateMajLdr @USATODAY
@SenateMajLdr The people should get a voice isn't accurate. Our voices were heard in 2010, 2012, and 2014, electing our senators and POTUS.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY #DoYourJob this will cost you everything. #loser
.@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY The people have a voice and they have spoken. 58% want a hearing. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY they say we no longer lead the world. Look at the type of leadership you show the world.
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY How about peoples' voice in election? Will there be such a writing?
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY The people have a voice. You either can't hear it, or you're ignoring it. Which is it? #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr President Reagan got a last year confirmation, but not @POTUS ? You are an obstructionist, and should be recalled. #ShameOnYou
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY We have a representative Gov't. My voice is thru my elected officials. YOU can't decide who is official/unofficial
@SenateMajLdr @USATODAY your op-ed is pretty pathetic.
