@SenateMajLdr @VP The "political season" is ALWAYS under way, you lack-wit.
@SenateMajLdr @VP as the Senile Majority Leader you can do whatever you want #Trumpisawinner
@SenateMajLdr @VP Funny, that's not how it works. I know you guys are terrified of losing your corporatist maj on the court, but #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @VP
@SenateMajLdr, you learned well from @tedcruz how to be a  extremist anti-gov obstructionist. He should be proud.
.@SenateMajLdr @VP "We'll drop him like a hot rock" This is what Mitch thinks of the voters say: http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/27/mcconnell-tells-gop-senators-well-drop-trump-like-a-hot-rock/ …
.@SenateMajLdr @VP While McConnell doesn't care what voters think, in IRAN your vote counts WOW:
@SenateMajLdr @VP Kind of like being married, right? You can't get a divorce. Oops. You did that too. Idiot turtle.
@SenateMajLdr @VP How's that working out?
@SenateMajLdr #doyourjob. Or better yet #resign
@SenateMajLdr @VP you are pathetic to try and deny a sitting president a Supreme Court nom
@SenateMajLdr @VP #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP Both Dems and Repubs are hypocrites. What you say is deafened by what you haven't done. Time to shut up.
.@SenateMajLdr the same applies to lame duck republican members of congress
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @VP If you really want Bernie to choose then by all means. What? u think a Repub is going 2 get 2 nominate LOL
@SenateMajLdr @VP Do your job and quit playing politics. Southern republicans are racist.
@SenateMajLdr @VP #SenateMajLdr You are so desperate it's pathetic.  You are the one tearing us apart.  Support the frontrunner!!
@SenateMajLdr there is a special place in hell for you #DoYourJob #turtleface
@SenateMajLdr not looking good for your party well the three parties of the @gop
@SenateMajLdr do you job!!!
@SenateMajLdr @VP Not until the election campaign is over. Until the ELECTION is over!
@SenateMajLdr @VP In other news... Scientists now confirm two wrongs do not make a right.
@SenateMajLdr, the @GOP Senate was elected to shut down the government rather than govern? Voters won't be fooled again.
@SenateMajLdr enjoy the next 10 months of doing nothing until you lose the Senate. You've created quite a legacy for yourself.
@SenateMajLdr what have you accomplished in 8 years besides a gov shutdown?You have no solutions, no ideas, no leadership
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP Consistently standing in the way of progress whether by Dems or Reps is the reason you are stuck with Donald Trump today.
@SenateMajLdr @VP Enough w/ the "well he said" or "but they did" Why not step up and actually be a leader! I think WE THE PEOPLE deserve it!
.@SenateMajLdr @VP This is what your obstructionism has led to after 8 years of blaming others for your failures: http://www.salon.com/2016/03/02/donald_trumps_supporters_are_so_fanatical_that_now_theyre_sending_threats_to_other_conservatives/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=socialflow …
.@SenateMajLdr @VP I'm sure POTUS Clinton will do a good job. Thanks.
@SenateMajLdr @VP Are you kidding me?  Deny Americans a full court because it is an "election year?"  DO YOUR FUCKING JOB FOR ONCE.
@SenateMajLdr @VP INCLUDING the vote for SCOTUS nominee.
@SenateMajLdr @VP Well then, I hope the 24 Republican senators up for reelection are recusing themselves from all votes this year.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @VP   Here we go... Should be put off till new POTUS is seated. Must have made another Deal with Obama
@SenateMajLdr @VP Maybe Trump will tell you, "You're Fired!"
@SenateMajLdr @VP Why? are you that sure that a Republican will win?sounds corrupt to me, you should be held accountable DISGRACEFULshameful
@SenateMajLdr @VP Why do you always stop progress? Voters should impeach you. Do your job correctly & keep your prejudice views to yourself.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @VP It BETTER BE KEPT ON HOLD!
@SenateMajLdr @VP nice cherrypicking.  Remember the Kennedy appt. #DoYourJob or return your salary!
@SenateMajLdr @VP @GOP This is how the Republican Party breaks itself.
@SenateMajLdr @VP This is a lie. There is no law stating an elected president can be denied the opportunity to perform his job.
@SenateMajLdr @VP Congrats!Stand firm on this don't let anyone bully you.We don't need a liberal justice that will destroy our Constitution
@SenateMajLdr @VP 14 presidents have nominated SCOTUS justices in their last term.  DO YOUR JOB, Congress never does
@SenateMajLdr @VP how do you not get that your party is fractured. only in that space can a Trump surface. Your party's creation, now own it
@SenateMajLdr @VP Well then MM, vote on the jobs bill or healthcare for everyone.
@SenateMajLdr @VP So apparently you consider that u are smarter than all Leaders before you who actually did their job. You are a traitor
@SenateMajLdr isn't your refusal to #DoYourJob a crass political calculation? What historical predicate supports you? #SCOTUS #LowMoments
@SenateMajLdr @VP  reason why your party looks the way it does is the stunts like this. it creates anger and creates candidates like Trump.
@SenateMajLdr is there any historical precedent for your refusal to give #POTUS'S #scotusnominee a vote? Or r u just #WingingIt #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr @VP Provide ENTIRE quote, Mr. M&M. Ur partial quote mining's despicable. Let me make prediction: You'll be min. ldr. soon.
@SenateMajLdr @VP WHY ?  U RNT LISTENING TO THE PPL U SERVE ANYWAY, NEVER AGAIN OLD RINO, TERM LIMITS 4 ALL GOV.   GO TRUMP !
@SenateMajLdr pls identify a single time that the senate acted on sentiments like those @VP expressed 24 years ago #DoYourJob #SCOTUS #lame
@SenateMajLdr @VP Why can't GOP accept what the people want?If it's not your way,u do anything to get your way.Grow up!!
@SenateMajLdr @VP Why? You just don't want to do your job? You can't simply vote down? #DoYourJob THIS is why ppl are sick of congress.
@SenateMajLdr @VP do some work
@SenateMajLdr @VP How to defeat Donald Trump through strategic voting:
http://progressivesforprosperity.org/strategic-voting-guide-march-5-8-contests/ … #NeverTrump
@SenateMajLdr @VP Don't kid yourself Mitch.  You may as well do your job now, 'cause you aren't going to be any happier about it later.
@SenateMajLdr @VP If Hilary gets in, you are gonna be fine and happy with her pick as well?
.@SenateMajLdr #NewsFlash, the American people voted FOUR YEARS AGO to let @BarackObama - the @POTUS - nominate for @Scotus, #Douche!
@SenateMajLdr @VP You ready for the Tramp brand, gold plated, simply the best nominee ever Mitch?  Is that what you want?
@SenateMajLdr @VP It would be refreshing if #GOPe leadership actually followed through on something.  I'm sorry but it's too little too late
