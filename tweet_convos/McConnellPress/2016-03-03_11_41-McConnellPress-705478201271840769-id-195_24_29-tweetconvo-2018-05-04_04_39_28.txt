@SenateMajLdr The people did decide, it's called an election...
@TheChuckMo The people also decided in 2014 when they voted in a republican senate. Read the constitution, the senate clearly has the power.
@autism9eleven they were elected to obstruct and not take responsibility for their constitutional duty?
@TheChuckMo There are three branches of government. Obstruction can be good, it's not inherently negative. Read the constitution. Moron.
@autism9eleven Ya, an unwillingness to govern for 7+ years shows a real commitment to the American people and the future of our country.
@TheChuckMo I would say so. The people obviously obviously don't want Obama to have as much power if they're electing a GOP senate. Idiot.
@autism9eleven Congress had power to act and did nothing. So the goal was to obstruct and not Govern? #UnAmerican
@TheChuckMo You're having trouble. There are three branches of government. The Senate isn't obligated to govern with Obama. #Constitution
@SenateMajLdr  don't vote on bills due to lame duck Senators. Wait until new Senators are sworn in. #LetThePeopleDecide or #DoYourJob
@MikeJUofA Bad analogy.
@autism9eleven same stupid argument, many senators up 4 reelection. Why vote on anything until the people decide who Sen majority will be.
@MikeJUofA I simply pointed out that your analogy was lacking. Think about your analogy and the point of Mitch's post. It'll dawn on you.
@autism9eleven then they shouldn't vote on any more ACA repeals for starters. His argument is wrong & isn't supported by the Constitution.
@MikeJUofA The Senate can keep voting on other things. His argument is supported by the constitution, as it says that the senate approves.
@autism9eleven but it doesn't say it has to wait until after a new president is sworn in.
@MikeJUofA True, the constitution doesn't say that Senate HAS to wait. I'm just pointing out that they CAN wait, it's in the Senates right.
@SenateMajLdr We DID decide in '08 & '12. + the Constitution doesn't say no SCOTUS appointments in election yrs. #DoYourJob
@MikeJUofA @SenateMajLdr We also decided in 2014. The senate doesn't have to confirm Obama's nominees.
@autism9eleven only if he does a recess appointment.
@MikeJUofA That would only be temporary. Further, the senate can control how long that lasts. So that's not a viable option in my view.
@autism9eleven my point being McConnell's argument makes no sense. If we wait 4 new potus, why not wait for new Senate.
@MikeJUofA Already responded to this argument.
@SenateMajLdr the people did decide when we voted in the last presidential election.  Your party did not win.  #DoYourJob #obstructiontwit
@LayneCKent @SenateMajLdr many times during election years SCOTUS nominees have been withheld #historylesson
@JeffP4Congress @SenateMajLdr do you think Scalia(being a strict constitutionalist) would have supported this?
@LayneCKent @SenateMajLdr yes, I do. Hard to tell on the others in SCOTUS, but he, Thomas and Alito, yes.
@JeffP4Congress @SenateMajLdr that would have made him a huge hypocrite.
@SenateMajLdr Unquote! #Senate Republicans Lose Their Minds on a Supreme Court Seat.~By THE EDITORIAL BOARD
@nytimes FEBRUARY 24, 2016.
@SenateMajLdr A majority of voters disapprove of GOP plans to not hold hearings or consider any SCOTUS nominee according to a WSJ/NBC poll.
@SenateMajLdr #ThePeopleDecided #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr the people have decided, get the fuck out of our way!!
@SenateMajLdr THATS RIGHT ITS THE PEOPLES VOTE --STOP INSULTING THE PEOPLE WHICH YOUR PARTY DOES VERY WELL--THATS WHY WE HATE REPUBLICANS
@SenateMajLdr no Mitch, you spiteful turtle, the #senate must follow the #constitution and vote on the president's nominee
@SenateMajLdr This is putting all capital letters on OBSTRUCTIONISM of the GOP!This hurts Democracy!
@SenateMajLdr WeDid. ElectedPresidentObama   You'reSenate. HE'SPresident. ActingLike His ' Boss ' Proves You'reRacist,TeaRed Obstructionist
@polandmary21 @SenateMajLdr Naw. tRump Luvrs, Want Hitler. I'm OK With Ignoring Them.
@SenateMajLdr argues, #letthepeopledecide...the people argue, #DoYourJob and honor the senates constitutional duty.
@SenateMajLdr "& his colleagues plan to shut their doors, plug their ears & hope the public doesn’t notice--#panic masquerading as strength"
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Mark Kirk of #Illinois & Susan Collins of #Maine, were two brave #GOP senators to say that they would vote on @POTUS nominee!
@SenateMajLdr "In any case~the people have already decided who should make this appointment: They elected Mr. Obama twice, by large margins"
@SenateMajLdr When President Obama was elected twice, we already decided he was best to decide!
@SenateMajLdr This is a sorry moment in history when a Speaker chooses such an undemocratic way to express his dislike of our President!
@SenateMajLdr Your hatred towards America is just oozing out of this speech
@SenateMajLdr We DID. TWICE. YOU must #DoYourJob & EARN the very handsome salary WE PAY YOU. Stop childishly disrespecting our good @POTUS.
@SenateMajLdr they already did. Twice. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr the people have decided, want you out #DoYourJob the people tired of #GOP #sellouts #liars #trump is your fault #growapair
@SenateMajLdr The Senate must do their job.
@SenateMajLdr "The only reason a nominee wouldn't b confirmed is that the Senate has preemptively decided to block any nominee sight unseen"
@SenateMajLdr "It is preposterous to accuse Mr. Obama of causing a “bitter struggle” by nominating someone who will not be confirmed."
.@SenateMajLdr lame duck senators should let the people decide before they do anything else
.@SenateMajLdr barack obama was elected twice

i think we know a president's term is 4 years
.@SenateMajLdr i don't appreciate you insulting my intelligence

voters know a president's term is 4 years
@SenateMajLdr Last @POTUS election it was argued that the next President wld likely select new SCOTUS members. Didn't the people speak then?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS In other words, Senator, the people did decide. How do you now justify denying the voices of the people!
@SenateMajLdr I believe the reason Trump is doing so well is because of the attitude of so many of you Republicans!Republicans are revolting
@SenateMajLdr They did! When they voted for the current #POTUS !  :-)   But surely you knew that, sir.
@SenateMajLdr i have no qualms about calling you a LIAR.You're trying to change rules to keep Trump from nomination RT RT RT #AlwaysTrump
@SenateMajLdr bye bye !!
@SenateMajLdr  THE PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING !! Get out ! ITS OVER ! We the people ! Get out of the way ... #TRUMP
@SenateMajLdr Like to know what U are doing about @potus putting our border patrol in harms way? @realDonaldTrump
@SenateMajLdr The Senate must do its job. The people decided when they elected him for 4 years, NOT 3.
@SenateMajLdr  “let the people decide,” that’s not what the Constitution say--it vests the power to make nominations to the court in @POTUS
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS isn't a “lame-duck president.”--lame-duck period is after the Nov election until a new president is inaugurated in Jan!
@SenateMajLdr "We the people," not "We the party."  Your divisive politics is damaging to the USA & disrespectful to the people you serve.
@SenateMajLdr "These statements are so twisted that it’s hard to know where to begin--Let’s take them one by one." I quote from the @nytimes
@SenateMajLdr The people have decided to give President Obama a 4 year term in office, and during that term fill SCOTUS vacancies PERIOD!
@SenateMajLdr 
@realDonaldTrump 
@congressdotgov 
We the people have decided we want #Trump2016. SAY NO TO BROKERED CONVENTION!
@SenateMajLdr And all the Republicans are welfare queens. The don't work and get a check from the government.
@SenateMajLdr do ur job and have the hearing
@SenateMajLdr By your "logic," all Senate colleagues up for '16 re-election must abstain from all votes until Jan. Do that! #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr You are the majority leader, not a doorstop!  Do your job. #supreme court
@SenateMajLdr we decided WE elected Obama twice !! Your party will pay a price for this.  JUST WAIT AND SEE
@SenateMajLdr The people decided. Why is the @GOP trying to take OUR choice away? WE VOTED IN OUR PRESIDENT WHO NOMINATES-twice. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr   The election the Koch brothers will choose the next SCOTUS. Isn't that right Mr McConnell?
@SenateMajLdr   Admit it. Instead of being a coward & saying you want the PEOPLE to decide. Tell it like it is...if GOP should win the
.@SenateMajLdr WE DECIDED. Twice. #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr The people did decide a lot of things last 2 elections. You OBVIOUSLY didn't listen to them then. No wonder people are mad!
@SenateMajLdr The GOP MUST hold Gov. Snyder  to the same standard for Truth, Honor and Integrity they hold the democrat party to!
@SenateMajLdr #LetThePeopleDecide? Sir, The People have asked you to #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr ...then LET the people decide & quit #rigging elections #HotRock @GOP @SpeakerRyan #Votes #Voices #Trashing #NoRespect @Reince

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress
@SenateMajLdr The people decided twice that Obama can nominate justices to the Supreme Court so do your job.

@SenateMajLdr PEOPLE DONT WANT TO HEAR YA SAY YOU WILL BACK TRUMP.Rep. not qualified to be trused if you all back TRUMP
@SenateMajLdr You so called Leaders WILL BE BLAMED for what you are allowing this rabid animal to do! Get Trump out
@SenateMajLdr Doing nothing about Trump is showing that Republicans can not be LEADERS. JUST TALK ALOT.
@SenateMajLdr People decided!Have TRUMP committed or you all are killing your own party. Do something brave to save your party.
@SenateMajLdr yes the Senate should, but you forget the people did decide.
@SenateMajLdr #LetThePeopleDecide that voted in 2012. Or those that voted in 2014 don't count either right ! Not a question I know I'm right
@SenateMajLdr Sabotaging Trump gets you Cruz.. Who can't wait to hold your head in the toilet.. #SenateMajLdrSWIRLY

@garmonbozia What's your point? Whatever the results, the people will have decided. It's gridlocked now. Idiot.
@autism9eleven the "point" is in the link. Did you even bother reading it?
@garmonbozia Yes. Pay attention moron: If the senate goes to the dems, then the people have decided. Right now, there's no point in aproving
@autism9eleven actually my re-electing the president for a second term they already decided.
@garmonbozia I'm conceding that the people decided in 2012. They ALSO decided in 2014 when they voted to have a GOP senate. Senate decides.
@autism9eleven except that they're choosing to not even decide.
@garmonbozia No, they're choosing to decide later when the people decide in 2016, and to my knowledge they can do that.
@SenateMajLdr We DID decide.  In 2012 when we re-elected Obama to run this country. #DoYourJob

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Your position is transparently partisan. It will secure your place in history, but not a place of honor.
@SenateMajLdr would love an answer 
@SenateMajLdr Mitch is so low energy he makes Jeb Bush look like he's on angel dust. Can this guy be any more irrelevant?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Americans have decided. Senate must consider SCOTUS candidates Also they decided you will not be re-elected.

@SenateMajLdr WH heartened by @CRS4Congress report that since 1900, all 6 SCOTUS noms in pres election years confirmed by Senate.
@SenateMajLdr Continue on this path and men like you will be swept from office and replaced with Trump's ilk.
@SenateMajLdr Uphold my constitution Mitch, and you stand a chance of restoring some dignity to your office.
@SenateMajLdr The people are angry enough to consider Trump because of these games you love to play
@SenateMajLdr Actions like this are exactly why the party has fallen apart, Mitch.
@SenateMajLdr THE SENATE NEEDS TO GO TO WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW ONCE AND FOR ALL.  NOW.  NO MORE WAITING. DO YOUR JOB.
@SenateMajLdr How did you arrive at the people not deciding???  THE PEOPLE SPOKE DECIDEDLY IN 2012.  THE PEOPLE DECIDED.  GET TO WORK.
@SenateMajLdr the people decided in 2012. It's time for you to #DoYourJob

@SenateMajLdr you're the reason so many GOPs are turning to Trump. You have no credibility because you lie and wheel and deal #shameful
@SenateMajLdr nice empty room Turtleboy
@SenateMajLdr Just noticed not one person here supports your "interpretation" of the Constitution.  The people have voted, & most not for u.
@SenateMajLdr We have voted 2x for the President who will nominate SCOTUS.  DO YOUR JOB.  Luckily no one thinks u r relevant. Do your job!
@SenateMajLdr - the people already decided.
@SenateMajLdr DO YOUR JOB.
@SenateMajLdr THE PEOPLE ALREADY DECIDED. TWICE. DO YOUR JOB, you miserable, obstructionist partisan hack.
@daisy_mcdonald Seems like you're projecting. The people also decided in 2014. Therefore, @SenateMajLdr has the power here.
@autism9eleven Doing something because you can is often not the best strategy. Obstruction may well backfire.
@SenateMajLdr We did ASS FACE. 66 million people said you can take your Mormon and shove him. We want Obama to pick SCOTUS nominees

@SenateMajLdr right, keep the establishment out of it
@SenateMajLdr Do your job, shitheel. The people spoke in 2012.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress "best positioned to make the decision vs a 'lame duck' POTUS". He has Gall...no class, but Gall.
@SenateMajLdr They already did numbnuts. Just because you didn't like it is your problem, not ours.
@SenateMajLdr They did, in Nov 2012.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress mitch, keep that same train of thought as we vote in the primaries @realDonaldTrump @DonaldTrum
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress IF WE COULD DECEIDE YOU WOULD BE OUT. TIRED OF YOU CHICKEN S''''''''''
.@SenateMajLdr Mitch, WE decided this already, twice!! WE want a decision in 2016. Sober up, stop your tantrums, vote on PRESIDENT'S nominee
@SenateMajLdr stand your ground, no nominations for Obama!
@SenateMajLdr So r u going to let the people decide ur nominee as well?
@SenateMajLdr You have betrayed us along with RNC. Voters decide elections not politicians. Shame on you. Pass Kate's law
@SenateMajLdr speaking of letting the people decide, didnt you just say you were going to spend party money to derail the people's nominee?
@SenateMajLdr Stay strong! #NoHearingsNoVotes

@MetalDanIRL In 2014. Therefore, the senate that we voted for, has the power to decide when this will be decided. You're so dumb.
@Blob_Fish @Catballou @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell should have been voted out of office years ago. He's an embarrassment to this country.
@SenateMajLdr You watching this Trump speech dude?
