.@SenateMajLdr .@GorsuchFacts Remember Merrick Garland, Addison?
did gorsuch help bush draft legislation 2 bypass torture rules? That's a good reason 2 vote NO IMO #gorsuch
maybe we should wait until the next election and vote then? #StolenSeat
You're correct. But Im curious what your "principled reason" was to hold up Garland. Take your time, I'll wait.
I've got one: #MerrickGarland #StolenSeat
There was no reason not to give Merrick Garland a hearing yet you managed that now didn't you? #countryoverparty
Please do not speak of principles until you acquire some.

Yes there is! That seat was Obama's to assign! Like it or not, your party is a USURPER of JUSTICE! Give it back!
do it! Stop allowing the delays!
DONT CONFIRM! @SenateDems - play the same game the republican crybabies played- #resist #impeach #mcconellsucks
There are many reasons to vote no - there was no principled reason not to have filled this seat a year ago!
What about Merrick Garland. Was there a principled reason to not confirm him, hypocrite?
Galatians 6, stop being a spoiled child.
SHOULD? REALLY? WHY NOT GUARANTEE WITH NUKE AND SHUT DOWN OBSTRUCTIONIST SCHUMER?  BALLS?
Who the hell is David Frederick?
he is a right wing white supremacist like the rest of you republicans. We will hold you responsible
Senate should give Garland his vote first....where there was ALSO no reason to vote NO
You are a hypocrite, Mitch. 
Really. 
If you're a Christian, you should be worried about ETERNAL DAMNATION. 
No nomination during 4 yr LAME DUCK administration. Obstruct.
There was no principled reason for you to BLOCK Merrick Garland, yet you did.
yes there is - Merrick Garland!
Reason #1. Your obsructionism of Garland.
@GorsuchFact #MerrickGarland deserves a vote. Stop destroying America, Mitch. KY is stupid for always putting u bck in office!

There was no principled reason to refuse a vote on Merrick B. Garland either. #hypocrites #MitchtheBitch
PRINCIPLED? YOU? A little late to be crying out for principled anything. You stole this nomination from Obama@
You mean other than the fact @SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts is a corporate stooge like you?
Remember how @SenateGOP said they wouldn't confirm any #Scotus if @HillaryClinton got elected. We do. #Garland
The @SenateGOP should have confirmed Merrick Garland, but he didn't even get a vote. Remember that?
The left party Lost control of us the people who support freedom .
We R not a communist country
Democrats don't have common sense. 
We the people are tired of the left .
We the silent majority wants Gorsuch
Democrats are going to Boycott the nomination . Don't waste your Time or people tax $ .
GO NUCLEAR !!!
Merrick Garland
there was no principled reason to block Merrick Garland either , But u did.
Merrick Garland over and over again. You've lost the high ground on this one.
ummmm, Merrick Garland?
SO CONFIRM HIM ALREADY. PLEASE
bring it to a vote the idiot Dems changed the rules to meet their needs...use it! No more talk, need action.
there was no reason not to vote on Merrick Garland either, so why didn't you do that?
#MerrickGarland deserved a vote. #resist
EXCEPT it's a STOLEN SEAT you fu*king CROOKS! The DOOR TO FACISM!
Why would you give Merrick Garland's seat to anyone else
Just like there was no principled reason to vote against Merrick Garland?
#FuckOffMitch
I have one fact for u. Garland.  Keep turtle mitch in his shell.
what r we waiting for?
YOU're a lousy leader-either are working against @POTUS-for donors-Or have no control of Senate-REPLACE McConnel
Was there any reason to vote no to #MerrickGarland? I know one reason- #Politics!
American hope the Dems block any vote like you did to the much more respected Judge Garland.
no, no and no. #NoGarlandNoGorsuch
like when you blocked Obamas nominee?  Two faced and disingenuous
, respectfully, was there a principled reason not to even consider Garland?
Merrick Garland
You have no shame. No Ethics. No Moral. #stolenseat #liar #TrumpsPuppet #RussianAgent
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts Just as there was no principled reason to block #Merrick
Just like there was no principle reason to refuse hearing for obamas Supreme Court nominee..........sooooo
McConnell you need to go nuclear go nuclear go nuclear go nuclear
was no reason not to confirm Garland, who was universally well regarded. Plus- this pres is in his last months just like Obama
8 is great Turtle
Please DON'T TRUST the Demos, Go For the "Nuclear Option" a Demo promised vote isn't worth anything
Principled reason. Judge Garland. You stole PBO's Supreme Court appointment.
Merrick Garland?
reason to vote no: obstruct any and everything you do. Just like you did to Obama.
LIKE THERE WAS NO PRINCIPLED REASON TO NOT EVEN HEAR OBAMA'S CHOICE? GOOD FOR THE GOOSE BUT NOT THE GANDER?
Principled? Sir- don't use $5 words that you know nothing about.
Speaking as someone without principles, you should know. #partyoverpeople
um no. Merrill Garland for one. Worse than Scalia if that's even possible for two. Shall I keep going?
No more principled reason than to vote against Garland either.
@chuckgrassley There was NO reason to withhold hearings on Judge Garland.
Merrick
Merrit Garland! Thank you!
Except Merrick Garland didn't even get the chance to be voted on. Gorsuch will never be counted as valid.
You have no grounds or standing to judge principled actions. You display none. EVER. @GOP
Gorsuch's record of placing corporate interests ahead of Americans' is a principled reason. A good one.  #SCOTUS
by that logic, you should have confirmed Merrick Garland, you turtled faced lying hypocrite!
we should F him because you are a dishonest hypocrite
Wrong
Garland.
. Same was true for Merrick Garland and you disrespected the man. What makes Gorsuch any different? Hypocrites!
@ I would like to have him or you show us where it says the controlling party gets to instill their religious beliefs
from old NC woman to old KY man, please just hush.
there was none a year ago, either...
there was non principled reason to not have a vote on Garland
.@SenateMajLdr .@GorsuchFacts TH ESTEEMED SENATOR McCONNELL SET TONE N STD LONG AGO.
DENYING 2 EVEN HOLD HEARINGS ON PREZ OBAMA CHOICE
FRCKU
The reason to vote NO is because you cheated obstructionist. Garland would be great.
Except the election was a fraud and since this POTUS will only be here for a year we should wait for a real one!
except this election was not a fraud. He won the electoral college and that's facts.
Just like there was no principled reason for you not to approve Garland. You are a hypocrite.
THERE WAS NO PRINCIPLED REASON TO PREVENT GARLAND FOR SCOTUS.   GORSUCH IS A FREAK - HE HAS MAJOR WOMAN ISSUES
What about the Merrick Garland facts??? #RESIST
Funny to hear you talk about 'principles,' turtle-boy.
this fool is a servant to a billionaire and his judicial decisions prove that. We will delay.
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts As a citizen I say "VOTE NO'
except you didn't even have a hearing for @BarackObama  for your petty reasons
there was no principled reason to block hearings for Judge Garland #resist
the idiot #schumer will vote no along with his ilk
What's the hurry? You sat on a nomination with no vote for nearly a year. #Resign
nuclear option
MERRICK GARLAND!?!?!
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts no principle reason to not hear Garland. "toxic environment" was your excuse. Any better now? No
no you should confirm Merrick Garland because it was his job first but you obstructionist said FU to America.
given the reckless behavior of @realDonaldTrump there should be no vote on Gorsuch until after 2018 election #GOPLies
Really!?!  #StolenSeat #WhatGoesAround
"No!" Is because of ur absolute disregard for the Constitution & GOP not holding a hearing 4 Garland. Laws r not based on ur prejudices.
THERE WAS NO PRINCIPLED REASON TO DENY MERRICK GARLAND A VOTE!!  #REPUBLICANHYPOCRITES
when? Get it done already
YOU stole this from America and crapped on the constitution in doing so.  good job DePuty DAWWWWG
The reason to vote NO because you stole that seat from #MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland.
Satan be praised. You don't elect Garland, so Gorsuch stays on the ground. He's Gore such. If look at his name
DA, you never voted on Obamas pick. We don't forget.
Actually given the fact that Trump is campaigning, by your own rule, you cannot confirm.
Mitch, there was NO "principled" reason to refuse to give Garland a hearing either. You a poor excuse for a leader and a man!
There was no principled reason to not give Merrick Garland a hearing, either, now was there? #UnethicalSenator
you have no right to discuss principles, you ignorant party hack. Care about the USA? #resign
@foxnews @realdonaldtrump Ldr McC, U need to get Judge G CONFIRMED ASAP so he'll be the SCOTUS tie-breaking vote
what about Garland?
when are the other 4 cabinet nominees going to be confirmed? This is unacceptable that it takes this long.
@AnjiUsa If more than one Liberal vote for him we know he is liberal leanings, even though has good resumes,been wrong before?
Merrick Garland
Nor is there a principled reason to vote AT ALL you treasonous fool.
principle merrick garland
I think he should be given the same chance that you gave Merrick Garland - none
. So far everyone inc. your wife Trump has recommended r liars, crooks, thieves and involved w/ Rusia. That's why
Mitch McConnel, you are not a good man #SCOTUS
Like you had principled reasons for refusing a vote on Obamas pick?  You lost the right to play that card Mitch.
Dems will stall as long as possible!
There was no principled reason to not confirm Obamas choice.  Karma
trump is campaigning so per your rules that's a no
You talk of principals when you didn't your job! #StolenSeat MGarland, only.
Still need to go nuclear sir. This Democratic Party is ruthless and they know this pick tips the scales big league. #maga
@GOP If u just leave it at "no principled reason" you have a new GOP motto. It works for POTUS, ACA repeal, EPA defunding...
Other than to play your game. Sheesh!
Principal reason Donald Trump
@McConnellPress @GorsuchFacts well there was no reason to let GM & Chysler go under BUT YOU wanted it to happen so screw you
hell no
Let's get in line. There's another nominee ahead of yours you skipped ahead of. You guys are like children.
Gorsuch should have to wait his turn, after Garland has a hearing.  #McConnellLies
You obstructed Congress for 8 Years! Karma Turtle Man Karma!
except that you stonewalled Merrick Garland for a year, you hypocrite.
McConnell should retire to the hole he slithered out from. - Everyone
There was not principled reason to refuse to hold hearings on Garland.
The #Senate  should confirm #MerrickGarland because there is no principled reason to vote no.
Except you wouldn't even meet with him. Why? Oh right. The black president appointed him. I forgot.
They should vote how their constituents dictate they should vote ... let it go @GorsuchFacts
There was absolutely no principled reason to deny Merrick Garland a hearing, at the very least.
well, don't forget POTUS is campaigning and you made it very clear can't fill SCOTUS seat during election time
good one 
Would love laws--if you intentionally refuse to do your job-defrauding American people-fire and repay salary!
yea not allowing a vote in the last 8 months of Obama's term seems like a pretty good principled reason  to me
just like there is no principled reason not to take health care away from24M poor &old people,right mac? #resist
besides, what do u know about principles,or ethics,or morals. u have none u old as_. #resist the GOP
this will be a vastly better country when drumpf and his GOP enablers are gone #resist #russiagate vote GOP OUT
What do the GOP know about principles?
plenty of reasons NOT to support him Links to billionaire #PhilipFAnschutz = suspect
shut up hack
ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Can't wait to watch the GOP go down. Party before country. #GrillGorsuch #SwampSCOTUS
,,.,.Principles are something the Dems know nothing about,.,,,.absolutely nothing!
.@SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts The primary reason not to is named Merrick Garland. But don't worry, we have dozens of others.
Betting coal country is Hating you now.
yeah nah. You guys need a taste of your own medicine.
nay, deserve a taste.
Mitch, you've turned the Senate into an unprincipled partisan body, why complain now?
The Senate should have confirmed Merrick Garland because there was no principled reason not to.
There wasn't for Merrick Garland either. McConnell for Senate Minority Leader in 2018!
are you STILL trying to make fetch happen. Given Trump why on earth would ANYONE trust YOUR choice? #SCOTUS
Lots of reasons not to confirm
