a Special Prosecutor? Will that be a two year investigation?
@SenatorTimScottOUR PRESIDENT IS A COWARD AND A TRAITOR,OBAMA PUT THE 2012 ELECTION AHEAD OF R BRAVE HEROES@BENGHIZI,NO DEFENSE4IT
Thank you Senator Scott!  The AG, Obama and HRC have a vested interest in not seeing justice!  Crooked as it gets
#Lynch- that's why she needs to step down. No one will trust the DOJ now.
Is there anyone Clintons won't intimidate tamper or buyoff?@HillaryClinton @billclinton #Corruption #AmericaFirst
you also forgot kill. Remember the Clinton body count?
Great segment Senator
you got that right, liars they are!
so congress has time for a special prosecutor to be appointed but not a SCOTUS judge?
Good luck with that, no one seems to be able to stop the madness in DC & the liars just keep lying
No, no, no. It is too late. Appointing a special prosecutor will delay the process months, after the election!
@CatBollar @SenatorTimScott send the cunt to jail
you were brilliant again tonight how stupid does Lynch think south Carolinian are
no you need to be defeat this election.And sent back to the bush you came out of
Special Prosecutor -Obama n lynch won't let it happen If one goes down they All go Down
....uh huh,  good luck with that sp. Prosecutor, who the hell do u think appoints the position.
@TimPeebles @SenatorTimScott handled by Comey, a GOP appointed Chief of the FBI. If anything, DEMS should be complaining about bias
@TimPeebles @SenatorTimScott Greta needs to understand Law better. Loretta has no part in the investigation. It's handled by a GOPr
somehow, they will get paid off too.
 there's no evidences of a crime 
@CBSNews Really? We need a,Special Prosecutor  to investigate Lying Donald Trump for Trump Univ, & other scams
Yes sir, we do.
she is not fare untrusted and Bill normaly un honest man
Love u /but a special prosecutor/ to investigate what/ bad judgement/Reps need to find a Better Way no witch hunt
no,you nerf to absolutely clean up the FBI
Our Senator. Proud of Senator Scott.
all a Special Pros will do is delay the outcome for about. 2 years. Shd of had one from day 1; too late now!
WE NEED A COMPLETE GOVERNMENT THAT IS NOT CORRUPT  WE NEED TRUMP !!!!!CLINTONS BOTH NEED TO B CHARGED OVER THIS
From what we've seen, we just need a prosecutor period.
@FoxNews @SenatorTimScott
@FoxNews @SenatorTimScott
@FoxNews @SenatorTimScott
Are you supporting Trump or going along with the RINO's?
amazing the person with make america great supports Republicans with a pic of a democrat president
...You may think you need a special prosecutor to get the result you want! But we citizens are sick and tired of GOP witch hunts!!!
it's a shame that people feed people's worst fear to help there canidate how keeps killing himself
should be donalds running mate maybe he can protect donald from going to jail
SHE ONLY REGRETS GETTING CAUGHT! 
THE FIX IS IN AND SHE MET WITH HIM TO DISCUSS HOW TO GET AWAY WITH IT
You think. The FBI needs look into  Lynch bank account's. Pass word would be " I have a bib "  #GoAway
Keep reaching, asshats. #Desperate
"Slick Willie" Clinton's plan all along. Same Ole Bill, a new drama every day.  Pelosi will chime in soon. #Greta
Which is what should have been done in the first place.  Now it will create a huge extension of the time line.
Your spot on. We need a special prosecutor to investigate Trump embezzlement, student thefts, kickbacks, lawsuits
- What you need is a dose of "I should just stop trying to pretend this about the truth."
Where's ryan, graham, jeb, ted, Kasich etc... now is the time to this is fixed and support full @realDonaldTrump
Bill Clinton, getting information from the U.S. Atty. General about Hillary Clinton, very unethical, Lynch fired
absolutely.  Lynch must resign.  Due to her secret meeting with Bill Clinton, she has no credibilty. Resign now!!!
Loretta Lynch should be fired from her job, she was evidence tampering, Bill Clinton is a witness against Hillary.
@tseivers59 @SenatorTimScott 

Lynch will b rich now. The Clinton foundation will donate to her favorite charity - liars anonymous.
As I understand it, Lynch has already
stated that she will abide by what FBI wants after HRC's interrog.
zilch
@SenatorTimScottThis is a designed delay, push this issue two years down the road right out of the Clinton playbook on cover up.
they have immunity - so does Obama - untouchables
Sign the petition:  https://wh.gov/i6UqQ 
why don't we get Ken Starr.  He's good at trying to make something out of nothing. And costing us millions.
Department of Justice is rotten to the core. Judge sworn in on Quran. Failure to prosecute Hillary. Releasing alien criminals, etc
R we supposed to surrender our right to expect govt  b honest & above reproach & just accept they r n bed w evil?
My wife's uncle was special prosecutor "John Saccone" Matawan
@LindaSuhler @SenatorTimScott we the ppl shld get behind Sen Scott & demand it! We have whined abt GOP not stopping O.. Let's do it
Need Special prosecutor as long as it don't prolong investigation much longer. Hell get one anyhow. Need it
No that is what they want, delay delay delay, just like the damn emails from State Dept! It's a trap don't bite!
unfortunately, a special prosecutor would only delay case by years! @LorettaLynch should recuse herself!
That will only buy HRC time. Face it-The Clintons got away with it, again. Move on
agreed!!!!!!!
Won't a SP reset the entire process so that it won't get finished until well after the election?
Did anybody see Bill carry anything on board the planeA Bag or something fill with moneyThere is no other reason
@realDonaldTrump @varon88ny Prob monitored by new Natl' Security-> mbrohd  #OnlyTrump2016
We definitely need 2 likeable flawless candidates. America deserves better.
Judge can you please remark on why the AG does not update the public about the Orlando terrorist's wife ?
Let's first put Trump on trial for fraud. He knows he's going to lose his University scam case @SenatorTimScott
when he doesn't, you apologize... and why does fraud bother you more than treason and perjury.  Liberal priorities baffle.
Treason & perjury? Yet you support Trump who thinks the Constitution is toilet paper & lies every second?  @FoxNews
Proof, you got nothing. And yes selling herself to foreign countries while acting Secretary of State is Treason.
Why don't you provide a shred of evidence for that slander instead of repeating conspiracy junk @FoxNews
Proof is right there on the donor sheet to the Clinton Foundation. Just because you ignore facts doesn't mean we all do.
You provided ZIP. USA been selling arms to same countries for a decade prior to & more than one approved the sales @FoxNews
, we cannot now trust this admin. or DOJ..They got caught having secret meeting with Bill C....Got caught period.
she will be elected President before the Special Prosecutor can do anything.
lt he more I think, the more this was planned. Special pros takes their "time" and by then election over.
@JudgeJeanine http://www.mediaite.com/tv/reporter-fbi-ordered-no-photos-no-pictures-of-lynchclinton-meeting/ â€¦ Obama seals his/can unseal opponents records faster before they know it.
How many Scandals can 1 person be apart of in a lifetime? Clinton's get special treatment.
no cameras, no bystanders allowed...no problem, just talking about golf
About time we hear the truth, thanks
Since @LorettaLynch could possibly work f/future pres. Clinton
She MUST RECUSE herself from the case!
#Ethics101
Is there any reason why we care what Tim says on Fox ??
Justice Dept is citadel of integrity??? That ended with Janet Reno
@JudgeJeanine Poor Loretta Lynch has to serve two MASTERS Bill Clinton and Barrack Obama no wonder she's lost her way....
Yeah, we need this guy telling us what we need! #lol 
#Greta #FoxNews #CNN #HillaryClinton #NeverHillaryOrTrump
lynch will never take the fall, she did it to appoint a sacrificial lamb once she recuse herself. DELAYING CASE
It is 100+ degrees in Phoenix. He was not playing golf!
But it wasn't a "meeting"  - they were just discussing travel plans & grandchildren & such ....
Right.
The fix is in. These elites flaunt their disrespect for the law and constitution.  I have no confidence in DOJ.
you can say it. We need a new AG. Don't be PC about it.
To do what? Litigate a meeting between two free citizens at a public airport with reporters around?
@LindaSuhler @SenatorTimScott What's Kenneth Starr up to these days ?
I AGREE
she sounds like Hillary! She wouldn't do it again? Shouldn't have done it in the first place! Crooked crooked!
better she doesnt recuse herself,or , it will go to deputy ag, also political appt. Better with jim comey
She regrets the meeting being leaked.
I smell a rat and it's really begging to stink.
Looks like the Repubs are looking for a conspiracy for their weird conspiracy theory.
@JudgeJeanine The fact is @LorettaLynch needs to recuse herself. She has made herself a potential witness in case!
. She knew better were not that stupid. Really she showing no sense what's so ever.
judge,  this is a move to FURTHER  DELAY the case down the road!
once the data change hands they will ask for MORE TIME. It is a brilliant move but no one seems to out it!
A republican one, right?  lol
Democrats, admit it, if a Republican would have done this, you would be screaming the exact same, WAKE UP, UNITE
Just one more example of how the Clintons and their ilk believe themselves to be above the law and the rest of us
You are wrong sir! This will be delayed now until after the election, which is exactly what the Clinton's want!
sign this petition to force Loretta Lynch to recuse herself
