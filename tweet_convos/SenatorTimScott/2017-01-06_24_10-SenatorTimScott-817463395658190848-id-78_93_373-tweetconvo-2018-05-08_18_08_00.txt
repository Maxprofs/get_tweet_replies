Yes, we are interested when Congress will ban #guncontrol & #gunfreezones that enable #massmurder.
your heart is with FL,but your pockets are lined w NRA$. Work to solve gun violence with real reform. #thoughtsandprayers
Real reform=ban #guncontrol/#criminalsafety laws that enable #massmurders & lesser violent crimes.
Not sure you have a heart! How about doing something for gun control, universal background checks, assault weapons ban?
Ban all 3 of those, to stop their enabling #massmurder?
Thank you Senator.
#heartsandprayers aren't needed. You're support for common sense gun laws are.
Shall not be infringed is the only common sense gun law, removing the word "not", is pro-#criminalsafety, and evil.
love when people comment on my posts then immediately block me so I can't respond. Cowards.
As it says in my profile, "DTI=15 BTC unblocking fee" DTI: Defend The Indefensible (victim disarmament for #criminalsafety)
Surprised you can remove the @NRA from your ass long enough to offer a thank you.
Which would mean banning #gunfreezones & #guncontrol.
.@SenatorTimScott If you actually gave a shit about first responders and families and communities, you would stand against the gun lobby.
*#guncontrol lobby.
Prayers are worse than useless, Senator, when people are bleeding to death in public. Do something concrete about guns!
Yes, ban #guncontrol which is responsible for making disarmed & defenseless people bleed to death.
Yes, let the Dylann Roofs of the country continue to exercise their "Second Amendment rights."
Mass murderer only has the right to be shot in #seldefense, but go on with your Defending The Indefensible!
.@SenatorTimScott your heart means a lot less than different votes on Feinstein, Cornyn, Murphy and Grassley amendments. Do better.
Your thankful heart should start listening to your voters. 
Don't let a cokehead create a Russian puppet gov. 
#trumphack
Senator Scott you are a honorable and righteous legislator!
thoughts and prayers for you as you cash your check from the @NRA
Because you get paid off by the NRA, you'll keep saying these bullshit platitudes.
Give back the money to the NRA if you SINCERELY feel badly.  Didn't think so...
You poor pathetic little man. Don't you know that guns are for men who are insecure about their manhood?
you made this possible.
Actually, #guncontrol did.
Tim, good chance to use that $17K in NRA money for hospital/funeral costs for victims. Seems only fair. #thoughtsandprayers
/ hypocrite your thoughts and prayers are meaningless
Spoken like a true NRA puppet
Isn't your heart with the NRA?  Less praying, more action!
he got $17,013 from@NRA 2support expanding gun access(which makes shootings like this more likely)
YOU DO NOT GET TO SAY ANYTHING EXCEPT "sorry." The blood is on your hands. YOURS.
Your heart is also against sensible gun control measures. Shame on you. You own these killings!
pretty sure your courage in crafting common sense gun legislation > your heart being there superficially
how about not being a shill for the NRA. That would mean more than your empty sympathy for the victims.
Whenever shootings happen the expectation is: 1. Florida Learn some #GunSense that's more effective than your #BlackHeart
If your heart  was with ANYONE in Florida or anywhere else-you would require #GunSense
yeah, and we don't have a gun problem, wake up
We have a #guncontrol problem, and it needs to be banned.
Bull shit! Do something.  Stop taking NRA Money to start with.
stop accepting contributions from @nra. #thoughtsandprayers
Hopefully that 17k NRA $ bought a new iPad @SenatorTimScott. You can use it to tweet your bullshit thoughts about your non-existent "heart".
you might as well of pulled the trigger for excepting that NRA blood money
If your prayers don't move you to action - beside taking more NRA money - they are worthless.
$17,013 from the NRA. Perhaps YOU'RE part of the problem, @SenatorTimScott.
maybe if you stood up to the NRA instead of bending over for them.
Amen
You have blood on your hands AGAIN. How much has NRA paid you? I thought you were "pro-life"???  cc @Everytown @igorvolsky

Yep, the @GOP would rather pray than ban #guncontrol to stop its enabling #massmurders & lesser crimes.
It would be really great if you could not take money from the NRA. Thanks.
So, stop taking $ from NRA.
Blood on your hands, @nra shill
Is your heart also with the $17,013 you received from the #NRA ? Coward!
Blood Money!!  hopefully we can get leaders that actually care in a couple years. 
That blood money you received from the NRA has stained your image and your soul.  Good luck with that.
Stop with the double http://standard.You  only have a heart for the NRA.
#thoughtsandprayers  HYPOCRITE  How much did you get from the NRA?
So you have a heart, even though you take money from NRA that results in so many hearts stopping?!?!?
The @NRA is a pro-#guncontrol organization?
senator maybe u should take that 17k given to u by the NRA and help pay for each victims funeral? Thoughts?
yaaaa didn't think so. Good luck sleeping with yet another mass shooting on ur conscious tho.
...NRA... 'nuff said. Im sure the optics are good for you though. #smh

You could actually do something tangible and make changes so this doesn't keep happening. Just a thought.
It looks like your heart is really with the NRA and the blood money you accept from them. Shame on you
oh. Ice we got anpoliticians heart now instead of prayers. Maybe this will stop future mass shootings everyone!!
Banning #guncontrol & #gunfreezones will.
Where is your heart when you cash those checks from the NRA
You are bought and paid for by the NRA.  You have blood on your hands.  #FortLauderdale
