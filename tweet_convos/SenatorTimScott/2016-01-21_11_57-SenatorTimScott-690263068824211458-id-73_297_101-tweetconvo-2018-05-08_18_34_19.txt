@markknoller blood on the hands of Obama. Majority did not want Iran deal, but Obama went ahead despite the people. All knowing Obama
@markknoller And by contributing $150B more, isn't this administration also complicit in funding terrorism? Anything for an agenda, eh?
@DManiac777 @markknoller you both understand that the US GAVE NOR CONTRIBUTED ANY MONEY, right? Please quit spewing this ridiculousness.
@sboztik Upon review, the misunderstanding, about both the amount and its origin, was mine. @markknoller made no such allusions. #MeaCulpa
@markknoller So what will be done about this??! #TotalStupidity
@markknoller Our fearless leader John Kerry along with POTUS should be tried for treason as both have sold out the USA!
@markknoller @SenatorTimScott ...so naturally we relax their visa requirements for entry into the U.S.
@markknoller so we just became sponsors of terrorism. Not even surprised.
@markknoller @BarrettSallee we're going to keep looking the other way when our "friends" the Saudis do it though right?
@markknoller I'm scratching my head as to WHY?!
@markknoller @cronair @_________huh
How in Gods name can you media folks continue to cover for and support this administration? What constitutes treason, Mark?

@markknoller
@markknoller 
Plus they get nukes...
@markknoller then why did we do it , again?  This president is horrible
@markknoller but shit, let's give them a billion dollars to do it. #tehranKerry #worstPresidentInOurHistory
@markknoller eeeezze
@markknoller where is that statement located?
@markknoller does that admission open White House to civil litigation in event of Iran-funded terror act?
@markknoller @SpeakerRyan Congress/Senate <Will be complicit in the deaths of Americans & others for funding TERROIST! #WakeUpAmerica #IRAN
@markknoller w
@markknoller so we are allowing them to fund terrorism now. How is this good?
@markknoller I could of told them that and saved the plant. What idiots 2+2=4 and Iran lies.
@markknoller We have ourselves a rocket scientist in the WH.
@markknoller to bad going to cocktail parties and rubbing elbows with DC elitists stopped you from pressing this question earlier.
@markknoller wow, really? Everyone but the WH got the memo!!! Always last to find out..
@markknoller @clpond53 Which "terrorism" are they talking about ? A sort different to that the WH supports ?
@markknoller @SenatorTimScott of course they will!  Gee what a surprise.... (sigh)
@markknoller For which side did Kerry negotiate if Iran ended up with all the money and killing tools?
@markknoller Funny u say that to destroy Human u invent: Saud, Al-qaeda, Taliban, Boko Haram, IzraHell rain Phosphorous.    @tsutton94
@markknoller history repeats itself. Clinton did the same thing with Korea. Now look at what they're doing
@markknoller DUH!!
@markknoller Is there any justification at all?  Or just “oh well, if we didn’t they might act even worse”?
"....adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."

@markknoller @MissSelfDefense
@markknoller "The Bunkers Impenetrable"
http://www.nukingpolitics.com/2015/03/the-bunkers-impenetrable.html …
@markknoller This is my shocked face.
@markknoller no worries those that find this disturbing are "  holding on to old tired dogmas"
@markknoller @SenatorTimScott Of course they will. It seems everyone knew that but Kerry & Obama.
@markknoller 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@markknoller 

This is what "Fundamental Transformation" looks like.
@markknoller wtf?????
@markknoller @mickeynu477 But they and others didn't hesitate to bash Sen. Cruz when he called them out on it.
@aldematt @markknoller Believe me if they could hide this, they wouldn't be admitting it.  This is getting it out there b4 first attack.
MT @markknoller WH concedes it's likely Iran will continue to support terrorism with funds unfrozen by US
@markknoller Obama/ Kerry making Neville Chamberlain look like Ronald Reagan on a daily basis. Our 'leaders' are the pied pipers of idiocy.
@markknoller @EricaJacobson13 Duh.
@markknoller I guess waiting for the next terror attack they sponsor is what obama means by "strategic patience."
@markknoller To quote nobody ever, "Surprise! Surprise!"
.@markknoller & they knew it'd happen which makes those at the WH tyrants at the very least or aiding/abetting our enemies which is treason
@markknoller that is treason on the part of the administration !
@markknoller So the WH concedes that blood IS on THEIR hands!??
@markknoller So, by extension, WH concedes that it has given nuclear green light to known terrorists. Smells like Jurassic #FastnFurious
@markknoller bc they wanted to
@markknoller Are we ready to say this is the first POTUS that directly and knowingly funds the enemy and that will get our troops killed?
@markknoller @SenatorTimScott Us folks already figured that out. Didn't take a genius. See Revolutionary Guards for more.
@markknoller If this is smart power , I'm ready for something not so smart.
@markknoller  Who cares what WH concedes? We've been ahead of them for last 7yrs. The fact they are finally catching up is of no import.
@markknoller well that certainly makes it all better now doesn't it?
@markknoller I love ex post facto Foreign Policy.
@markknoller  tell  me  something  I  dont  already know.
@markknoller ...but that's ok with WH
@markknoller that's comforting ... that they actually conceded something.
