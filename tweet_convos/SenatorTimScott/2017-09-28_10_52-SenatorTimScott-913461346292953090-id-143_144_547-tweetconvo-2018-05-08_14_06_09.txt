Forgive me if I don't believe you. Show me a bill alongside Trump's tax returns, then we'll talk.
Can we see yours also, then I'll listen to your mouth
Be more than happy to show you mine. We live on my husband's SSID for severe COPD. Now, put yours up.
Careless what you say or what you have let see the paper, then we all can determine if your a liar.
Nope. Whip yours out and let's see if it measures up
Oh, found one of your party members enjoy.
Seriously? Apparently trying to have a discussion about taxes and our country is beneath you. That's fine. I expected no less.
If you’re offering a tax break to the middle class it’s going to have to include, guess what, a tax break for the middle class. #liar
Seriously?  Hashtag Keep YO money?  I guess that's the GOP  trying to be the commen man. SMH
Are you embarrassed?  Cuz I'm embarrassed for you.
Tax returns please-
Can we see yours Please!
Stop lying. #Liar
I wonder why they gave you the #keepyomoney sign, hey Tim they don't give a days work about you, give it to timmie he will hold it, #uncool
If you wonder Y your approval ratings are so low, it is in direct result of GOP lies & belief that we can't read/see with our own eyes! #
They both lie.
the question is??? Will It give more tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy???
Eliminates a lot but give huge tax break threshold
#dosomethingGOP time to make decisions to benefit your constituents, not ingratiate yourselves to 1 lying, racist, corrupt, narcissistic sociopath! Choose country over trump, or in 2018 we'll make sure those that will, are elected!!
IMMORAL Tax Plan raisg rate on poorest/lower rates for most wealthy. #NotOnePenny NO Repeal of Estate Tax NO Repeal of Alternate Minium Tax
I do not relate to this man at all. He is nothing like me. I made a mistake, which will not repeat itself.
Lies. Lies. And more lies
You too are addicted!
YOU LIE. I USED TO ADMIRE YOU.
They are all happy because tax plan helps them become richer!
Can you really be THIS out of touch??!!
The rich only hold on to their money & if this tax plan passes will not have 2 pay inheritance tax  can keep all their money & pass it down
Jesus Christ!! Did u stand up in the room and tell everyone "Hey Im a black guy. Those people will listen to me." This is Uncle Tom-foolery!
WRONG. GOP trying to pull another fast one. #Taxreform helps rich ppl & big corps...aka GOP Donors https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/28/us/politics/trump-tax-benefit.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0 …
The Federal Government is double-taxing senior citizens, help stop this abuse by signing this petition: http://fwact.org/ErsTwgA 

Yo @SenatorTimScott, how exactly does this math help a family #KeepYoMoney?
& what about s family of 2 making 65,000 needing morgage interest deduction &,high state tax deduction - they screw us
I'll read up on the tax proposal but what's wrong with Keep Your Money? Who speaks in that venacular anymore? Do you on the Senate Floor?
Hush Yo Mouth !
This tax reform is not helping my family I already have to get a loan every year 2 pay taxes & now you want to take away my deductions
The deductions i use as my income in that place most Americans are inbetween 55 - 70,000 U take away state tax deduction, morgage interest
You tax my 401k why not tax the rich they will not feel it,  this tax plan terrible 4 middle class
#KeepYoMoney More of my money stays in my check...Sign me up! Great talk Brother Scott
hear that? those are the rest of senators standing behind you laughing AT YOU. they don't have your back, they're using you. SHAME ON YOU.
Dear God. These Asshats were laughing at you @SenatorTimScott not with you shame on you for letting them use you parody blacks . #RacistGOP
Sounds good....so tell me...how much will "Sherrie" get when you eliminate the estate tax? #KeepYoBullshit
Says the same men who voted to hide #Trump taxes = complicit in hiding a #Treason against the country
Nobody behind you is listen to a word you're saying.  Just look at them.  Why do you think you're being put in front at this time? NFL/black
That would be exclusively for the wealthy. You left out that crucial word
WEALTHY. Shame on you, Senator Scott for lying about whom it helps
All this tax reform is nothing but a billionaire cash grab that will increase the national debt.
Ha ha! I laughed when I heard you say that! It's true though and thank you for telling the truth.
Your summary of alleged tax "reform" is a lie.  Any credible argument requires first the release of Trump taxes.

If Trump can't show us his taxes he can't mess with ours.
#flattax @SenatorCruz_
Could we look at wealth logarithmically, pick an aesthetic point, and impose an estate tax to curb Dynastic Wealth? @ClemsonEcon
WHY DO YOU RETWEET LIES JOHN?  ARE YOU TOO MUCH OF A COWARD TO TELL THEM TO THE FACES OF TEXANS?  HOW ABOUT A TOWN HALL COWARD.
Nope that's a lie. Trickle down proven to hurt country.
I hope so.   After seeing what has been previously presented by the current administration, I am very skeptical.  What is being hidden?
Tax cuts for the rich!  That's what The People want! David Koch NEEDS more money!  Come on, guys, do the right thing!
Tell us one time that tge supply side worked? Never
More lies to the American people. #MoLies #KeepYoLies #TaxcutsForTheRich
Thank you Senator Scott!
Really #standup
Wow. Had such respect for you
What good is it to #keepyomoney when you #loseyojob to automation? https://www.facebook.com/lillian.vogl/posts/1499776880088486 … #solidaritychat #robotoverlords #oligarchy
How can you say that when you haven’t worked any of the details?  I’m an accountant and I see real concern 4 2income fam in high tax states
There is a problem! Low tax rate raised??? Exemptions removed??? NOT GOOD FOR TAXPAYERS!!! Small & Large business looks OK! REWORK REQUIRED!

Thank You SC!!
KNOW BODY HAS SAID THIS TAX CUT WILL HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS.@chuckschumer @NancyPelosi
Boy you really love to lie.  Does Lyan Ryan have his hand up your ass moving your mouth to confirm his lies?
Great, but let's not forget healthcare, wall, and the rest of Trump's agenda.
They are laughing at you, bruh. #KeepYoMoney Next time, #KeepYoDignity. #DoBetter
How about helping #PuertoRicoRelief and #USVI immediately? They help us here in SC when we have a disaster
#KeepYoMoney is #GOP code for #SaveYourMoney because #TrickleDownEcon means increasing #MiddleClass payroll taxes #fiscalresponsibility
Most of Tax Cuts Go to Top 1%
So it is true you RT lies
No welfare for the wealthy
How will our government learn to budget less money coming in? You guys are nuts, but sure give us more money
If you want to be rescued from puerto rico you must sign a IOU
"Offshoring funds", "tax havens", "shell companies", "corporate welfare cheats"..say it, Tim, say it!
Next time, tell us something we can believe.
Tax reform is a well disguised tax increase that will burden poor families most.
Crowbarring “yo” into a hashtag like
The Trump tax plan is to take away  $10-20k in tax incentives from the middle class and give them  $1k in tax cuts. Sounds like a bad deal.
You're a Trumpster. Too bad. I won't forget. Be truthful about plan & how it affects the people.
Don't give up on Healthcare!
I ran my own numbers and it doesn't help me a bit
But will it #BuildMoDeficit, and also #WidenTheIncomeDivide, resulting in #MoreMoneyAtTheTop?
I call BS.
I think you are talking to Trump when you say #KeepYoMoney. All educated people be sayin this proposal very good for the rich folk.
A truly superb tweet...both incredibly patronizing and 180 degrees wrong.
You know that's a lie, we know that's a lie, we know you know that's a lie. Shameful.
LOL
Especially if your family name is #Trump  https://twitter.com/sensanders/status/913505679889063936 …  $4 billion!
Who benefits from Trump's plan to repeal the estate tax? Only the top 0.2% — Trump, his cabinet, and other millionaires and billionaires. 
I hope this is worth it to you.
Can you explain why #TrumpTaxScam looks like a tax cut for the rich?
Here, based on prior Tax Policy Ctr estimates, is what I'd ballpark as the 10-yr revenue cost, and the avg. benefit for millionaires.  5/ 
Today would be a good day to investigate @SenatorTimScott and @JohnCornyn.
#MAGA
Tim u know this is a con. Just another poltrickster.Equal school funding,retraining for the 21st century. Invest in the people.
Republicians spin 
-medium income people make between $34k-100K
This all about tax cuts for the rich
@SenatorTimScott Scott/Gowdy 2020! Thank you Senator!
question senator scott heard this bill does not allow for any state deductions. is this true & will SC deductions be removed as a deduction?
What a load of crap. This isn't helping the people..it's convincing the middle class what's best for your rich ass is what's best for them.
Yes Tom
Next to impossible to believe anything you peddle these days. So I'm inclined to call BS and assume it's tax reform for the rich.
Are you nuts???? For who ? You ?
Hate to say it Senator but you have a bunch of idiots following your account. They can do no more than parrot what they've been fed.  taxes

Trickle down doesn't work.
Worked for Kennedy and Reagan. And if you read the outline of the plan, this is the opposite of trickle down
You left off cause a recession.
You are a bad liar
It will make rich richer and your debt bigger. Good luck
Total BS. It is welfare for the wealthy- does nothing for the majority of Americans. This "tax reform" is another nail in @GOP's coffin.
More debt and #lessyomoney
Lies
who could be against keeping more of your own money?
.@SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan "A Big, But Fixable" Is it? What about #DeficitIncrease #CorporateTaxCuts #DeathTaxRepeal?
You're a liar
Tax returns first! 45 has to show his tax returns first!
No one cares about that. Time to get the country moving. Mueller has access to his tax returns, anything juicy will get leaked
Not for 94% of the Country, Seriously.
.@SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Increasing Deficit 4 #TaxCuts and 4 Whom?
#KeepYoMoney
You are one kick ass senator !
Especially for that 2/10 of a percent that you bend over for on a daily basis.
One word SENATE?????
I'm a retired teacher receiving a small pension. What I've read re your plan shows my taxes will increase. How does this help me?
You won't pay any tax at all most likely
More pressing right now:
Actually, it might help them #GetMoreOfYourMoney. Let's have some bipartisan evaluation and debate.
Are you still saying YO?
Tim the GOP has lost all cred
I love hashtag #KeepYoMoney .. great job.. Thank you
Are you talking to the rich why r u all saying this and experts say no mostly to benefit rich
As an SC resident and a constituent, this is really embarrassing. Are you their puppet now?
Maybe for some. I'm not feeling too bullish about it myself, but I'm not a super megarich GOP donor or corporation.
Your lies will hurt people. Please stop.
You are a white-supremacist.  Hands down
When it's all said and done, only corporations benefit.
That hashtag makes you look like a bloody fool, Senator. Show some pride in yourself 

#PartyOfNixon
Do you have any math to back that up? Can we see the policy?
Prove it.
