Your support of Donald Trump is an embarrassment to Ronald Reagan
@TNGOP You realize he would have been too liberal to win a single primary in 2016?
if I donate $47k like the DeVos family, can I buy your vote back?   Also, How much will your vote for Supreme Court cost?
@SenThomTillis how would u like the crowd at #WomensMarch at ur offices. Don't underestimate women & their org. #StopDeVos
I am reading yr replies to yr tweets I suggest u vote NO on DeVos listen to yr constituents!
Thank you @SenatorTimScott We the People are Thankful for Men like you :)
maybe you should remember him by not fumbling back our win in the cold war b/c of party loyalty #TrumpPutinEP
@SenThomTillis day no to Putinpuppet .
why do you worship Reagan? He was the originator of #WorstLieIEverTold
reagan was the anti christ.  duh.  doesnt every neo con know this,  or does continuing same old bs?
why did #RonaldReagan fight the anti-Apartheid movement?
@SenThomTillis seems hypocritical that @HouseGOP are honoring a man you clearly dont emulate. 
YOU HAVE 0 CREDIBILITY4 2018
why did #RonaldReagan announce his presidential campaign in 1979 in Philadelphia, MS with a speech about "states' rights"?
Rolling in his grave watching you all destroy the values he held dearly.
#RonaldReagan invented "identity politics" and conservatives have used it as a weapon for 50 years. He hated #freedomforall
why did #RonaldReagan say,"We can't let our streets become jungle pathways," after the Watts riots while running 4 CA gov?
Please stand up MORE!!! for what you believe in....it's refreshing!!!
Vote no on DeVos. She is unqualified to lead public schools, & she's a pay-for-play nominee. Drain the swamp=Dump DeVos!
please vote No on DeVos. Our children's education is the MOST important issue. we must have vision and competence in office
AmericaIsFreedom-FreedomOfSpeech,FreedomOfReligion, FreedomOfEnterprise.&FrdmIsSpecial&Rare.It'sFragile;ItNeedsProtection.
He could care less about you. He kept black pple poor and raged a war against black men by mass incarceration. No dignity.
corruption lies equal reagan. equal bush, equal kkk, equal war, profiteering govt, equal trump,and gdumbya
There's no walls around the human spirit, no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect#Reagan
A Republican who actually had some class.
i remember and celebrate when his brain turned to mush
@SenThomTillis even Reagan would have said #NoOnDeVos #DumpDeVos #TheResistance
President Reagan would be appalled about the state of US government. We the people are speaking - LISTEN!
Vote No on #PresidentBannon 's pick for Education! No DeVos!
I can almost see him spinning in his grave. #PresidentBannon
@SenThomTillis  vote NO to Betsy DeVos!  She is not qualified!!
Reagan thought that we should have a guest worker program for undocumented workers. Said a wall was stupid.
He's rolling in his grave at what you and your fellow "Republicans" are allowing to happen in the name of the party.
he would be APPALLED at all the Putin love from Trump. And he would NEVER have put up someone as incompetent as DeVos
@SenThomTillis indeed, he would be very sad at the current state of the #GOP and the #POTUS
@SenThomTillis Only the living have BIRTHDAYS.
You should demonstrate the courage you admire in #Reagan
vote NO to DeVos!!!! failing schools are not what our education system needs!! I am a constituent from 29715- hear me!!!
It would have been my grandads b-day as well today, same year also!!
I served in the Army under President Reagan.  He won Cold War without firing a shot.  Millions in Europe are Free today.
@SenThomTillis Please Vote No for #devos
please think of our public schools when voting for Mrs. DeVos! Please vote no for Maine!
And you celebrate his birthday by standing with the donald?  Are you even sure you are from SOUTH CAROLINA?  Your values???
@SenThomTillis  Vote NO to DeVos! If you care about education, please stop DeVos! Reagan would've never nominated DeVos!!
When will you be holding a Town Hall? What are your thoughts on this: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2017/02/government_by_white_nationalism_is_upon_us.html â€¦ ?
@SenThomTillis please vote no on DeVos!!!! Please! As a constituent, this is so important to me!
@SenThomTillis Are you guys remembering how Dictators were afraid of him and how he gave refugees hope?
To bad the man that holds that office now will destroy the republican party and even the country given the chance
Can you please honor The Gipper & vote AGAINST DeVos? He never would've gone for that level of incompetency.
Obama was strong supporter of public schools for other people's kids.  Let's end the reign of terror by NEA & AFT
honor Reagan by voting No to #devos!
That man would be disgusted by what the GOP has become.  Do your job and get us a qualified cabinet!
When will you remember what American & republican values really are? Stand up for us. We don't want this lying regime.
He would never have approved of mentally ill having gun rights??
now remember who your constituents are. The majority of our kids go to public schools and they deserve better! #DumpDevos
As a public teacher.  I am counting the hours until our students and their families are free from the NEA
You need to remember your duties to SC constituents & RECUSE YOURSELF from the DeVos vote. Your friend is incompetent.
accepting $49,200 from her makes your vote dirty. #recuseyourself #noDevos
She gave $1 million to all the GOP senators + another $2.7 to GOP fund. OF COURSE THEY VOTE FOR HER.
PleaseVote @NoDeVos WeNeedEqual $ & QualityEducationForAll Her Actions Record Statements & Supporters Disagree @SenateFloor
the republicans need you now "tear down that wall"
Current horrible administration is making me nostalgic even for Reagan years, despite Reaganomics' terrible consequences.

Do you all Trumpets and religious bigots get the message?
Sorry you are mis-informed
LOVE!!!!
Mr Scott I'm Proud to have voted Twice For President Reagan He Was and Will Always Be The BEST !!!!!!!
he wouldn't be welcome in today's GOP
