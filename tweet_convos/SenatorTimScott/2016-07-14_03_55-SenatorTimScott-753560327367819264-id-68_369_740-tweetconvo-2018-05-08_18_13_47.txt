Very moving. Please don't drop the ball.
Excellent speech by Sen Scott! People like Scott & Rubio are trying 2 make America better!Thank you!
Sensible gun legislation now
Wake Up: Read 6 Yr Muslin Brotherhood Controlling USA & Sharia Law, Hillary name stated; we are down to 4 yrs.
I loved it, I really wish the Republican ticket was Rubio-Scott :(
@EboniKWilliams @SenatorTimScott These issues should be neither left nor right, neither socialist nor libertarian-about equality
all the speeches politicians make are great. Useless but great.
Can we all try and be a little more like this? https://twitter.com/blakely_ellen/status/753609475945144320 …
You are both honorable men and we are proud to have you in our country and government
I like Sen Scott. He has shown we can have biases and nay Sayers through out all our lives. But persevere.
Back Trump or go hone
#Marco4Senate #OnlyMarco
where is your low energy buddy Jeb the two of you signed that you would support the Repub nominee so your word means nothing
Thanks for making us aware of his speech.
Such an informative speech. Sad that this country can't move into the 21st Century & leave the prejudice behind
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @NPR
you will never be even half the man @SenatorTimScott is.
how would you know @marcorubio what he said when you never show up for work?  #Fired.
I was very moved by this speech, @SenatorTimScott. https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4610836/senator-tim-scott-trust-gap-police-african-americans …
Powerful speech. Solution starts with a strong family structure first. Besides improved policing standards.
You are also a minority/Cuban, when will we hear from you? Not the 2 face want to get reelected you. When?
Amen! Thanks for sharing.Much to do, but it can't be done in DC! It is called personal responsibility. Go Blue, we support you.
this explains why neither of you are speaking at the convention as of now. You both can give speeches on issues
Both speak so passionately about the critical issues that face us everyday. What could of been...
I don't recall any politicians / staffers getting killed by police, but Carey Gabay was  killed by street thugs
your team called yesterday for another donation.   I sent the check to @realDonaldTrump #getonboard
Why did Scotts staffer get pulled over so often? He has the favorite dope boy car in a high crime city.
use it to do something, what will you do about racism in congress? Need more than speeches now.
My white Dad was on a date w/ my mom when they were young & a cop pulled a gun on him cuz my Dad got smart
I'll vote for u in FL Marco & appreciate Tim Scott but I a white Hispanic female have had bad cop experiences
Impressed by your 7/13 speech; moved by fact that the challenges haven't made you bitter. Open to your ideas
republicans conceding that police are systematically racists. Awesome! Thanks for focusing on the real issues!
better you all endorse @realDonaldTrump and make America proud. take America back from Obama. impeach him.
Marco we need you to step up and defeat Hillary clinton stop hiding in Florida come out and support trump against Hillary!!!!!
A real eye opener for me.  I was stunned to hear of black men’s obstacles and pain.
time to support #TheRealDonaldTrump and unite the party to defeat Dems! Be a United!
Gooooooooo @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #MASA #AmericaFirst #Trump2016

This speech by @SenatorTimScott is moving & powerful & really worth a few minutes to watch. https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4610836/senator-tim-scott-trust-gap-police-african-americans …
@marcorubio @SenatorTimScott
- keep enduring this life and your God will reward you---never stop magnifying truth.Persevere & be blessed.
Hey little marco, you haven't got a clue. How can you promote scottie
Just go away.
little marco must go...
why are you up its 4 in the morning
.@marcorubio @SenatorTimScott Thank you both for speeches on this important subject promoting finding solutions instead of being divisive.
talk about pandering Rubio. Don't diminish what the senator said when you are callous and uncaring
and you will do nothing about it
#IStandWithMarcoRubio Bc God's Greater & Marco gets it! https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GIAtfuv9qg …
#IStandWithIsrael
why is it so hard for people to admit that there's prejudice involved in #PoliceDepartments?
#TrumpCoatBoyMikePence you're smart declined to become the coat boy
Why don't you tell me what it is about before I watch??
I'm not voting for the missing senator of my state.
