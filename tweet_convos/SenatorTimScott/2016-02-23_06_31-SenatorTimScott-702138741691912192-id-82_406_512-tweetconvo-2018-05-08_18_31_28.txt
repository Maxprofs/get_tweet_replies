@THEeroticneed @BrotherVet @SenatorTimScott because everyone is afraid of that quack!  He is a disaster and should be hung for TREASON.
@THEeroticneed like this?http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9HTAiW-B4WQ …
@SenatorTimScott @socialistmop What's new? He's been destroying America from day one, and no one will lift a finger to stop him.
@SenatorTimScott After marrying Rubio you need to be voted out as a globalist open border pig you have shown to be. We see your true colors.
@SenatorTimScott   I AGREE!! 120% with you Tim, KEEP up the GREAT! WORK!!
@SenatorTimScott nope, go back to hiding under your desk
@SenatorTimScott guess its only ok when a white guy says it http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9HTAiW-B4WQ …
@SenatorTimScott @katemauro take off the word on and yes. You guys cave to whatever Obama wants.  No backbone or the will to fighr
@SenatorTimScott @democratssucass  Completely Unsafe!
Next he will let their relative's come visit them in prison.
@SenatorTimScott @sudischuricht well maybe the legislature will actually do something about Obama acting illegally for once???
@NikoTheFarmer @SenatorTimScott Has there been anything he's done that hasn't had an anti-American smell to it? None! It's all intentional!
@ancerrone @NikoTheFarmer @SenatorTimScott People WON'T believe that his agenda is global, his masters globalist's, his mission UN control
@Macshivers @ancerrone @NikoTheFarmer @SenatorTimScott Almost like a caliphate, huh?
@ruthdianecotter @ancerrone @NikoTheFarmer @SenatorTimScott Very smart Americans are missing OBVIOUS clues as to where this country is going
@NikoTheFarmer @Macshivers @ancerrone @SenatorTimScott You are not a dummy. If you were, you wouldn't admit it.
@SenatorTimScott @LoriKemp Had respected U but supporting amnesty boy did away with that. No difference, Rubio won't stop Syrian refugees.
@SenatorTimScott more importantly, in closing Gitmo, we lose a major defensive asset. We can't have Cuba move the Russians in next door
@SenatorTimScott This further supports the legacy of Obama, that he is the worst President in U.S. history.
@SenatorTimScott Yes,tell us how our prisons cannot hold supposed terrorists but can hold domestic criminals.Are they magicians as well?
@SenatorTimScott maybe we could just kill the prisoners and be done with it. Not that hard.
@SenatorTimScott soooo I guess it's ok to spend more money on 100 detainees than some people make in a year! 40,000 per detainee #getaclue
100 or less $4,000,000 divide that and it's an estimate! For those asking! Include guards, food, utilities...,etc #getaclue
@SenatorTimScott No, yet somehow I doubt you'll (Congress) will do anything to stop it.
@sav01 @SenatorTimScott As much as I Like the Senator, they will do NOTHING.
@tbone9070 I very much like @SenatorTimScott as well, but these guys are just incapable of stopping Obama.
@SenatorTimScott  No problem with them coming here as long as they walk!  Might get a little wet.
@SenatorTimScott how is it illegal? He wouldn't do it if it was!
@SenatorTimScott Message heard loud and clear!  We don't need the JV team, it's cheerleaders and supporters on US soil.
@SenatorTimScott no u can stop there actually
@SenatorTimScott I believe it is legal. Just unwise.
@SenatorTimScott How exactly do you propose to keep them incarcerated? Everything isn't POTUS fault! #PutUpOrShutUp #StopScareTactics
@SenatorTimScott @MikeV_803 Illegal is a matter for the courts, reckless and unsafe? no rationale. Oh and https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2559 …
@SenatorTimScott @KurtSchlichter Let me guess, you'll vote for it anyway.
@SenatorTimScott @mimimayesTN I said more than 3 years ago, watch them open all prison doors..wait for it. His national security enFORCErs.
@SenatorTimScott Obama Wants Gitmo Closed
So He can Give it to Cuba,
the Russians to Establish a Military Base
90 Miles from Our Shores
@SenatorTimScott Why is THIS illegal action so outrageous?Where were you and the rest of congress while Obama got away with everything else?
@SenatorTimScott 
Yes, Senator. We desperately need your voice of reason to stop this tyrant.
@SenatorTimScott no Tim let's keep it open for Dick Cheney and George Bush need I go on..
@SenatorTimScott Domestic locations? He's not suggesting a Holiday Inn.
@SenatorTimScott @SenPatRoberts - he has no clue what his only job duty is - to keep America safe !
@SenatorTimScott Sen Scott, it's  time for you to determine what you think about Gitmo by researching this yourself. Stop being a Parrot.
. @SenatorTimScott @SenPatRoberts How long do y'all intend to support the suspension of Habeas & natural law in the name of treasonous GWOT?
@SenatorTimScott @Enchantedsnowmn Put them in Baltimore, MD and they'll blend right in
@lschi1 @SenatorTimScott
He wants to put them in a maximum security location
Is he planning on bringing them to Whitehouse?
@Enchantedsnowmn @SenatorTimScott Those guys can't even keep one nut from jumping the fence and walking around the Whitehouse
@SenatorTimScott >#Stop, non of those words are true. Please go on.
@SenatorTimScott @patriotmom2911 what will you do to stop it?
@SenatorTimScott I heard you're going to have a couple staying with you.
@SenatorTimScott simply awful
@SenatorTimScott what makes it illegal? (honestly dont know)
@SenatorTimScott @POTUS #POTUS Mr. PRESIDENT.  Quit the blatant lying to the American public..enough is enough...
@SenatorTimScott Indefinite detention is unlawful, reckless, and unsafe. Please do go on.
@SenatorTimScott these whites don't love you Tim....
.@SenatorTimScott actually what we have been doing to gitmo prisoners is illegal, unsafe, and reckless. Need I go on?
@WikileaksTruck @SenatorTimScott I 100% agree Art superhero, Gitmo is where america tortures people illegally, it has to stop
@SenatorTimScott Why he will continue to do as he desires and be damned any one else. Who is going to stop him? Congress has no will.
@SenatorTimScott nonsense this prison should have been closed long ago
@SenatorTimScott @gailtalk @GOP Where are you?
@SenatorTimScott @KurtSchlichter Don't go on...we know.
@SenatorTimScott @KurtSchlichter 
"Illegal" ought to be enough. That is, if we had elected GOP Sens&Reps who were worth a damn. Big BIG "if"
(Having said that, YOU're not part of the problem, @SenatorTimScott you're OK--wish the others were like you.) @KurtSchlichter
@SenatorTimScott Yes, you do. Tell us specifically how the RNC will prevent it. No whining or excuses. PERIOD!!
@SenatorTimScott @PatriotWitch STOP HIM!!
@SenatorTimScott Something needs to be done, but what are y'all going to do? The same thing you have done since mid-terms NOTHING #Rino
@SenatorTimScott Yes yu need to go on. Twitter S
statement is easy, but what is going to be DONE to stop him is he goes exec orders again?
@SenatorTimScott Yes, Senator, you do. Are supermax prisons unsafe? What about the blind sheik from the 93 WTC bombing? #Guantanamo
@SenatorTimScott if Muslims try and attack in America, Americans will kill them!
@SenatorTimScott @KurtSchlichter Please do!
@SenatorTimScott If we can't deal with them ourselves, we shouldn't hold them in another country where we can safely ignore our own laws.
@SenatorTimScott yes you do.
@SenatorTimScott - I like the cut of your jib Tim
@SenatorTimScott YES!! Loudly call him out as a lawless president defying the people and the Constitution.
@SenatorTimScott @nevergiveup2004   Will return Gitmo to Cuba.
@SenatorTimScott Rubio's my Senator.Overloaded here w/ illegals.They slaughter horses, leech, cheat & steal.WE know 1st hand .@marcorubio
@SenatorTimScott Please stop him we have majorities and can't seem to ever do it.So why vote in Republicans if we are worthless?
@SenatorTimScott And very expensive!
@veritasjc @SenatorTimScott We pay $3.1 million each year for each prisoner to keep them at GITMO.
@veritasjc @SenatorTimScott That doesn't count the $65 million school we're building for US soldier guards' kids.
@SenatorTimScott WHAT TERRORISTS? THEY'VE BEEN FOUND INNOCENT!!!!!
@SenatorTimScott Why? What's the problem? U support MR and he's for amnesty/open borders. Heck just let them ALL in.
@SenatorTimScott Obama sure does love handing power over to authortarian dictators.  Obama is a traitor IMO. His goal is to weaken USA.
Coming from a Rubio endorser that's funny. Rubio voted to allow extremists into the country in December. @SenatorTimScott
@SenatorTimScott illegal is the only issue here.
@ZalmanGelbman No. Everything is an issue with this.
