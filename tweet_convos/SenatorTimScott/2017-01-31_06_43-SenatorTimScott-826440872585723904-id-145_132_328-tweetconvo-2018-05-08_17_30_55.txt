Read your article defending @BetsyDeVos. So you think you're helping public schools by helping everything but?
Ignoring pub schools DOESN'T cause them to improve through "competition". Now I know you can be bought for $50K
I'm sorry, I strongly disagree. No experience, no understanding, she is not right.
As an awarded SC teacher (public & private) of 40 years, DeVos support has cost you my support & vote.
Short article "because he paid me too."
...SMH... just SMH...
The teachers of SC will NOT forget this decision Senator. You will not get our votes!
wanting school choice != qualified.  She does not fathom scope or issues this job encompassed.
Disappointed to see you supporting such an under qualified person.
How much did she pay you to say this? #DumpDevos
$49,000, I believe.
Bought for just $49,000!  I'm so disappointed #DumpDevos
she has no experience in EDUCATION or TEACHING or FEDERAL LOANS...disappointed in you
.@SenatorTimScott I hope you are listening to your Senate colleagues this morning. DeVos' #alternativefacts & ethics equal #noDevos. Vote NO
your support of DeVos is very disappointing.
how much money has DeVos donated to your campaign? You cannot be trusted #nopayforplay
Betsy could not answer basic questions on key components of our public education system.  Please vote No on her appoint.
I believe you work for the people of SC, not to serve your own interests. #noDevos
Betsy DeVos does NOT have the credentials for the job!!! Are you all puppets???
You support her because she contributed thousands of dollars to your campaign, Senator. Keep it !
it's so easy to find out why every senator votes the way they do, all you gotta do is follow the money
listen to the people that you represent! Change. Your. Vote.
it's sad that you've turned your back on America's children. #shameful
You are a sad excuse for a black man. Voting to destroy public education. #Sellout
I am an SC voter and you have doomed my autistic son's education.
how because of choice? I'm excited to get vouchers!
You're more qualified for this role than her and I'm surprised you can't coalesce around a more qualified candidate!
very disappointed. 2nd reason you need to go. You lost my you support. #recallscott
I in your state @SenatorTimScott and there is NO WAY  @BetsyDeVos is qualified for the job. LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE. @thestate
She is NOT the right choice for this position or any other! #MidtermElections
how does school choice help rural communities that dont have access to other options?
She is not competent to be the Ed Secretary.  List to your constituents and vote NO!
You will be on the wrong side of history if you confirm Betsy DeVos. Review your conscience. Were you not at her hearing?
you're suppose to represent and advocate the interests of  South Carolinians
Betsy DeVos is completely unqualified for this position. I urge you to vote NO.
Betsy DeVos is an ignorant crackpot who is completely unqualified for the job. Shame!
of course she's the right choice when she donates $7,400 to your campaign.
Hold out for more!$49,000? Peanuts
@realmojesse5372 @RaySr1946
She knows nothing about public schools, spec. ed, federal loans. She is wrong
Bought and paid for. @BuzzAtTheState @BetsyDeVos
disgrace.
I cannot wait until u run again since u openly and fully support plagarism. #cheaters
Shame on you.  $49,000-that's the cost of sacrificing quality eduction for our children.  We will vote you OUT! #StopDeVos
She's the Cheater in Charge -- did charter schools skip the lessons about plagiarizing?
so disappointed in you for overlooking the total lack of understanding of Fed Law.
you support her simply because you're a partisan Republican
how much did she pay you to write this?
How much money did #BetsyDeVos paid you to say that ?  #corrupt
Very disappointed in you, sir. You will not have my vote next election.
MANY SC educators disagree. She will destroy SC public schools. SAY NO!
Sir I direct U 2 TheMackinacCenter "Choice" is a step to Ending public schools #StopDavos @SenatorTimScott @BuzzAtTheState  @thestate
We PAY you and you're not doing your job. Shame on you for this.
Shame! All you should feel is shame! Bought & paid for!
Having read this, you comment on what is wrong but make no argument to why she'll be the right choice.
. @SenatorTimScott Your betrayal of South Carolina's children by supporting DeVos will not be forgotten come reelection time.
. @SenatorTimScott DeVos is the wrong choice for Ed. Sec. You know it. Your constituents are watching. We will remember.
Or is it because of donation $$? #CrookedPolitics #DoYourJob
your selling out public education for less ths $50K is nothing short of corruption!
@BuzzAtTheState @BetsyDeVos @thestate
You should be ashamed... Terrible choice!
NO!  No experience, no competence.  She's a puppet.
You ignored your electorate.  Bi-partisan opposition was strong.
SHAME SHAME SHAME You put education and our children's future at risk
Mrs. DeVos did not say she would support the IDEA, because she does not know the law
As a native South Carolinian, I prayed u would be found on the right side of history. #BetsyDeVos  @BuzzAtTheState
how much $$ did @BetsyDeVos pay for this?
You are so wrong on all accounts. Public schools have school choice. Visit some time.
This is a shameful excuse for party politics as usual. Don't think constituents like myself will forget this next election
Higher Education institutions that receive Federal Pell Grant are held accountable and must be accredited.
No she's not. No experience. Just out for money. She is the wrong choice. #noDevos
As a constituent who called and emailed, I respectfully disagree with your decision. Sadly disappointed.
How'd you spend that $49K she gave you?
No, sir, she is not. You have been bought. Us here in SC will #neverforget
So you are ok with teaching kids to plagiarize? Never taught that in PUBLIC school!
Pay-for-play,unqualified and ignorant on public education.  Shame on you. Value your voters. Reject Devos.
How much money has Mrs. DeVos given you, Senator?
Get the FEDS out of our schools
Would that be because of the $42,900 DeVos has paid you????  

Shame, Senator--shame
I DON'T TRUST THIS GUY.
So completely wrong about research on school choice. Poor and rural schools have deplorable funding in SC and you just ensured it worsens.
Please do not confirm DeVos! She will destroy public education.
We the TaxPaying Americans Support her too.
#NODeVos #educationexperience #investedin$FedED$
Senator, she has no qualifications for this position. She just has a lot of money.
she is unqualified. She will not help those affected by scam #4profit colleges.
This why you will NOT receive my vote in next election.
save you a click, it's because of the 49k she donated
Not cool
charter schools DONT WORK
she donated the maximum amount to your campaign. Coincidence?
thank you!
Senator, I hoped and expected you would do better by us. You've let SC down this time
as your constituent I am deeply disappointed. Address fact that DeVos charters performed more poorly than public schools.
I see that campaign contributions can, in fact, but a vote. #TimScottWasBought
our kids will still be in school when you're up for reelection. We won't forget you sided w/ billionaires next time we vote
Proud to have voted for Mr. Scott .
@cassielcope @BuzzAtTheState @BetsyDeVos @thestate incredibly weak choice. Incredibly disappointed.
.@SenatorTimScott I voted for you, believing you had more courage to stand up for what is right.
#recalltimscott
DID SHE DONATE TO YOUR CAMPAIGN AT ALL, EVER?
You cannot be serious.
You are betraying your constituents (and my child) for $$$. I wonâ€™t forget it.
.@SenatorTimScott @BuzzAtTheState @BetsyDeVos @thestate You are full of it  Senator!
Plus, DeVos is dumb.
DeVos bad for rural students, bad for special needs students, bad for public schools.
As a constituent of Mount Pleasant SC, I strongly disagree with your support of DeVos
you've made my decision to not vote for you again super easy.
You sold your vote in exchange for destroying our children's futures. SHAME ON YOU! @BuzzAtTheState @thestate #NoDeVos
Thank you for making the right decision.  Give school choice to all students, not just the rich.
have fun going down in history as 1who supported dismantling of Amerian Education
2022
Can't we just get rid of the US dept of Ed?
I respectfully disagree. She is utterly unqualified & ignorant of the office's scope.
- @BetsyDeVos spends millions on the campaigns of you and your friends not on education that is what we have an issue with!
You have my full support.  She will make a good difference at the Dept of Ed.
Because she contributed big money to me and my pac? Just a guess..
Yer a good man Sen. Scott.  Please tell your Dem colleagues to stop playing politics w/security
no she is not!
@realS____Dollar @BuzzAtTheState @BetsyDeVos @thestate as a parent stop common core
- @BetsyDeVos is clearly as unqualified as you were bought!
No, you're supporting her because money talks in Washington.
Very disappointed. She is wholly unqualified and inexperienced. This is not a good move for public education.
@SenatorTimScott  a vote for DeVos is a vote against 2018 your district says #NoActionNoVote 2018
Columbia SC
so the fact that DeVos family contributed $200m to GOP & $50k to you didn't influence you at all, huh? She is unqualified.
This does not explain why you voted against Your people.  I know your phone was busy
SHE IS NOT THE RIGHT CHOICE! Supported  Pro-Islamic Curriculum & that is enough! NO!
as a constituent from Travelers Rest, SC 29690 who called & emailed about DeVos, I respectfully disagree. #blockDeVos
why is she the right choice?
really?
