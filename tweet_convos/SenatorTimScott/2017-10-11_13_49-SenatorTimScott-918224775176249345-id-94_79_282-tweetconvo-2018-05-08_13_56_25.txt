How about appropriately tax the wealthy and give Americans am actual return on investment through Healthcare, education, and living wage?
Because that would be Socialism, we are a Republic. You may want to learn that.
So republic means we pay taxes and get zero benefit? K.
No, take a Government class, you may learn something.
Took and passed several government classes. No where in our founding documents does it say "You poor? You die!"
Correct, it guarantees equal opportunity, not free handouts. That is why we donate to charities. It has worked for a couple hundred years.
And why does our current taxation model give the majority of the benefit to private contractors? What about actual American citizens?
That is exactly what we are trying to fix. Jump in and help instead of bitching!
Make it fair, close the SALT loophole!
Release your tax returns and demand potus and his cabinet release their tax returns to see how all of you benefit from trump tax plans
Why?
Corporate taxes equal reduced wages..but somehow record profits and huge payments to CEOs as they leave? C'mon man.
Stop lying.
Failed business class, didn’t ya

How does the Kansas tax cutting experiment affect your views?
It doesn't because he can't read.
@POTUS  y’all can help by cutting bad regulations that’s hurting small trucking companies. @ELD_or_ME  came to Washington to inform y’all.
If you are not a fake you will hurting hardworking Americans
Your tax reform is a joke.
Sen. Scott: I do not understand how a single mother HOH w/ 2 kids would be better off under your plan vs. current law.  /1
Oh it is better that she pay higher premiums and not have the deductible to get the care her and her children need that is your plan right
Allow less donation receipts & wtite off at least half of daycare.  Lower federal rates but raise state rate by 1%. More cash to state 
@SenateGOP @RepKevinBrady & corporations while screwing hardworking Americans, millions will pay more. NO WAY! Tax the rich
We can't talk about domestic problems, education + because trump's taunting N.Korea, Iran and killing American's ACA. #HelpAmericansNow
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO US!  We don't need tax cuts for rich &a few $ to us. Help us w/comp healthcare so we don't go broke if bad illness
Paid a lot of taxes the past 8 yrs. Ready for #TaxReform.
Why not a straight flat tax
28 million #MiddleClass get a #deduction on the interest paid for mortgages. This #TaxCut to the rich takes this away from the #MiddleClass.
Take the 100 billion $ the top 1% would get and make Jr. College free OR put it into #Infrastructure that would create jobs IN America!
I don't want the top 1% to get #NotADime in #TaxCuts. They get #loopholes, their kids get great educations + #HealthCare #CreateJobs w/Infra
instead of taking to mr. brady, how about speaking with real hardworking american families. Can you say, I have no tanasity
PASS TAXES OUR WE WILL VOTE YOU OUT
@SenateGOP @RepKevinBrady  STOP trying to SCAM the the hardworking American ppl w this scam tax plan. Tax cuts for the rich
@USATODAY @WSJ to hell with the deficit, the 1% want their tax cuts.
Have a town hall and talk to your constituents and see what they think about your plans on voting on this!
Bought and paid for by special interest? When are people going to learn that these politicians do not have their best interest in mind?
80% of the tax benefits go to the top 1%.  In many cases taxes go up for middle class.
You can help American families by invoking the #25thAmendment
You guys have been talking for years.  Shut up and get the job done. House should write a bill, pass the bill, and get it to the senate. Then the senate passes a bill and it goes to reconciliation.  You are supposed to know that and do it.
SIMPLE: don't take millions off healthcare to fund the tax cut for the wealthy, like Trump and many SENATORS.
U will be taking MORE $ from my fam of 6! Lose exemptions, prop tax ded, mortgage interest.  Cant afford ur "tax cut". U will DROWN R family
Don't take ppl for fools!
Is that code for "rich American families"?
@SenateGOP @RepKevinBrady #25amendmentnow
.@GOP needs you to believe that their tax breaks to wealthy & corporations will benefit you. Don't be fooled!  Rich will just get richer.
#ZeroTax30K
Scott should be focusing on 70,000 SC kids who could lose insurance. Instead, he's working on tax cuts for the rich.http://www.statehousereport.com/2017/10/06/federal-program-funding-uninsured/ …
Get rid of trump and bring America back!
You liars Trickle-down Reaganomics help rich & corporations get richer. Care to comment? 95% of Americans would love hear you explain the #s
Since at least 40% of middle class families w/kids will see their taxes RISE while the 1% laugh to the bank, you can keep your tax plan.
GOP is ok with people in PR starving so they can get their $5 TRILLION giving TRUMP $1 BILLION & top 1% at  least $150,000/yr in tax cuts.
Why are you so dishonest?
Avg SC income $42,367 
State tax : 2965.69 ( WHICH GOES AWAY)
Go ahead, tell me what they will save or pay?
What are new tax brackets ?
GOP plan makes the wealthiest Americans richer at the expense of everyone else.  No, thank you!
Republicans don't care about the poor or the middle class.
It has to pass we American vote 4 @realDonaldTrump and his agenda
The fascist GOP thinks this will do it...
So Excited To Do My Taxes In 2017. ..
I mean In 2018. ...Big Plans For My refund
Two chambers and both sides of the aisle!  Now that's American!
#KeepYoMoney   #MyMoneyNotDCs
Same old GOP line for 50 years. Say you love them only, while you are dating 5 others. We listen and believe. You continue to take advantage
What about #trump saying he wants 2 shut down major television networks!
THIS IS REAL NEWS, EVERYONE WATCHED  AND HEARD IT!!!Time 4 amend25!
Corporate taxes bein paid thru Cost is justice; ideas to lower cost & increase profitability are often granted then regretted by employees¿¡
How can we know any of this is true if GOP won't reveal full plan, brackets and all. #taxreform #betweentwochambers
Unless his suggestion is "scrap this garbage plan and start over," I'll pass. #KeepYoLies
Can we start by ensuring that healthcare is affordable & that tax breaks are for hard working families--not the rich?
Senator everything you've tried selling since the Trump presidency  began will hurt the average American.  Simply put - I don't trust you
Need to pay for Calif. Fl, Tx, PR, Vi and infrastructure. Keep the $100 I'd get back and add it to FEMA. No tax cuts for the rich.
Who are you trying fool with this congress or the American people
Here's an idea- vote against trump tax plan!! A vote in favor is putting $$ in hands of the rich
Working families will have LESS money under the GOP plan.  Rich families gain much more. Please make major revisions.
Please cut the GOV and GOV spending.
Back on the  clock?  Great MAGA
Get the result & slap each other on the backs later...So far you r all LOSERS and gave Americans the BIRD. We'll give it back in spades.
What happened to #keepyomoney is that not happening anymore? Just another con... #sadtruth
Trickle down never trickle down it lines rich pockets why are you only !meeting with bankers and business leaders when home  says it all
It's not very difficult.
Just a reminder: trickle down doesn't actually trickle down... #NotOnePenny
