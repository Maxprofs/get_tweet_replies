.@justinamash thanks for sharing Justin
My experience with cops has also sucked...I am just not conditioned to believe that's BECAUSE of my skin color
maybe you don't want to be enlightened. Been with hubs 14 yrs in/around Chicago. Never been pulled over. @SenatorTimScott
I get pulled over all the time but I don't care about anecdotal experiences.  Real data shows police are fair.
It's hard to face the reality, but I believe it's a convo that needs to be had. Goes beyond anecdotes. @SenatorTimScott
no actually it doesn't. You are denying the data because it makes you feel self righteous.  Pathetic to me.
so I am pathetic to you because I disagree? Interesting way to dialogue. Why bother? @SenatorTimScott
blacks are more likely to get mandatory minimums than whites but again not disproportionately to violent crime
let's ask this since police were actively and overtly racist (1950s) what methods were put in place 2 fix
You are emphatically arguing that police are systematically racist.  No statistical evidence of that. Disgraceful.
Check out #JaneElliott Live as a Black man for a week then let's talk about disgraceful! #TDJFiresideChat
if you don't want to look at the data and just want to be emotional then fine and I can't stop you
You offered no evidence (just testimony) and no solutions.  Encounters with the cops suck.  Always have and always will.
If the testimony/life experience of a US
Senator made no impression/promoted You to demand change then...
that's why other Black men don't stand a chance as we have seen! Check out #JaneElliott  Thank God you're not them!
your next speech please address why cops have so much distrust of blacks. Their pain and anguish is real too. 2 way street
I've been pulled over many times. never thought it was for being white or female. A few times, maybe for being young. MX5
What reason did the Officers give you for the stop? Did they have hand on gun/gun aimed at you? #JaneElliottl
One week later, they arrested the Latino woman who looked like me in same make/model/color car. Good job!
@YouTube something must be done about that as well we need the police to do their job without abusing their power
@YouTube having said that enemies of freedom and capitalism are using this to create chaos in our big cities
.@SenatorTimScott NOW my wish is for Sen #TimScott to speakout on the deafening silence of #BlackRepublicans in general on this topic. #blm
Great point! The opportunity to show some leadership in the GOP is knocking! If they won't we will! #DemVote
@YouTube what's not being said about this is that police are not just abusing the blacks they ate doing it to all races
@YouTube ages genders ect. They dont discriminate. They call this job security something must be done
@YouTube black republican from south Carolina
Thank you Senator
anyone that hyphens AMERICAN with another word in front of it, is not a TRUE AMERICAN. R U UP for reelection?
@YouTube I know certain things cops are taught in the academy. One is "dirty car, dirty driver". Poor ppl get f'ed with imo
@timkaine we all will watch everyone we love die and they will watch us die.
thank you for sharing your personal experiences.  I hope it creates the discussion that we need
70 minutes of Hillary Clinton lies!!!!! https://youtu.be/4uT68riwrFI  via @YouTube
Well done Senator Scott...respect your experiences and feelings toward vast majority of law enforcement officers.  I agree.
@YouTube. Pleased that you are our Senator. Thought provoking speech.
good luck with getting your side to notice a long festered problem. Meanwhile #PhilandoCastile 's 4 yr old buried dad 2day

THIS HAS HAPPEND 4 YRS & NON OF THESE POLITICIANS SPOKE UP UNTIL BLKLIVESMATTER SOCIAL MOVEMENT Y
Thank you for your strength,courage & integrity!
There is no racism. There is only lack of responsibility & accountability. The Police r Heroes. Get a job& stop complaining
u just fueled the fire even more, so no I don't like ur speech. I don't see color until u tell me what color you are
Bullshit. Are u color blind? U didn't notice @SenatorTimScott is black? Pres Obama, Colin Powell or Condi Rice?
Also black!
I saw scotts color cause he told me what color he was, obozo isn't black, his a mulatto!
going on in todays time, do u think that maybe the BLM might have caused some of this, or maybe the president with words
do u really think u did any good here w this speech, it sounds like ur promoting the BLM, u should be looking at what is
thank you, for you convicting words.
Thank you for showing true leadership and hope.
You DO know that @realDonaldTrump is the nominee of your party? Empathize w/your pain, but Don won't make things better!
Powerful words! Wish you didn't discriminate against #gays #nonchristian #poor https://www.scott.senate.gov/legislative-work … #RadicalChristianity
@TGowdySC @CNN @FoxNews @BarackObama SHOULD speak so passionately as @SenatorTimScott Honesty that transcends color to healing humanity.
@YouTube 
 I have always made some mistake that initiated probable cause (I.e. human error). I can't believe your stories.
@YouTube 
Mr. Scott, but I have had my share of encounters with law enforcement (some with black friends in the car)... 1/2
I don't live in South Carolina but hope to vote for you some day. Thanks for sharing.
@YouTube You are a brilliant man. Keep up the great work
@SenatorTimScott @timkaine
Excellent speech, and a necessary one! Thank you for sharing your personal experiences and using your position for good!
Amen!
Moved me to tears
It's about constitutional rights. Not color. These same guys are for a police state until something happens to them.
Thanks for sharing Tim!
i wish people see how smart i am and not as a disabled person.
@YouTube  Powerfully and eloquently put Senator! Together WE must make #SocialChangeSocialJustice a reality!
I'm very proud of my Senator! Well done sir!
.@SenatorTimScott
thank you for speaking out, Senator, and sharing your experience. I pray it doesn't fall on deaf ears.
@CapehartJ Have friends this happens to regularly.Middle-class suburb;middle-management & teacher; 50's. #DrivingWhileBlack
Thank you for your fantastic speech and speaking the truth. #BlackLivesMatter
. @SenatorTimScott @DocWashburn
@CapehartJ @YouTube Just read the responses to this video.
@CapehartJ @YouTube Sorry, but your senate colleagues and voters don't believe your life matters either. #republicantruths
Generalize much? I'm 1 of his voters & I'm white. I have a lot of respect for @SenatorTimScott & shockingly, I care..@CapehartJ
If it doesn't apply let it fly. However, whether you believe ALL Black Lives Matter is the point
I'm not up on the hip slang, so not sure what flying has to do with anything. U don't know me so..
@SenatorTimScott @CapehartJ
Bahaha! "Hip slang"???!!! Well bless your heart, you just proved my point. Have a nice day. Bye!
I suppose I should have add (sarc) but there aren't enough characters.
Sadly your bias is showing.  @SenatorTimScott @CapehartJ
@goldietaylor there is still a segment of the population who will not believe the Senator. Need I say which segment.
why do you stay in a party that promotes division and hate? POC are being harmed,greenlighted by your party. WTF
our society has lost touch with our neighbor.the rt worries bout their rights the lft lets the govt do it.u r n my prayers
So disappointed in you. Why assume an officer saying he doesn't recognize you is racist?
Heard that Sir. I'm shocked u said. But much appreciated.  It's a start. Now pass some Laws. like it's an epidemic
Thank U for this speech.Sharing ur experiences publicly is hard to do,but it's a necessity to help facilitate understanding
Thank you @SenatorTimScott for your leadership on this issue! @YouTube
You never-----see women police killing unarmed people

Explain this http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/5949982/1/ …
@YouTube Very touching sir. Thank you.
@ali yeah dem cops feel no pain coz dey ain't human right? Y'all dividin us more.
If you expect empathy from your Republican peers, you're in the wrong party, Senator. @nycsouthpaw
thank you Sir for your honesty. we need to speak to the broader issue of criminal justice reform to alter some of this

Thank you sir
@justinamash Senator, thank you for your truthful and heartfelt comments. You advance the ball w those comments .
oops, you're black. Unlike all of your colleagues.
Sir, deep respect for you and your message.  Let's all work together to make things better.
@YouTube Thanks for speaking from the heart and sharing your personal experiences
An absolutely moving speech about your personal experiences that all should view. Thanks and I look forward to speech #3.
Brilliant speech. Good for you. I hope it works.
Such simple but so #eloquent words strip the issue bare! Who is qualified to judge another w/o walking in his shoes but God
Powerful speech, Senator.  Thank u 4 sharing.  Much 2 ponder 4 me; I look 4ward 2 your solutions speech.
I hate to say it, but The dialogue of race relationship is going to be very difficult at best and impossible at worse.
So after your poignant words, I find myself wishing the ppl who profiled u were seated right in front of u for this speech.
to hear your words, to see the man you are & to feel a sense of shame.
ur kidding me aren't u? do u think that those cops pulling him over, CHANGED HIM to go straight!? u sir r the shame
Your brains have leaked out of your shell. Fuck off, nobody.
U FUCK OFF!!! u weren't born with any brains...or your brain dead.  must be a democrat, or liberal, or one of those lazy legislators
Thank you sir for sharing your experience. This speech needs to be shared.
Thank you so much for sharing your experiences. We need to hear these stories.
Thank you @SenatorTimScott for using your voice to help others hear that we have a problem.
there is no problem, only ignorant liberals
Not to disregard, but check perspective. I don't speed, drink, or give pd a reason. Yet, I also get stopped sometimes.
Okay...try to not think about yourself and view it as 40million similar stories.
This is eye opening. This should be the model for our national discussion on race. Thank you senator.
If this is leading up to your supporting a national police force, many of us will be deeply disappointed.
he said government isn't the answer to every problem
I agree!
Watch @SenatorTimScott "Just because you do not feel the pain, the anguish of another, doesn't mean it doesn't exist
Like the Lubavitcher Rebbe said we should empathize with others the way a mother is in pain when her baby teethes.
