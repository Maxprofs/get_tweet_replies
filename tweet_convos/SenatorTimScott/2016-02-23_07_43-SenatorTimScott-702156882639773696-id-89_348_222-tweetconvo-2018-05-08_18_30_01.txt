@JohnLaprise @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @filterednews Why, do you think, he wants them on #AmericanSoil. He is strategically placing them!
@AngelaTN777 @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @filterednews yeah...not much
@SenatorTimScott @conservativeoki @WhiteHouse Americans are still overwhelmingly against this, POTUS still pushing it. "Will of the ppl?" 
@elainebatt3 @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse I agree, will of the people? Hasn't been that way for seven years, why would it change now?
@conservativeoki @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse This whole issue is pure ideology. No substantive reason to do it except he wants to.
@elainebatt3 @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Yes and this is not good AT ALL for the country!
@SenatorTimScott @RNRNewMexico @WhiteHouse Obama is building recruitment centers in our prisons organizing of the Muslim.God help the bulls
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Excuse me Senator, but has anyone polled the W.H. To see if they care?
@SenatorTimScott @TamiDurling @WhiteHouse @rlockrocks SC &NC Senators has to change from do nothing Senators collecting pay checks.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse If I didn't know better, I'd think @POTUS were, like, pro-terrorist or something. 
Maybe terrorist-lite.
How about if we retrofit an old naval vessel and keep them off shore

@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse

@mdcolliM Why work w bad proposals? He made stupid promise,he's more interested in ideology than safety. @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse
@NewEnglandDevil Absurd...Actually it is the opposite. Having Gitmo open makes America less safe.  @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse
@mdcolliM @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Foolish. There's reason noone will take these evil men on their soil. Bringing them to US inc release
@mdcolliM @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse increases chances they will be legally released.
@NewEnglandDevil @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Provide the stats.We are talking terrorists.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Oh no! That is insane!
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Oh man, that is close to a school! I sure hope the terrorists don't get a hold of any guns. #save the children
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse but not near the politicians who represent the people of the US?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @GA4Rubio Bringing them to a less secure area will most certainly motivate terrorists to come as well.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Why feign such outrage when you know congress won't do anything about it? @TGowdySC @congressdotgov
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Yeh well, the way the sell-out congress operates, I'm sure this will be allowed.  @TGowdySC @GOPoversight
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse And 10 Miles from My Home, where my wife lives, my children play, Where is Tattaglia?

@SenatorTimScott @NetworksManager @WhiteHouse when is the last time a terrorist got out of a US prison? Stop with scare tactics
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @NetworksManager Keep supporting Rubio, it will come buckwheat.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse I say bring them on. Put them in general population.  We won't be feeding them within a month.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse ......put up tents on the North Lawn of the WH....so he can give them hugs,milk and cookies at night
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse demand they go to Alcatraz! It's the perfect location! #guantanamo
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse so was Dylann Roof
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC Why is this even a question? U passed a bill blocking transfers. Or is obama gonna ignore that law too?
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse In other words, #GuantanamoOnMain.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC I served on that base. Terrible location. Does the @WhiteHouse have Google maps?
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Congress has done little to stop BO. What are you going to do about this?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio  This is absolutely ridiculous.... Homeland Security anyone?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse OMG...you people will believe anything you're told.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Establishment endorcement negates the opportunity for my VOTE!! I'M SICK OF THE HOLLOW EMPTY PROMISES
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse if detainees are brought to America who knows weather our school kids will be held for ransom someday
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse One candidate is able to drive MSM dialogue. #Trump 2016
Immigration..Muslims..vets..trade..
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC. And near my house but it doesn't bother me. Close Gitmo!
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Keep GITMO open & throw all pedophiles & terrorist's in there together, TAX DOLLARS WELL SPENT.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Disgusting!
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse And the gop led congress will do nothing as usual.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Obama will do what he wants until someone stops him.That person will be able to drive MSM narrative.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Chicago sounds like a better location
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse So what will you do?
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse send them to Chicago
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse keep'em in Cuba Tim!
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse ..Obama simply does not care about the wishes/safety of Charleston area voters nor the value of Good Sense.
@SenatorTimScott My"brave Americans", THE AFGHANS ARE COMING, hide under our beds guns in hand @WhiteHouse
The location @WhiteHouse is looking at in South Carolina is within five miles of a dozen schools, multiple neighborhoods. #Guantanamo
@SenatorTimScott @redostoneage @WhiteHouse At least Rubio & Schumer's amnesty plan would've made them legal.
@SenatorTimScott @SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse STOP OBAMA'S Insanity! Keep Gitmo open!
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Then how about you Republicans stop Obama instead of running around stumping with GOPe boy wonder Rubio?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Marshall Service runs Fed jail in DC. DC a Federal Reservation not a State.
@SenatorTimScott. What could go wrong? 
@SenatorTimScott where is it?
@SenatorTimScott What are you AFRAID of Senator? If you're SCARED, say you're SCARED. Don't project your FEAR on the rest of us @WhiteHouse
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse uphold the law and Act like an American. You have guns, protect YoUR  family. They be in a Max Sec. JAIL
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Can you stop this?
@SenatorTimScott yet you support SC being invaded by illegals/refugees and having @realDonaldTrump banned in election studies in our schools
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse oh hell no. Why don't they put them in alcatraz?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse why is there a prison there in the first place?
@SenatorTimScott Come Tim Scott the naval weapon station is a good location ,that would save the United States a lot of money
@SenatorTimScott  We, the people, have had it with Obama!  Why does no one do anything to stop him?!?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse They're terrorists. No different from any other criminal in prison 5 miles away. They aren't super-villains.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Another example of the White House creating new problems in exchange for a nonexistent problem.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse I want the names of those countries Obama mentioned that is affected by us keeping our country safe!!
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse then it's up to you & Congress to do something to stop Obama. Duh. Helpless much?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse stop him!
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse DO NOT invite those animals inside our borders. its is obama's agenda. Stop it quickly.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse You have to be kidding me. How about he locate them next to where HE plans to live AFTER he's out of the W.H.?
