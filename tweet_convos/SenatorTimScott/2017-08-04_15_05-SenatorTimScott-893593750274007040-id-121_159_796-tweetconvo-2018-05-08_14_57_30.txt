Thank you!!!!!
South Carolina residents are proud of you Tim Scott.
The people he should be self identifying with are embarrassed by him.
If you build a wall, this is part of what you'll be killing.
Would love to see you focus on something that can actually benefit people in SC. Remember, you're supposed to represent us @SenatorTimScott
I'm proud to claim Tim Scott as my Senator, wish I could feel the same way about the RINO, Lindsey Graham.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. GOP has done nothing - except support DJT.
It ridiculous that the GOP has to sponsor a bill to force the liberals to enforce existing law. It's a sorry state of affairs thanks leftist
Thank you!
We need to fix broken illegal immigration problem. Please support family based legal immigration & don't allow to attack legal immigrants.
Thank you,  Senator. #SCVoter
PROUD? The wildlife affected by potential border wall #noWall
Boo hoo
The things you two are proud of are truly terrifying! You are merely aiding and abetting Putin's puppet! May you go down with him.
Need to look at Anwan & Debbie of DNC for leaks during election
We know for sure your president was lying and Mexico will never  pay for his ridiculous wall.  I wonder if any Russian $ is in your pockets.

Thanks Senator Scott! When you're done with those who bought you, we on the ground could really use some healthcare and infrastructure.
Rereading this, I saw a horrible alternate interpretation. I meant that your *vote* is bought. I apologize if I seemed to mean otherwise.
Very disappointed in this sir
Thank you for putting America first
We have to pay for this! Really is there anyone in Washington that has two brain cells that work.
We need to have actual borders...yes, even if we end up paying. We can use the money that we will save from withdrawing from climate accord!
If Sanctuary cities would police themselves...
Thank you for your support of our PRESIDENT agenda. Sad that other republicans put their own agenda over the American people.
yall are bad at yr jobs
"proud co-sponsor of state-sanctioned racism, xenophobia, and the police brutality they co-create"
Joe Wilson had the audacity to tell POTUS "YOU LIE" during SOTU address. Tim you are learning from DT that lying works.
Wow. Local paper retweeting propaganda?
@SenatorTimScott just know we SC voters will hold you accountable for failing to represent us. #voter
WWJD?
Remind you of anyone? 
@EPN and MEXICO is paying for the WALL!! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS promised and said so!! USA is not paying for the beautiful WALL
You're just a rubber stamp for #trump policies... have you no shame?!
Are you both supporting the Cotton- Perdue bill?
Hmm. Not sure why the heck I'm following you...
Why is it enforcing existing laws are priority number one when it's immigration but priority never when its education #autism #dyslexia
YES!!!!!!!
Why are you on the wrong side of EVERYTHING.
You don't read the comments do you @SenatorTimScott ?  Nothing you say matters.  You are Trump's lackey.  Nothing more.
Don't spend our money on a wall!
sending law abiding parents back  their children as orphans and the financial responsibility of the government
Forget the wall! Forget the immigration non-issue! Forget repeal & replace. Fix the ACA & move away from crazy Trump! Represent SC! #SCvoter
I was just going to compliment you on opposing Trump's tax reform but NOW THIS? You have a lot to prove after your  DeVos lunacy. #SCVoter
I am a great fan of yours, Sen Scott. U r so smart with common sense
Any comments on your boss being investigated by a grand jury?
#Healthcare Homeless students, how about focusing on SC's future? http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/2016/12/21/student-homelessness-increases-sc-nation/95698370/ … #KeepKidsCovered
Thanks Sen Scott!  I hope @LindseyGrahamSC will support as well.
Hold sanctuary cities accountable for what? Having lower crime rates?
Thank you, sir.  Blessings to you.
Such a poor representative of the people....
@SenatorTimScott has taken at least $10,800 from Russian connected Access Industries, Inc.

You've got this all wrong, Senator.  Improve ACA. Protect at-risk constituents. Demand accountability from WH - Russia.  Have a town hall.
EXACTLY!!
Accountability:
"Tim Scott puts your campaign donations into his own pockets"

http://www.dordems.org/dcdps-blog-page/tim-scott-puts-your-campaign-donations-into-his-own-pockets …

so you too support hateful and useless legislation
I would be proud to attend your town hall in Columbia SC when you schedule it!!!
How about Greenville?  And we're TRUE Republicans and WE VOTE!
Man you are being used like a tool. Wake up
We voted for Trump, we voted for a wall. Not a virtual wall where more illegals can come in.



Spare a thought today for the million kids in Yemen starving and afflicted by polio and cholera

https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/ … Everyone!! Blow up this article with likes/retweets!!!! This is what Putin wants to turn the US into!!! #TrumpRussia
Thank you, Senator Scott!
FOR WHAT??
But border crossings are down 75% right?  Oh, that would be because of Obama's policies so must go...got it
3 steps that address symptoms, not cause. Focus needs to shift toward revising legal immigration.
And enforcing labor laws. That's the cause.
So let's make high Tech manufacturers rich.  General Kelly has said,what made him effective was working with Mexico. People not toys.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @tedcruz @RepKevinBrady @SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse @POTUS   Senator Scott, U mean that wall DJT was going to get
the Mexicans to pay for, but not really according to conversation with President Nieto
And we'd love to see any facts or evidence to back your claims that it will do any of the things that you PROMISE they will do.
He will not reply since he never replies or faces his constituents!!  Riding Trump's coattail?
Making a non-issue sound so important. How about enforcing the law re #TrumpRussiaCollusion & improve #ACA#HealthCare & fix #infrastructure?
Nope. I have MS and emailed him about the ACA. Got a bs reply about why it needs to be repealed/replaced, even though the GOP has no plan.
Thank you
Open your eyes, ears, and brain, please!!
John when you have your next Town Hall why don't you invite Clara?
This is Clara Crawford. She's 86, and she spends her summer making sure poor kids get at least one full meal a day. http://trib.it/2weLbyU  
YOU WOULD BE PROUD OF THAT- WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED - TELL TRUMP TO FUND THE AFFORDABLE HEATH CARE LIKE THE EXISTING LAW SAYS -
Then you are as useless as he is. Photo ops, donor meetings, sucking up to Dolt45 are his to do list. I guess yours too. #kakistocracy
Senator Tim Scott you are a great man you will always have my vote
It wont pass
DPRK:  USSR:  TRUMPF:.•°•. 
Wait, @realDonaldTrump said border crossings were down 75%? Porous? Doesn't jive JC, Tim. Just more of the same from you tow.
#Impeach
He also told the Mexican President that the wall was the least important issue.
It's almost like he already built it!
So, when should we expect massive fines and/or jail time for businesses that employ undocumented workers? Oh, you meant pick which laws...
Yes, we should focus on the employers: make it cost-prohibitive to employ people in the country illegally, and jail egregious offenders.
And yet, only poor workers are targeted while people make outrageous profits utilizing them. Congress is bought.
Well, they are breaking the law by being here.  However, we should target employers also (not instead of).
We are going after users instead of dealers. Companies pay to bring them in illegally. They profit and people suffer. Wages are depressed.
Only question now is will republicans have the balls to vote in anything or tou just going to keep kicking the can?  Pass healthcare.
Sad, as none of those are truly pressing issues. Universal healthcare? Higher education? The future of work and employment. Those are it.
Actually, border security and #immigration enforcement is a critical issue that needs to be addressed ASAP!
John is full of it & Texans (the smart ones) are embarrassed by his brown nosing at our expense.  Houston is THE CAPITOL of sanctuaries.

CONGRESS,SUBPOENA ALL AMERICAN'S WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP OR STOP RUSSIAN WITCH HUNT

NO WALL
In spite of law enforcement's views. Between JC and the corrupt, fake religious @TexasGOP we will resemble a third world country soon.

Meanwhile crops are rotting in SC fields and farm hand labor is nonexistent.
