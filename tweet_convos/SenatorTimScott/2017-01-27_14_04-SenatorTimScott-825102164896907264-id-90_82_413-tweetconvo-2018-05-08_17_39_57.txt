What about JEWS? Do you remember JEWS on Holocaust Remembrance Day?
I'm curious @SenatorTimScott, what is your position on the #MuslimBan ? As a constituent, I'm waiting. History is watching.
I would like an answer as I am one of your constituent as well. Be american1st,GOP 2nd
yet you remain silent in support of Muslim ban and deportation. Shame!
never again means #notosessions
See the irony of remembering the holocaust and ignoring what is happening today? Speak out against the immigration ban!
I applaud your questioning of the immigration ban. You hedged but spoke out. Bravo!
now is not the time to remain silent.  History will judge you.  #NoBanNoWall
If love is going to overcome hate, it's going to have to open its mouth. Your silence on the #MuslimBan is deafening.
.@SenatorTimScott Your constituents are asking, you and @LindseyGrahamSC are silent. Where is outrage over Trump's unconstitutional actions?
you say never again as the POTUS bans Muslims and refugees. Where is your voice now? You cannot remain silent.
you can't say 'never again' and not speak out against the #refugeeban #nomuslimban #hypocrisy
Does this mean you will oppose the travel ban from select Muslim countries and provide a safe harbor for Syrian refugees?
Hypocrite.
but your prez wouldn't acknowledge you should acknowledge his wack nominees #NOTODEVOS
can't prove that by those cabinet nominees
more like #again since you voted silent on  #Muslimban. Legal SC resident Nazanin Zinouri cant get back to US #notarefugee
And then POTUS signed an ill thought out EO that makes our country less safe and is rooted in hate and you remained silent!
Please vote against Betsy Devos on Tuesday!! From a retired SC teacher.
love over comes hate. Speak out against the Muslim ban which puts our neighbors at risk. It's the Christian thing to do.
.@SenatorTimScott Whose side are you on? Don't be silent! - A Veteran 
#MuslimBan #TheResitance
where is your outrage for ban on refugees then???? #neveragain
Senator Scott, please join @LindseyGrahamSC in speaking out against this insane man blocking refugees from our country.
With these sentiments in mind,what about bringing Nazanin Zinouri home? Pls speak out vs. Muslim ban and Banon on Sec Coun.
where's your statement? #neveragain are pretty words. Now back them up.
except for muslims?
May this constituent ask for your thoughts on the #travelban ?
Wow, how much did you charge for your soul? It's happening again today! No to muslim ban, no to Davos, no to Bannon.
please stand on the right side of history and speak out against the #MuslimBan
As you and your other @GOP reps remain silent the world is watching. #NeverAgain is happening....what are YOU going to do?
great sentiment. Would you now say something loving about the refugee bans and the Muslim travel ban?
What you choose to say (or not say) today will be remembered. Please stand up against this unconstitutional #MuslimBan
Seriously?As your president orders a ban on Muslims? Hypocrite!
Will you stand up for today's refugees and immigrants? #NoMuslimBan #NoBanNoWall #RefugeesWelcome  #stopdiscrimination @SenatorTimScott
#NeverAgain was happening again, TODAY! Where were you, sir, as this data scientist from Clemson couldn't return home?


And yet you remain silent. Shame on you
And today you endorse banning refugees!
how do we honor them by closing our borders to the same type of people?!
never again? do you even know what's happening in the world? your terrible. won't get my vote next re-election
At one point you argued in favor of religious freedom @SenatorTimScott. Now you & GOP are complicit in #muslimban.
RT @thehill: Opinion: Government should protect, not assault our religious freedom (by @RepTimScott) http://bit.ly/zYEUQB  #religion #freedom
Never again? It's happening now. Do not stay quiet. You're future voters are watching you.
Appreciate the tweet, now take some action to actually make sure #NeverAgain. Make your state proud.
But banning Muslims on the anniverssary is okay?!
please help her or her dog. She was trying to get to Clemson.  https://www.facebook.com/nazanin.zinouri/posts/10202859584807567 …
your silence on the #muslimban speaks volumes for your hypocrisy and cowardice.
Spare me! How can you say #neveragain when u support a madman  for President. Do something now. #ImmigrantsWelcome
amd then we ban Muslims
#neveragain, yet silent on Trumps Muslim ban. Shame on you
Yet, you never initiated a Kindertransport to rescue children, supported Muslim ban. 
I hope you're serious about #neveragain - looking forward to hearing your opposition to Trump's new EO.
#RefugeeBan pretty #ironic #SpeakTruthToPower
Paz Con Amor Y Amor Con Paz, Es La Salvacion De La Humanidad Ante La Existencia De Tanta Malvada Calamidad Llena De Maldad
Unless Your Muslim though #NeverAgain #RefugeesWelcome #StopTheMuslimBan
you can help love overcome hate by listening to constituents who are appalled by Trump's ban on immigrants!
Actions speak louder than words. As your constituent, I am disgusted that you are affiliated with Trump, & his actions.
we need your voice and leadership.  Stand up against Trump.  stand up!!!!!
.@SenatorTimScott And now we ban more refugees so that they can endure another holocaust. Shame on you. #MuslimBan
yet we're banning refugees from entering our country. Don't forget our history of turning refugees away. Help us do better.
I'll believe it when you speak out about the imposed Muslim ban and discrimination against those who are not Christian.
Are we honestly marking that legacy by banning refugees?? Horrific!! You must speak out on this!! Matthew 25:35-46
Well said. This is a nice sentiment, though your actions to ensure #NeverAgain speak louder than these words.
if you really want "#NeverAgain" to mean something, pls condemn Trump's cruel, religious-based refugee ban EO
Yet you say zero when @POTUS issues religious discrim. EO blocking refugee entry. USA did that to Jewish refugees in WW2.
Donald Trump has banned Syrian refugees on Holocaust Memorial Day. Hitler 2.0 must be stopped! #ImpeachTrump
Tim in 8 years from now @SpeakerRyan will be POTUS 2026 I need you to be ready for a cabinet job @jasoninthehouse SPEAKER
I hope you remember this if the Muslim ban becomes a reality. #NeverAgain
wish you would tell your president.
Trump loves Hate, Love Trumps hate!  #InternationalHolocaustRemembranceDay #noh8
@postandcourier you should be pro-life not just pro-birth

love win EVERYTIME!! #godslove
Respectfully, sir. Holocaust Remembrance Day is about a specific people & it was good men with guns who overcame hatred.
more accurately, overwhelming firepower overcomes hate after hate slaughters millions of Jews and others. #RefugeesWelcome
