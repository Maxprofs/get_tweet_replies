Please explain how repealing the estate tax helps lower/middle class families, since they will never reach the gift tax exclusion limit.
Dad leaves you his property when he's gone. He's paid the taxes on said property. Why should you pay the tax again?
Unless the property is worth approx. $5.5 mil ($11 mil if married), it already passes tax free through lifetime gift exemption. (1/2)
The proposed rule only helps if u have over $5 mil. @ death. That's why I was asking the Senator how this helps middle/lower income folks.
There are small businesses that get by, that can be saved if they do away w/death tax.
Then (maybe) it would go through probate and be subject to estate tax. Very very few, if any, businesses of that size r structured that way
Because of the incredibly high personal liability the owner would be subject to while alive. I'm not saying eliminating the death tax would
Not help anyone, I'm just not convinced it would be a net positive for the working class in the same way it set is for the very affluent
So why is the lowest tax bracket being raised from 10% to 12%?  Isn't that the rate paid by those very people?
Lol, politicians being politicians... 
From the greek roots:

Poly (many) tick (blood suckers) 

( Trust nobody! )
Well said, my friend
You may think that a blitz of tweets will overwhelm the truth but we know you are lying and you plan will only help the rich!
shame
With all of your resources find someone to create a marketing plan that overcomes the lame Democratic disinformation efforts and sell it.


#KeepYoMoney #LostYoDignity 
@SenatorTimScott don't let trump demean you
If the top bracket comes down two percent and the bottom bracket goes up two percent, who ACTUALLY #KeepYoMoney ?
Holy crap 
You need to work together to pass something! Anything!
This does not make sense.
White House 'can't guarantee' middle class won't pay higher taxes. http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/white-house-cant-guarantee-middle-class-wont-pay-more.html …

So, this is going well. 
sure... let's see if the president's plan actually makes that happen. So far it seems it's more about #richpeoplekeeptheirmoney
How about rebuilding the nation, Fla. Tx. PR, VI and infrastructure. This will create jobs and good paying jobs.
Uh, this Tax Reform does none of that.
Really? #keepyomoney??
"Offshoring funds", "tax havens", "shell companies", "corporate welfare cheats"..say it, Tim , say it!
Congress big business get a pay raise the middle class takes it in the butt so b happy the almighty rich have spoken
Tim at least be honest. It's also about giving huge tax cuts to your donors. It's more about donors & less about ppl. Don't become Paul Ryan
#TaxReform rip-off: No personal exemptions, bottom rates upped, taxes 401K, workers pay 2X investors, pass-thru scam
How much more? Be specific. Drop in the bucket compared to what rich & corporations will get. Speaking of Moore: http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/27/roy-moore-senate-republicans-no-comment-243220 …
Tackle hard choices and work together
Then lower tax to 23% and keep healthcare deduction. Some families have significant Medication and treatment expenses.
Tim Scott you're the best!
Doing an excellent job, Sir!
You are awesome! #KeepYoMoney
By Yo, he means YoMultinationalCorporations.
also  trump mentioned  he use tax loopholes  for he tax's 2016 Hillary and trump debate  .
Just wait until you see how 45 use the tax loopholes for his benefit &family. Funny was no mention on removing it.
Great ! Now do heathcare reform
Where are the women senators?! Yeah, I thought so.
By cutting #SocialSecurity so families can keep working longer & wealthy @GOP can prosper & live GREAT American life! #NoPOTUStaxesNOreform
#TaxReform is about anything but helping #American families.  Great for Corporations, though...
:massive eye roll:
Support our President.
He does. He's one of the few.
Trump ATTACKED every demographic except rich white males:hateful rhetoric and heinous policies. NO TAX REFORM TIL @POTUS SHOWS TAX RETURNS
FAKE & FRAUD  WHEEL OF CONGRESS & SENATE
#TaxReform is about helping American families living paycheck to paycheck bring more money home. #KeepYoMoney
16th Amendment was never legally ratified, the constitution says that paying income tax is Voluntary & I have video of congress saying it. 
About time!!! Show America that your done being a socialist government and taking more than you need!!!
Unfortunately when GOP wants to help it is to save poor $100, middle $1000 & rich $1000000000 #NotaxCuts4Rich
You're being too generous - I bet the middle class sees about $400, sad!

There would be no tax loopholes either. 15% is 15%. Tired of poor people wanting rich people's money. That IS NOT the American way.
Wait for it, wait for it ;-)
Help Me Please!!!!
Are you a giant corporation or billionaire? @SenatorTimScott would be happy to help.
@FairTaxOfficial  Also need spending reform #LessSpending
Cut entitlements. NO entitlements to illegal aliens!! Please! We could save billions there.
You’ve got to be kidding....
Many white guys & a white woman putting Uncle Tim up front. Ya think repealing Estate Tax will help all the folks in SC that look like him?
Being pretty racist, I'd say!
enough with all the empty promises from washington. done with ya'll.
i heard the pres. talk about all these tax cuts we're going to make yet we are trillions in debt told we r paying for a wall mexico was.
can think of alot of tax reform besides cutting only corp taxes to 20% leaving mine at 35% wno deductions or asking the wealth to decline ss
maybe just maybe washington could give us non married childless ppl a tax break for once. raise min. wages so ppl can get off welfare.
you know what senator? believe it or not single folks pay a tremendous amount of taxes & do not have child deductions to reduce out taxes.
Ensure this is transparent to ensure you are fattening your own pocket and not a cover up.
If you guys don't speak up now, these gun toting, minority insulting, public cursing types like Trump, Roy Moore & Steve Bannon will ruin us
Will it be a bipartisan solution?
I hope that's what the details reveal once we get them. Often, that's been the rhetoric but not the reality on #TaxReform .
Federal Government has grown out of control. How many Intelligence agencies? + FBI DEA TSA DHS INS....mostly administrators. Duplication
Pass a law for a National Language. How much money is wasted printing Everything in multiple languages. Super easy money savings.
No one believes that
