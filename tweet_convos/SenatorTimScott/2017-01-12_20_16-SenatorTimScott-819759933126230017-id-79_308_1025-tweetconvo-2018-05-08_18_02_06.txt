Look how cute you guys are while you plot to steal my family's health care.
Aw, you have to pay a fair share like the rest of us. Must be hard on you.
aw someone's okay with taking the outcome of other people's hard work
Everyone works hard. Some of us are American enough to look out for others.
Uh oh. Sounds like somebody needs a safe place and a floor mat and a nap.
The same old catchphrases & middle school insults from a Trumpie. Unoriginal & pathetic. Read a book.
Now I feel bad. I didnt you needed a bedtime story as well. What book shall I read to you snowflake?

Premiums are increasing, patients’ choices are dwindling, & 28 million Americans remain uninsured: http://buff.ly/2j4QHhg  #RepealObamacare
Almost 50 thousand lost their coverage in AR and cant afford policies in ACA
Lost my plan because we make $100 a mo too much for AR plans.
In ACA exchange lowest prem had $13,000 deduct. Better plan prem. was $745 mo
Private plans are expensive here are as bad
Senator, pray you look out for the least of them like Jesus's did.
Where did Jesus tell us to use govt to force our neighbors to help the poor? @WillieJamesBlu2 @SenatorTimScott @SpeakerRyan
No where.
The awesome power of the love of God.
Jesus said when you have done it unto the least of them.
Yup. The children. Not full grown adults. Read the book. The least of these includes the unborn.
I agree with you on the unborn.
Then let's start there and worry about government welfare/healthcare after we stop killing 684,740 black babies per yr.
Now back to taking away health care for 20 million
nonce behaviour

A little dab'll do ya!
Looks like he having a seizure.
ANSWER ME! does ur mama know u want to strip babies of healthcare??? have some fucking respect
Cute , if you weren't plotting to kill thousands of Americans to save money for rich people
Everyone else in this photo is seconds away from exploding into pure cringe
It's a GOP thing. It's like fight club, so I can't explain it to you.
Make no mistake, Reagan definitely would've dabbed.
And may well have stolen our healthcare, too.
dab on em, dab on em

dab on em, dab on em

condemn your base to death like UNNNNNGH

and dab on em, dab on em
ABSOLUTE #trash. The both of you. Such a simple-minded sellout, Scott. But why? #Selfhate "Bruh"?
no. this isn't a time to be cute while you gut America.
Dabbing while taking healthcare.
How as a Black man did you manage to dab worse than Doby “@SenatorTimScott Pretty good dab @SpeakerRyan - I got you ”

At least you're enjoying yourselves while ensuring the deaths of thousands of Americans in need.
Do you believe in womb baby killing?
Womb baby killing?  What are you, 5?  It's called abortion, and having worked in OB/GYN, yes
It's also, More accurately, called murder of a baby in the womb. Need a safe place yet? Too bad.
I feel perfectly safe.  It's funny that you think you're intimidating. Also, zygote =/= baby
Intimidating? Do u understand "safe place"? Nothing 2 do with intimidation from me. It's offense of ur protected world view.
Yeah moron, I get it.  And I don't feel like I need to be protected from any information, or you.  Proceed.
the bemused girl in the back 
That so last year. #DabbingAwayHealthCare #Way2Go

Dabbing still a thing? GOP always trying to take us back!
'elections have consequences', dab on em
You people are pathetic. No one laughing now that you're killing the ACA.
Dabbing at taking away care from people with cancer? Shame
@WillGalloway_ I wish Massachusetts US Senators were this cool :/
Nero dabbed while Rome burned
it's the new mark of incompetence. And it's self inflicted.
Posts the single best one-word reply in Twitter history, and sets the standard for GOP dabbing--both in the same week!
ok guys, enough of this. Let's get serious
what is meaning behind the dab?  I don't get it
We were supposed to leave this in 2016...
@Kurt_Solo @colbyb3rg @Chafe16
Why are you so determined to kill your constituents? Please keep your hands off our healthcare! #SaveACA
nothing is "yours" if its paid for with someone else's money
Plate guy: And this is why the rest of the world hates us.
@my1voice56 Hey @CameronNewton didn't realize #MYQB was into politics. U got'em dabbing in DC & at SC Capitol
Stop appropriating the most stupid of pop culture. Stick with doing your job competently.
Ghetto, smh
Just as wearing pants around ankles reveals where a##holes R, dabbing exposes who has head buried in up ars.
cease this faggotry
*Gochoo
good job!!!
you guys need to stop. Seriously. The entire world is watching while you act like clowns.
For the good of the nation this madness must end

@jhseher @SpeakerRyan stop this
SC loves Tim Scott!!! Lyndsey Graham not so much 
Seriously? Celebrating my murder and the murder of many other Americans who depend on ACA to live? Shame!!

Celebrating while taking away the people's health insurance with ZERO replacement in place? Reprehensible! Answer that!

Goodness gracious! Hope you were not choking here, just sneezing.
Glad you are having a good time while you take healthcare away from Poor children. C.H.I.P. remember?
I'm a big fan of yours Mr. Scott!
Do you Dab once for every mother that can't buy her cancer drugs? May need to bundle into 1 dab per hundreds
@JakeGBlum @SpeakerRyan 
oh no.....look what you've started Ryan.
you look stupid dapping for massa who's about to take away healthcare from millions.
I don't quite think you understand what dapping is.
