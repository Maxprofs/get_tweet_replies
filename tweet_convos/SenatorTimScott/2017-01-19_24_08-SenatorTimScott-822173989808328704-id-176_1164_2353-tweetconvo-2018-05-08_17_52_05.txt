http://hill.cm/bbk4mFl  
@thehill that 'ol pen ain't what it used to be.....
Coward. You act like the people there are from the phantom zone and we have no Superman. They are just some humans.
Yes. It's purely anti-Constitutional institution. Close it now.
@ace2blue @thehill You are hilarious! Love your quick (and succinct) wit!
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@thehill Thank you Sen Scott
My parting letter to Obama: GO AWAY
Not surprising the Republican party are the hypocritical and obstructionist party that doesn't get anything done.
@shiiialee @thehill NO, make it bigger!
Senator Scott is the ultimate master of brevity.
honest q: u cool w/ El Chapo coming to US? Man who escaped prison twice? But you think G-bay detainees are bigger threats?
@PoliticalLine @thehill yes. Charge them and be done with it.
Bravo, sir. Thank you for standing firm.
@Mellecon Phloog's Two Parting Letters to Obama:  F and U
Obama knows he will be quickly forgotten.
I wish he would be forgotten, but a man with his ego will NOT go away.  He'll continue to insert himself into public life.
In years to come, I hope to vote for you as president. @SenatorTimScott
@PoliticalLine Fuk yeah!!
It doesn't matter about keeping us safe, all obama cares about is closing Gitmo. Thank God he is leaving
Bawhaaaaaaa
@thehill Build a gallows there first.
Needs to be closed, and the whole base abandoned. It's a symbol of the dark aspects of U.S. foreign policy-not worth it
Ha! You tell 'em, @SenatorTimScott!
@1stbornAmerican @thehill what is his fascination with Guantanamo?
you rock Mr. Scott! Was worried Congress would change you like them, but no! Please run for governor!
You are officially King of one-word knockout tweets. Keep up the good work.

@SscottSsmith84  Obama is a non caring Evil Man ! Shame on him & ALL HIS DEMOCRATS, OBAMA WAS A DISASTER GOOD BYE TO HIM !!
Bravo, @SenatorTimScott!  #Brevity is the #Soul of #Clarity! @JenDinnj @thehill
No way, no how. Thank you @SenatorTimScott

@RickCanton 
@thehill Well said.
@DSFWife @thehill guess he doesn't like his Muslim brotherhood brothers being locked up there, free the family
LOVE YOU SENATOR TIM SCOTT You AND OTHER LEGISLATORS WHO SAY NO ARE TRULY LEGITIMATE
@thehill -Don't close it put him in it along with those pricks who wouldn't go to the inauguration!
@thehill that was then this is now. We have new sheriff in tow and law and order is needed.
Expand GTMO. Interrogate and gather intelligence rather than just killing them as Obama did.
Book some more guests for an extended stay actually.
HAHA!
PerfectKeep tweeting, Senator!
@SenatorTimScott
@thehill I think we ought to bring back every one he's released and add some more!
Good answer!
@szysgt @thehill
@SeahawkBurrrton @thehill Thank you, sir!

Wait, didn't BHO say he was going to close it? Why's he need you guys to do it? 
Nah, keep it open and the beds made for Trump and his Red Traitors. They'll be there soon enough.
@thehill best response ever.
@Hardline_Stance @thehill Hell no!

@carolinagirl63 @thehill Close your cigarette stained mouth
Land of the free, home of the brave, offshore torture prison where we lock you up & never actually charge you, USA USA!!!
"Brevity (should be) the soul of (Twitter)" @thehill
: Thank you, Senator! Direct, succinct & ABSOLUTELY correct. Our out-going "president" is the one playing politics.
Thank you for being there for all of US!
Wish you were my Senator, Sir.
Agreed. Fill it up! 
short and sweet and the right answer no! let me say it again no and no way keep it open were going to need it
@jtLOL @thehill  No more advice needed from the peanut gallery. Ride off into the sunset and never come back traitor.
@thehill thank you Senator Scott it's just that simple the word is NO
Franchise it out.
Well spoken, Mr. Scott.  America needs you
@thehill you r making SC look good at the hearings - I am glad I voted for you

Senator, I like your style @SenatorTimScott
@mshson @thehill 
F-off
@sumarie711 what a sore bitter loser and huge disappointment he turned out to be. I loved his girls though. Sorry for them
I love you. That sounds creepy, I know, but it was my first thought. Well done sir!
Thank you, Sir. That was the proper response to "Bathhouse Barry".
@thehill Thank-you. Stand strong Senator.
@SoniaPennell @thehill Thank U @SenTimScott for Your Conservative&Constitution values&love of our America!
@thehill make that hell no !
@thehill you are a dame fool but I would not expect nothing else.
@thehill is there anyone left there???
@Doodisgirl 
He needs to just go...
@thehill Put more terrorists there. Perfect place close to US but on an island. #Liberals are idiots.
You do the best one word tweets!
@TN_Trump  This fucker's first order of business was to close Gitmo on his first day and Congress rightly screwed him.
Nice. Concise and to the point.
Send Obama there & clintons & rest of liberal stupids that want 2 destroy #America
Time to fill 'er up, Congress. The released detainees will be back!
@CStamper_ @thehill / A Big NO!
@CStamper_ @thehill Obuma is so great, why didn't he get in done in 8 years

@laughing_ginger @thehill
@thehill
You are one of my HEROES!  2024? Pretty please? :)
@thehill no:) is right!!
@CStamper_ @thehill maybe Obama will not write a letter? Instead he will leave a 8x10 picture of himself
@thehill  Thank you for No!
@CStamper_ @thehill he's already emptied the prisons... #ObamaLegacy
That's it!... I've waited long enough. I have to follow Tim Scott. Master of the one word trolltweet.
@LilMissRightie   KaBoom !!!
Can #Obama empty it w/o Congress via #executiveoverreach in his last few hours?
What is your objection to closing Guantanamo?
@GloriaMitchell6 good
There is vacancy in Gitmo, plenty of beds available for captured terrorists.

@thehill ha ha ha love u senator Scott
#TimScott2024
There's another way: send them home in pine boxes.
@thehill Start restocking it.
@thehill To the end OBAMA a Brainless Liberal!
No... and how about we double it?
.@SenatorTimScott @thehill you are the GOP GOAT of twitter
Well said...
thank you Senator Scott for your leadership
@thehill I love that you say more in one word tweets than you-know-who does in multi-tweet rants. Kudos!
I ADORE you.  @thehill
@thehill 
For a man of great achievement, it appears you lack the ability to understand the symbolism of having a Guantanamo open.
you're seriously the best, Senator
@bayareahausfrau @SenatorTimScott Making SC proud!
Respect you, Senator. But Guantanmo has become a blight on our country that has outlived it's usefulness.
Time to #MakeGitmoGreatAgain and fill it up with terrorists
why not?

$85 million to the government is like $8.50 to a household. It's worth it to pay that minute amount
Fantastic!  Big fan, @SenatorTimScott, big fan. #BecauseRecividism
@thehill #Torture doesn't work.
Neither does liberalism
Care to explain why Senator?
He doesn't have to
is my Senator. Yes, he does.
No he doesn't because you already know the answer
Interesting that he didn't choose to do it during his own presidency yet still claims moral high ground.
he can't without congress
He never even tried to get it through Congress.
my point stands.
Not really.
well. You're wrong but I doubt you care. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/02/23/politics/guantanamo-bay-obama-prison-closure-plan/index.html?client=safari …
He couldn't have sent it up in 2009?
@thehill Stay strong Senator! Obama only has a few HOURS left!
Good for you, Senator!
@thehill Hell NO!
Where will BO, Hillary, and JK go!
who is JK?
john kerry
got it
Hell no! Vacancy, fill it up. Need some intel.
following you is my best 2017 decision thus far. :)
