But not everyone is a Christian. Our nation wasn't founded on Christian principles. It needs to stay out of our government.
on that point mama you are incorrect
Shes right
The country was founded as n Judea Christian principles
Anyone who's studied US history knows that it was founded by Deists. Look it up.
Tell me what religion were the African slaves when they were brought to America?
What does it matter they did not write the constitution or bill of rights etc.
Thats why the constitution and bill of rights should be scrapped. Doesn't work in "modern day time".
Really? You are agreeing with his CLEARLY racist comment? Definitely remembering this.
Think you'll like our website.
So u think this scum is ok? He's pro dog fighting & thinks CHILDREN shld be allowed to attend! U hv to be kidding or insane
Seriously Rep Comstock you support this racist, intolerant policy?
Barbara, how come you only tweeted this from your campaign account? Weird. #va10 should know how you feel
We know where she stands.We'll VoteBlue, giving her an overdue goodbye
Dear Senator Scott you are part of the Problem. Who are you trying to please. Look at your inner cities, study the Miami.
.@TheRealUgom @SenatorTimScott
Thanks Lynn I watched it yesterday.
This is what Steve King fears:
And this (this is not at all about race):
This is true racism:
.@YankStinkfinger @SenatorTimScott
This is what Steve King fears & how Native Americans were treated does not change the obvious.
And this, is this what you want for America?
Civilization didn't begin in EUROPE.#
shh....that's where the Garden of Eden, by the river in Africa, REALLY was.
@BarbaraComstock please clarify that you DO NOT in any way, shape or form support White supremacist Steve King.
@BarbaraComstock How dare you RT this racist tripe? Wow. #va10 Barbara does NOT represent me. Just, wow.
.@bcdieff @SenatorTimScott
.@bcdieff @SenatorTimScott The fear is those who do not believe in "melting" like this:
Here's one not from Fox News @bcdieff @SenatorTimScott
Barbara. Your 'courage' to casually RT a vague criticism of a blatant racist is a looking glass of your so called leadership
But, as you are well aware, we the people are NOT all Christians. And most of us who are, do not literally believe in Adam and Eve.
@BarbaraComstock Oh, PLEASE, Comstock. Stop it with the Christian fantasies and hypocrisy.
@BarbaraComstock @nytimes and the Earth is 3000 years old right?
are you going to explicitly denounce senator King?
This appears to be an endorsement of Steve King’s bigoted views. Is that correct?
Yes! Fact-cultures R dying off, if French moved2Holland they'd be citizen of Holland but French descendants,not Dutch desc!
Your boy waded even deeper into the racist gene pool today on radio. He send U a copy of Camp of the Saints as a gift too?
Steve King is saying if immigrants don't support the Constitution/values, our nation will eventually lose
@BarbaraComstock not all of our constituents are Christian. In fact, @RepComstock , many of yours are not.
SMH.  Excusing these people and turning your head will NOT help this country! #resist
U should denounce this foolishness, if u do not you are basically saying you agree with it. Don't try 2 justify, denounce!
Is this supposed to be a rebuke? What does Christian have to do with it. If this is it, why even repsond at all? Shameful, Senator Scott!!
I'm sure if the haters and racists gain complete control of the country, they'll show you nothing but respect.
you're a very brave person for not calling out this racist person. Be sure to hide when he walks toward you

so, are you for, or against his views?

You're talking about the Holy Bible and @SteveKingIA is talking about the KKK bible. Same verses, different interpretations.
The ones who stay silent are part of the problem too! Lash out at against these Klan in disguise senators.
oh yeah? That's how you are gonna be ok with aligning yourself with the party of racists? #shame#traitors#ticktock
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar:
for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

and yet you act surprised why people call you Uncle Tom....
I served under @SenatorTimScott brother. Great man. I can't believe even you agreed w/this, Sen. Scott. Smh...
Grow a backbone and just say @SteveKingIA is a racist.
dummy
bravo
negro what the hell does this even mean to his statement?????
tim they not using ships they using trains you better hop your ass of that train because its going to crash!
Just a note: in John 8, Jesus REJECTS the claim of the wicked that they share paternity with Him. Steve King is NOT my bro!
You play in the wolves of racists and are surprised when one bites you with fleas? Come on, brah. Stay woke.
@SteveKingIA  Well said Sen. Scott. Though all may not have understood or agreed, it's these values that can unite us.
out of many one is the translation.

.@SenatorTimScott
What in the world are you saying? I hope you aren't taking up for that sad excuse of a politician.
.@scbluedot @formerleft @SenatorTimScott
showing true colors
This is what Steve King fears:
Do you honestly think not wanting this in America is racism?
This is true racism:
This is a dog whistle to white nationalism. And exactly why the GOP won't last another generation. @SteveKingIA
confused here. What happened to the 1st amendment? Read the constitution. America isn't only Christian.
and non-christians say human is human is human. I also hope this mean you will not support Muslim ban 2.0
Amen
the problem only arises Tim when we have situations like in Europe when people don't believe that
I appreciate you calling him out, but I believe the GOP needs to do something as a party.  There is a disturbing trend of
White Nationalism in our country. Trump voters, that's one thing, but when it crosses over to Congress and the White House,
firstly, many of your constituents are NOT Christian. You represent all of us.
ya, just as gross.
.@JordanEHolt
that's cute. Do you get all your news from crazy YouTube sources?
.@JordanEHolt So you have no response. Got it! This is true racism:
Is this a condemnation? Unclear / vague.
Exactly Darlene the tweet is clear as mud but there is definitely no condemnation.
Why is it that everytime a #Conservative or #Republican speaks, someone yells: #Racists? EVERYTHING AIN'T RACIST!
No it is not, I agree with you. But this particular set of statements are both racist and ignorant.
What the hell does he even mean by "someone else's babies?"
WE DON'T WANT THIS IN AMERICA. @SteveKingIA is absolutely right! We want to keep our culture. Not that of the middle east!
I can't figure out if you are condemning, criticizing, or concurring with @SteveKingIA #concernedGOPcolleague #ornot
.@francofille_sc @SenatorTimScott
this explanation is as abhorrent as the tweet itself. #racist
This is what he fears:
And this; what is abhorrent about not wanting this in America?
This is true racism not the things Steve King fears:
Instead of condemning this racist you Tweet about him?  Scary
.@Islandgirlx2 @SenatorTimScott
Steven King is a straight up racist! Hands down
I don't believe Steve King is racist; his concern is masses of immigrants NOT ASSIMILATING.
If you don't agree that's very fine but don't make him out to be the boogeyman he's not.
This is what Steve King fears:
And this, do you want this in America?
Tim I really need you to explain this. You saying non-Christians have no place? I'm puzzled.
.@jayscotttalks @SenatorTimScott
Do you speak only for Christians in SC or for ALL religious and non-religious people?
.@JaiChandran @SenatorTimScott
These folks do not follow the basic tenets of Christianity. They believe in white Jesus.
.@FranFromDaBayou @DarleneShab @SenatorTimScott
This is equally horrifying. Are you posting this to prove he's horrible or do you agree w him?
Neither actually, I just believe we need to be more tolerant of people of different views.
I don't believe Steve King is racist; his concern is masses of immigrants NOT ASSIMILATING.
If you don't agree that's very fine but don't make him out to be the boogeyman he's not.
the civilization he refers to includes inventions from all over the non-white world: algebra, noodles, fireworks, the wheel
@Bencjacobs @nytimes Pretty sure not all Christians believe in a literal Adam and Eve, but ok..
.@cacikra @Bencjacobs @SenatorTimScott
.@SenatorTimScott @Bencjacobs @nytimes Getting more and more difficult to remain a Republican, isn't it Senator?
.@lisasusanberger @SenatorTimScott
I won't defend his lack of delivery beforehand, but he tried to explain and no one will listen.
so what are you gonna do about the white nationalists in your party? That includes the president.
Steve King's statement has nothing to do with white nationalism or race.  http://politistick.com/no-rep-steve-king-is-not-a-racist-and-yes-every-word-he-said-is-truth/?utm_content=buffer96e41&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer …

I'm pretty sure Steve King would love it if you and your family would go back to where you came from He wants #AmericaWhite

poor old Steve: a dinosaur that sees it coming.
We are all "one blood."  Unless evolution is true then it's open season.
Evolution does contribute to racism but Steve King's statement has nothing to do with race. http://politistick.com/no-rep-steve-king-is-not-a-racist-and-yes-every-word-he-said-is-truth/?utm_content=buffer96e41&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer …

Can Congress do anything to censure him? White nationalists should be called out.
