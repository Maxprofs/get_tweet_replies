All for the rich...
You want the government to steal more money from the rich to give to you, because your not rich. You should pay more in taxes that's fair
This plan is better named "How To Screw The Other 95%".
You want fairness? Pay equal taxes to the rich!! Thats  fair!!  All laws are to be enforced equally, and protected equally. That fair
All wanted to take our healthcare... appalling unconscionable group...all on the take from special interests!
Trump tax cut would give 79.7% of benefits to top 1 percent. So how does this #keepyomoney thing work exactly?
You didn't hear? The new, updated, accurate hashtag is #expandyomansion
“So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.” James 4:17
Ya think you can get a good tax plan together, cause you are failing miserably on healthcare, with no excuses left
And it's gonna suck. More cash for the rich at the expense of the middle class and poor. Cuz. Ya know? The rich need more money.
Logical person!! Look at your beloved Venezuela and cuba under socialism. Is that what you want America to become?
Eliminating the estate tax = another great example of how Trump's family would save billions under #TrumpTaxScam
The riches money is not yours, they worked hard and earned it!! Why do you think what's theirs should be yours?? Jealous theif!!
How does this guy sleep at night? He is the equivalent of a Jewish Nazi. "Fair" tax framework is another handout to the rich #fakechristian
We're not buying your BS Scott.  This is nothing but a HUGE TAX BREAK FOR THE WEALTHY RIGHT OFF THE THE BACK OF THE MIDDLE CLASS!
When the government runs out of money to steal from the people that give you a job!! The government will go after your money to give away
This gives a 4% Break to the rich. The lower class rates go up. Everyone gets the deduction. trump said no breaks for the rich. Lied again!!
Have you ever heard of equal protection under the law? Under the constitution all laws are to be applied equally. You should be paying more
The president said the rich weren’t getting a tax break. That’s what I’m mad about. We were lied to again!
You should be paying the same amount of taxes the rich are paying no matter what the percentage is!! If you believe in fairness
I like a flat tax. One rate. Go for the tax on luxury goods and cars to level the field.
Less people will buy luxury goods and that means lay offs we've done that and people lost
 their jobs did that in the 90s under Bill Clinton
You can tier it. Maybe $100 for a Chevy, $500 for Porsche??? The eco guys can figure out a formula.
all of you will be out of work if you don't do something about gun safety.

We're NOT helpless. Here are some measures most Americans support that could help stop future mass shootings. Pass it on. (h/t @sangerkatz)

Massive debt and more money for Tim and his buddies... yep bend over and #spreadyocheeks
$800 tax added this coming year for Obama care. Cut a tax here add a tax there no savings for the people.  Fool the people thats congress
Tax cuts is not tax reform.  Reform is when you eleminate all tax deductions and simplify reporting and eleminate 1,000s of tax codes
Well at least you got a photo op that isn't all old white men.
Your a racist sexist. You should be ashamed of yourself . Hypocrisy is your style

@SenatorTimScott w/agree #KeepYoMoney and #FAIRtax does that best by ending FICA w/hurts low income. 
@POTUS 
@VP 
@SenMajLdr 
@SpeakerRyan
Looks about right.. mostly men, mostly white, all wealthy and trying to act like they care about middle and (God forbid) poor Americans.  
After what you tried to pull off for health care?
Dont back down, dont let the democrats rule the debate!
Thank you . It's very Newt new. I will study with a big interest. @KellyannePolls @newtgingrich @JudgeJeanine
Crap...another delusional & sociopathic Nazi added to the RAPE OF AMERICA (AKA the GOP)!
SAVE THE USA..IMPEACH NOW!!!

Republicans are lying,just look at all the programs they have gotten rid of,so that trump&this staff can spend our tax money on themselves.
You pay for the failed program's . I want to keep more of my money to do what I want with it. It's not your money. You can pay for it!
Pass a law to limit all elected fed officials to 2-terms.  End career politicians.  #TermLimits
You’re going with #KeepYoMoney? Your social media person should be ashamed. #LoseYoJob
Another room of Men #sad
Your a socialist sexist .
Watch out for Wiley John McCain....
CON JOB BY RYAN & MCCONNELL! Really? Raise lowest??? Lower highest??? We are not buying it GOP CONGRESS!!! U WILL LOSE IN NEXT PRIMARY!!!

Looks like another kegger to kick off tax reform.

We look forward to voting out @gop @IndivisibleTeam


Don't you feel special, Diane? One white, rich woman surrounded by all white, rich men (and one token black man)?
If the American people get anything resembling real reform out you folks, I'll be truly amazed.
Who keeps their money? The wealthy? As always, the middle class pays their fair share and the wealthy don't.
Blah Blah Blah Sickening
Hey!  A woman!  Just one? The % of women in Congress is 19.6%. USA population is 50.6% Don’t u think more than one woman should be included?
Ryan looking smug, two smiling,the rest seem sad.
Oh Diane Black is gleeful trust me. She and her corrupt husband benefit perfectly from this.

Lots of sad/ mad faces??
just standing there on TV EVERY SINGLE DAY DOES NOT GET ANYTHING DONE YOU FOOLS ! JUST DO IT !

Congress is the problem! #TaxReform will not happen until #FAIRtax ends t/ability to sell tax policy favors. #MTFA 
@Talkmaster…
#GOP #TaxReform: Line the pockets of the 1% and corporations and screw the average American. Nobody trust Congress - 16% approval. Joke!
Estate Tax exemption only benefits persons with whose assets exceed $5.49 million. How many are thinking that sounds like them?
You can let 45000 immigrants into the US, but you can't get 200000 veterans off the street or welfare, fix the va or I'll start backing Dems
Seems like another free ride for the wealthy on the backs of the middle class. Restore Estate Tax and state and local Tax deduction.

Bullshit!!  Liars all of you
Look at all the lying bowel movements!
Lies! All lies! Funneling money to big contributors! None of you will EVER be reelected!
Unveil...congratulate selves for “a plan,” a BIG THOUGHT. Pass some gas. Gaslight America. Photos and kisses. It’s a brand new future
Horseshit.
Why should we subsidize billionaires?
How much money do the rich need? According to GOP, ALL of it. Screw the middle and poor.
@RepDianeBlack with your record, you might want to reconsider the black "slang" usage of your hashtag.
I don't know what is more offensive, a bunch of white guys saying keepYOmoney, or a bunch of white guys legislating female organs.
Well it's the same group so it can just be doubly offensive.

It's a  trash plan you released today that's just a massive tax cut for the 1% nothing more.
Just a note to all of you-do not wait until next year to vote on this-do it this year-we are really tired of waiting for things to get done
Tell 45 to #ShowUsHisTaxes
What is happening to capital gains taxes in the new plan?
No tax cuts for Big Biz or the wealthy! Tax cuts should only be for small biz and middle class! Raise taxes on wealthy & close loopholes!
The GOP tax cut plan is more of the same—a gift to the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations RIGHT OFF THE BACK OF MIDDLE CLASS!
Much of Trump's plan is designed to give tax breaks to companies who have been actively avoiding paying taxes.
Trump at his rally LYING AGAIN! vows that his tax plan will protect low and middle-income Americans, not the “wealthy. THIS IS LAUGHABLE!!
90% of the ppl in that pic are WHITE GUYS - yeah ok - you represent America!
Those be Trump’s bitches.
Your the only bitch here. Cry bitch
Sure, real great I'm sure -- for the wealthy, that is!  #InPocketOfRich #screwthemiddleclass
That is pure evil. Fascist actually
What's "evil" & "Fascist actually," @jsftennis?
Trying to steal 90% of successful Americans money and putting it in the hands of the state.
Hi, @jsftennis.
You have it in reverse:
The current  Tax Code represents decades of the few taking from the many to give to themselves.
P.S. @jsftennis.
My apologies.
I seem to have made a few typos in that last Golden Retriever Meme.
So, here's a corrected version.
You are seeking to force successful Americans to surrender the vast majority of their wealth to what would be a tyrannical government
You are advocating for the theft of private property. For state run economy. Socialism. Communism. Undemocratic actually
All you are unveiling is propaganda.  Unless you publish income with the tax brackets so we can all SEE what it is, it’s all BS @RonWyden
I don't care if he keeps more money,price flies private planes and waste over 25 thousand on a private booth for EPA.keep preexisting&caps
Don't tell me, let me guess. Big breaks for (not) job creators, middle class gets screwed. Am I close?
You better have Obamacare repealed or this caucus is toast in 2018. Stop playing games and do what you promised.
Dollhands designed his  #TrumpSCAM tax giveaways to wealth hoarders plan with only himself in mind.
Trump can keep more of his money
And #growyodeficit.This "plan" makes no sense in a context of flat productivity and declining wage growth. Propose something realistic.
Stop lying. This is a tax cut for the rich paid for by the middle class and poor.  #PuertoRico
Why are you lying to your constituents? This tax plan would raise their taxes substantially.
I mean “no one” believes this “shit”
yes, this WILL help rich people keep/steal their $. And nice usurpation of the black vernacular. May as well steal culture too, right?
Um no. Allowing people to keep more of their OWN hard earned money isn't stealing. Its just the opposite
Well the only way you are going to keep more of your hard earned money is if you are a millionaire.
That's an absolute lie.  And having a million dollars doesn't make you a filthy rich person. Stop punishing & discouraging success & wealth
Point out where I was punishing wealth and discouraging success. Saying you have to be in the top tax bracket to benefit is not a lie.
It is a lie. Middle class taxes will also be cut. As will lower income taxes, as deductibles will be doubled. Also,business tax rate is down
Rich pay less, middle get a few dollars, poor pay more. They raised the income, raised the rate, and decreased the reductions for the poor
Of course rich will have greater cuts than lower income Americans because they have and make more!
You sorry do nothing's better get off your butts and actually support POTUS and his tax reform. Sick of the BS and excuses, 2018 coming if you don't.
#KeepYoMoney - so racist
Keeping my money?

You guys just love giving more money to the rich, don't you?
Fake news.
it's "your" money
You'd think they would be reluctant to adopt "urban" slang, considering the fact that they're a bunch of racist rich white guys.
Especially after railing how disrespectful black folks are for taking a knee.
tax thee rich my guy
The plan is complete trash that only helps the donor class and corporations. We will not let you raise our natl deb by $6 Trillion a tax cut
Stop being a sychophant.  Do your job #HelpPuertoRicoNow #WaiveJonesAct 
#Americans are dying!
Let us know when you actually tackle the Obamacare mess & beat it.
