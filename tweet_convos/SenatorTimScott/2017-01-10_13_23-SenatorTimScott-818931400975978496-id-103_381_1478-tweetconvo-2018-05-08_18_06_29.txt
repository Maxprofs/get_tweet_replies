@SenatorTimScott.  You've sold your soul voting for Jeff Sessions.
@CarolTempel how would Jesus respond to kicking millions off of health insurance?
Not a hard question; the Bible says role of government is law enforcement & defense & that's all.
Charity is the realm of family/church/community & not government.
since you are so godly can you pay for my next PET scan or maybe the surgery to remove my port
Oh, it's on the government presently & good luck with that!

@CarolTempel wow jesus would NOT have voted for sessions so you might want to save your receipt
You don't think Jesus approves Sessions shutting down the AL. Klan and putting 1 on death row?
think he would have voted for Hate Crime Prevention,Fair Pay,Violence Against Women&Voting Right Acts, all Sessions voted against
Maybe you don't know Jesus as well as you think.
would you mind Sessions addressing you as boy? Do you agree worst thing about the KKK is smoking weed? #SirHaveYouNoDecency
@CarolTempel Very glad if that, but still wish you'd voted no
@Toddkron @CarolTempel Scott has been en fuego the last few days. Love that guy.
