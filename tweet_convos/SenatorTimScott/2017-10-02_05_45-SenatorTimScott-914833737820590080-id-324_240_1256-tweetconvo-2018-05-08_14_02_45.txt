Maybe you could, I don't know, sponsor a bill that severely restricts access to firearms or something. You know, something useful.
Owning/acquiring the type of weapon that was allegedly used is already severely restricted by law.
Maybe the laws are ineffective? That's what we do when a law isn't working, we change it. We don't just throw up our hands in America.
The laws re: auto weapons are working. Legally-acquired auto has been used in crimes only 3x in 80 years before this. No law is foolproof.
Tired of being told that this problem is intractable by gun owners.
Just because something is rare doesn't mean it isn't horrifying and worth trying to prevent.
Just because something horrifying happens doesn't mean laws aren't there to try to prevent it.
So do you agree that we have more mass shootings per capita than other nations? You just disagree that laws can do anything to address this?
#ThoughtsAndPrayersAreNotEnough. It is time for responsible #GunContolNow
Im one of your SC voters- explain your position on this. I agree with @JimmyKimmelLive - your words are meaningless if u are allowing this.
I await the ban on high capacity magazines that could help ensure this never happens again. #GunControlNow
How many have to be murdered before anyone will take the high road?
Considering that rather than withdrawing the awful armor-piercing rounds & silencers for all bill they TABLED IT so they can bring it back
when they think we're all safely not paying attention? I don't even know if the @GOP is human at this point, to be so thoughtlessly cruel.
#StayWoke
By your inaction, you are responsible for the deaths of 31,000 Americans annually. You are spineless & sans-balls.
You took $4500 from the NRA last election cycle. Your actions speak louder than your words.
It's easier to take the NRA's money than to stand up to them. He's guilty of government sponsored genocide. 31,000 dead last year.
Another empty concern from another meaningless politician. Did you get anything nice with your hard earned NRA funds?
South Carolina Senator Tim Scott received $4,500 from the #NRA during the 2016 election cycle. #thoughtsandprayers
He should at least demand enough to pay for the final expenses of the 31,000 Americans who died from gun violence last year.
Oh, sure! Your "heart" is with Las Vegas. Yet your pocketbook took in $4,500 from the NRA in 2016. There is blood on YOUR hands.
@SenatorTimScott , WHY?  https://www.facebook.com/JimmyKimmelLive/videos/10155712384013374/ …
You're a disappointment Tim! We don't want your heart we want your action. Stop taking $$ from @NRA and start doing your job!!!
those victims deserve more than your heart, they deserve action. Stop taking NRA$ & start enacting reasonable gun control
Why don't you support a ban on sales of high capacity magazines? There's no reason anyone needs to shoot hundreds of bullets w/o reloading.
What is your definition of a high capacity magazine? Is it 100? 200? You said hundreds of rounds could you specify the number? "High Capacity Magazine" bans limit rifles and shotguns to FIVE TO TEN or at most TWENTY rounds! Not hundreds.
Then do something aout it instead of just voting the way the NRA tells you to. Show that you are a man with conscience and a heart.
A conscience & heart would be a start, but he'd also need a spine & balls - he has neither.
Where was your heart when you voted no on universal background checks in 2016? Where was your heart when you accepted $4,500 from the NRA?
He has no heart. He also has no spine or balls.
Do something to help... propose legislation, change the gun laws. Stop taking money from the NRA!
That would require a spine & balls - Scott has neither.
We notice you accept thousands of dollars from the NRA.  Is that the reason we have no discussion of restrictions on assault weapons?
You're in the NRA's pocket! You should be ashamed of your voting record and the money you have taken. Shame on you Tim Scott
God bless the victims and their families and the brave first responders who always put the safety of others ahead of their own.
Yet you'll vote just like the old white men tell you.
Do something other than thoughts and prayers. They are meaningless. We want common sense gun control like the rest of the civilized world.
tomorrow morning stop taking money from NRA and take action. America deserves better!
READ YOUR COMMENTS. Everyone is against your supporting the @NRA and taking their money. EVERYONE. Start listening to us.
#SCVoter suggests that passing meaningful #uncontrolled will end the need for your meaningless platitudes
You can stop this.  Ban automatic and semiautomatic guns already.

You've taken money from the NRA, your "well wishes" mean nothing.
may you please also send the NRA their money back. thank you.
or better yet, donate it to save lives and support those affected.
where is your heart today senator? If it's still with the people will you stop taking money from the NRA?

their blood is on your hands, shame on you for asking $ from the NRA and pretending to care about Americans.
And thank you for graciously accepting $4500 from the NRA.
What kind of monster are you to tweet this while happily accepting money from the NRA? Can't wait to vote you out for REAL change!
Hey, you could actually do something about this, but you're too busy lining your pockets. #BloodMoney YOU DID THIS
The shooter had 42 guns, which for you is a "right." But for those shot, healthcare is a "privilege." Your policies are warped.
What is your plan to reduce mass shootings? Your "heart" is meaningless without action.
$4,500
how about putting your vote with the people and common sense instead of the NRA!
Get out of their pocket
This is empty without action. You're putting money over human lives.
Your thoughts and prayers are empty gestures when you allow this to continue.
Their blood is on your hands and it won't wash off.
How about stop taking blood money from the NRA and pass legislation that will help the mentally ill get treatment instead of weapons?
Then do something. Just. Fucking. Do. Something.
Senator Tim Scott received $4,500 from the NRA
Your heart was with the NRA last election cycle when you received funds from them.
I'm sure you're not, but you should be ashamed of yourself.
I am a South Carolinian. It is time for action, otherwise this is an empty condolence. NRA money is blood money.
As a Repub and your constituent, you and Congress need to DO SOMETHING about gun control. Enough thoughts and prayers.
No respect 4 THOUGHTS & PRAYERS
Get outta the NRAs pocket & DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL! GUN CONTROL NOW! Get assault weapons off the street!
MY heart hopes you won't take another $4000 from the NRA last year - that's about $7 per shooting victim this time, right?
Your voting record contradicts those sentiments sir .
As your constituent I’m telling you to stop double talking and shove your empty platitudes.  DO SOMETHING. #guncontrol
very simple and meaningless words without actions to make a change.
so I assume you must believe that your condolences are all we need as Americans to be safe from the bullets of semi automatic weapons?
Prayers and praise are fine but does zip for the living. Gun controls now or we find a new Senator in November.
We need more than prayers, we need gun regulation!
HOW MANY MORE MASS SHOOTINGS MUST HAPPEN BEFORE YOU TAKE ACTION ON GUN CONTROL?
Gun control, Senator. You have the power, sir.  These tragedies are too much for us...
You received $4500 from the NRA during the 2016 election.  What is your plan to deal with gun violence?
South Carolina Senator Tim Scott received $4,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.

Let me fix this tweet for u: I will help pass #GunControl to save lives because one dead American due to gun violence is too many. #LasVegas
This morning I'm wondering how you could think freedom looks like 270+ mass shootings per year. #bloodmoney #GunControlNow
You are complicit in voting not to extend the assault weapons ban. Return your NRA money, Tim. Show some integrity.
So, are u going to give back the $4500 u got from the @NRA or nah? #GiveTheBloodMoneyBack
POLICY helps. Tweeting "thoughts & prayers" and accepting $4,500 from NRA does not. Enough is enough! NOW is the time to talk about change.
If your heart is with their hearts, pass some legislations that actually address this!
"Our hearts" mean little to grieving families. Why don't you stop taking NRA money & vote for gun control to help prevent future tragedies?
DO SOMETHING!! You can stop this from happening so frequently with legislation. How can you sleep at night taking $$$ from the NRA????
Whats in your Heart < $3k from NRA. Keep up the good work! time for something new, #guncontrol #SandyHook #LasVegas
Truly tragic it would be helpful if you did not take $4,500 from the NRA as you did in 2016 #guncontrol
Ya hear dat, #keepyomoney man? DO SOMETHING! Words are nice but accomplish nothing! Step up, do your job, or step down.
Maybe you should take the $4,500 you got from the NRA and clean your #BloodStainedHands by paying for someone's medical bills. #GFY
So was the $4,500 you got from the NRA last election cycle worth it?
Save your lousy and hollow words. The majority of Americans want  sensible gun laws but  you sold us out for a $4,500 donation from the  @NRA. That's less than  $78 per human life lost in Vegas.
Be brave! Support gun control before another mass shooting happens.
Are your hearts with those who will continue to die because you keep taking $$ from the @NRA instead of passing sensible #guncontrol?
Stop accepting #NRA money. Join the fight for #CommonSenseGunControl. #LasVegasShooting #noguns
Keep your thoughts & prayers. You took $17,950 from @NRA, which makes you #Complicit in the #LasVegasShooting last night.
You took $4,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle. This is on you!
Who voted against gun control? Joe and Mika read their names http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/who-voted-against-gun-control … #BloodOnYourHands
4,500..The amount of cash Tim Scott received from the NRA
#LasVegasShooting #GunControlNow 
Not while politicians can be bought.
$4,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.  You're a hypocrite, and I'm embarrassed that you represent the state where I live.
Blood is on your hands for taking money and supporting terrorist @NRA
The time 4 conversation is yet again NOW.  Theres no GOOD excuse 2 not openly discuss gun violence & how 2 prevent another mass shooting.
The next time you take money from the NRA I hope you remember the people who you allowed to be killed as a result of your greed.
Please use this to ban assault rifles from civilian sale - I know you  the NRA but civilians don’t EVER need assault rifles!!
So this should mean you will no longer accept campaign donations from the NRA, right?
#sendthebloodmoneyback. Not just thoughts & prayers. Stop taking $ from the NRA and stop assault rifles.
yet you still won't refuse @NRA money will you - $4500 worth the #bloodonyourhands?
Stop taking money from the NRA. Your tweets are worthless.
What are you going to do about it? Stop it with the "thoughts and prayers" canned response. It's disingenuous.
You're an NRA-bought hypocrite, complicit in every one of these murders. There is blood on your hands.

Your heart wouldn't have to be if you did something about gun control instead if taking @NRA money. #LasVegasShootings #BloodOnYourHands
Think on the $4500 in NRA blood money you took last year.
We need stronger gun laws, not your prayers.  Stop taking payola from the @NRA and contributing to unnecessary violence.
But isn't your heart also with that $4500 check you pulled from #NRA last year? Let me answer that for you. 
The dollars you accepted from the NRA negate your empty sentiments. Please act!
If you could stop taking money from the NRA so we can trust that you are making safe laws for U.S. citizens that'd be great.
You don’t get to vote the way u do then pretend u care when people die due to your senselessness. Make up ur mind, u can’t have it both ways
If those families refuse to return your heart just use the $4,500 of NRA cash you took last election to buy another!
Are you planning to give back your 2016 monies received from the NRA?Asking for America @NFL @Kaepernick7 @NAACP @ACLU @maddow @womensmarch
Is your heart with stopping #MassShootings? Will you push for gun control & stop taking NRA money? #LasVegasShooting
You received $4,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle. Therefore, the price of a human life to you is $76.27 each for just today.
I hate that piece of scum.
You don't have a right to say this. You made this happen by taking $ from @NRA and supporting @NRA.
James 2:17 " Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. "  Stop taking money from NRA!
If your hearts are with the victims then fight for more gun control laws. Use the $4,500 the NRA from last year's election gave you to start
Save your thoughts & prayers - we dont need it -  We need action. R U going to find ur spine & stand up to protect us!  #GunControlNow @NRA
Respectfully, I don't want your thoughts and prayers, I want laws that protect me and mine.
Amen brother
Your tweet says your heart is with the victims, but your voting record and acceptance of NRA $ says your heart is with the perpetrator.
This morning we have all been looking up who took money from the #NRA. You took $4,500. #TookGunLobbyMoney
