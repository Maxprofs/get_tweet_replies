@Mike_Beacham Tim u r so right! This can only be resolved when the community understands responsibility & it starts at home
Thank you!
@TGowdySC We Must RISE UP & Cut Off The Head Of The Snake That Is The POWER Behind This Agenda.
@TGowdySC was a unarmed black man! T Martin, used his hands a cement sidewalk! Resisting arrest is also a problem is it not
So we shouldnt vote for the evil madwoman who was responsible for hudreds of thousands deaths and destruction of countries
Admit that #BatonRouge #Minnesota -- while tragic -- were justifiable police killings. Target real problem.
@TGowdySC and we cannot sllow POTUS inflame racial hatred. Waiting for November.
@TGowdySC dang right. Protectors of the constitution won't let that happen
@TGowdySC BLM ready to create summer Convention chaos.  Check out @wesleyfelixpsi's Tweet:
Hacked messages of #BlackLivesMatter leader reveal Obama admin’s plan for ‘summer of chaos’ and martial law http://www.dcclothesline.com/2016/07/06/hacked-messages-of-blacklivesmatter-leader-reveal-obama-admins-plan-for-summer-of-chaos-and-martial-law/ …
@skatblueeyes. Let's  start by NOT endorsing or voting 4 a racist divider like Don the Con Trump.
KKK gave Hillary 20,000 donation to campaign. So who's friends with them?? Wake up !!
@TGowdySC hand experience, my friend & k9 partner some1 over 4 a traffic violation & was shot in the head along with his...
The problem IS NOT  American People!!& since its not, THEY are not the solution & THEY CANNOT SOLVE the prob! @TGowdySC
Bridges? Really? Like for ILLEGALS? We don't support Illegals in America. They are breaking the law. We need a WALL !!!
Being part of the Dem party, you should talk to Obama about hate, racism and divisiveness.We've had 8 years of it
@TGowdySC it was also a false narrative. He assaulted a store clerk then went for the cop & gun. But the media said he ....
@TGowdySC we only see the shooting videos AFTER what lead up to the shooting & jump to conclusions to blame cops quickly...
@TGowdySC poverty, fatherless children etc. it's a HEART problem, it's a "no God in heart" problem, it's a media problem...
@tgowdysc
@Mike_Beacham you are right!
There is a BIG difference w/a possible inappropriate response by a Police Officer & a premeditated attack by a racist hater
@TGowdySC there will always b a law breaker, & cops r N more fear 2day than ever. because 2many don't see life precious!
@TGowdySC then get involved with legislation to change laws, I don't see it helping until criminals stop committing crimes.
@TGowdySC k9 partner on his wife's bday. Cops R human! They don't make the laws, they uphold them. Ppl don't like laws.....
@TGowdySC is in danger. Cops are human, they R N fear daily cuz a simple traffic stop can cost them their life I have 1st..
@TGowdySC if an officer says stop, hands on head or steering wheel & the person disobeys, at that moment, the cops life....
@TGowdySC these videos should not be put on media until AFTER an investigation is complete. Mike brown, is a good example..
@TGowdySC great words. But the conversation every1 avoids, are the stats on crime. We cannot continue to blame crimes on...
Thank you for your sound and heartfelt advice Your service to our country and your state is tremendous and very appreciated
We appreciate your leadership and honesty.
Who are the mad men? Why hashtag #Dallas #BatonRouge #Minnesota in the same tweet?
The lawlessness has to be stopped before any healing and coming together can begin.
- You're a little late. There's been someone in the WH that's been growing that divide for 8 yrs. Now AG & FBI @TGowdySC
@TGowdySC heres the solution that should be supported by all, esp. YOU SCOTT & ALL GOP https://goo.gl/images/gak0xO 
In fairness, they should hold all of Congress to the same standard, starting with Gowdy http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/7/8/1546465/-Benghazi-headhunter-Trey-Gowdy-and-the-GOP-are-being-called-out-for-improper-email-use?detail=facebook … …
@TGowdySC Beautifully said Sen. Scott. Thank you for reaching out with compassion and truth. God bless you sir.
@TGowdySC Obama speaks division..hate...and this time carnage 2 hours later!!!!
@TGowdySC: Much Respect Sir !
Well said Senator Scott but I always side with the cops you do what they say granted some react to self protect or wrongly
@TGowdySC Well said Senator.  You're a true thinking man.
Sadly, Senator, hated often does "win" - at least for a substantial bit of time. Human history shows that time and again.
@TGowdySC love this guy!
Thanks Tim but politicians breaking the law and setting a bad example don't help
The biggest dividers are Hillary and Obama!
You go @SenatorTimScott WE LOVE YOU 
Downtrodden blacks are told lies by 
#Jackson #Sharpton #JudasPress (D)
A profound message that needs to echo across @SenatorTimScott @ToniKalHan
@TGowdySC thank you for sharing this.  I hope his message goes viral
Expose the real culprits #CrookedHillary @georgesoros & #WeaponizedMedia for fomenting.
So beautifully said, Senator. Thank you from North Charleston!
hatred burns any bridge of communication
have you endorsed Donald Trump yet?
You go Tlm
BLM is creating a bridge to nowhere.
well said Senator
Madman?Soldier in #Obama,#BLM,#ISIS movement to transform America.Identify problem so can fix.Are you calling cops madmen?
That is an amazing message for all Americans! Thank you, and God bless you!
Well said! South Carolina is very fortunate to have a man of your upstanding character representing us!
Yes senator does not win. This is why you must NOT support Donald J Trump
Amen sir....Amen.....
Mr. Scott i don't believe nothing that comes out of your mouth you are nothing
LOVE your msg Senator.. Keep fighting the good fight!!
#USA #PeaceAndLove
Simply said....love me some Tim Scott.  Look forward to his name in a Prez primary one day.  Go Dawgs!!
We need to vote out the perpetrators of racist propaganda: Obama lynch holder democrats Rinos ...
Action Not more words are called for . BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS.
Arm every American with AR-15s if they so choose.
you're a great American 
You don't help with your PC statements. Just as with Islam we can't fix what we don't first acknowledge. My kids tell truth
Thank you for addressing all of the terrible incidents of the past week. SC is proud to have you representing us.
The facts are that ppl and guns were involved in these incidents Need to build bridges between the ppl and #EndGunViolence
Preach!
