@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn HOW ARE YOU GONNA BLAME @realDonaldTrump FOR THAT STEVE ?
@Soonertrain @stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @realDonaldTrump get a dictionary moron
@stephenfhayes @FredMayhew2 @thomasjoscelyn Gee that's shocking...or not
@jez009 Thanks for Retweets!! GoodMorning!
@jez009 Blessings to U Jez!!
@jez009 Have a Proverbs 4:7 Day!!
@jez009 Happy GoodFriday, All!!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn not to late to kill him.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn is this one of the terrorists we traded for that POS Bergdahl?
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @chriskkenny was he radicalised before or after Guantanamo?
@supercujo Doesn't matter when. Just that we know he is @stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @chriskkenny
@LadyImpactOhio @stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @chriskkenny ignorance is bliss, huh?
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Gee, I bet Obama sent him a card to congratulate him.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Treasonous
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Gitmo watchers: 28% of released Jihadists returned to battle. Ask Hillary if she agrees w/ Obama on shutdown
@stephenfhayes @UpInTheHills @thomasjoscelyn Another prime example of Obama picking a "winner".
@stephenfhayes @PeterSomerville @thomasjoscelyn 

thanks, Barack Hussein
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn No one could possibly have seen this coming.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Doesn't anyone else see that Potus is doing all of this on purpose!
@ThinkTank2014
@ThinkTank2014
@stephenfhayes @bob_owens @thomasjoscelyn good job @BarackObama
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn What did you think they were going to do? Work for the Red Cross??
@stephenfhayes @SenatorTimScott @thomasjoscelyn 
Does this surprise anyone xcpt administration? No clue!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn They should have dropped him off ...half way across the ocean.
@stephenfhayes @RadioFreeTom @thomasjoscelyn Man, that came out of left field, who would have ever thought ?
@stephenfhayes @ShannonBream @thomasjoscelyn Guess that job as a used camel salesperson at Kabuls Camels didn't pan out.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn are you
U fkg kidding me geez
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn thank you once again #Obama for helping our enemy
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@stephenfhayes @K1erry @thomasjoscelyn Great job as usual Mr. President!
@stephenfhayes @jtLOL @thomasjoscelyn Gee, thanks, Obama.
@stephenfhayes @topsecretk9 @thomasjoscelyn Who would have figured that except Obama. That's why he let him out of Gitmo. Corruption in DC
@stephenfhayes @MustacheChuck @thomasjoscelyn Of course Obama knew what he was doing. He leads from behind, backdoor support for Terror.
@stephenfhayes @vjeannek @thomasjoscelyn Another of Obama's good decisions. Will he apply for a visa?
@stephenfhayes @JonahNRO @thomasjoscelyn the Obama doctrine: " here's my lunch money, now you don't have to take it, unless you want more.."
@stephenfhayes @BeladonnaRogers @thomasjoscelyn  Another Obama success story.  Ya have to scratch your head and wonder what side is he on
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn I see a drone and a bright light in his short future.
@stephenfhayes Thanks for reporting what most won't. @MRIrene @thomasjoscelyn
@stephenfhayes @mi_conservative @thomasjoscelyn stop this man
@stephenfhayes @topsecretk9 @thomasjoscelyn I would show my surprised face but I will never have one as long as I live...#ObamadestroyedUSA
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Obama should be charged with treason aiding and abetting the enemy
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn guess we really taught him a lesson.
@stephenfhayes @OmegaMan58 @thomasjoscelyn blame ONLY Obama!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Who saw this coming. I thought O swore he'd keep AMERICANS SAFE? Twice? God help us all.
.@realDonaldTrump @stephenfhayes @musicgirlsuzi @thomasjoscelyn #BreakingNewsGuantanamo
@stephenfhayes @isaacncohen @thomasjoscelyn If true, tolja so.
@stephenfhayes @RadioFreeTom @thomasjoscelyn Big surprise. He shoulda beeb tried in SDNY, which has a damn could track record of convictions
@stephenfhayes @BrentSchuetz @thomasjoscelyn Man, knock me over with a feather!  Another victory for Obama!!  What a joke!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn did Trump let him go or was it the current Commander in Chief?
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Obama would have let Hitler go free if we somehow had captured him in WWII & he was President
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn -  That's because #POTUS is an #AffirmativeActionAmateur
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn We "know" so much  about these individuals and yet they are never arrested publicly, questioned publicly
@stephenfhayes @BanCollectivism @thomasjoscelyn Never stops with obama & admin, always setting free terrorists who kill more due to obama
@stephenfhayes ...maybe Obama should explain his 'war is over and we exchange prisoners' speech once again, maybe al Qosi didn't hear him.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn trump right again
@stephenfhayes @Uncle_Jimbo @thomasjoscelyn stunning
MT @stephenfhayes: Guantanamo detainee released July '12 now leader of al Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/12/ex-guantanamo-detainee-now-an-al-qaeda-leader-in-yemen.php … @thomasjoscelyn
@SpeigleSunni Generally your query is a valid one. Specifically here ==> @stephenfhayes & ==> @thomasjoscelyn . I've been reading LWJ 4ever!
@stephenfhayes If only there was some group of people telling Obama this would happen and releasing them was a dumb idea. @thomasjoscelyn
@stephenfhayes @PoliticalShort @thomasjoscelyn great job Barry
@stephenfhayes @SenatorTimScott @thomasjoscelyn Keep Gitmo !!
@stephenfhayes @SenatorTimScott @thomasjoscelyn who is responsible for this?  Gitmo Bay is the perfect holding facility... makes no sense!
@stephenfhayes @BillKristol @thomasjoscelyn in cages with no charges forever then!!!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Everything Obama does is a YUGE FAILURE! Bet he's bribing terrorist's to not attack while he's still POTUS.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @fiddlestix007 Thank You #POTUS44
You can't  say Obama doesn't provide leadership.  It's just to the other side.  @stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @MoonbeamMelly A trained #MKULTRA is fit for the job.
@stephenfhayes @JonahNRO @thomasjoscelyn Didn't see that one coming #sarcasm
@stephenfhayes @CANARYorg @thomasjoscelyn YES & LIKELY SENT OBAMA A "THANK YOU" CARD!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn
"Whoa! I never saw THAT coming!"
Said no one outside of Washington EVER!!!
@stephenfhayes: "BREAKING: Guantanamo detainee released July 2012 now a leader of al Qaeda in…" #1 in United States http://www.toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=674752432098947073 …
@stephenfhayes @ShannonBream @thomasjoscelyn this is what Obama wants to do to us
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Who would have thought?
@stephenfhayes @ericmetaxas @thomasjoscelyn shocker
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn #Obama'sBrother
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn GEE WHO SAW THAT ONE COMING!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @MattMackowiak @Letstango133 I still say send the refugees to Guantanamo
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Spend a ton, cause wars, open borders, invasions, ignore ISIS 1+yr. Trump supporters know nothing. #Trump
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn But Obama promised this would NEVER happen.

@stephenfhayes @ShannonBream @thomasjoscelyn Oh shit I should have used spell check!
@stephenfhayes @ShannonBream @thomasjoscelyn  Thank you Barack Assnine Obama
@stephenfhayes @ShannonBream @thomasjoscelyn I'd hardly call this breaking, considering it was 100% predictable & preventable #failedpolicy
@stephenfhayes @ShannonBream @thomasjoscelyn imagine that according to our leader that would never happen
@stephenfhayes @cvpayne @thomasjoscelyn big surprise there lol right obamma
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn What number of leader is this Obama released - this same ass that's going to vet 10K muzzy's with his history
@stephenfhayes @SenatorTimScott @thomasjoscelyn why was he detained in the 1st place? You don't create animosity and no response.
@potus “@stephenfhayes: BREAKING: Guantanamo detainee now AQ leader  http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/12/ex-guantanamo-detainee-now-an-al-qaeda-leader-in-yemen.php … @thomasjoscelyn” @GOP @realdonaldtrump
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Gee that didn't take long to rise to the top of the dung heap.  Thanks Mr President.  Go back to sleeping.
@stephenfhayes @Uncle_Jimbo @thomasjoscelyn What? NOoooooo.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn He will probably be back in the USA soon as a 'refugee'.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Thanks, Obama!
@stephenfhayes @cvpayne @thomasjoscelyn Better tell Obama to to turn on the TV so he'll be up to speed on this.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn he was allowed to do so by Sudanese govt whose forces are invading #Yemen with #US help
.@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn He promised fundamental transformation of America...
@stephenfhayes @LukeDCoffey @thomasjoscelyn The article does not say why the US released a confirmed terrorist. Does anyone *know*?
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #tcot #Trump2016 #MOLONLABE #yuge #NRA #2A

@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn another successful Obama plan.
@stephenfhayes @seanmdav @thomasjoscelyn A "#JVTeam"
member no longer "#Contained"
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Obama remains unaware of any connection between the terrorists and overseas operatives.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn on the plus side, Barry would not have thought of shooting a Hellfire missile at him in Cuba, now: Incoming!
@stephenfhayes @JonahNRO @thomasjoscelyn 

how many "mistakes" can one prez makes b4 people realize he's not dumb and this is intentional?
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @RalphPeters was onto something..
@MichaelSmith024 @stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @ralphpeters BAWHAHAHAHAHAHA
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn THIS is why you were on the No-Fly list!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn let's not rush to judgement
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn #ThanksObama It is so amazing how people of this country did not see this coming! Vote 4 change? U got it!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn if you don't kill them in battle, they rise again
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn every person this man kills is blood in Democrat hands
.@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Un-freaking-believable. What do we say to the survivor families of our dead soldiers who died capturing him?
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Didn't see that one coming 
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Didn't see that coming and all we will hear about is Trump.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn TREASON
@stephenfhayes @cvpayne @thomasjoscelyn c'est impossible!!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn @FrostedFrakes1
@stephenfhayes @cvpayne @thomasjoscelyn but I guess that is considered "contained"
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn don't tell that to #POTUS
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn YOUR a surprised?
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Is this one of those setbacks #Obama likes to talk about? Won't be the last
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn And who other than POTUS didn't see that coming???
@stephenfhayes @chriskkenny @thomasjoscelyn Guantanamo detainee now with Al Qaeda why are we not surprised, this is what we expected.
@stephenfhayes @cvpayne @thomasjoscelyn if that isn't proof of Treason what is? Barry is a Traitor
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn So predictable ....when is the security of the US going to take precedence over politics for this WH
@stephenfhayes @benshapiro @thomasjoscelyn Oops!
@stephenfhayes @JCinQC @thomasjoscelyn Thanks Obama!
Imagine that. @stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn
@BillKristol @stephenfhayes Block Hayes since he's a Al Sharpton race-baiter. He's done!

@stephenfhayes @benshapiro @thomasjoscelyn No one saw this coming.....
@stephenfhayes @DavidMDrucker : Do you think you could at least bring yourself to advocate keeping him out of our country ? Oh,  he's Muslim
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn barack hussein obama knows exactly what he's  doing to America when he releases these detainee's. #Bergdahl
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn "Dyaum! Who woulda seen that coming?" -No One Ever
Ironically(?), Ibrahim al Qosi was allowed to fly, while @stephenfhayes was not.
@thomasjoscelyn
How can Obama keep al Qaeda 'on the run' if they're sittin' around locked up at Gitmo? @stephenfhayes @lachlan @thomasjoscelyn
@GuardAmerican @stephenfhayes @lachlan @thomasjoscelyn #MSM wanted nothing to do any and all #Admin investigation till 11/2012! Still don't
@stephenfhayes @Rigarner89 @thomasjoscelyn hhhhmmmmm.  Just like the NAZI in "Saving Private Ryan"
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn clown show.pure and simple
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Obama; returning islamonazis to the battlefield.
@stephenfhayes @benshapiro @thomasjoscelyn >> I find that hard to believe.
@stephenfhayes @benshapiro @thomasjoscelyn Thanks Obama
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn are you really surprised? No one else is..
@stephenfhayes @benshapiro @thomasjoscelyn Thanks to the loser BHO!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn - the naïveté of the left is a never-ending phenomenon
.@stephenfhayes  Amnesia still rampant at Fox :

"One was Abu Sufian bin Qumu, a suspect in the Benghazi attack."
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn.  Knew this would happen. So much for Obama's position on this
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn How could that have happened? #stupidleaders
@stephenfhayes @JoeFL65 @thomasjoscelyn That's obama's people!
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn well no one saw that coming
@stephenfhayes @EvilEsq @thomasjoscelyn Lets send POTUS a gift basket for a job well done for his people.
@stephenfhayes @Swohtz @thomasjoscelyn shocker
@stephenfhayes @cvpayne @thomasjoscelyn 
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn

Look at the bright side! Since we're not holding him, they can't use him as a recruiting tool! Wait, what??
@stephenfhayes No surprise
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Wow, that was "unexpected", like everything else in this admin (especially the economy & foreign policy).
@stephenfhayes @cvpayne @thomasjoscelyn well, as Obama would say, it's a big world
@stephenfhayes @cvpayne @thomasjoscelyn how lovely. The gift from Obama that keeps on giving.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn #ThanksObama

@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn Wel WTH just another detainee getting back to his previous career- TY @BarackObama for trusting SUDAN
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn I see many references to this in presidential election TV ads coming in the future. Good grief.
@stephenfhayes @thomasjoscelyn what a surprise, huh?
