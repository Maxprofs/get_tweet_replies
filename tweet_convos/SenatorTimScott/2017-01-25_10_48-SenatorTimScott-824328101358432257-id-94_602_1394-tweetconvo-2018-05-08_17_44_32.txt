And I choose public schools. Now, it's your responsibility to find the alleged problems and propose fixes.
You are free to choose. That's the whole point.
Only wealthy will have means and availability of schools. What do  u propose 4 rural& urban?
Lots of reform needed. End teacher tenure. End seniority based pay. Empower school principals.
What evidence based reforms do you recommend?
Lots of evidence that reforms r needed. I recommend eg professors Hanushek and Fryer.
Have you shared them with Scott & the education committee? Is Devos even aware?
Hanushek and Fryer are highly renowned academic researchers. Advisers and think tanks are aware
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott Jesus, Ted. When the dust clears, those who colluded against the American people will be ousted.
yeah just like the 1000 plus seats lost by democrat party since 2008
The American people want no part of this agenda of hate. You're for it, I see...
remember that famous old quote "elections have consequences " BHObama
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott Instead of fixing schools, you choose to give money to businesses. Misleading the public
been throwing $ @ education for years and it's worse than ever #govtistheproblem
because theyre spending money but not on quality education. Temp bump in test scores
Public schools are the backbone of America.  Vote no on Devos, she will destroy public education.
public schools are what is destroying America along with liberal leaning teachers
Michigan charter schools FAILED.  Why aren't you looking at the statistics?
South Carolina's  are thriving and have waiting lists
Charters are a recipe for disaster and you know it.  Rich will be more educated, poor will be illiterate.
@tedcruz RESIST efforts to destroy public schools.
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott how can public schools improve with less money??? Ed. is a social program not a capitalist venture
it was now its #socialengenering
.@schoolchoicewk .@tedcruz .@SenatorTimScott Why are you passing a law that mandates how local property taxes are use? States rights?
because federal government tells states how to now #neahastogo

So, you are pro-choice?
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott
better known in "inner circles" as defund "NIGGER" schools #TedCruz
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott If you care about education you will vote NO on Betsy DeVos.
Please remember that for most of us, the choice we want is NOT for-profit charter schools!
senator Bernie Sanders is amazing Tim Scott not so much
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott If you want corruption, go ahead and make K-12 more of a business model with vouchers.
So many Charter schools have gone down in flames.  Not the answer.
our local RURAL  high school just became a charter school and is THRIVING!
Also, if they 'just' became a Charter, you don't have the metrics to claim success
Get back to me in 4 years with results driven data.
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott lower area schools will have none then what then
There is no choice if public schools are not viable or robbed of money for books and teachers.
@JeffFlake I don't know one teacher who will work for #BetsyDeVos. What is your plan when the massive walkout happens?
And on goes the propaganda. Listen to your voters No DeVoss
so you guys create a holiday week for what? To say that you like it? it's already failed where implemented.
the only way to Make America Great Again is to get rid of the NEA and turn Education back to states
can't please everyone! I'm thankful I can choose a school that puts kids first, no money needed or moving!
Thank you Senator Scott!
love school choice, nice work.
Thank you, Senator Scott, for your leadership. School choice is the Civil Rights of the 21st century.
@SenTedCruz @SenatorTimScott I do not understand why this is news or something big. A resolution means nothing it's not law
The problem is not the school, the problem is the Teachers Union..
great work Tim
@SenTedCruz @SenatorTimScott This is exciting news sir!
@coinabs @SenatorTimScott YET they can't seem to find time to  APPROVE President Trump's cabinet picks.
Has the voucher system been reinstated for the DC area?
@SenTedCruz @SenatorTimScott Excellent! Parents need quality alternatives to failing public school monopolies.
@SenTedCruz @SenatorTimScott Unless that choice is to attend a well-funded public school. That's a choice the GOP fights.
@SenTedCruz @SenatorTimScott 
but isn't school choice the equivalent of people not eating at a restaurant? #DipshitCruz
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott Do not celebrate corruption and the destruction of affordable quality education.
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott When is public school week.  Why promote vouchers that hurt rural students?
@JeffFlake @SenatorTimScott and the cabinet nominees?
@JeffFlake @SenatorTimScott
American education for $ale No refunds if your child fails life because you bought Trump U pitch
There is greater value than you can imagine relative to public schools and education #GrowUpUS
@JeffFlake @SenatorTimScott BOOOOOO
How about you improve conditions in the public school system instead?  Also, empty your voicemail.
@JeffFlake You should be embarrassed, Flake. Gutting public schools with no civil rights/disabilities protections. No DeVos.
vouchers designed to kill public schools. Say no to vouchers & betsy devoss. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/12/08/a-sobering-look-at-what-betsy-devos-did-to-education-in-michigan-and-what-she-might-do-as-secretary-of-education/?utm_term=.9fdd0fbe9e47 …
@JeffFlake @SenatorTimScott "Choice" = rich, white families choose and the rest of our kids suffer
Da Fuq is this image supposed to be? The Capitol wearing a Bone Fone?
@JeffFlake @SenatorTimScott
Choice for the lucky few
Who gets first choice?
What happens when choices run out?
So when are you going to do something about the ethics issues with the president?
@JeffFlake Do not take money from public schools. DeVos is unqualified and students in Michigan have been hurt tremendously.
@JeffFlake @SenatorTimScott eff you senator
@JeffFlake @SenatorTimScott Guess you're voting to #DeVosTATE our education system, right? #dicks
I do NOT want my property tax dollars going to private or charter schools. #publicschools
@JeffFlake @SenatorTimScott Lets play GUT the public school system rich people can spend less on public and charter schools!
@JeffFlake @SenatorTimScott Thank you @SenatorTimScott. @JeffFlake needs your help.
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott POTUS spoke very badly about yr father&yr wife was ridiculed at #RNC DO SOMETHING 2STOP HIM!
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott 
Educators & parents don't support DeVoss no matter how many ways u present
Quit acting like we do
NO on DeVos.  Stop ignoring your constituents. You are not representing your voters. Never again!!!!
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott No, no, no. Please stop cutting funds for #publicschools .
Well when he accepts money from DeVos and then votes for her.  His vote is paid for.
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott May we choose for taxpayer money to go to public schools instead of private schools, please?

@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott go away little teddy
NATIONAL BULLSHIT WEEK!!
The Dems campaigned on it...of course like everything it's was just another lie
There is no more important issue today than the elimination of agenda driven education in our schools.

@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott breaking news, the us senate just set desegregation back 50 years. #racistagenda #resign

More like "National Scammer Rip-Off of Our Property Tax Dollars Week." Charter schools are a scam.
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott Nice. School Choice, Great!
Wait wuh...?  What kind of Orwellian bullshit is this?  This week is national latest ripoff week.
@tedcruz Thank you @SenatorTimScott for being a voice on behalf of the conservative majority! We appreciate you!!!
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott This bill leaves our disabled children and those in poverty vulnerable. Matthew 25:40
@tedcruz @SenatorTimScott thankyou
I choose public schools, with union teachers.

@cspanwj #UniteBlue #humor #NotMyPOTUS
@tedcruz I saw you threatened to let embassies get attacked like Benghazi if Jerusalem doesn't get embassy.  Wow!
Public education should be on notice.
