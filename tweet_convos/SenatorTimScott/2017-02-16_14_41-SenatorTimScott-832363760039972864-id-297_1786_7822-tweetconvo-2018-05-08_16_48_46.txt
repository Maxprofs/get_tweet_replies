I have never seen a more visible vice president. Its assuring to witness that both POTUS&VP are equally active.
Very important work! Black Americans should get on board for  their fair share of the Make America Great again economy!
@NAACP is claiming POTUS doesn't care about the black community @jessebwatters @FoxNews @oreillyfactor @SheriffClarke @VP @SenatorTimScott
@SenatorTimScottt
VP Pence is already reaching out to black communities! Can you state what Obama did for blacks in 8yrs?
OH.. do YOU know what Black caucus is? Did a bl reporter arrange these meetings???
Awesome!
@sunbeltgirl @SenatorTimScott @washingtonpost @nytimes VP Pence is a good honest man
Senator Scott should be our next President it would be AWESOME
You can't support black communities without acknowledging that #BlackLivesMatter.
blm is a racist organization.  All lives matter
CC @tariqnasheed @RealDLHughley @DrUmarJohnson @westthea @AprilDRyan @YvetteDC @SymoneDSanders .....
Thanks for following through.  @sigstarget @SenatorTimScott
Awesome so happy to hear
There are many POSITIVE things happening in #America right now! It's so refreshing to see #AmericaFirst
please do not act like you care for small business. When have you dealt with one in the last 10 years???
...Outstanding young Conservative Senator from South Carolina, Tim Scott.  Great job Senator, keep up the good work!
please stop using plastic water bottles! They are wasteful and bad for the environment! Thanks 
@sjhh @SenatorTimScott Need "developed" neighborhoods. Can't do that in HIGH CRIME areas. Business moves out.
Black Small Business is the way to the American Dream for men and women of the inner cities. #buyblack
well done
This is a great move. It should aim at empoweeing them rather than censorship and then detroying them one by one.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS fix flints water
Thank you for your commitment to small business owners! Obama hated us, nice to be respected again!
People, it is the small business owners that keeps America going. Obama said they didn't build that.
The political swampers give a little to the poor and take a lot from the middle-class while giving the most to themselves. Drain it!!!
@Tee_Quake @SenatorTimScott 
hopefully you and @SecondLady can come with Sen Scott to our school in Mt Pleasant, SC. No.1 STEM in nation!
Good job guys.  Keep the focus on jobs!
love the fact that you and Trump are meeting with many business leaders.
Senator Tim Scott > a profile in courage.

When are we going to have someone like Tim Scott wanting things for all americans...not just black ones?
That's amazing! Thank you very much! I hope the meeting was successful!

photo with a black senator posted the day after @POTUS treats a reporter like the DC black people secratary. #Cheap

#youafoo
@KIR_bigg50 @SenatorTimScott 
@KIR_bigg50 @SenatorTimScott I wanted to retweet this but apparently twitter is blocking
you are as much a fraud as your boss.
keep up the great work we are with you
Senator Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) could take lessons from Senator Scott!! #SCproud
keep up the good work and don't listen to to the media .
You Republicans care about no body but yourselves. If you're not filling your pockets you could care less.
Thanks for all the hard work and hours you are putting into to #maga
Amen! @SenatorTimScott is pure class.
WOW! Something the dems wld NEVER do.......actually BENEFIT THE POOR! They only USE minorities for VOTES! #MAGA
.thanks VP and small biz owners.  It looks like u r working. No big photo op, no big ratings, just results. Good luck

Sen Tim Scott has shown great character
Good,Atlanta the VP is on his job and not throwing temper tantrums on Twitter,About fake news?
if you're smart you'll jump ship now while your reputation is still somewhat intact
Tweet Tweet! I trust you were honest with them, Michael. Their success will drive the nation. #DontLie
Great.
Great.
Great.
Thanks @SenatorTimScott for actively supporting @POTUS & moving his agenda for us. The swamp dwellers refuse to #MAGA #drainingtheswamp
you ever visited a black community?
business and get equipment and build a shop
should be discussing it in all communities not just black  I am a small business owner I need capital to work my
Great Representative lots of class unlike that Bunch of Black Caucus guys who are plantation obstructionist
remember that black man wrongly convicted from elkhart you didn't pardon last year? @ammadien monster.
what about a bipartisan investigation on Trump and Russia
Cutting healthcare isn't how to encourage people to quit their jobs and start companies
It must be difficult to attempt a charm offensive when you possess no charm. Or integrity.

Get a new soul.
.@VP @SenatorTimScott Beautiful...Get #Liberals #blacklivesmatter terrorists out of govt, let some REAL black male role models step forward!
you go President Pence and Senator Scott! Thank God for you both!
That is awesome

So, @realDonaldTrump and Co are paying ppl to attend their Tampa rally this weekend. Craigslist ad has been taken down, but: 
can you guys let @realDonaldTrump @POTUS know what the CBC is bc he acted like it's the first time he's ever heard it
AMAZINGLY HOW POTUS WILL DELIVER TO OUR BLACK COMMUNITIES AS PROMISED & BLACK-A WILL FINALLY ALL VOTE TRUMPENCE IN 2020
nice to read that this is taking shape & becoming a reality.
@SBAgov @SenatorTimScott - INVESTIGATE RUSSIA TIES, CONFLICTS of INTEREST & CORRUPTION. And fix this natl security mess.
yeah Tim worked for that small business run by DeVos #payToPlay
now if you only gave two shits about the black community.
nice try. We are all still talking about @POTUS presser train wreck.
I know you are trying to keep your chin up . Must be hard to be the only adult in the room Maybe leave before your career sinks
what are you doing Bout Russia and its aggression towards the US
Thank you Mr Vice President. We love your care for Americas buisness leaders. We couldnt do it without your help!
employ the lgbt community .
I think that’s great but what about existing small business that need your help?
great tweet. Like there is no chaos in the administrative branch. Can we hear about your Valentines party too?
Chuga Chuga Choo Choo; It's Gonna Be Yuuge!
And nothing will get done!
Loves meeting you, Tim Scott!!

Robert Harward wisely opted NOT to board the Titanic just before it plows into an iceberg.

#KremlinGate…
Hey Pence, they've put you in the class dummy role; enjoying it?
love seeing government working for the people
What do you know about McCain taking to Prank caller
AWESOME
well it would be great if all of the WH acted like this half the time. But that would be crazy to think
If Bannon is POTUS and Trump is @VP, what would ya say...ya do here, Mike? @SenatorTimScott
this is beautiful
You don't give a damn about black communities so stop pretending that you do.
Posting images of you hugging black business owners in February is NOT going to win the approval of black people.  EXPLOITATION much?
If you want to support black communities, try giving a shit about public education.
STOP using the term Obamacare he's around the corner wanting to fuck you and you're using his name every day, STOP!!!!
It is criminal how much Obama neglected the Black communites and Black entrepreneurs, Trump and Pence truly care.
Happy to see these meetings going on!  Another promise kept by our President when campaigning! Not many keep promises!
love senator scott. a great up and coming leader.
I'm assuming @AprilDRyan set that meeting up for you? #ImpeachTrump

People are starting to realize that it's not smart to board a sinking ship. https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/832361996473495553 …
omgeez for a second there, I thought you were saying Session has small ball!
omg. A person of color. Was there any women. Omg. One women. It's progress. So now try to replicate it
Get hip.  They are African American communities.
Can you explain to @realDonaldTrump that all black people don't personally know one another. It's embarrassing.
you guys can't do that the world wants you to be racists we know better thank you make our inner cities great again
Great, but did Omarosa set the meeting up? What a joke and waste of tax payer dollars. Kellyann too!
THIS is good stuff...Can't wait for more like this!
That's nice but you might want to check on your boss. He had a complete breakdown today #impeachtrump
We included Tim Scott cause you know he's a black.
GREAT PHOTO-OP WITH YOUR ONE TOKEN BLACK MAN!!!   KUDOS, MIKE!!!
Loving the Trump/Pence agenda.
so who does Pence tales his orders from? Trump or Bannon?
pence you got your balls out of bannon's pocketbook?
