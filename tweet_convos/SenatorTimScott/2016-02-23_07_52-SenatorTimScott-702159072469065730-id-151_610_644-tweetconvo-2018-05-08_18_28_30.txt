@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse we just had someone kill 6 people who is more dangerous someone already locked up or our own people you decide
@beachcoaststyle @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse of course you would choose terrorist over any American
@donnakaye2014 @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse it was an American who killed six people so what's his issue?
@beachcoaststyle @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Ever researched or studied the savages in Gitmo or their fellow citizens? Hate in their hearts
@donnakaye2014 @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse what about the hate the American had for killing six people and what about the four killed in AZ
@beachcoaststyle @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse point made Hate! Doesn't excuse the savages being bought here on purpose who hate everybody
@donnakaye2014 honestly I don't worry about terrorist I worry about that nut with a gun who shoots 6 people at once it happens all the time
@beachcoaststyle Guess San Bernardino isn't a wake up call then? Guess we should ignore them bc they were not nuts with ideology of hate
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse What efforts are you making to stop Obama from giving #Gitmo back to Cuba?
@SenatorTimScott @VitoandVitoShow @WhiteHouse Yet who is going to stop him? Oh that's right House & Senate not enough for Congress to do job
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Establishment Republicans move their mouths but let OBAMA & DEMOCRATS control America. SCARED OF OBAMA!
@daynutrition @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Scared or complicit?/Status quo. Tired of voting for one person that has two faces Backs Rub liar
@SenatorTimScott @eaaknighterrant @WhiteHouse 
The Congress / Senate/  House needs to be gutted. Full of cowards.
They let America down.
@SenatorTimScott I've seen @tedcruz & @RandPaul filibuster. Let's see you or Marco stop government over this. Be courageous! Lead!
@Mostofsky @SenatorTimScott @tedcruz @RandPaul 
I agree
SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN OVER GITMO
Next year GOP will be an asterisk.
@GOPBSBusters @SenatorTimScott @tedcruz @RandPaul just like last time. historic majority in house, and took back the Senate.
@Mostofsky 
Sure keep dreaming. 0% chance of winning WH (Trump pissed off 1/2 of all gopers) + MANY blue states to defend in senate.
@GOPBSBusters whether this analysis is true or not, shutting govt only helped GOP w/elections.
@Mostofsky When turnout is 35% and is mainly right wing loons, sure. In general election? No chance.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Well then work to.stop him. Very disappointing that you backed. Immigration pusher Rubio.
@SenatorTimScott Military experts agree w/ President that it's existence is creating more terrorist, being used for recruiting. GOP r fools.
@SenatorTimScott you can't get it thru his head the difference between lawless person & WAR he's a lib asswipe who never played soldier
@SenatorTimScott @Gdsblssd1 This would include Gitmo, Rape-fugee's, more muzzies, or any other single person not 100% vetted & cleared 100%
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @hrw this is the problem
@SenatorTimScott @BlackburnRuth Does the @WhiteHouse have the ability to maintain a perpetual state of war?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Uh, Tim - you might have heard - this Pres couldn't give a damn about laws when he's inconvenienced.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse 
"Law? I don't know that word..." -- @POTUS
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse God help us when @congressdotgov materializes authority and accepting terrorists like they're Syrian refugees.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse sounds legit
like the potus gives a shit what the law says @SenatorTimScott @RachelCohen12 @WhiteHouse
Shame on you >@SenatorTimScott You Cannot call anyone "terrorists" if you unconstitutionally refuse to give them a fair trial #lying #weasel
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse how is this any different from prior lawless actions? It's not.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @POTUS is responsible for enforcing law? Terrorism is against the law? I believe he does. Article II.
@KenWarnock @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @POTUS their terrorist acts were in other countries.  Should be turned over to those countries.
@ezy06001 @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @POTUS There's an idea!!!
@SenatorTimScott @NatShupe @WhiteHouse when has that ever matter to this pos potus?
@SenatorTimScott what exactly is going to happen?Are they supermen who'll escape from supermax? #nothingbutfearitself #homeofthebrave #USA
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse i agree, but should they be kept forever? How's that good for them or us? Why not imprison them state side?
@SenatorTimScott The Obama admin are lawless--and congress has not for the most stopped them when they could!
@SenatorTimScott Even though the law is clear RE Gitmo, he has proven the law means nothing to him. Who made him untouchable?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse REPUBLICANS will back down as usual & let him continue his LAWLESSNESS. It would be RACIST to not let it happen
@daynutrition @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse vote for Trump!!!
@JPVWAG @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse i can get behind all these MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ideas.
@daynutrition @JPVWAG @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse yep we've lost all faith in DC ur the Lawless Administration
@SpecialKMB1969 @JPVWAG @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse You got the right!
@SenatorTimScott @SassyPantsjj @WhiteHouse Seeing as Barry wipes his ass with the constitution, what difference does it make?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse  Obama knows Congress doesn't have the ball's to stop him.
@SenatorTimScott @Saint_Obama @WhiteHouse very true Senator but how could you sell your honor for the establishment.  @GOP is done.
@SenatorTimScott @Soldierjohn @WhiteHouse Unfortunately #Obama doesn't give a crap about our laws.  He'll probably just sneak them in.
@SenatorTimScott @Owlie17 @WhiteHouse the laws are so clear that Barack should be in jail next to Hillary no question so what's your point
@SenatorTimScott @GAAnnieLonden @WhiteHouse And what will you do to stop him?
@LjHaupt @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse BO should be arrested.  Revolution!
@GAAnnieLonden @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse a long time ago
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse not without congressional support. Americans don't want these foreign terri oats on American soil.
@SenatorTimScott @LuanneCarey When has that stopped him
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @CNCKSTER @POTUS need only break the lease with Cuba and that throws the whole issue back in Congress's lap
@SenatorTimScott @Day4wisewoman @WhiteHouse Tim Scott, I knew I liked you! Tim Scott :Great for South Carolina, MarcoRubio:Great for America
@SenatorTimScott @NetworksManager @WhiteHouse Bothers you, does it?  How 'bout @TGowdySC?  Does it bother him too?
@SenatorTimScott Senator, the White House doesn't have the authority for half the things it's done. Do you think this will be any different?
@SenatorTimScott You & fellow Senators have stood by and let BHO take dictatorial power-I no longer trust you=Rubio @tedavis62 @WhiteHouse
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse stay strong
@SenatorTimScott @NetworksManager @WhiteHouse that is most probably true
@SenatorTimScott @NetworksManager anybody supporting Marco Rubio does not have the right to talk bad about anybody
@SenatorTimScott @Minuteman_1756 @WhiteHouse This is not a school debate and Obama doesn't follow laws. Cut off his money and shut him down.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC Since when does our Pen-In-Chief adhere to or abide by America's written Laws?#Guantanamo
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse How much more blood does Obama want on his hands? Imprison terrorists in the US, make jail breaks inevitable.
@SenatorTimScott @NatShupe @WhiteHouse Oh, like 'lack of authority' has EVER stopped this administration,....
@SenatorTimScott @mimimayesTN if ukeep letting the littlevil one smear his feces in the peoples house&donot correct him, he'll keep doin it!
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse release them to an isolated building in Syria & Obama will order a drone hit without hesitation.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Why is admin bringing this up again if we already have a law. Enforce the law Congress.
@SenatorTimScott @ChrisBowen25 @WhiteHouse Just like how the Constitution couldn't be more clear forbidding indefinite detention.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse deliver all the prisoners to the Saudis.   They know what to do with then.
@senatortimscott @whitehouse @sejehh The White House make up there own laws
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse the Presidents speech insults reason & intellect.  A prison is a prison is a prison, regardless of the zip code
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse You endorsed #MarcoRubio Did you even read his proposals in the #GangOf8 bill? #OpenBorders #Amnesty
@SenatorTimScott @RonJellison @WhiteHouse The Constitution will not stop anything.That will take Congress & the will of the American people.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse - if you think the potus is concerned with authority or the safety of Americans, you are mistaken.
@SenatorTimScott Read this! @marcorubio & @tedcruz & Obama are NOT ELIGIBLE, none r NaturalBornCitizens! #gop #tcot
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Obama doesn't follow the law and the GOP makes very little move to STOP him.
@SenatorTimScott 
Law couldn't be clearer on natural born citizen clause! Born in  country to CITIZEN parents (plural)! 
Rubio not eligible
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse It must be stopped now! What are you going to Congress?
@SenatorTimScott @NatShupe @WhiteHouse they are on their way to SC! Stop it, since you and Haley are so smart!
@SenatorTimScott @NatShupe @WhiteHouse that won't stop Obama. He'll do it anyway & no SCOTUS majority to impede him
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @NatShupe So, what are you going to do about it, the world wants to know?
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Then why have you allowed him to settle those captured at our borders into American communities.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Right on Senator!
@SenatorTimScott @Cjwebb7 @WhiteHouse Since when has Obama cared about law?  And since when has the Senate had the spine to stop him?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse ; Tim, you are THE Man!
@pghdads @SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse So stop him
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse well, what is Congress going to do about it? Americans elected republicans to stop BO & you ppl do NOTHING!
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC And that is why @POTUS & @WhiteHouse is sending you a plan! Do you have a plan Senator????? RRRRrright!!!
@SenatorTimScott @VlanTrunk @WhiteHouse Move them all to South Carolina, they will fit right in with the locals.
@SenatorTimScott @obamanonsense @WhiteHouse ART WORLD IS ALREADY PREPARING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMPS PICTURE FOR THE WH HAVING TROUBLE WITH HAIR
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Correct and that's why he's bringing it before Congress. Simply vote no if you don't agree.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse  Not everyone in Guantanamo is a terrorist!The U.S captures without evidence presented/ trial in a lot of cases
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse  Senator has that ever been a problem for this arrogant ideological sob in the WH??
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Laws & constitution have never impeded this in-American Marxist-Islamist POTUS. Gitmo no exception
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @TGowdySC  YOU ARE WRONG ,!!!!!!! .
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC snake2872
But he does for thousands of muslims?
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse what was the authority that established that prison?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse since when did the law apply to Obama or Hillary.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse really? what r u going 2 do? The same u did w/Obamacare, PP, Budget? NOTHING! All talk no action! SAD
.@SenatorTimScott It seems like
Pres. Obama is more concerned about fulfilling a promise than protecting the American people. @WhiteHouse
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Hey, Rubio supporter, do you think he gives a rat's behind about the law.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Then Congress & the Courts MUST take action. Cannot continue 2 allow Obama 2 abuse power & ignore laws
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Can't someone stop him? Is the @GOP truly impotent!!?? This is NOT "who we are"! This is who "he is": a tyrant!
@SenatorTimScott  US got more deaths caused by 'mentally ill' police "self defence" etc than terror related deaths in North America combjned
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse @TGowdySC From what I can tell, the law is whatever Obama wants it to be. & u, Gowdy, & Rubio have enabled him.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse I don't think Mr. Obama really cares about the laws, Constitution, or the citizens of the U.S.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse since when has this administration obeyed any laws?
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Since when has the Emperoe, Obama, bothered to obey the law?
“@SenatorTimScott-law couldn't be clearer-WH no authority to move dozens of terrorists to U.S.] 

SINCE WHEN HAS HIS LAW BREAKIN MATTERED 2U
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC Detainees will teach Radical Islam to hardcore Prisoners. Do we want that?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse then I guess you have nothing to worry about then
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse This President doesn't care about the law, constitution or American people. That should be evident.
@cathyspartanj @steph93065 @RonBasler1 @SenatorTimScott @dunn_cheri @WhiteHouse @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump TWO ESTABLISHMENT RINO'S LEFT!
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse bless your heart. s.c. sure has idiots n all branches of gov. representing them--maybe they deserve u
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse 
OK Tim - there are hundreds of dangerous serial killers in US prisons. Are you ready to move them out?
@GOPBSBusters @SenatorTimScott But do all those American serial killers try to recruit others to kill for their cause? It's different.
@SenatorTimScott @KatMcKinley @WhiteHouse oh THIS white house has Obamauthority. Because feckless Republican senate concedes to him.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse you wont move them to America ... u will send them to the east and u will accuse Muslims of being terrorists
@SenatorTimScott when has the law stopped Obama?
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse prison employees & families will become targets to break out detainees
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Has that ever stopped this president? Feckless GOP will allow it to slide-like always
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse I sure hope not.
@SenatorTimScott @KatMcKinley @WhiteHouse And I thought you were conservative.  Nothing conservative about Rubio
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse  then Y don't politicians stop him? That's why AMERICA'S VOTING @realDonaldTrump.  NOT A POLITICIAN
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse But, I do what I want. Silly little peasants...
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse ok GOP my question - what are you doing to stop it ?!
@SenatorTimScott You damn fool that Guantanamo concentration camp is a shame for you and your barbaric country, stop oppressing people!!
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC Yet nobody is doing anything to stop this lawless president.  Tell me I'm wrong!
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse he laughs at your law...L'Etat c'est Moi
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse POTUS only concerned about  his version of his world in his small world mind his private sandbox
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Sick of paying hundreds of millions to support congressional obstructionism.  #gitmo #closegitmo #Guantanamo
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse so what are you going to propose to stop this
@SenatorTimScott What about a plan to do his job & seal our borders? No, bring more terrorists from Gitmo to poison our federal prisons!
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Well let's hope that Congress doesn't assume its normal position bent over the table & let it happen.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse and just what are you and absent Rubio going to do about it
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse When this lawless Pres talks about rule of law I want to stomp my feet & throw a tantrum like a child
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse so does this give him the authority to just release them as he has been doing?
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse so stop him
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Well do something other than tweet about it. All I hear from you guys are #Soundbites.
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC #Guantanamo is outside of Magna Carta, outside of Madison's Constitution and outside of the Bill of Rights. #tcot
@SenatorTimScott @TGowdySC @WhiteHouse Stop him!
@IranAware @SenatorTimScott Law also said Obama had to notify Congress 30 days prior to Bergdahl exchange. Yet no impeachment. #tcot
@IranAware @Connectionary @SenatorTimScott What would Marco say...
@SenatorTimScott @SharplyRight @WhiteHouse This better be stopped in its tracks! #ImpeachObama for treason!
@Longtails53 @SenatorTimScott @SharplyRight @WhiteHouse absolutely.  Treason for putting americans in jeopardy on our own soil
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse But he has a pen
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse 
I'm sure @SenTedCruz will stand and fight...unlike your cowardly candidate @marcorubio
@SenatorTimScott @masspa1032 @WhiteHouse #THANK YOU
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse commander-in-chief of US military doesn't have authority over military base. got it.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse The law is even clearer than that. The US does have the duty to abide by Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse what law is this?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Are our facilities not safe?  Why the fear tactics?
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse I thought senators would have better facts. We did elect you too. They are moving them to other faculties
@SenatorTimScott @WhiteHouse Since when does the "Law" matter in politics and policy?
