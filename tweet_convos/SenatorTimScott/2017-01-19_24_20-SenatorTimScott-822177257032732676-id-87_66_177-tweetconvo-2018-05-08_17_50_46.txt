You are too busy making a fool of yourself at hearings. Retire in legislator comfort before full senility sets in.
How about not using taxpayers time and money to work on your stand up act.
@thehill Abusing prescription drugs? Explains alot about ur words & actions. You're a damn US Senator. Act like a statesman.
@thehill shame on you for today sir. Shame on you.
Thank you, Senator for protecting us and especially out great city of Leavenworth.
very good to see you defend illegal torture and a base that violates international law. Shows what kind of person you are
lets hope your watch ends soon
@thehill isn't time for a retirement watch you old coot?
We're getting a joke in the Oval Office. We don't need your jokes in confirmation hearings, funny boy.
@thehill take that Valium.
@thehill Do you make it a habit of taking benzodiazepines on a daily basis? Do voters know you do? Do you have a prescription
Valium? Why would you want to sedate those that question Wall Street corruption? Rhetorical question. We know why.
@thehill honey, have some warm milk and ask your nurse to put you to bed now. You've had a long day.
Yes Pat we know you like tRump want to fill it up with bad dudes & waterboard them. It's what you do. #MSNBC. Take a Valium.
Yeah, you're a profile in patriotism and courage. When does "Phase Two" of your WMD investigation start? Phony.
@thehill and if Obama wanted to keep it open You'd say it cost 2much & you'd fight to close it
We've seen u do this for 8yrs
.@SenPatRoberts Of course not.  Why would you vote on any legislature requested by @POTUS  You will continue obstruction until his last day.
.@SenPatRoberts You & your obstructionist cronies of these 8 yrs hv needed much more than valium to #DoYourJob 2/3 @POTUS @SenateDems
.@SenPatRoberts Yet no @SenateDems or @POTUS have disrespected u as u did @RonWyden @SenSherrodBrown @POTUS in 2day's hearing. Pls retire!
Seriously, it's time for you to spare KS the embarrassment and retire!
@thehill investigate Senator Roberts as a drug dealer. PS - wasn't funny yesterday or today.
good, maybe you can visit the old asshat in prison?  Sneak him in some Valium?
@TEN_GOP I can't recognize Melania with clothes on and I'm certain Abe want run the fuck away too! 
nice try Poobah. Everyone know the dems then because the republicans now.
That Valium comment was rude and unacceptable. Kansas is watching.
...So you're saying you support an illegal torture facility. Gross.
@thehill You're the reason why nobody wants to live Kansas anymore.
I became a fan of Senator Pat @SenPatRoberts today! I still am instructing you to pass a term limits bill ASAP! #TermLimits
take a Valium you complete & utter ***
@thehill Here's a pinprick of humor--how about a Viagra pill, Grampy?
We have a "watch" too. We'll put you out of a job ASAP.
We need new people with new, intelligent, less partisan ideas representing us in DC. We're only as good as the people rep. us
@thehill From what I hear, the only thing on your watch is gay porn. Nothing wrong with that, but you might want to come out.
@thehill You must know it's illegal to share drugs that are regulated by the DEA ?? #valium
Good Job Senator! As good as your daughter's blow job!
@thehill   Mr. Roberts, u acted like a bitter old man. Better take a dose of your valium. Is that how u make decisions? Drugs
running the government is serious, and that you think a racist, sexist, bigot  noms are funny, you are one of them.
@thehill no need to get your panties in a knot, just take a Valium.
u made a complete ass out on Ron during the hearing!!
Just take Valium!
@thehill Please maintain your dignity and no disrespect to colleagues or speakers!
@thehill Oh sure, what a jerk; fill it up with terror 
If Sen. Ron Wyden needs a Valium then you Sir need a rope around your neck.
Pat it you who needs 2 take valium.
You have sold country to Russians.
No, nothing productive should ever get done on your watch.  Just keep screwing the American people over and collect your paycheck.
Can't wait dor your watch to be over. Time for some common sense and reason to represent KS.
Maybe you are right - because it might have room for you!
U R and embarrassment to true Republicans. SHAME ON YOU!
You're an insult to democracy.
Pat, Kansas is a mess financially. Enough with the posturing, it's embarrassing. #SwampDwellers
about the valium thing?Right on spot sir!America commends and loves you!
@thehill  but u r  ok shutting down ACA Social Sec. Medicare Medicaid & Planned Parenthood.
oh,look another Gushing On Putin party member who needs to take some Valium. Does he like Golden Showers too?
Nothing has happened on your watch to help citizens in any way,shape or form.
why don't a take a bottle of Valium and go take a dirt nap?
@thehill Take an opiate pill mr drug pusher #shame
@thehill  what else doesn't happen on your watch? Oh right - free and equal education without the fear of guns. #kansas
Hell NO!
@seanhannity @TomCottonAR @KellyTrump2016 @realDonaldTrump @unconcious0 @DarrellIssa @
what?
But....why. Besides politics?
@SenatorTimScott @thehill Should really start to watch your failing state and maybe a take a seat while you're at it. :/ 
Pat, just take a valium. No need to get heated about it.
No you would rather the taxpayer continue 2 foot bill 4 those 60 detainees. Cost 2015: $445 million. Ur watch needs 2 end.
Think of how many guns could be sold if they move the detainees to the mainland!!
#PATAKEAVALIUMROBERTS
Thank you, Sir    @thehill
It's awesome that we keep an offshore prison for people that we've scooped up and black bagged across the globe.

Right?! Awesome?
Drug Addicted @SenPatRoberts Always Has Valium On Hand 
Yeah boy, you sure protected us, didn't you. I bet the people of Guantanamo are tired of being constantly bombed.
can I get some Valium from you?
