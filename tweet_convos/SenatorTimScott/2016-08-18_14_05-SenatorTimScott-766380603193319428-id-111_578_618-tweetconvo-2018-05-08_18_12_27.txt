@jackeekgonzalez @ABC Republicans politicians are pathetic. I Celebrate the return of American Hostages. You whine and lie.
@2CHRONICLES_714 They admitted it after they denied it. Then they saw the evidence had them nailed. They r also LIARS!
@TGowdySC Giving Aid & Comfort To Enemies Of The USA Is TREASON Article 3 Section 3 US Constitution
Sad to see you twist Hague Tribunal Settlement into a http://ransom.You  had an opportunity to be an important Republican.TheFlunky
somebody tell me why we payed 400 mill. was given for ransom when we gave them money already and Iran deal?
You can rephrase anything to mean something different. Stop redressing things into what they are not
@TGowdySC Lies lies everywhere lies. Sing along
not unlike the Benghazi Clinton Obama video lie.
It's painfully obvious this is ransom and another $%#%ing BHO deception
@SenateGOP 

This money will fund Hamas and Hezbollah. How is this not " giving aide and comfort to the enemy?"
What they do with the $400m we paid to them shouldn't be your concern
@TGowdySC Also, the 6 billion dollars Hillary lost! Along with the 4 lives lost in Benghazi! Hillary's 2 different stories!
@TGowdySC And how come we keep giving ungodly sums to our enemies?
Another $400m will be paid to Iran pretty soon. What ransom will that be?
"PAYMENT WAS CONTINGENT"? Hostage said that PLANE WAITED FOR OTHER PLANE (WITH MONEY) B4 LEAVING... WHICH IS IT?
We know how corrupt the Admins, but what is being done about it, e.g., Hillary still loose. Can anyone stop her?
@TGowdySC the state department is in the crooks back pocket. And they are the ones to look at these new emails  why them
@TGowdySC what insurance do we have that in these new emails if there is a smoking gun the state dept won't delete it
@TGowdySC How did they become  prisoners in the 1st place?
@mich_83x they are lying
Ransom is paying someone with YOUR money.   Leverage is holding THEIR money and refusing to give it to them.
GOP intellectually challenged, slow-learners. Leverage def not same as ransom; cant b ransom if it's Iran's money
if Iran now doing this, they r nobetter than Isis, but they r Muslims, & like rabid dogs,expect them to act like rabid dogs
@TGowdySC the right bitches that the Iran deal didn't include prisoners.So when it does they bitch about that. Disingenuous
And Congress could do nothing about it? What happened to "power of the purse"?

@TGowdySC @ABC why aren't they going to jail
afraid not it is called the debate immunity clause in the Constitution.
get behind Trump finally someone reaching out to Black Americans
Who were the prisoners and why were they worth 400 million dollars?
At least we saved lives.Unlike the Benghazi witch trails u spend 5-50 million for fake wrong doing. Vulgar really
@TGowdySC Pretty dumb to do the same thing your are investigating someone for.
More BS spin by R's. US held the $400 million WE OWED Iran hostage until OUR people were released and returned.
@SenateGOP @ABC
@SenateGOP @ABC
@SenateGOP @ABC 

Is it a ransom, if its already their money?
Details.
@ABC #bahrain yet another Obama cock up. What a mess he leaves the world in. What a shame . USA DESERVES BETTER
@LivingstonLD22 @ABC He should have just shipped the Iranians TOW anti-tank missiles like Reagan did right? #TCOT
@SenateGOP My question is this: if we made this great deal w/Iran; why are they holding Americans in the first place?
@SenateGOP @ABC it's sad that we have to sit here and tell ourselves all politicians lie we have a chance to change that,DT
@SenateGOP @ABC 
Someone needs jailed
@SenateGOP Sen Scott I have land 4 sale at the bottom of the Hudson River . Want to bye into that?
@SenateGOP Here's the thing democratic supporters don't care about lying cheating stealing or corruption
@POTUS Hmmm. The Reps forget that their idol, RReagan, literally paid ransom for hostages. The GOP spins history
@SenateGOP @ABC ransom is not defined as giving someone something that is THIERS already. The money was owed idiot.
Everything destroy me makes me stronger.
when will you disavow trump.
@TGowdySC @ABC Why isn't OBAMA being ARRESTED
of course complete distortion but realityGOP hates like US & r democracy try undo @POTUS elections w obstruction
Obama admits to ransom?Isnt that sort of against the law?Where did he get the money?Parents can't pay ransom.Crooked
and what will the Senate do...? Hopefully not sit on its hands.
@TGowdySC @ABC 
We are becoming a banana republic.
Even honest Democrats are hearing lie, after lie,after lie. For 8 years
@TGowdySC @ABC So, who is going to jail?? .....ps I want my money back! Cia nsa fbi doj??? Nobody????
@TGowdySC @ABC  Since the president BROKE US LAW he can be impeached, right? I mean Clinton was impeached 4 less. #justice
what's new? To much cover up 
Is this legally wrong?
@TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott tired of this corrupt administration
@TGowdySC @ABC Funny how our POTUS just recently told Americans "This is nothing new"! Lies from BO, lies from HRC-Typical!
Like people are confused.  Ransom standoff: "Give the money.  "Give me the prisoner."   Something's gotta budge.
This is a case of the #LibDems shits!!!
@TGowdySC @ABC  you guys need to get obama out of office he is destroying it. The money the muslims, r freedom,terrorists
@TGowdySC ...That should have been LEVERAGE.
@TGowdySC ... LEVERAG is the new progressive term for quid pro quo/ransom.
@TGowdySC Thank you for the update! Prayers for you & all of our countries leaders. 
State Dept - "Oh you said ransom? We thought you said 'ran some.' No one ran anywhere, so we said the money wasn't for that
Thank you for the update! Prayers for you & all of our leaders.
That is called cruel and unusual punishment.
GET A LIFE TIM THAT WAS LAST WEEKS NEWS .
and that makes it any less valid? 7 yrs later bush is still being blamed. Can we use ur excuse there?
BUSH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST , HE IS A WAR CRIMINAL .NUFF SAID .
and you are a moron to think he is responsible for anything more then Iraq which Obama screwed up. Nuffsaid
A SMALL MINDED MENTAL MIDGET LIKE YOU SEEM TO BE REALLY DOESN'T DESERVE AN ANSWER .
@TGowdySC @ABC
@TGowdySC @ABC obama does whatever he wants, and pretty much has for the last 8 years... hildabeast will continue the ilk.
@TGowdySC   How can we tolerate an administration that lies to us repeatedly until confronted with proven facts?
its called they are Democrats. It's what they do. When u have the media on ur side u can say whatever.
@TGowdySC A couple of wks ago LYING OBAMA AS$URED THE AMERICAN PPL THAT7 IRANIANS WERENT PD A RANSOM????
@TGowdySC @ABC Then WHAT can be done about it? WHY won't anything be done about it? CAN Obama be censured for it?
the gop won't risk alienating the African American vote by impeaching Obama.
@TGowdySC Where did it come from?
@TGowdySC
That Algiers Accord sounds even worse than it originally did when we end up paying Iran damages plus interest.
@TGowdySC @ABC And just what will the Senate do about it?  Hold more hearings?  Do something, please!
they will whine and campaign on it. Nothing more. Where did the money come from?
What are you going to do about it????
Why is controversial?  We owed Iran the $. Refused to pay for years. Then agreed to pay if we got something in return.
incredible you fault State for squeezing Iran. Iran ransomed its own $$$ back with the prisoners. No good deed unpunished
start the impeachment proceedings!!
"Fueling suspicions by the Republicans"? No Democrats suspected it?
@JoyAnnReid Let's hear from the Obama and Hillary surrogates. Oh wait, they will be silent.
to busy golfing while folks in Louisiana swim for higher ground. Shhh
So better idea is to give the $400M back as required by Hague ruling and not try to have American prisoners released?
you do realize how this looks to the hostage takers of the world right? Americans be smart stay home.
Does telling part of the story twisting this story into "ransom" money(which it wasn't) helps?
does the press release in Iran and prisoner testimony not fit ur narrative bother u?
so what?  Its not like there isn't a precedent for paying Iran money to release hostages.
This administration has never been transparent and no one seems to care
Really everyone knew this except those that are wearing their welders glasses...even then they would say it never happened
Depends how you say something: "I forced him to take the gun out of my face by slapping his palm with my wallet."
and then stupid enough to vote 4 more yrs of it with HRC....hello people
why does it take so long for the obama administration to be truthful ?
Giving them their money back is not ransom. But nice try.
you don't give money back to terrorists, except Muslim Obama.....but nice try
