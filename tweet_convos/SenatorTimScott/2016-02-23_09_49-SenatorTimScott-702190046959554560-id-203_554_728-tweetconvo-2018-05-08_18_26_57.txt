@TGowdySC @angie_eeee yea ACLU will make sure they have habeas corpus and a platform CAIR will want them access to other prisoners
Our prisons will be excellent recruiting grounds for ISIS, al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab, et al. #Gitmo #jihad  @socityjim | @TGowdySC
@angie_eeee @socityjim @TGowdySC -They already are. Most "American" converts are black males. Fact.
@TGowdySC well hell if he does impeach that dam Muslim
@TGowdySC @julieruzicka95 that's better than turning the fkers lose. Put them out in Colorado 20 feet under ground.
@TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott Obama trades the law for votes, labels it compassion. Compassion for who?
@TGowdySC So...what are you going to do about it, the world wants to know?
@MCTStJames @TGowdySC Exactly. the same thing he did against Hillary. NOTHING. It's all Rinos do, run their mouth pretending 2B conservative
@TGowdySC Another "against the law" that doesn't matter. O does what he wants/is never held accountable. It's almost as if he IS the law.
@TGowdySC Absolutely! And it is stupid too.
@TGowdySC Prosecute
@TGowdySC Barry doesn't care!
@TGowdySC @NatShupe what Do you expect from a pinhead !!!!
@TGowdySC Why don't you people that we elected do your job ?  Fire him !!
@TGowdySC umm but you endorsed the Amnesty King
@marcorubio 
#hypocritemuch?
@likeitor_lumpit @TGowdySC @marcorubio This Nimrata (her real name) Haley and family. Real Americans only.
what's reckless and dangerous is your being in the House and able to tweet.
@TGowdySC @ColdironVicki That never stopped Obama before....& neither have the Republicans!
@TGowdySC @SenCoryGardner Close Gitmo!
@TGowdySC @ResistTyranny well Trey um,,uh, can you stop that thingy for us? P.s why have you gone soft?
@TGowdySC @ResistTyranny then do something more than just talk about it.
@TGowdySC then please do something to stop this reckless Prez.  the GOP has given in to him long enough so please hold strong on this issue
@TGowdySC @MSymbolik Then why did you oppose the only candidate that stood up to Obama?
@SilverSummerSun @LexingtonBobby Cruz didn't stand up 2 BHO . Cruz voted for Amnesty . Is a globalist backed by Beck & other whacks .
@jimalle26279141 @LexingtonBobby That's not true. Rubio did Gang of 8 and Trump was still swilling gin with HIllary. Cruz was the only one.
Trey-if you read this-why MUST refugees B relocated? Why no int'l ctrld safe zones w/ food/med in region, financed by oil revenue?
@TGowdySC @ResistTyranny what will you do about it Trey I hope more than you have with Hillary and #Benghazi 
@TGowdySC don't you know, HE'S above the law! Isn't it obvious!!
@TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott and you have no other solution but justify its worth $80M /yr but yet u won't look after out vets. HYPOCRITE!
@TGowdySC @POTUS STUPIDLY (HE LIKES THAT WORD!) SAYS GITMO IS AN ISIS RECRUITING TOOL ? SO MOVING THEM TO U.S. WOULDN'T EVEN BE WORSE!!!
@TGowdySC yea yea yea keep strutting that's all you RINOs like to do.
@TGowdySC @aemdee so what your saying expect Obama to do this unlawful act and remain consistent just saying
What are you going to DO about it??? @TGowdySC #DoSOMETHING
@TGowdySC Trey you need to stop him we the American people demand it
@TGowdySC Then have a warrant issued for the arrest of Barack Obama...as well as Articles of Impeachment. It shouldn't have taken this long!
@TGowdySC  As if laws mean anything to BO!  This man should have been impeached years ago-why is Congress afraid to do its duty?
@TGowdySC @NatShupe What are you going to do about? Nothing as usual. Hold him accountable for once.
@TGowdySC We know it's lawless. What are you willing to do about it?
@TGowdySC PEE WEE!
@TGowdySC your speaking to the choir I think, stop him, what would Marco do....
@TGowdySC why not relocate him there and out of office!
@TGowdySC that's correct mr. Gowdy and what Hillary Clinton did  letting our boys die is also criminal but nothing happened to her scumbags
@TGowdySC it will save tax payers Billions & Billions of Dollars, Sense When this Muslim cares One Bit about Saving Money esp. Americans $$$
@TGowdySC 1) You and @GOP can do something substantive to stop him or 2) go on TV and just whine abt it, like the last 7 yrs.
@TGowdySC This isn't about closing GITMO & u know it! Giving it back to Cuba.
@TGowdySC @GAAnnieLonden and what will Congress do to stop him??
@TGowdySC
Grab them balls & stop #LawlessObama!
Don't F-up like #Benghazi!
We know #RobioRubio #CanuckCruz are MIA!
@TGowdySC   Thank you !
@TGowdySC @ER93442886 And, What have you all done to stop him? Not a dam thing, We're watching and waiting!
@TGowdySC @jds81051 HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO DESTROY AMERICA 
@savipaige @TGowdySC @jds81051 of major concern is removing 2k military and giving that base to who?
@TGowdySC @melanoma321 And since it is against the law Representative. What do you intend to do about it
@TGowdySC what law? This administration violates so many laws so fast the legal system has no ability to catch up for the next century.
@TGowdySC @TheVoiceOfPaulR You're up there Trey - do something about it
@TGowdySC   Trey he has to be worried on what is going to happen to him after the election anything could happen
@TGowdySC trey. You are one of our last hopes until he is removed from office hold their feet to the fire
@TGowdySC he could care less his whole agenda is to allow the Moslems to take over
@TGowdySC @realDonaldTrump And Congress just sits there and let's him run wild.  Any wonder why we vote for Trump?
@TGowdySC so how will #congress stop it? #POTUS has proven will do whatever wants through #ExecutiveOrder & no one has stopped him yet
@TGowdySC Yes, it is reckless and against the law! That's precisely why Obama is going to do it! Congress is afraid of impeachment!
@Proud1American The Senate isn't afraid of impeachment; it does not have the votes to convict.  Conviction is the point.  @TGowdySC
@mlleodile1 @TGowdySC Okay, they're afraid to Convict! We do have a Republican majority! Just put impeachment on his record!
@Proud1American Conviction requires a 2/3 vote - Republicans only have 54 Senators. Removal only happens on conviction.  @TGowdySC
@mlleodile1 @TGowdySC I get your point! Even impeachment without conviction is a big Black Eye! Without conviction, Clinton still impeached!
@Proud1American Most folks would feel let down if ultimately he didn't have to pay. Clinton survived, relatively unscathed.  @TGowdySC
@mlleodile1 @TGowdySC I'd rather give him a bold scar than no wound at all!
@TGowdySC @idawhannadoyou Trey wake up your Congressional District is full of Obama's Syrian refugees whats up are they voting for you
@TGowdySC says the guy who altered documents to frame #Hillary over #Benghazi #Fauxtrage.  Why aren't *YOU* in jail?
@TGowdySC @robertew2945 All word no actuon
@TGowdySC tell me which law
@TGowdySC which law? Why is it reckless?
@TGowdySC So what are you going to do about it GowdyGive the Communist President more money to destroy AmericaJust like you and R pals do
@TGowdySC against the law hasn't stopped Obama. Ever.
@TGowdySC Is this your vow to impeach him if he moves forward?
@TGowdySC .....do what you do Sir......stop him
@TGowdySC 
let a few of them loose in W. Texas... Tell ranch hands there's no bag limit...
Problem cleared up in a couple of days..
#simple
@TGowdySC @RedRising11 Then stop this tyrant!
@TGowdySC @cattinks They won't do a thing, he will appoint a Supreme Court Justice too, GOP is scared to be called racist so they bow down!
@TGowdySC Then stop Obama
@TGowdySC @rightwinglatina surprised you and @SpeakerRyan aren't filling out their H1B visa paperwork right now. #MrOpenBorders
@TGowdySC So what are you going to do about it?  Like everything else, I assume, "absolutely nothing." Just talk about it.
@TGowdySC Hold him accountable then at least once. What is wrong with Congress? Why bother having a Congress if no one will do anything?!?!
@TGowdySC @SenCoryGardner So what does POTUS plan for GITMO land afterwards? Give it to communist Cuba? Or China? 90 miles to Key West....90
@TGowdySC just another example what a devisive, traitor, incompetent and how he circumvents the constitution, and the ball less congress oks
@TGowdySC NO NO They should not step  one foot on US SOIL!  @POTUS
@TGowdySC @jimblab May I suggest it’s a bit like litter - take your own rubbish home with you. Don’t dump it on someone else! #courtesy
@TGowdySC @RickyRayinGA You know Obama is breaking the law so DO SOMETHING ALREADY! Why do you think you got the House & Senate, STOP HIM!
@TGowdySC then stand up and stop him. Start impeachment hearings with @HouseJudiciary already. You know it's over due.
@RickyRayinGA @TGowdySC @HouseJudiciary
@TGowdySC But will a majority stand up to him this time?
@TGowdySC So when you have a Pres that continues to break the law why why is he not impeached @SenateMajLdr @PRyan
@TGowdySC @cc_yandian I am furious!
@TGowdySC @LoriStu
@cc_yandian @TGowdySC @LoriStu Our worst nightmare aka 8 years of Obama, is almost over! 
@TGowdySC Another reason Yoho Intro'd Resol. of Censure & Condemnation of BO Foreign Policy: http://tinyurl.com/gtuowvj 
@TGowdySC What are you going to do about Gitmo. Seems as though your Benghazi hearings are a flop, will Gitmo be the same.
@TGowdySC @mimimayesTN So stop him. This congress, with a majority republican, has don't NOTHING to defund his lawlessness
@TGowdySC @TrishLaird Then, stop him!!!!!!
@PamJWilliamson @TGowdySC @TrishLaird Yes....then stop him.  Stop barking and start biting!
@TGowdySC What are you and Congress doing about it?
@rln22 @likeitor_lumpit @TGowdySC If you're waiting for Trey to do anything but talk, you're wasting your time.  He's with Rubio. We know.
@TGowdySC @SenCoryGardner Utterly ridiculous. We've had terrorists in our supermaxes for decades. Stop your fearmongering partisanship!
@TGowdySC Then let's have the feckless GOP stop them...
@TGowdySC http://www.stripes.com/news/europe/former-guantanamo-detainee-among-4-arrested-in-spain-morocco-for-islamic-state-ties-1.395610?platform=hootsuite …
@TGowdySC so when are you going to stop him...trump will win and leave you cowards alone and take America back..shame on you
@TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott Go ahead  and stop this nonsense ,sue ..or call in arms to stop it ,you won't regret later.
@TGowdySC @PoliticalLaughs but we let him do whatever he wants
@TGowdySC law or no law Obama has no obligation to respect the law as far as he is concerned we have seen this time in and timeout
.@TGowdySC @Loretta_Stiles Prosecute!
@TGowdySC @BarackObama does not care what you or anyone thinks. There's no one to stop him. Only one person can #Trump 2016
@TGowdySC
@TGowdySC please fight there as a South Carolina resident and an American like this
@TGowdySC The law means nothing to that Idiot. Put him in Gitmo with them good ole boys.
@TGowdySC @MarieMa49685063 So isn't electing a Canadian POTUS
@TGowdySC USA prisons are for convicted criminals
@TGowdySC Too bad it fits right in with his "CHANGE" for America plan .
@TGowdySC stateside prison employees & family become targets of those who wish to free detainees. Prison security non existent
@TGowdySC I don't have a law degree but somewhere this cat can be held for treason if anybody in Washington had some g----ds
@TGowdySC So was the tactics used by Dubya & Cheney during war in Iraq! But it didn't stop them! Torture was & still is, illegal!
@TGowdySC Thanks for reiterating the obvious. Now what are you going to do about it?
@TGowdySC GOD love you. Trying to defend us against those who know too many powerful people to go to jail. Love you!
@TGowdySC you represent we the people in a way we cannot. Do something about it! The people you represent need your help.
@TGowdySC AND WHO IS STOPPING HIM???  NO ONE!!!
@TGowdySC Trey & the GOP said they would stop this crap. So far, All Talk No Action. e.g. Omnibus, Open Border, etc
@robertew2945 @TGowdySC Trey Gowdy drops the ball too much for me.
@TGowdySC He is not planning to do it without Congress' cooperation. What are you so afraid of, coward?
@TGowdySC looking forward to our meeting tomorrow. #NABSLC
@TGowdySC We have already established the fact the Mr.O. does not care much about American law :(
@TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott against the law? Too bad nobody will do a damn thing about it. #Cowards
@TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott When has the law ever mattered to Obama? You all were elected to put a stop to him; to this. Keep #Gitmo open.
@TGowdySC Most everything Obama does is a negative for America. ..He is trying to take our country down.
@TGowdySC Who is going to stop him, Goudy????
@TGowdySC You think that bothers him?
@TGowdySC @iowahawkblog 
I like you buddy. But you should concentrate on what you intend to do about it, not what you intend to say about it
@TGowdySC lol and exactly what law is that??
@TGowdySC So impeach him.
@TGowdySC Are you going to hold a bunch of blustery hearings and then do nothing, again?  #PaperTiger
@TGowdySC it's no different than allowing illegals 2enter & 2stay here you don't know who they are & what they are capable of if not vetted
@TGowdySC THEN DO UR JOB AND STOP IT,YOU ARE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AND CAN BE THROWN OUT BY THE PEOPLE
@TGowdySC Well, gee Trey, if nothing else, can you WORKERS do ONE THING before you're OUT? Then don't whine to us, just pay off your DEBT!
@TGowdySC Then STOP HIM!!!
@TGowdySC @NatShupe United States soil? You mean SC? Isn't that your stumping ground where you and Haley endorsed loser Rubio!
@TGowdySC stop him from doing it! Will military intentionally break law at his word? If they do that's a whole diff level of road 2tyranny..
@TGowdySC  REPUBLICAN LIE .
@TGowdySC but you will do nothing about it just like Hillary's criminal activities.   #Weak #GOPe #Failure
@sevigny_rob @TGowdySC hey! No one wants to be called a half racist, right?!
@TGowdySC He's done it so many times sir! When will he be accountable? Or any of them for that matter.
@TGowdySC   Then PLEEEEZE  have Obama arrested like any other criminal who breaks the law.
@TGowdySC We KNOW that.  What we need to know is HOW & WHEN you and the rest of Congress are going to stop him !!!
@TGowdySC Why don't you boy on the hill do something to shut him down?
@TGowdySC LIKE ANY OF YOU WILL BOTHER TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! YOU ALL FAILED US!
@TGowdySC um...naw
@TGowdySC ok lawmakers get ur "thinking caps" on & #STOP this #overreach of #tyrannical power grab by @POTUS
@TGowdySC So make sure U and UR fellow republicans hold him to the law, unlike U have been able to do so far with every other lawless action
@TGowdySC Not that legality has been much of a deterrent to this admin as a whole. Before or after.
@TGowdySC Yet you support Rubio. Illegal Immigration is also against the law
@TGowdySC  Sum it up; NOT in Americas interest, NOT legal, NOT safe and since when did this clown care about saving money.
@TGowdySC how about getting back to DC and SToppING HIM!  gee...  why do you think so many are supporting Trump?  Because is is not chicken!
@TGowdySC Makes no sense...it's all about the money & not offending his Muslim bedfellows. So transparent...SMH
@TGowdySC Let's see hwo the house handles this. Obama should be getting packed but yet he's still holding you folks by your noses. We'll see
@TGowdySC amen
@TGowdySC Well no kidding, how is this news? He is a treasonous traitorous globalist and race baiter. Islamic sympathizer.
@TGowdySC // So will you do anything about it other than tweet?
@TGowdySC What law is this? Could ya share a link to it or something? I was unaware of that. Simply thought it wasn't smart.
@TGowdySC what you gonna do about it

@TGowdySC SO STOP HIM!
@TGowdySC GANGof8?!
