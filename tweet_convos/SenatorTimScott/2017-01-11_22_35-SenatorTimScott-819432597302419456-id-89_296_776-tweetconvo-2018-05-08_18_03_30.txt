You are a big man Senator Scott. You are in the Senate as you say And yet you serve no one but the people that prop you up. Shame
I am a 35 year old in Greenville. Due to a blood clot I had a series of strokes last mth. How will I be insured?
Thank God. We are small business owners and for the 2 of us our premium has gone up to 2000 a month. How can we pay that?
Majority of Americans like provisions of ACA, just don't like the name Obamacare. Why not just change the name?
How are you going to make insurance affordable? Accept pre-existing conditions? And give the rich a HUGE tax break?
please devise a healthcare plan for our citizens which will also be use as the default insurance for elected officials
that is horrible thank God we have Donald Trump in a few days
like...education?
but why the announcement? You're a Republican and you're doing as expected. Since the 60s, your party has marginalized POC.
Don't you dare vote to repeal before having replacement ready! 1/
dont take away OBC  Medicaid my 10 year old  daughter life depends on, she needs medicine that cost 2000 mth
No absolutely not.. what are you thinking. Do you have a replacement.
I don't understand why that's the first thing on the agenda for you guys. Don't we have bigger issues?
Thanks Senator
My prems didn't go up under ACA, I kept my Dr., I'm healthier, life is overall better. Don't eff with my healthcare.
Alright!!!Yay! Thank you! Pls continue, I am one of those families paying ridiculous premiums.
I just pray you never need health insurance and can't afford it. Shame on you!
this whole statement makes me want to take back my vote.  Shameful, really.
He's a typical sellout! Will side with others to fit in!  @SenatorTimScott
blah blah blah, regulate the industry... cap profit margins..standardize pricing...
So you're in favor of repealing without a replacement? Cause that's insane.
you should be ashamed of yourself.
Please keep making us PROUD,  Senator Scott!
Thank you for your service. I'm Watching closely regarding #ACARepeal
I just can't understand how you feel a repeal vote is responsible without a clear replacement.
It's easy to beat up a straw man. Ins. prems rose at double digit rates for a decade before ACA. Can't blame Obama 4 that.
please tell me the plan so I can understand this isn't a party issue!  You are effecting millions of people!
God bless you Senator... take heart many of us pray for you.
You've just helped thousands of your constituents to die. There is no plan for replacement. Who are you representing?
good job!!!!
I think it would best serve if you voted to expand medicare in SC, NC just expanded and premiums are starting to fall
thank you
Every time you vote to endorse Trump or his agenda, it is another reason you will never get my vote.
Please see @RandPaul #RepealReplaceSameDay plan.
you should be ashamed how do you look at yourself in the mirror
and what about ppl like me, who had coverage for the first time in years b/c of a pre-existing condition?
believe they've said they're going to keep the part where you can't be denied for having a preexisting condition
I read that too, but from what I understand they voted to repeal it all yesterday, including preexisting cond
where's the replacement? Can we read it? #aca
what is your plan to replace?  You shouldn't repeal unless you can make it better...instead, folks will lose the safety net
I'm disappointed you & @LindseyGrahamSC voted against ACA.  SC'ers will suffer and won't be eligible for Medicaid
Why didn't you share letters from young healthy women who paid into ACA and enjoyed preventative/reproductive care?
The middle class cannot afford high deductible plans, Senator Scott! Much respect to you, Sir!
great job
BS. You took steps to take insurance away from over 20 million Americans who deserve the same health care YOU have.
Exactly. Who the heck are the public servants here?
honestly, I am very sorry for the 3 people you mentioned. It is very difficult to not have health insurance. But (1/2)
what good is repealing ACA without an alternative? Then 20 million (plus your three!) ALL won't have health insurance (2/2)
@ChrisLoesch didn't you already take other 62 first steps to repeal obamacare? Number 63 is not so bad. Keep trying
what is the replacement plan, Senator, or are you privy? Repeal w/out a tacit, tested replacement plan is a death sentence.
Shame on you! You have a cushy healthplan but the rest of us need the ACA! Stop wasting taxpayers money! #ProtectOurCare
@TonySisk if @realDonaldTrump will tell congress to work on this and it will b THEIR HEALTHCARE PLAN it'll b great & quick
your statement on ACA does not address people like me who have preexisting conditions and would be harmed by repeal.
u took away key provisions like pre-existing conditions and our kids on our plan til 26 yrs old!
TRAIN!
premiums were rising drastically before ACA & will keep rising unless you address the cost of healthcare itself. (2/2)
as a constituent that works with this mess everyday, please hear me. I could share lots of stories and suggestions 1/2
This is also personal for me. I'm also your constituent with children on ACA. What is your replacement plan? And when?
Repeal the whole damn thing or leave it alone.
Where do we find details of how the replacement works?
Congratulations on ensuring that my disabled uncle who depends on ACA for lifesaving meds will die bf we can vote you out.
more than 200,000 other stories in our state disagree. Don't you represent them, too?
what doesn't work about 20 million more people having insurance?
thank you.
I'm a SC resident. Not pleased w/your vote.
#MakeAmericaSickAgain you have lost your way. Your votes on ACA and Sessions will hurt blacks the most. Your card-revoked
Vote no. Americans need health care. Think of your people, not your party. We deserve better!
it's finally time to stop with ludicrous partisan politics and gross mischaracterizations.  Just govern.
I voted for you and want you to fix ACA problems, not brand Obamacare.
Please and hurry!
Thank you for staying up all night! 
I'm STILL WAITING for solutions, Senator. Don't repeal until you have a better one.
@TGowdySC @marcorubio #CANOWORMS #NIGHTMAREHEALTHCARE  Please change the working title so l can erase "OBAMA" from MY HEAD!
most things have been erased from your head. Good luck with that.
.@senatortimscott This is a lie. You do not have a replacement that will work. Some of your constituents will die because of your vote.
how will this be accomplished w/o gutting $ to Medicaid? Countless low income families depend on for treatment @MUSChealth
what will you do for those with "pre-existing" conditions? not interested in the stories anymore. I want to hear alt plan?
I'd like to hear in detail about the substantive alternative? I'll be in touch with your health LA/office as usual.
Yikes, @SenatorTimScott print is too small to read.
What are you going to replace it with? How long between the repeal and replace?
For all of you sick Americans with insurance, we have heard you. Help is on the way. You will soon be free of insurance!!
This was only a first step; there will be replacement plan before ACA ends; market needs time to prepare, etc.
ABSOLUTELY! This repeal is going to save my cabinet millions of dollars in taxes as we free Americans of their insurance! #MRGA
Its broken bc 1.)  Ins. Cos raised premiums for profit. 2.) manipulated exchange pools.  3.) Red states refuse to expand.
And how will you stop Insurers from more manipulation/monopolization heading into Trump's Deregulation era?
do you believe in santa too?
You clowns demanded healtcare remain in the hands of private for profits. You voted against American people tonight.
There are literally millions of stories like that across the US. Would it be better not to get any such "help" as the ACA?
This was only a first step; there will be replacement plan before ACA ends; market needs time to prepare, etc.
List,Liar,are you and the rest of those cut throat chicken head Republicans on a health care plan,we are paying for?
This was only a first step; there will be replacement plan before ACA ends; market needs time to prepare, etc.
Shame on you Sir! #voterama
This was only a first step; there will be replacement plan before ACA ends; market needs time to prepare, etc.
Good for the American people.
This was only a first step; there will be replacement plan before ACA ends; market has to have time to prepare, etc.
