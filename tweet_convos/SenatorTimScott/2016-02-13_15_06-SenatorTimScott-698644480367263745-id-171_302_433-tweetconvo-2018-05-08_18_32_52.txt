@SenatorTimScott you want to be a slave so badly. Jesus.
@cly_de @SenatorTimScott Why is it when a black person don't want handouts he a slave black people will never get it.
LMFAO. You want to be one too.  @lipscomb_kelvin @SenatorTimScott
@cly_de @SenatorTimScott I can tell you a house nigga always sitting around waiting for the government to take care of
@lipscomb_kelvin @SenatorTimScott meanwhile....
@cly_de @SenatorTimScott I'm voting Marco Rubio we must fight these progessive lairs one last thing can you name me three things Obama done
@AureliaBrown16 @cly_de @SenatorTimScott Are you serious dumbing down the GPA for black kids to get in college isn't help it's liberals
@SenatorTimScott we must not let obama get this nomination.
@williamsnick26 @SenatorTimScott Oh looky here not only Senate Repubs but u also said n above twt 'must not let Obama get nomination'.
@TessatTys @SenatorTimScott you cracked the code!!!!! I want the senate repubs to exercise their rights given under the constitution.
@williamsnick26 Ur showin agreement w @SenatorTimScott that not this but "next pres" nominates SCOTUS w/hope next pres will be a Republican.
@TessatTys @SenatorTimScott whether republican or democrat should not be lame duck president
@williamsnick26 @SenatorTimScott Art2, Sec2 of Constitution: POTUS noms SCOTUS w advice-consent of Senate, NOT "except when lame duck pres".
@TessatTys @SenatorTimScott notice the consent part?? He can nominate whoever he wants
@williamsnick26 @SenatorTimScott Uv already admitted 2agree w/unconstitutional agenda of senate "wait til next pres". BLOCK nominees.
@SenatorTimScott Overall,58% say they'd like to see the President nominate someone to the Court rather than leave the seat vacant.#DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott  Nice try the next president a year from now. So much for the bullshit of so-called constitutional conservatives.
@SenatorTimScott According 2 Constitution, the president is to nominate justices 2 the SCOTUS. Pres Obama is our president, so it's his job.
@bbkenn92 @SenatorTimScott To "wait til next pres" is not only an affront to the constitution but to democracy, the ppl's choice 4pres.
@SenatorTimScott So ignore the Constitution NOW but have the next guy follow it? You GOPers are so disrespectful & tyrannical its sickening
@SenatorTimScott I like your work but on this one you are wrong my fellow republican.
@SenatorTimScott Your job is to uphold the Constitution, not rewrite it.
@SenatorTimScott Sandra Day O'Connor: Obama should name Scalia's replacement.#DOYOURJOB
@SenatorTimScott No longer respected opinion on anything Constitution when you cherry pick what parts you want to follow.. Disrespectful.
@SenatorTimScott Surprised you would cherry pick what parts of Constitution should be followed vs. following the entire constitution.
@SenatorTimScott Must wait until election. Not by socialist POTUS
@SenatorTimScott @JewelryMadness Absolutely! I'll send protein shakes and a padded matt so you can filibuster all night long!
@SenatorTimScott Senator You've been mislead about the constitutional duties of @POTUS. We expect you to honestly assess a SCOTUS candidate.
@SenatorTimScott Most lawyers are taught interpretation matters more than the original intent, & many wield English too poor to interpret...
@SenatorTimScott  I absolutely agree! Sorry Mr. Obama, sadly you are not a democrat, you yield power like an autocrat. # of Executive Orders
@SenatorTimScott Can somebody please help me? How many executive orders and how many presidential memorandums? Add both of those numbers up!
@SenatorTimScott Sorry Mr. Trump, yes, you are certainly better than Hillary, and even Bernie, but your weakness is that you are a boss.
@SenatorTimScott Don't believe the polls. History will prove that they lie too, and are biased, and most, if not all, are unscientific!
@SenatorTimScott Thank you Tim and to the voters of S. Carolina, thank you, You deserve the truth. Both Tim and Rubio will unite America!
@SenatorTimScott BLOCK ALL NOMINEES!!!
@SenatorTimScott Tim I don't agree with you backing Rubio he is another Obama can't believe you don't see it
@SenatorTimScott @ElishivaAhmose .Here's 2 hoping the Country survives Odummy's final year. Something tells me he's gonna go ape shit...
@SenatorTimScott how convenient his death given ruling on @EPA
@SenatorTimScott what is also sad is NOBODY has cared about manner of death.
He had no security detail...embalmed IMMEDIATELY
It smells ripe
@SenatorTimScott Why would you pick Rubio when he pushed for the gang of 8. You must be 4 amnesty too! What appointment did he promise you!
@SenatorTimScott Quit the BS "Constitution" clearly outlines the duty of @BarackObama is to choose a #justice & not the people. Honor it Sir
@SenatorTimScott how about upholding our rules about illegal immigration
@SenatorTimScott Why are you going against the Founding Fathers, Tim? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appointments_Clause …
@SenatorTimScott the word is "shall" not "when Tim feels like it"
@SenatorTimScott You don't get to skip work just because you don't like POTUS.  Show up and do your job.
@SenatorTimScott @LoveuLynn  I am Sadden your a RINO
@SenatorTimScott @LoveuLynn Senator Scott, can we trust that you will make sure that this current lawless regime is gone before a consent?
@SenatorTimScott  it's too bad you endorsed the guy who thought John Kerry was a good idea
Obama is POTUS for the next 11 months. He get's to nominate someone. I hope he finds a Muslim Marxist to piss you off.

 @SenatorTimScott
@SenatorTimScott I imagine the +300 days left in Obama's presidency will suffice in the time necessary to make the next appointment
.@SenatorTimScott Sir, please impress us with your ability to think on your own instead of constantly being an ideologic puppet. #TryThat
@SenatorTimScott That's right, the NEXT one, not this one, please.
@SenatorTimScott that's not how it works....
@SenatorTimScott or the current President can nominate and get a new justice confirmed before the general election
@SenatorTimScott He was a great American. Congressman must not let Obama push someone through with executive action
@SenatorTimScott coonery at its highest level
@SenatorTimScott Wrong!!! That's the sitting Prez job per const. You should know that @SenatorTimScott  or find another job dude
@SenatorTimScott you're looking to leave the Supreme Court useless for 1 1/2 years? You suck!
@SenatorTimScott according to the constitution that's a job for the current president, not the next.
@SenatorTimScott The current President and Senators have the authority and imperative to put another judge on the court NOW.
@SenatorTimScott let's pray!
@SenatorTimScott to a others on this feed. How about a reasonable adult conversation?
@SenatorTimScott "advise and consent" does not mean rollover. Obama will nominate. Fine, then reject. Start over. Should take until January.
@SenatorTimScott and please remind the minority party that they blocked Bork for 18 months
@SenatorTimScott What is the Constitutional justification for "next" rather than "current" President?
.@SenatorTimScott The sitting POTUS will do his job and nominate a Justice. Senators should do theirs and hold confirmation hearing & vote
@SenatorTimScott @MattShaheen @SenateMajLdr that's bs - so the GOP hasn't worked for 8 years and now the SCOTUS shouldn't work for a year?
@SenatorTimScott The current President has a duty and obligation to nominate a justice now, and the Senate has a duty to confirm now.
@SenatorTimScott Only an ignorant Republikkkan would say something stupid like "the next President...."! Resign.
@SenatorTimScott @blackrepublican Possibility #scalia was ASSASSINATED, or at least helped along to his death by #obama and Anti-Americans.
@SenatorTimScott @blackrepublican You can't love the constitution and believe that. We can't be hypocrites on this issue. Lead by example.
@SenatorTimScott @Avik No worries. Current President will fulfill is Constitutional obligations and do so. Thanks for the tips, though.
@SenatorTimScott @MikeEllis_AIM why not this President Sen. Scott?
@SenatorTimScott @sarasuamaria if you want to uphold the Constitution, THIS President must nominate his successor, dipshit
@SenatorTimScott @DiasporaConnect Thankfully, the constitution was amended to remove some racist, bigoted, founding principles.
@SenatorTimScott Hmm...sometimes its tough to tow the party line, especially if it defies logic and good sense...huh?
@SenatorTimScott @DiasporaConnect @BarackObama has indicated that he will nominate a replacement.Where do you stand on that?
@SenatorTimScott what happens if a Democrate wins the election? What then? Will you wait another 4 yrs? Beware the precedent u r setting.
@SenatorTimScott Do you really hate your blackness that much?Your kids will grow up to be ashamed of you! History will not be kind to u.
@SenatorTimScott don't do this brother. You know it's not right and being evil.
@SenatorTimScott maybe you should too.
@SenatorTimScott Another Quimbo and Sambo eh Timmie? Do you ever think for yourself? Ever? Or carry the party leader's water? Total waste!!
@SenatorTimScott @rolandsmartin Orginal Constitution does not limit @POTUS term of office.  In this time of crisis must extend Obama's term
@SenatorTimScott @brandonholder oh, please, we all know you wouldn't support Jesus if Obama appointed him. It's all about obstruction
@SenatorTimScott Why put off until tomorrow, that which can be done by our sitting @POTUS. #Obama 's got this.
@SenatorTimScott @postandcourier we currently have a president and he will offer a nomination #SCOTUS
@SenatorTimScott @STPCityGOP Amen
@SenatorTimScott Or - you know - the current @POTUS .  Like it says in the Constitution.
@SenatorTimScott @Turners NO this @POTUS should nominate a successor immediately!!!
@SenatorTimScott No. A new justice needs to be confirmed ∗before∗ the election. Plenty of justices were confirmed during an election year.
@SenatorTimScott what do you mean next president? Obama will nominate someone.
@SenatorTimScott @MariahTamaya so Scott endorses Rubio whom has close to zero principles. Thanks Tim!
.@SenatorTimScott Condolences to his family, but SCOTUS needs to be full and functioning. Preventing that insults the concept of justice.
@SenatorTimScott the Constitution is a living document, and can change, ONLY by the people
@SenatorTimScott  You do realize that we have a current President now right.
@SenatorTimScott the court cannot be allowed to add, only interpret, we the people handle additions, not we the 5 people
@SenatorTimScott Whoever is the next President is won't get a chance. Obama is gonna nominate Scalia's successor & u & McConnell will affirm
@SenatorTimScott What is wrong with current President? Do you think he is 3/5 a President?
@SenatorTimScott @postandcourier But, it doesn't work like that. Like, at all.
@SenatorTimScott Just because your political body has stop doing their job, doesn't mean the president should too. #Scalia
@SenatorTimScott um, that's kind of unconstitutional there...
@Quarbarian2 @SenatorTimScott hahahahahahahah
@SenatorTimScott 
NO.
THIS President shall nominate & THIS Senate shall confirm a Justice THIS YEAR.
NO PHONY POLITICAL DELAYS.
Do your job.
@SenatorTimScott @postandcourier I don't think we should have to wait for the next president to get a new justice.
@SenatorTimScott Obama is going to nominate some total idiot & the rhinos will give him/her a free pass!
@SenatorTimScott @twright55 Well what if that's Trump?
@SenatorTimScott Right! Time to violate the Constitution in order to uphold it! Good logic there! Jeebus.
@SenatorTimScott The current President does that. Read the Constitution a bit. #Scalia
@SenatorTimScott you're a US Senator who doesn't know/understand the process of SCOTUS nominations. Oh dear
@Fr360dDan @SenatorTimScott you shame Alexander Hamilton
@SenatorTimScott To UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, our current President will nominate successor and our Senate must vote to confirm.
@SenatorTimScott Or do you NOT believe in the guiding principals of our constitution?
@SenatorTimScott @postandcourier No! The vacancy is now and the position should be filled now. Congress, do your job!
@SenatorTimScott, this President should nominate Justice Scalia's successor. As Senator Graham often says, #ElectionsHaveConsequences
@SenatorTimScott whats constitutional reasoning 4 waiting? If none,its just shrill politics-GOP losing votes 4 decades #Scalia #Hillary2016
@SenatorTimScott Sir, you cant be to saddened by the passing of Justice Scalia if you're already politicizing his deaths. You're an ass!
@SenatorTimScott we have a president in office that will be there for another year. I'm quite sure he's capable
@SenatorTimScott So you don't give a shit about justice for the next year? Political hack.
@SenatorTimScott founding principles? You mean like #citizensunited? Trying to ban gay marriage?
@SenatorTimScott Hopefully President Obama would appoint someone who doesn't insult African American intelligence on a daily basis
@SenatorTimScott @PoliticalLaughs the current president doesn't have the mental capacity to choose a reputable justice.
@SenatorTimScott Actually, the current President has 11 months left in his term and a Constitutional obligation to make that appointment.
@SenatorTimScott Our current President will handle that.  Relax Brother Scott.
@johnlegend @SenatorTimScott has to be confirmed
@SenatorTimScott And if Hillary or Bernie wins, I'm sure you'll call for the next President after them to nominate.
@SenatorTimScott This dirt bag Senator has a rebel flag on his office #betyou
@SenatorTimScott How quickly did you pivot from offering prayers for the Scalia family to being unbelievably political?
@SenatorTimScott @AndyParas Why wait for  the next President?
@SenatorTimScott Actually, Senator, the CURRENT President gets to nominate the next justice
@Robert_Fried @SenatorTimScott They uphold the constitution when it benefits interest of Republicans not for the rights of everyday people.
@akanoyton @SenatorTimScott I agree.
@SenatorTimScott Y'all better stand in the gap. You know BHO will try to get some liberal justice in there on his watch.
@SenatorTimScott I can't wait to do my job until I work with people I like better. I'm sick of do-nothing GOP obstructionists like you!
@SenatorTimScott but the Constitution clearly states the the (sitting) president has that authority. Clearly you don't uphold it
@SenatorTimScott correction the CURRENT president must nominate a successor
@SenatorTimScott @Stever0020 Absolutely no question, see to that senator this country as we know it will not survive another Obama Sabatoge!
@SenatorTimScott @postandcourier Senator, your callous disregard for the Constitution just lost you my vote for reelection. #Scalia
@SenatorTimScott the next President?  No this President will be nominating his successor.
@SenatorTimScott founding principles were that black were property.....
@SenatorTimScott they all do. Just bc its not your party nominee it's not exclusive.
@SenatorTimScott @AndyParas - why not the current president? Here it goes....
@SenatorTimScott Could we talk you into supporting a constitutionalist for President now?
@SenatorTimScott nice to see you openly advocating for obstructing the Pres from doing his job.  Either way a Dem will be appointing judge.
@bimmerella @SenatorTimScott Senate has finally say
@SenatorTimScott There is zero legal basis for the next president doing it. The current president should.
@SenatorTimScott black man in SC still doing anything that massa says
@SenatorTimScott
@SenatorTimScott No that's ok WE THE PEOPLE ASK PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA REMEMBER BEING CALLED A LAME DUCK #FILLTHESEAT
@SenatorTimScott
@SenatorTimScott this is beyond an idiotic statement! Grow the hell up!
@SenatorTimScott wrong answer. Your opinion of the "next" President doing so politicizes your response and invalidates it
@SenatorTimScott Ohhh, you're a republican.  I get it now.
@SenatorTimScott FOH
@SenatorTimScott I'm embarrassed for you, sir
@SenatorTimScott So, you're saying the next president should nominate the successor instead of the current president?  Please explain.
@SenatorTimScott Senator as your Constituent I pray you do everything possible to keep Obama from Selecting his Successor.
@eddiern @SenatorTimScott why don't you think he should follow the constitution?
@SenatorTimScott 3/5 was literally a founding principle.
@SenatorTimScott 
We have a sitting President, Senator.
@SenatorTimScott No thanks, there's a president in office now.
@MantonieByrd @SenatorTimScott it's almost guaranteed that Congress will stonewall the new appointment in the hope they will take the WH
@SenatorTimScott This tweet is an absolute embarrassment. The #GOP has no shame.
@SenatorTimScott but as of today the constitution is still in place and we have an active POTUS and Senate...so why are we wiring 11+ mos
@SenatorTimScott YOU must stand by that pledge: NEXT POTUS appoints! IF Obama appointS we might as well take a match to the CONSTITUTION!
@fididymus @SenatorTimScott Constitutionally impossible.  The vacancy needs filled as soon as possible.  It will be Obama's nominee.
@malkat1987 @SenatorTimScott NO! Constitutionally the Senate must confirm...If Senate does not confirm, it will NOT be Obama's choice!
@fididymus @SenatorTimScott What I'm telling you is that it's both his right and duty.
@SenatorTimScott @PoliticalLaughs wrong it's up 2 #presidentobama deal with #realitycheck
@SenatorTimScott Why should the next, not the current @POTUS make the appointment?
@SenatorTimScott @PoliticalLaughs The Next President?  That is a whole year from now!
@SenatorTimScott, you are willing to let the U.S. Supreme Court go with eight justices for the next year? Seriously, sir, do your job!
@Nadomom @SenatorTimScott If a republican was in the White House and the slime ball democRATS controlled congress they would wait a year
@CbolttttLeibold, if you really believe that, Chris, allow me to sell you some oceanfront property in Arizona. @SenatorTimScott
@Nadomom @SenatorTimScott Put your head back up your ass and vote for that lying criminal Hillary in November... Until then shut up
@CbolttttLeibold: Son, you need a hug. And toss in some therapy to deal with your anger. It will only give you wrinkles. @SenatorTimScott
@Nadomom @SenatorTimScott go bake some cookies and let the men folk worry about politics .. Just make yourself pretty for your husband
Have a good evening, @CbolttttLeibold. Find some peace. I'm getting my wine chilled for #GOPDebate. #cheers @SenatorTimScott
@Nadomom @CbolttttLeibold @SenatorTimScott Me too, LOL
@SenatorTimScott CURRENT President. As bad as you hate it.
@SenatorTimScott nah we got a president who can do it now
@Phuture_MDandCE @SenatorTimScott @dogstar7tweets Breaking: Republicans race to appeal to infamous 'No Fair!' clause of US #Constitution.
@SenatorTimScott Very sad. Could be the end for our country Hoping Obama won't replace him soon
@SenatorTimScott don't you mean, the current President can nominate a successor to the late Associate Justice Scalia seat on the bench?
@SenatorTimScott you have a constitutional duty to appoint a member now
@Sam_Rubinstein @SenatorTimScott actually, the Senate does no such appointing.  Obama can appoint, Senate can and will vote no.
