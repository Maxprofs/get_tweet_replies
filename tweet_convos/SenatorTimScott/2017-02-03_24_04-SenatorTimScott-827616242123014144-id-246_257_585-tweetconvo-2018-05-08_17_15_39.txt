the solution for underperforming schools is NOT DeVos. Maybe nationally paying teachers more?
they make like $70K in detroit...how much more??

Scott. frontPagemagazine is not a REAL source. Avg sal is 53k & 71K is also only if you have a doctorate. Sorry
is $53K enough?
the guy that squirts Gatorade into the mouths of NFL players makes 50K and isn't helping our collective future soooooo no.
how much will make the kids read??
Scott. Surely you can understand simply more pay is not the answer to all things. However DeVos is the answer for NOTHING
So instead of taking money away make sure underperforming schools get fully funded and staffed. #noDevos
Funding and poverty are the problems. Packing classrooms while siphoning $ to 'charters' is the problem.
Funding IS NOT the problem! @SenAlexander @SenatorTimScott
Same old, knuckle-dragging south, holding us back for 160 years.
Thank you Senator Tim Scout for saying that. Stuck in underperforming schools for many generation
And you believe that of all the innovative and educated people in the world, that billionaire is the best?BS.
Betsy has invested millions of her own money & years of her life helping poor kids get a good education. @SenatorTimScott
An education for some kids, her way. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
Don't know where you live & state of public ed but many parents are begging for CHOICE. @SenatorTimScott
As for "educated people," professional educators are a big part of the problem. It's spelled POWER and BUREAUCRACY.
so stop cutting funding for public education. Don't confirm an idiot to serve at the helm
Shame on you. You have left South Carolina's and America's students out in the cold. First and last term.
DeVos is to education as Jack Skellington is to Christmas. But a very corrupt Jack Skellington.
fix the system.  No privatization. Equality.
Solution to failing schools IS NOT take public money & give to private inst, it is to give equally to all @SenAlexander @SenatorTimScott
you fix what broken not push kids down and step on them
EDUCATION SHOULD BE IN STATE CONTROL, NOT BIG GOVERNMENT!! One size does not fit all
Each state has its own culture and environmental dangers. Each state is unique and should only have oversight
@SenateRPC @SenatorTimScott a billionaire who never attended public school will  not be it's saving grace. Sellout!!!!
Mr Scott, You know this woman is not qualified.Perhaps it's the $50,000 in campaign donations that bought you
what about about the generations of rural kids that cant travel miles to charter schools in Christendom?
We have to make sure Scott does not get re-elected. He's bought and paid for.
And if you look at #charterschools, you'll find many of the poorest kids stuck in underperforming schools.
I am embarrassed and disappointed that you are supporting Betsy DeVos.
Betsy DeVos is not an ally to public education.
A travesty is continuing to underfund public education and not listening to qualified educators! No DeVos!
Chgo teachers highest paid. Kids in public school--most failing.
Teachers alone can't do it. Need wraparound services. Not DeVos
Services like what?!
Then why not work to fix the problems instead of taking a cop out and privatizing schools?
The problem is the SYSTEM and especially so where unions control. @SenAlexander @SenatorTimScott
Yeah so let's hand the reigns over to someone who stuck Detroit's kids in underperforming schools
Her work has been disastrous for Michigan&Ohio,she has no experience or qualifications, she bought your vote
Accountabilty for all schools,public & charter publicly funded need to have same standards period! #DumpDevos
Then work with congress to improve public education. Betsy DeVos is not the answer. She is unqualified
Check Detroit's school system ratings. DeVos made it worse, not better. No accountability. Vote NO on Devos!
And DeVos wants NO accountability. What could go wrong?
@SenateRPC @SenatorTimScott Vote NO on DeVos! Highest K-12 Public Education Graduation Rate EVER!! Highly Qualified Teacher!
NO Dem fingerprints on this dullest biggest ROCK in your box.Will cost wealthy tons more & fail everyone else
Devos only purpose is to dumb down next batch of gop voters to leave behind the disable, the lest of you.
@BetsyDeVos 
#shameful  DeVos agenda scary and you will be held accountable.  #paytoplay #noDevos #notimscott
.@SenAlexander @SenatorTimScott Betsy DeVos is wholly unqualified for this position, just like @POTUS. Do not confirm her, please.

I'm so happy that I voted for you, Tim Scott..thank you!
please do not let Betsy DeVos be our Secretary of Education. Please choose a moderate instead.
DeVos is NOT the solution to underperforming schools and lack of educational opportunity! #noDevos
but if the kids are still performing at a high level whats it matter? #noDevos #DumpDevos
#noDevos
The Sec of Education should insist on the same accountability for public and private and on IDEA compliance.
If your focus is on underperforming schools, you should be voting NO. DeVos is unqualified.
agreed so get a qualified proponent of mainstream and alternative education. Not a hack. New constituent here
For-profits & charters don't have to report graduation rates & assessment data the same way public schools do
Before you say the public system is failing, measure for-profits & charters the same way public schools are.
Make for-profits/charters report IEPs and 504s numbers.Oh,that's right,many sign away their rights.Pesky IDEA
Funneling US funds into private & charter schools will not help the millions of kids in remote areas.
The real debate is the generations of Republican Senators who sell out Americans decade after decade. Pitiful
Shame on you for selling America's children down the river.  It will NOT be forgotten. #StopDeVos
@SenateRPC @SenatorTimScott. Vote YES for Betsy DeVos
shame on both of you! Paper $ over people.
those numbers will go to ZERO with devos after public schools get privatized.Bettergo with a qualified person
You're a Republican, wouldn't it be nice to save us?Are you on the right side of history?Time and votes tell.
How do kids handle standardized testing if states run  schools? This makes no sense. #NoDeVos
BEST THING TO READ: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/07/07/a-surprising-truth-about-american-education/?postshare=9041486436891590&tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.971e96b46495 â€¦
FED FUNDING = FED ED CHOICE IS NOT REAL CHOICE FED ED IS NOT EDUCATION OF OPPORTUNITY ! #DUMPDEVOS
'..poor education does have a correlation w/things you mentioned @BetsyDeVos will make it worse #holdthefloor
Paid for vote, we all know. #selloutscott #DumpDeVos Some others need to retire.
anyone who's taken $ from @BetsyDeVos should not vote.  Obvious conflict.  #StopDeVos
VOTE NO @BetsyDeVos ISN'T a qualified @usedgov  leader. Vote your moral compass not your party #NoBetsyDeVos
America's children deserve better.  DeVos is unqualified.  Schools should not be about profit.
Yes many of them grew up and voted for the most incompetent person ever to assume the presidency.
DO NOT justify taking away our disabled children's education. DeVos will ruin everything we have worked for.
You are tone deaf! Americans DO NOT SUPPORT BETSY DEVOS! How much $$$ has she given you to buy her position?
If you accepted $ from Devos, you must recuse yourself from voting.
you must vote no on devos. She is not qualified. #holdthefloor #theresistance #StopDeVos #NoonDeVos
if I applied for employment with ms devoss I have to be qualified y she doesn't have to follow the same rule
VOTE NO on #BetsyDeVos
@SenateRPC @SenatorTimScott vote NO on Devos!!! Americans are begging for their children's educations. Be patriots!
And DeVos will fix this and get richer at the same time. YOU MONEYGRUBBERS !!!!! SAD as Donald would say!!!
US children deserve the best. #NotoDeVos
Your vote is bought and paid for this is the problem, MONEY! 
I have called, emailed, maybe you'll see this.
Please, please!!! We are begging you to vote NO on DeVos! She is wholly incompetent, and deep down, you know!
DeVos is not the answer! Will remember in 6 years your failure to do right for country over party! 
@SenToomey  
DeVos is BAD for public education. Please do not vote to confirm this unqualified candidate.
the people who elected you do not support DeVos, why do you? $49K reasons I suspect
starting to understand your affinity for DeVos http://wapo.st/2kAF6aJ   40k in contributions will do it.
What is your response to reports that people have been getting paid to call Senators in support of DeVos?
There are better qualified appointees to help our public schools. Vote "NO" on Betsy DeVos. Do the right!
I hope u choose our children over party n say no to DeVos
that is the real debate! Privatization does not improve low performance, but better management will.
Your vote for Devos cost her $49,200 - NOT bad. Too bad about the future of American education!
Put our Nation's children's education over party and vote NO on DeVos. You know she is not qualified!
please vote NO on DeVos!
No, the real debate is that DeVos is totally unqualified to be Sec of Ed.  AND YOU KNOW IT!  Vote no.
So let's spend $billions on a wall! Wonder what we could do w/ $billions in our school systems? #kidsfirst
poor neighborhoods have poor schools. Taking money away won't help. Fix the  inequity. #WeSeeYou #StopDeVos
Betsy DeVos is not the answer.
Much to debate, but with someone who actually knows and understands the issues. DeVos is NOT the answer.
don't confirm Devon
Betsy DeVos is an enemy of public ed. She will bring harm to ed of vast numbers of under represented kids!
the real debate is how much money Devos' family stands to profit from charters
vote NO on Betsy DeVos - sec of education should be educated on the department
The real debate is politicians and lobbyists w/ no experience in public schools vilifying educators & unions
That's because your states would rather give tax breaks to the wealthy & corporations than invest in children
vote no
exactly, vote for school choice
have some integrity and @dumpdevos @SenateGOP
Teachers can only do so much given the kids and socio economic settings. Ms DeVos is unqualified to help this
please senators. Oppose the nomination of @BetsyDeVos.
.@SenAlexander @SenatorTimScott Real debate is that we have NO idea how private/charter schools perform. NOT held to the same standards!!
No, sir. Underperforming generations of parents are raising their children poorly. Schools can't remedy that.
I'm not paid to email you. My Taxes pay you to read this. Publish that u fulfill that obligation. Majority voter.
defunding their school doesn't help them #NoDevos put children before politics and before profit!!!
I see the look on your face, @SenatorTimScott, when they talk about #DeVos.
You're right: #WokeBaby would be a better choice

 @SenAlexander
doing something the same way and getting the same and worse results is insanity #givechildrenchoice
putting them in underperforming charter/private schools won't solve a darn thing either. No on DeVos!
Though I might agree with your impassioned speech, DeVos is NOT the answer. Unprepared & incapable. No.
the American education system belongs to the people. It is not yours to sell or divest. #NoDevos
so properly fund public education, stop shortchanging our children & stop selling what's not yours!
call for reform. tell administrators to do their job. train teachers. Please don't destroy public education.
So, call for reform. Don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Why reinvent the wheel to profit the rich?
Don't put someone who doesn't know abt public schools in charge. She can't make it better. #DeVosFacts
@GOPHELP @SenatorTimScott Mutually exclusive. We need better schools but we DO NOT need #DeVos. Find someone better!!
the problem is u do not have a solution to present that is proven to work
12 senators betrayed our children by confirming incompetent plagiarist Betsy DeVos. Does yours have a spine??
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake persuade @lisamurkowski & @SenatorCollins to confirm @BetsyDeVos
then debate solutions!Don't further defund & remove oversight of schools & expect better results #nodevos
STUDIES SHOW CHARTER SCHOOLS NO BETTER THAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS *AND* HAVE **NO**  OVERSIGHT & NATIONAL STANDARDS
Alexander, I think it's time you figured out what your next career path is.  You have terrible judgement
the real debate is lack of qualifications
Ok. So what's YOUR solution?
- Read the comments on the FB post of this video.
why don't you just tell us, your constituents, the truth? You don't care what we think of DeVos, she's in some deal #truth
.@SenAlexander .@SenatorTimScott Please protect disabled students by finding a Secretary eager to defend their rights. Parents say: No DeVos
Bravo Senator!!!!
want to help schools? Pay teachers what they deserve and fund the needs of schools, instead of funding a wall
DeVos will not help the underserved.
#WeAreAmerica
you don't fix the problem with Charters and vouchers, vote no on DeVos!
Why do you keep quoting Senators that have a conflict of interest in regards to DeVos? #SenateGOPMoneyTalks
VOTE NO TO DeVos!!!! She is not qualified and you are going to get voted out. You are not representing your state. Only TRUMP
Betsy would take badly needed money from the "underperforming schools".
you can do better than this! DeVos not the answer! Vote NO
the real debate - when families are living in poverty and the politicians blamed education and refuse to help
no, the real debate is destroying public schools and creating the haves and have nots. I am not in union
have you ever stepped foot in one of these so called "underperforming" schools?  Doubtful
Say No to DeVos
Please vote no on Betsy DeVos. Our children's education is too valuable for "pay to play." #OpposeDeVos
She is NOT QUALIFIED. Please don't confirm her.
California is raising money to put you out of office enjoy your final days! U are bought! Shame on u
no to DeVos! No! How are you voting?
Maybe you'll read research if I pay you. You'll do anything for money.
Nothing in DeVos' background suggests she can successfully manage D.O.ED & help those children. #VoteNoDevos
Still waiting on some substantial literature that supports @BetsyDeVos and her practices.
The real debate is the impact of poverty on students#getitright #PublicSchoolsMatter
The real problem is Charter schools and vouchers taking money out of public schools #VoteNoDevos #NotoDeVos
DeVos thinks states should handle special ed. She did not know what IDEA was. No!! #NoDevos #Indivisible
School choice is not the answer. It will only make these statistics worse - SO many kids lose out. #NoDevos
@SenBobCorker She is grossly unqualified! Our children matter. Public education matters. #RejectDeVos
@SenBobCorker Fix public education! Hire good teachers and pay them accordingly. Voter: 37601 #RejectDeVos
are you listening? BC your constituents are watching #VoteNoDevos
meanwhile politicians surgically attached to Teacher Unions hide in shame
no debate, we can do better than DeVos
what about the under performing parents. Maybe kids should get a parent voucher.
Diverting $$ from already underfunded schools is not a solution.
@IsabelleAliciaa @SenatorTimScott I couldn't have said it any better 
simply offering another schl isn't a solution. Charters fail. Devos's agenda of unchecked charters failed!
I think the real debate is a lack of emphasis on adult education. Invest in over-looked they will overperform
SC voter here. I'm all for school of choice, but please reconsider DeVos. She will not save anyone.
Why is @BetsyDeVos even qualified to bring these under performing schools up to par?
Teachers agree with this, and they want better. We don't see how @BetsyDeVos is, in any way, a solution.
:  @BetsyDeVos  is not the answer!!!??
you both are horrible senators! Both have special interests. You don't care about students. Money from Devos
people need to remember & vote them out. #StopDeVos
Progressives have destroyed education...INTENTIONALLY! Read about it. http://deliberatedumbingdown.com/ 
Both of you -- and @BetsyDeVos -- are disgraceful.
Your views are ill-informed, misguided, and incorrect. You cannot justify your position
Pay them more than @BetsyDeVos paid you?
Are you going to reduce testing? Empower teachers? Recruit qualified teachers?
Are you going to address social issues? Are you going to read research?
Are you going to directly address childhood poverty?
So you're just going to build new schools? Send the kids elsewhere?
and you think DeVos is going to fix that!? She's clueless.
You're just being lazy. Find a solution that doesn't gut public education. If you can't, we can replace you.
The solution doesn't come from the inexperienced DeVos. She has no clue! #grizzlies
It's time we give these kids their emancipation.  They are being forced into substandard schools.  Enough!
I guess you are just not listing to the people on this one. "NO" on DeVos!!!
But why her? Why not a different school choice advocate who knows the system better?
thank you senator.
I agree with @SenatorTimScott. @SenAlexander do you truly believe @BetsyDeVos is someone who can address this problem? I do not think she is
True, but we don't need Betsy DeVos to fix our local and State problems. Don't waste taxpayer dollars on her.
vouchers are not the answers
You are delusional if you think DeVos has the answers to fix this. She can't help because she can't relate.
How is she going to help kids stuck in underperforming schools? SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT EDUCATION!
Thank you for telling the truth!
You both understand that education reforms can be considered with a more qualified nominee, right?? #NoDeVos
Then how about fixing root of problem - poverty!! Don't rob schools to line privateers' pockets! #publicEd
