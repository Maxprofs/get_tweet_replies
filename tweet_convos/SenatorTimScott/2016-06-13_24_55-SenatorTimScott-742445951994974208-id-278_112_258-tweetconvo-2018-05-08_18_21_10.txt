silence is not what is needed #enough

#ActForOrlando #FILIBUSTER
Hypocrites.
.@SenateGOP I prayed with my priest. #DoYourJob and legislate! Pass universal background checks & #NoFlyNoBuy TODAY!
Your moment of silence is useless and no longer needed. Your ACTION is what matters. #makeitstop
We don't want your silence. We want ACTION.
@SenateMajLdr #PrayForOrlando Mitch McConnell (R-KY): Gifted from the NRA $1,262,189---but he will keep praying! #NotOneMore
@SenJohnThune %£$#& ya'll.
A moment? You've been silent since day one. "Faith without works is dead". #filibuster
The @SenateDems know that moments of silence are the last thing we need right now. When will you figure that out?
Didn't care enough to actually try to prevent it from happening again though, did you? Fuck your "prayers."
@SenJohnThune Maybe instead of prayers, you could offer up the fat money the NRA gave you to compromise your responsibilities?
WE DON'T NEED YOUR PRAYERS OR SILENCE. WE NEED YOU TO #SayNO2NRA DO YOUR JOB! #ENOUGH #BanKillingMachines #SensibleGunControl
Please stand your ground don't let the Dems take gun rights from the law abiding Americans
SENATE REPUBLICANS HADE NOT LET NRA FORCE THEM TO LET NO=FLY PEOPLE BUY GUNS THE PEOPLE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE =SENATEHELP MURDER
@SenJohnThune enough prayers and thoughts.  How about you think about fixing this and do it!  #NoFlyNoBuy
The country needed more than silence from you. #DisarmHate #Enough
@SenJohnThune We don't need more #thoughtsandprayers - we need action - why are you taking the @NRA's blood money? @GOP
OK prayer over,  gop .  Now let's block that gun control and gay rights legislation and show our real face.
Have any Republican Senators supported the #Enoughisenough #filibuster in any way? If not, why not?
we need action, not silence! Do your duty! Vote! #Enough #filibuster
Please do more than pray! #WeAreWatching #filibuster #EnoughGunViolence
@SenateMajLdr Save your prayers. Just pass effective gun control. Okay?
Stop praying, and start supporting reasonable and sane gun control legislation.
@SenateMajLdr And stop bullying gays and creating a hateful environment where violence thrives.
@SenJohnThune prayer has not helped. Maybe its time to try real legislation. Too bad the NRA owns the GOP.
Oh that should really help!  Thanks for all the guns!!!!
@SenateMajLdr We need #PolicyChangeforOrlando! Please do the right thing & lead w/Bipartisan support.
we don't want your prayers, or your moment of silence! We want gun control! #NoFlyNoBuy!
no we don't
I don't give a rats ass what you want anymore! My people are dying because of GOD inaction!  Enough!
they're dying because they aren't smart enough to carry their own gun
All those people carrying guns in that night club? Every one becomes the suspect. What kind of crazy logic is that?
the guy who shot back would have been a hero.
there was an off duty cop in there! He shot back. Get your facts right before you declare your expertise!
so there was one hero there. Great.  a couple more would have been useful
.@SenateGOP Senate GOP inaction is a shameful, spineless affront to all victims' families. #HonorWithAction not empty condolences.
YES PLEASE.  Thoughts and prayers are wonderful.  FAITH without Action is dead.  We want action! #filibuster
moments of silence are not enough, and only you guys can speak up to make the difference. #holdthefloor
Prayers are not #enough. As a body without a spirit is dead, so is faith without deeds -James 2:26. Vote #YesOn551 #OrlandoUnited
.@SenateGOP #NoMoreSilence #WeThePeople Demand action! #DisarmHate #DemandaVote for #gunsense Support @ChrisMurphyCT bill!!
Fuck your prayers. Other side of aisle is busy doing their jobs right now. Get on board and do yours. Cooperate. #EndGunViolence
@nra we don't need ur silence, we need u 2 vote 4 No fly/No buy & close internet & gun show loopholes!
URGENT calling senators to say NO GUN CONTOL Legislation! taking away 2nd amendment from law abiding citizen is not the answer!
Work with the bipartisan group, make it possible to bar gun sales for suspected criminals. Don't let the NRA decide your agenda.
GET OFF YOUR GD KNEES & pass sensible #guncontrol GROW A PAIR!! #filibuster Stop the #nra blood $$$$$$$$$$$
@SenateMajLdr Ban assault weapons and ban large magazines while you are at it. #do nothing Congress
Yes #prayforOrlando but also do SOMETHING ABOUT IT! #filibuster
where's the bill? your lack of leadership is cowardly #Enough #DisarmHate
This is sweet, but would be better if you #DoYourJob #Enough #EnoughGunViolence
We prayed after #Columbine, after #virginiatech, after #sandyhook, after #colorado and after #orlando. IT DOESN'T WORK! #ENOUGH
.. o O ( gay )
Hasn't there been enough silence? Some action to prevent events like this from happening again would be nice. #stoptheviolence
REMOVE THEIR GUNS...FIRST..SEE HOW LONG THEY LAST..OR IS JUST AMERICANS YOU WANT DEAD?
Who are you kidding? You people hate gays, period - you are only using this to further pro-gun agenda of @nra, @nranews.
@SenJohnThune We'll call, we'll email, we’ll vote. If you don't fight to #EndGunViolence, we will vote for someone who does.
@SenateGOP
Your moment of silence means nothing if the @NRA is still controlling you.  Bunch of cowards! #WheresTheBill
gun control what are you waiting for? How many people have to die?  What if it was your child?
@SenatorTimScott No more silence.  We'll do the praying.  #WheresTheBill
@SenJohnThune Silence is an easy gesture. What are you going to do to stop this from happening again. Ban assault weapons.
That is all you got? You can be replaced and you should be.
@SenJohnThune
prayers are great, but we need more than prayers.  Real action.
And then take all the NRA checks so people can buy assault weapons to kill those they hate.
At which time Democrats will politicize that moment. They are classless political power mongers.
The @SenateGOP are all cowards, because all they’re willing to do is pray rather than stand up to the @NRA.
At 4:00 p.m. the Senate will hold a moment of silence to #PrayForOrlando and remember those who lost their lives. 
Quit praying and ban assault rifles NOW
@SenateMajLdr don't want your prayers. Want you to represent your constituency and vote for gun control.
Your prayers are fatuous unless you take meaningful action. #OrlandoShooting #gunviolence #GunControl
@SenJohnThune Prayers are nice, but they aren't stopping the violence.  How about some "real" action from the Senate? #cowards
But you don't want sharper Gun laws...Idiots!
you cannot pray the gay away.
@SenateMajLdr What a joke! Do something!!
@SenateMajLdr how much $ were you given mcconell? 1.2m fr NRA. U hv bn silent long enough.
@SenateMajLdr A Senate's moment of silence = A victim's eternity of silence = A nation's scorn of silence.  Be silent no more!
... Well, we will #prayforyou 
Be constructive-vote for assault weapon ban-vote to replace FBI with an agency that actually protects US-FBI is aiding terrorists
Less praying, more changing. Thanks
@SenatorTimScott After that, how about holding a vote for assault weapons ban??
Cbviously, our thoughts and our prayers are with the victims and their families of this senseless, cowardice Islamic lunacy.
yep were ready for the hate to stop. Prayers for Orlando.
You all must understand the very day you approved gay was the day USA  was marked Red by God.
@SenateMajLdr How about getting off your asses and fixing this problem?! Action, not prayers, are needed.
How about doing something instead of praying?
Great! A moment of silence that will do absolutely nothing to prevent gun violence!
@SenatorTimScott your prayers and silent theater are MEANINGLESS.
@SenatorTimScott GARBAGE. How about prayer through meaningful action--instead of obstructing background checks on gun purchases.
prayer is easy. Praying is not why you are elected,#DoYourJob stop weapons of mass killings on our streets.#PrayForOrlando
@SenateMajLdr It's not enough to pray for the constant stream of victims anymore... Do something.
and think how you are enabling ISIS and haters to get their hands on assult weapons to kill Americans in schools, churches & bars
49 people killed by one person with two guns. Where is our right to life in this great country? You are failing us.
@SenateMajLdr Your prayers are meaningless, what good will your prayers do as long as you are in the NRA's pocketbook?
@SenateMajLdr #NeverTrump
cowards
has had decades of silence instead of speaking up to protect Americans from gun deaths. No more silence! No more prayers!
how about #dosomethingpriductiveaboutgunviolenceforOrlando ?
Why don't you protect instead? Your prayers don't do anything.
@SenatorTimScott this Senate??? http://m.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2-000-terror-suspects-bought-guns-legally-report-article-1.2437868 …
@SenateMajLdr do something you lousy excuse for a Christian. do something about guns..liar and sinner before your lord
@SenateMajLdr Pray, yes, Pray that the GOP will end its run to the Bank of NRA. #ElectionDefeatisComingForYou
@SenateGOP
@SenateMajLdr 90% of the country want action not silence! Now is precisely the WRONG time for silence.
@SenateMajLdr Your silence is deafening. And deadly. How do you live with yourself?
Way to go GOP! You "sympathize" without actually acknowledging. The definition of lip-service!
Prayers are nice but we're paying you to vote to end this insanity! #DoYourJob
Right, that'll help the victims.
Oh, the irony..
fuck you, you all are responsible for this
@SenateMajLdr stop praying and pass a law to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists.
@SenateMajLdr  No one needs your prayers, We need sensible gun laws.
@SenateMajLdr Praying is good, passing common sense gun control laws is better. #OrlandoUnited #WeNeedGunControl #CommonSense
a moment of silence you been doing that for the last seven and a half years do something please
@SenateMajLdr a moment of silence is he best you could come up with? Why don't you actually DO something about gun violence?
@SenateMajLdr mindless gestures that accomplish nothing. Exactly what you expect from do-nothing party
@SenateMajLdr We need ACTION not inaction. Shame for putting money ahead of American lives.
but there was "action " Money was exchanged and this happened http://m.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2-000-terror-suspects-bought-guns-legally-report-article-1.2437868 …
@SenateMajLdr We need action not prayers and moment of silence. This is on YOU. Pulse Victims blood on your hands.
You're actually showing some compassion towards us #LGBT Americans? I don't buy it.
@SenateMajLdr We dont need ur silence, we need you to start working for ur pay! Bkgr checks, wait times, fngprints!
We don't need your silence anymore. We need action. Your silence is what killed everyone in Orlando! @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr
Y don't U keep Ur moment of silence N use a moment of Action #gunsafety leg #OrlandoUnited #Orlando @sandyhook @MaleOutrage #guns
Have some respect! Keep your senseless BS to yourselves. Read your mentions and tell your social media managers to stop trying
@SenateMajLdr with all due respect, Please figure out how to stop this violence. No one needs automatic weapons.
