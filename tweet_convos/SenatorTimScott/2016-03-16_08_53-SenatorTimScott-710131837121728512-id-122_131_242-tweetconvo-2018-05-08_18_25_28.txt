@SenatorTimScott this guy is a complete fraud, do your job or resign
.@SenatorTimScott The same voice they will use when you seek re-election and they consider that you won't #DoYourJob ?
@SenatorTimScott the American people had their say when they elected Obama x2 by 5 million votes! #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott Whose pick do you look forward to more? Trump's or Clinton's?
@SenatorTimScott We've already had our say. We elected @POTUS. TWICE! Do your job if you want any hope of keeping it.
@SenatorTimScott Who did Senate stuff b4 voted in & who does Senate stuff now rather than wait for ppl to vote in Nov? Lame duck hypocrite.
@SenatorTimScott now all of a sudden you all want us to have a voice? #TermLimits
@SenatorTimScott The American people deserve to have their elected officials do their jobs ..not defer them for 11-12 months. I'd be fired.
@SenatorTimScott yes the American people voted in 2012 who would pick the next scotus
The People did decide-on 11/6/11 @SenatorTimScott. #DoYourJob #FollowTheConstitution #StandUpForSC
@SenatorTimScott The American People DID have a voice in choosing the next member of #SCOTUS - it's the 2008 and 2012 election. Deal with it
@SenatorTimScott The American people DID use their voice- when they elected Barack Obama as their president. Disagree? Please explain why.
@SenatorTimScott Quit being a party shyster. The Senate Judiciary Committee has the obligation to have a hearing and you know it. #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott #DoYourJob and hold a hearing for #SCOTUSnominee. Dont and expect to lose your job in the ballot box. U work for US.
@SenatorTimScott you really sound idiotic. The Amer ppl don't vote on a Justice. They do vote on POTUS & he is their voice
@SenatorTimScott @PinkPrism1 Have you wised up and turned your support to The Winner yet- #DonaldTrump 
@SenatorTimScott by this logic, you shouldn't vote in the Senate this term until SC decides who should represent our state in November
.@SenatorTimScott If people deserve a voice, why does GOP keep passing Voter Suppression laws to keep them from having a voice? #Hypocrites
@senatortimscott the people gave obama 4 yrs to do the http://job.GOP  SENATORS DO YOUR JOB!
@SenatorTimScott As you're up for reelection, please refrain from all voting: we really should give the American people a voice. #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott Thank you, Senator, for not even pretending to do your job. The people spoke 4 yrs ago. Wait til you see Hillary's pick.
@SenatorTimScott we did, when elected our senators.  There are a lot of things we answer for down the road when we don't care enough to vote
@senatortimscott They already did, Tim.
@SenatorTimScott #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott they did have a say.  They elected the Senate!
@SenatorTimScott They did in 2012.

@SenatorTimScott Checks and balances.  Or maybe you need to retake civics?
@SenatorTimScott @baileyjer Agree! RT!
@SenatorTimScott The people have already made their decision when President Obama was re-elected another term
 Wouldn't you say
@SenatorTimScott @MyMd78 'By the people, for the people', where did that go? I like the comment TS
@SenatorTimScott Hey Dummy! We already did, in 2012. Remember? You're an embarrassment. Stop talking please.
@SenatorTimScott The Do Nothing Congress decides to do nothing yet again....not surprised at all. Just go home already.
@SenatorTimScott Senator you do of course fully realise that this is egregous populist hokum ?
@SenatorTimScott Party talking point is rediculous. You make yourself look foolish by peddling this inane argument. #potus #scotus #respect
@SenatorTimScott I voted for President Obama. Twice. He has a year left in his term. You're trying to disenfranchise me. Advise & consent!
@SenatorTimScott who are you? Do your job
@SenatorTimScott We had a voice -- it was in electing President Obama, twice! #SCOTUS
@SenatorTimScott #DoYourJob we have a president so that means we made our choice!
@SenatorTimScott the people of us stink balls
@SenatorTimScott I would believe that if the republicans didn't say they were going to block anyone he nominated.
@SenatorTimScott that's why they voted Obama in 2012 it's his right #DoYourJob #growthefup
@SenatorTimScott The people in your state decided -- do your job and hear this nominee.
@SenatorTimScott as a constituent in your district, you have lost my vote. Do your damn job or be sent packing.
@SenatorTimScott Thank you Senator Scott.
@SenatorTimScott this makes me embarrassed to be from SC. Stop playing games and give a fair hearing, please.
@SenatorTimScott WASPS invented the USA. There should be at least ONE Protestant on SCOTUS. Without them the USA decays.
@SenatorTimScott the american people did make that decision, when president @BarackObama was reelected. time to #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott the people had a say and they elected the President, not once, but twice. Fulfill your constitutional responsibility.
@SenatorTimScott would you still say that if GOP was in office? No. Feel free to block any judge you like, but don't cower behind this BS.
@SenatorTimScott Rubio conned the people of Florida
@SenatorTimScott SMH
@SenatorTimScott Do your job and they will. Your the GOP is abusing power and disrespecting the Constitution. Spare us the talking points.
@SenatorTimScott the American people have spoken, twice in fact by electing Obama POTUS. Stop being obstructionist. #SCOTUS #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorTimScott  We decided in 2012.
@SenatorTimScott The American people deserve to expect you to #DoYourJob and hold hearings on #SCOTUSnominee - You shame your state!
@SenatorTimScott they did. Do your job!
@SenatorTimScott We had a voice, it was called the 2012 election.
@ABCNews4 @SenatorTimScott We already did, we elected Obama TWICE. #DoYourJob If you have problems with nominee, vote against.
@SenatorTimScott As a student in the upstate, I am curious senator, are you prepared to vote for a Trump supreme court nominee?
@SenatorTimScott they spoke. We have a president who has the constitutional duty to nominate and YOU have the duty to approve the nominee.
@SenatorTimScott Just like we have a right to chose our POTUS! So STOP trying to end THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE!!
@SenatorTimScott they did when they elected the President who is allowed to, by the const. to nominate SC justices. What don't you get?
@SenatorTimScott The people decided in 2012. #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott @ABCNews4 We decided in '12! #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott #doyourjob & give a thumbs up or down on the SCOTUS pick. Quit playing partisan politics You are better than that. #csugrad
@SenatorTimScott I agree with you, now agree with me and join Ted Cruz
@SenatorTimScott #doyourjob
@SenatorTimScott They did decide-by voting for Obama twice in a row.  Are you suggesting Presidents should only have 7 year terms?
@SenatorTimScott @ABCNews4WebGrrl That's what @POTUS & #Congress are for, Senator: to represent the interests of ALL Americans.
@SenatorTimScott - They do through their current Senators, elected by the people.  @GOP
@SenatorTimScott they do, they elected the President who has the power to make an appointment. You are deviating from our constitution.
.@SenatorTimScott they did have a choice and they made it when they re-elected #POTUS. Please read the #constitution and #DoYourJob
@cbdharmon @SenatorTimScott There is no time limit in Constitution. Maybe you better read it again.
Thanks @jstines3 for your opinion. Yes, but that interpretation of the #Constitution enables unlimited obstructionism. Why not just vote no?
@SenatorTimScott ... Don't give in to the dark side - wait for the next Pres
@SenatorTimScott Constitution?
@SenatorTimScott You guys will cave.  No doubt. Obama's lap dogs.
@SenatorTimScott Really? We don't evn hve a voice in choosing the nxt prez, according to Curly Haugland, who wonders why there are primaries
@SenatorTimScott With respect, Senator Scott, we did have a voice--when we elected you and @LindseyGrahamSC. #doyourjob #confirmGarland
@SenatorTimScott Grow up and do your job.
@SenatorTimScott SC voted with the rest of America in 2012, confirming we entrust our President to nominate to fill #SCOTUS. #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott I absolutely agree with that . NO hearng on any Obama recommendation! Wait til next President & pray is #REPUBLICAN PROLIFE
@SenatorTimScott since when in our history have the ppl had a direct voice in picking a SCOTUS justice?
@SenatorTimScott #DoYourJob please and thanks, sincerely #WeThePeople
@SenatorTimScott Sen.:you uniquely1st appointed seat by your Gov. (Voted for by SC)Wasn't your pos.also decided by voters initially or not?
@SenatorTimScott Why didn't Your Gov. wait 'til you run for seat in next election?If this is different, why?
@SenatorTimScott your partisan obstruction is an embarrassment to any fair-minded SC citizens who just want government to work...
@SenatorTimScott The American people decided when they reelected Barack Obama.  Advocate for hearings now.  Do your job!
@SenatorTimScott Poor argument. The people has elected both the president and the senate, whose job it is to appoint the judge.
@SenatorTimScott stay the course Mr. Scott. The next POTUS should get to appoint.  Just like what Joe Biden said back in the 90's
@SenatorTimScott  they did when they re-elected @POTUS Obama.
@SenatorTimScott good man come visit Bakersfield again with Kevin
@SenatorTimScott SHADDUP
@SenatorTimScott you represent the American people. That is part of your duty on our behalf #DoYourJob
@SenatorTimScott I'm a South Carolina resident. The American people did decide. In 2012. By five million votes. Do your job.
@ryanreal @SenatorTimScott That's irrelevant. Obama shouldn't decide. The more recent congressional elections should decide.
@The_Viking64 Sen. Scott has said the next President should nominate. I'm saying that's ridiculous and the Senate should hear this nominee
