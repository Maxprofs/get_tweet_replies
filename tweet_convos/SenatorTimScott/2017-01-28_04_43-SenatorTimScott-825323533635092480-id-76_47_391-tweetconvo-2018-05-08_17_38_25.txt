thank you for supporting SC students! Please cont. to stand w/ students nationwide and vote against Betsy DeVos. #StopDeVos
You need to show some leadership and condemn Trumps action against Muslims.
I'm not reading from a script when I call about Devos. #southcarolinateacher
Tim Scott at a high-priced restaurant looks like "Sobys" that many in Greenville, SC can not afford to eat in themselves.
this is not a robocall #SCsaysnoDeVos money out of politics #50k #StopDeVos #noDevos
Bring home Nazanin Zinouri!
While .@SenatorTimScott is having a "great time", his constituents are trying to reach him to talk about important issues. #watchyourrepssc
many students at the conference are his constituents 
Wanna talk to us about your thoughts on the Constitutional crisis?
I'm a SC voter and I called you about not confirming DeVos along with many of my SC friends!
Please explain why you support @POTUS & Bannon's fascist regime. Sad!
HHI Constituent....NO on Betsey DeVos.  Beaufort Co. public schools NEED support, not wealthy private schools!
talk to teachers in SC Senator, talk to students
my degrees are in education ad English so I know plenty of teachers in SC, I went to college with them, they are my friends
bring Clemson student  Nazanin Zinouri back to the U.S.!
.@SenatorTimScott: speak out against 7 nation ban EO and appt of Bannon to NSC. We're watching. Cc- @WatchYourRepsSC
.@SenJohnMcCain knows we need to #StopPresidentBannon. Your move, @LindseyGrahamSC.

Yay having a blast while legal residents of USA are detained and thousands of Americans face down police to get justice
if you care about students you would vote NO to DeVos!
if you care about children you know that #BetsyDeVos is bad for education. Just say no to Betsy.
Support public ed! Vote no on DeVos!
support students in the future and vote NO on @BetsyDeVos for Secretary of Education! #StopDeVos
this is not a decision to base on how long you've known someone or how much money they've given to you and your party
those teachers OPPOSE DeVos
I've seen your comments that most people contacting you are not from SC, I am from SC and I oppose DeVos
because they probably didn't address real issues with you #NOTODEVOS
still can't get through to your phone. Outrageous that you support DeVos. Did she buy you w her $49200 contribution? RECUSE
You should be ashamed if yourself. Accepting DeVoss As a SC you are not looking out fir our state!
If you want more students to become leaders, it is imperative that you vote against Betsy DeVos!  Please help the teachers!
I saw both you and Sen. Graham are SILENT on the #MuslimBan. This makes me question why you were voted in. Right the wrong!
I do not live in South Carolina but Tim Scott in a example for all Senators.
yes, if the example is to take $50,000 and be their puppet. Wish I could afford a cabinet post like Devos.
Many of your constituents would like some of your time. If we throw a party will you come? @WatchYourRepsSC #noDevos
it will probably cost us $50,000.
I hope you spoke out against this atrocious refugee ban just put in place.
he's been silent so far.
Honor those students by voting NO for DeVos.
yay, but no comment on the #MuslimBan? You are consistently disappointing.
Senator this is nice but far from the issues you need to be dealing with. Stand up to this president. He does not represent us.
Is this what you do while Trump destroys lives? Oh yea you like that. Power is your motivation, lives don't matter. Hate
are you a man or a mouse? stand up for immigrants!
please, stand up to the chaos going on right now in the country. I'm asking you as a SC voter and tax paying citizen.
education is for everyone, not just the rich.
how can you believe DeVos is good for education? Do you to keep poor children from a proper education?
and I hope you told them you will vote NO on DeVos!
I believe u will be one of the great Senators. TY
Great!!  Now continue to think of the children, and oppose DeVos' nomination.  Children matter.
.@SenatorTimScott Get back to work please and #StandUpToTrump. We need Congress to check and balance @POTUS
#noDevos
Since Betsy DeVos gave you so much $$$, are you going to abstain from voting on her confirmation? >$5M to GOP in last 5 yrs
Please think of students who need IDEA and vote #noDevos.
Will you show them TRUE leadership? Will you step up and vote NO for DeVos?
America's future > The party line.  
#Resist
Senator Scott, you are doing such a great job for the people of South Carolina! You are appreciated!
was just there at Fort Jackson people like and respect you
Thank You!
I love that you engaged with the young people. Kudos to you.
How about stepping up and showing some leadership. Betsy DeVos is not qualified.
Senator, I would like to cordially invite you to my home for a great evening of fondue and policy discussion. @WatchYourRepsSC #noDevos
your constituents want to talk to you in a town hall forum.  Please set this up and notify us asap.  @WatchYourRepsSC
#voteout
you know Southerners always are gracious host!
I'll be giving your office a call Monday about Devos. I believe she is not the right choice. Everyone I talk to agrees.
Looking for to the confirmation of Mrs.  DeVos.   We need some intelligence &  common sense in that office.
