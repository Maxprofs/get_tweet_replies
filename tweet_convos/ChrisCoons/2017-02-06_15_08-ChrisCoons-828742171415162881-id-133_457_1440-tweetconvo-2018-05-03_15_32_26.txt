and that's a problem? Do you think they support DeVos?
any chance he voted nay because she couldn't answer a question intelligently during the hearings?
@SenateDems Thank you Sen Coons. Thank you for trying.
US education system deteriorated beyond belief over the last 30 years. Kids can't do simple math upon graduating HS. DOE Sux
thank you.
go back in your hole snowflake I'll send you a hrc crying towels
for my tears of laughter. 
Mr. Coons, my friend; you don't have to vote the party line all the time.  How about half the time, you represent me?  VOTE YES
.@ChrisCoons Democrats have controlled edu. for decades. Ironic for dems to blame Trump's win on lack of education. You've been in control!
you're a shill
@SenateDems Thank you I loved your effort
u jst stated u been working w inner cities schools for over decade,so u oppose DeVos.THEN WHY HAVEN'T U ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING?
...tks for admitting u r part of those presiding over failing schools over the last decades..#VOTECOONSOUT
Thank you for voting no against DeVos! #NotoDeVos
thank you!
thank you Senator for fighting for our children
Stop using our Freedom Flag to support oppression of women. 
Morons
personally I think this use of "your freedom flag" is more oppressive to women than a hijab
Thank you on behalf of the people of the United States.
Thank you for standing up against DEVOS #NoODEVOS @ChrisCoons
thank you for your No Vote
Oh. Well, if you strenuously object then I should take some time to reconsider.
our school system is full of unqualified teachers and principles just turn on the news
Haha I wish they had that on voting forms 'no fucking WAY' :) Id enjoy voting more
Why do you say #Devos is unqualified?
she has NEVER even set foot in a Public School for one!
How do you know that??!The results from what we have been doing is NOT WORKING. What is wrong w/ school choice?! @ChrisCoons
My children's public school is working exceptionally well for mine. Do you have a children?
I have 2 sons & a daughter. I m glad ur schools r great. Why can't I have that chance 4 my kids? #SchoolChoice @ChrisCoons
Similar hiring a community organizer, turned 1 term senator to be POTUS?
a tie that when I am concerned it's such a uphill battle so much McCarthyism going on in everything this administration is doin
Senator Coons I appreciate all the hard work that you and the Dems are doing in fighting back, but when the VP votes to  undo a
Thank you for your vote
Thank you Senator. We will not forget. #unpresidented
@1corporatethug Against De Vos, because the job has been handled so well until now, & you care?
We want ThreeRs, Not ThreeXXX
THANK YOU!!!
@1corporatethug What were the qualifications of the man who ran it 39yrs (retired few yrs ago)? 
Sex w Andy Warhol? 
Nitpick
@SenateDems thank you for standing up for the people
@SenateDems 
Unqualified to be a senator, clown on Kaine level, red rubber nose, big floppy shoes. obama court jester
Coons votes 4 Teacher Unions & Obama's Sec Ed gave us US StudentsLast in Science & Math &  & 1st inCost/Student $90K
So giving to Inner City kids so they may have a better education is bad? You're delusional Senator!!
@mfbusto11 Thank you Sen Coons. The video is great.
@SenateDems Plantation Democrats beholden to bloated education system oppose DeVos who brings CHOICE & HOPE to inner city youth!
Thank you for standing strong against DeVos
@SenateDems You're a partisan hack. Nothing more. Your hysterics & hyperbole are why your party has been rejected coast 2 coast.
@SenateDems  Thank you Sir!!
@SenateDems wonder how much he gets from the union?
I think it's just a yea or nay vote. Don't really have a 'hells yeah!' or 'fuck no!' vote.
Just no, will suffice.
Thank you for #NoOnDeVos!
@SenateDems Thank you Senator
@SenateDems I wholeheartedly agree, Mr Senator. Nothing personal. It's suggested, someone that identifies.
And how much did the Teacher's Unions pour into your coffers? Dept of Education(1979) poster child of failure.
@SenateDems You all are a joke - NEA has more money - vote the way they want you to - forget what is good for kids
Thank you so much for caring for our teachers, the children and young adults of our country.
@SenateDems And Your Unqualified to be a Senator...
@SenateDems divos is exactly what the school system needs shake it up people
Thank you sir, for your clarity and focus. Please keep up this fight.
you’re not my senator but thank you.
@SenateDems I'm sorry--but this just really seems like a platitude. Why not Tillerson, Sessions?
@SenateDems if choice gives kids in poorer areas opportunity why resist that?
Thank you for preventing the totally unqualified, incompetent, and corrupt DeVos from being Education Secretary! 
@SenateDems what makes you qualified to judge? Your motivation is the teachers union money. Bottom line. Oh and anti Trump.
@SenateDems  I guess those 50 R's want their money back for being in the Amway pyramid sales scheme.
@SenateDems Thank you
Thank you for your Senate floor speech against DeVos.
Thank you for listening to us and taking care of our kids.

@SenateDems Is this what the teachers union tells u
@SenateDems she also believes in.conversion therapy and that religion should be in schools. Sorry none of that should be allowed
@SenateDems I'm for choice but not all charter schools work because tmsome care more about money involved than the children.
@SenateDems DeVos is not qualified for this job. She never held job, never went to public school and believes in charter schools
@SenateDems What I know, Trump is success oriented.If DeVos fails, he will replace her. For new perspective/not for status quo

what does Chris Coons know about public education??  Private school graduate
thanks for your vote.
U just said children deserve better and Batsy DeVos will help all schools and all students unlike Dems leavg inner cities nohope
They are very afraid that the union would lose power over education. No more poor education for our children's
@SenateDems  good for you . Vote no!!
@SenateDems thank you for voting no. Did you vote no on ALL his picks? They are all problematic, and are not worthy.
Betsy DeVos IS Qualified and your blocking of the Presidents Cabinet is on record.The Great people of Delaware will vote you out
@SenateDems Thank you! Great advocacy on the Senate floor. Stay the course! #NoonDeVos
@SenateDems education will be Louise's
¡Muchas gracias! This middle school Gay Straight Alliance is proud of you for making a real difference to our kids & our country

agree. No on DeVos
@SenatorCarper   #Devos and #Pruitt  are......
Thank you Senator Coons.
@anitalhdz But wait a minute. Coons is Democrat. Dem senators actually have a brain. Unlike some others in Senate.
Why don't U B honest?Do UR children go 2 private school?Highly accredited public schools?How much"support"do u get from unions?
#VoteNoDevos
Thank you!
Thank you! 
Also, does the clerk add an "*" when your "no" vote is actually a "no way" vote?

YOU are unqualified to rule over our Education. Get over it, The people are done letting congress teach their kids.
Congress and trumpf are teaching our children how to lie, cheat, & embrace racism&hate & then some! No more!
Says the one referring to POTUS with a false name, listening to Dems and believes the USC applies HR to all world people.
stopbullyin your a druggy and you say what?
D's are the liars and cheaters, ask Kevin De Leon. D's are racists who support affirmative action, form of segregation.
Perhaps it is just time to abolish the Department of Education. The States should handle education...
