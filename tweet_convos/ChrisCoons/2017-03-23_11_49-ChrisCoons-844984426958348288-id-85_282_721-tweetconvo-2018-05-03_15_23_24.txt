Why are you looking for a deal with Republicans on Gorsuch? This is completely unacceptable!
Yes it is, Dem voters will NOT tolerate capitulating to GOP. Why you're in the minority, no guts or courage
we are writing for GOP to go nuclear , we don't need another judge like the moron in Hawaii .

The rich get richer, the people die from lack of health care. Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish: $13.6 million #obscenegreed
every job I have had only had one choice of carrier.?. I just need one, as appose to none. don't ppl remember the hospital fails
It's already too high! Not affordable 
why do you think the president pulled the bill it was not what he wanted.We already have millions that can't afford obamacare
we don't want gorsuch!
do NOT surrender on Gorsuch. The filibuster needs to go anyway. MAKE THEM DO IT, or you WILL be primaried in 2020.
@SenateDems Fight coup  like survival of country depends on it
(MEGA-THREAD) The plot to sell America's foreign policy for foreign oil _and_ steal an election in the bargain began at the Mayflower Hotel. 
No worries, we will just wait for #Obamacare to implode on its own. #MAGA
I now believe that Democrats in congress are a real danger to this democracy-I say that as someone who's wasn't a Trump voter.
Don't betray women and the working poor by endorsing and a vote IS an endorsement - Gorsuch. A filibuster is necessary!
hey are you my dad?
Now on cnn you want to work together. Earlier today you didnt!! 2 faced liar. YOU OWN OBAMACARE!!
WE DON'T WANT ACA FIXED. it should fail. Do you have ACA?? No bet not.
NO TO MAKING A DEAL ON GORSUCH
REPUBLICARE. This is bigger than just Trump.
@SenateDems Governments answer is always throw taxpayers money at any problem. They NEVER actually fix any problems.
@SenateDems ACA isn't anything obama & the Dems promised either. Get ALL gov OUT of our healthcare. Gov is inefficient.
I thank you
You seem to not understand people will choose what they want to buy. No one wants to starve to pay for not needed...
Ocare was an embarrassment
I am republican .Hold Trump to his words.  Call him to his ideal dreams for America  https://twitter.com/ReaganBattalion/status/845113806812577793 â€¦
Poor things need more money and a nice tax break. UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley: $14.5 million #obscenegreed
Cigna CEO David Cordani: $17.3 million, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini: $17.3 million #obscenegreed
@SenateDems pop! Pass the damn stop acting like snowflakes...
You are disingenuous.
@SenateDems  So true, do not want Trump Care worse than Obama Care.
Democrats lie when the truth sounds better. You know full well that nonsense you call the ACA is and has been in a death spiral.
@SenateDems   Block Gorsuch, the treatment of Obama's nominee is a disgrace
I am happy with ACA. With GOP plan I would be w/o comprehensive care. Wake up! People will die
@SenateDems Hopefully that's an enthusiastically "Hell No!"
once Trump stop going on a weekend vacation.. every weekend .. then the plan can be paid for.
tell Republicans don't bankrupt our seniors of 45and 64 who will work hard to pay for lawmakers. God bless them all
@SenateDems American Legion what Universal Health Care for their whole bodies not this lousy ahca bill
Good for Sen. Chris Coons! He's one smart Fellow! It's easy math.
@SenateDems STAY STRONG! Vote NO!!!
@SenateDems We'll of course they lied, that's all they do...besides tearing apart USA & all our protecting agencies
@SenateDems vote no to Trumpcare.
@SenateDems why can't the "people get health care like FEHBP? Where the Govt. Pays 72% of our Premiums?
Sir I appreciate your bipartisanship. Please don't die on the "repeal" hill. Consider single payer. HC isn't a commodity. TY
@SenateDems 
HELL NO. NO MORE tax breaks for millionaires at the expense of our veterans, elderly, disabled & poor. #SaveACA
@SenateDems we want the same healthcare all of you have. If it works for you then it will work for us
@SenateDems Thank You and PLEASE PUSH FOR INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION!!!
SECRET SERVICE ASKED ME IF I CAN KILL TRUMP.
YES, I CAN. ASK COMEY.
https://yapishu.net/book/70152 
@SenateDems just impeach that Russian loving orange clown and be done. What are you waiting for? The evidence is there
Bravo, Sen. Coons!
@SenateDems that what it isn't. What it is a yuge tax break for @potus at expense of America. A money grab. A living lie.
@SenateDems you and your colleagues should be ashamed
@SenateDems  why in the world are you so intent on falsehoods
@SenateDems woooo!
Thank you from Frankford!!!
why not just make your congressional system the new ACA?
Congress also has to use ACA - have since 2010, but I do think they get a subsidy. Also they make good $$.
No to Trumpcare disaster
VOTE NO TO TRUMPCARE
that way the 'government' can save health care by taking it over and socializing it.  That was the goal from the beginning.
NOT
Chris Coons is just joking...he tweets more than Trump.  He would rather Obama care stay, because it's on it's last legs and
Republicans have demonized the ACA yet public does want affordable healthcare; they have painted themselves into a corner.
I'm watching this country is divided the republicans don't care about these people
judge gorouish failed
go get em!!
my costs went up 33% with Obamacare. You can have it both ways buddy.
the plan they have put together will not help your premiums go down. That's why they need to vote no and FIX IT.
the problem is the ACA. Dem leaders talk like it has no negative impact. Sticking with the ACA is bad for many
Repeal & replacing w #Trumpcare WILL cost you more. Higher costs less cover. ACA needs 2b review & FIXED
