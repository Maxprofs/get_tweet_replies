Agree. The president should not be able to pardon people that are involved when it's a conflict of interest
Hmmm..send a copy to Beauregard Sessions too?
Where was your "MEMO" when Clinton, Comey, Clapper, Rice,, Brennan, & Holder OUTRIGHT LIED to Congress?
hmmm Crickets!
They ALL lie, and they ALLL get away with it.
So many Dems including Comey lied to Congress including your darling Hillary
Where are your facts?
You tryin to tell me that lying to congress isn't already a crime? Really? If I got "interviewed" & lied I'd get to walk too? Yeah. Sure.
It is a crime. It's a 1001 violation, which was the point of Sen. Coons' post.
Sorry, but your statement is false & there will be no indictment. Don, Jr., Flynn & Manafort indictments coming up! Hillary is the past.
"Now that we have formalities out of the way." 
Yack, yack, yack...been over a yr and nothing, stop crying wolf, time 4 left 2 show its cards & act or give up ur fishing expedition
Does anyone believe, for a second, that Don, Jr. won't get away with lying?
desperation
right. But isn't this just more of Congress knowing a Trump team member broke the law but not doing a single thing about it?
Thank you!
Fredo will try to plead ignorance?
Hilarious.
Does this propaganda email only apply to @DonaldJTrumpJr or anyone that gives false statements to Congress? I think you missed some names!
Let's just sum it up to Obama staffers n appointees why were they exempt?
Don't forget to send a copy to Comey and Clapper and the other liars inspired by Obama.
Clearly he didn't bother pointing this out when HRC, Holder, Brennan, and all the rest of the 0bozo Mob testified - THEY DID LIE!!
Pre-empting any "Well, he wasn't under oath..." excuses later from Trump team?
Am proud of our Senator Coons. Well played, Senator!
So…DonJr should have James Clapper's job as DNI? Or Hillary's job as SoS? Or Susan Rice's job as NSA? Or Obama's job as POTUS? They all lied
Hey, he's just trying to be one of the gang, Clinton, Comey, Clapper, Rice, Brennan, & Holder, Wasserman-Schultz, Obama  #AllLIARS
Where are the charges for Eric Holder, Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton, James Comey...and the list goes on and on?
'I kept my father out of the loop, which is why he drafted a response about that meeting.' Huh?
@ljndawson @ChrisCoons but daddy would just pardon him anyway
He should have thought about That with Clinton  and obama
"I'm sorry officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that"
@DonaldJTrumpJr  #douchebag #drumpf #nazi
Does this apply to HRC,Comey,Clapper,IRS heads,Obama staffers?
Like Comey, Lynch, and Hillary have done. Y do they get a pass sir?
Lying, under oath, to Congress. Wow.
Thanks @ChrisCoons @ChuckGrassley you know Jr's testimony was a lie....are you complicit ... protecting trump...do your job.
Why is he speaking in private?? All Russia testimony should be in public hearings unless it's explaining how they hacked us
Did this get sent to Sessions
Doesn't the Bible already have a law about lying? To anyone?! Prov 14:5;  Prov 6:16-20; Exodus 20:16;  Zechariah 10:2. Pick one!!!
Well...that's telling. I thought lying to Congress is like lying to the FBI??
I typed coons in the gif search
Did he contradict this statement today?
#TreasonousTrumps
So then why isn't sessions in jail
Maybe...he should have done it before?
A little light reading for Junior. @DonaldJTrumpJr 
Sleep well #KompromatJr. #TrumpRussia #PutinMustBeProud
Can we get a #NothingBurger with a little #RussianDressing? A side order of treason...and some Backchannel Swamp Stew.
Gee, I wonder why..#PrisonForJr
Trump Jr. Before the hearing trying to decide on his story...
Is that a federal charge?  If so he can be pardoned.
He needs to send it to Hillary Comey and others. Coons is an embarrassment for Del and a propoganda machine, not unlike Goebbels during WW2
He's a liar. He sat with @seanhannity & lied with a straight face.If Uwere watching carefully though you'd have noticed that he was nervous
Hummmmm, I'm sure it was totally unrelated to the testimony. He intended to do it before hand and forgot.
This should make @DonaldJTrumpJr a bit nervous guess he is not as good a liar as Daddy.
I'm sure it was just coincidental 
Subtly.  That's a good look for him.
People have to be reminded not to lie? That's bad.
Once again, that these type statements have to even be uttered...boggles the mind. Lying to Congress wasn't previously prohibited?
Oh, it was! The senator was quoting an existing law.
Wow.
Hereditary LIAR
@ndylan1 @ChrisCoons amazing.
Which will make zero difference to Chump. He was born a liar, and continues to this day
Hmmm...why would he do that...unless...
I think the correct phrase here is "oooh, SNAP!"
Jr what have you done? This illegitimate Cabal has broken so many laws lets throw them out on the simplest misdemeanor. #ImpeachTheCabal
Special counsel is merely a distraction. Idiots latch on fake Russia news like a baby with a bottle. @POTUS is running show! 
no blev John IO.38
such losers maybe just us little corporations can adopt your strategies
Question:
Why has no-one been charged and convicted?
has anyone checked to see if he just happens to send this out once a week?
Look forward to when Coons brings HRC back to explain all her lies to Congress. Coons proves again that he is a hypocrite!!!
Hey TrumpTrain, sounds like Coons is targeting @DonaldJTrumpJr. Comey Clinton,Lynch, Rice,Holder etc, all lie, where was this letter @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump how do we get Coons investigated. @ChuckGrassley.  Sends out FAUX letter about DT Jr, yet let's Comey,Clinton,Rice etc lie
@ChrisCoons @ChuckGrassley lying to Congress REALLY? Sorry hard to take you seriously. Comey, Clinton, Lynch, Holder, Rice, should I go on?
Oh wait I understand. What you meant was, this only applies to Republicans that support Trump. THINK IT'S TIME TO INVESTIGATE COONS
But....but....#SessionsLiedToo #DontForgetJeff Is Sessions above this law @ChrisCoons ???
to publicize what they had done... Where does this end?!
Which specifically means he was part of the coverup They waited more than a year to confess to this after they were scooped and forced
This young man has changed his story so many times he isn't credible His father wrote a coverup letter to the effect it was adoptions
Sessions, Pruitt & other Trump nominees have ALL LIED under oath & weren't held accountable, so the statute doesn't really mean much does it
#FakeNews
@DonaldJTrumpJr lied several times and just so we all are on the same page he's told three different stories.
The only question is whether DonJr receives daddy's 2nd PARDON or if Trump pardons others so his son isn't so close to the top of the queue.
The second Trump pardons his son, impeachment proceedings need to move forward ASAP.
Oops....it's for you @DonaldJTrumpJr
@ChrisCoons @SenatorCarper Can't lie to Congress?  That'll shorten up your speeches, eh?
Oh snap! Awesome.
#loveit
LMAO! Where was this when Hillary lied and lied and lied and lied...
Comey and James clapper both lied in front of congress. Clearly there's no consequences to lying to congress. Do as you please everyone.
Comey didn't lie. Nice try. Thanks for playing. Your prize? The impeachment and removal of POTUS45. Congrats!
  heehee..
the kremlinbots are especially active today ...
They all have been lying for a long while. Until I see them in jail for lying. Tweeting about the law means nothing.
OK, nice email. Question is, will Congress actually ACT on it (since we've already publicly seen several different versions of this story)?
Should have mailed it to Junior before the meeting. Bet his sphincter tightened up during grilling as daddy wasnt there to hold his hand.
Did he show up with Super Dave Osborn in a headset?
Lil d should be shitting bricks by now LOL
I hope they use that on Hillary!!!  What's the penalty?  We all know she lied so much we can't keep track.  Lock her up!!!!
Well heck, lying had no repercussions for Sessions so why should Junior be worried?
Don Jr testimony today...
Hahaha 
Not too subtle a hint....
Shorter: Trump Jr. lied to Congress today.
Can we assume that is indicative of what may have occurred behind closed doors?! hahaha! Like father like son.


I am sure it is to serve as a warning to the next scum that comes before SJC that they need to tell the truth like JR.. dripping w/sarcasm
Send it to Clapper, Crooked Hillary and Dirty Rice !!
Yaaaaasss @DonaldJTrumpJr
so guess they don't believe @DonaldJTrumpJr I mean who would, he's told 4 different versions of the same story!
Hope the Committee stressed this to Jr before he began testifying today.

Seriously @jimsciutto you’re just a shyster and @ChrisCoons nothing more than a laying cheese ball ! Fake News Channel @CNN
Excellent!
Coons is another one of the partisan Dems just looking for anything to stick Republicans or Trump. Sad leadership
or u kno investigating what is looking more and more everyday like the Trump campaign colluded w/ RU to undermine an election. but ya sure.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
Good for him.  Shake that tree.
Love it.
Does that apply to Sessions too?
Or how bout Comey and James clapper?
#bot
Subtle....
