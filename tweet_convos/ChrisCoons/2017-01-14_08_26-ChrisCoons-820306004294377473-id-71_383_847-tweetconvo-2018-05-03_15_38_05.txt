Coons a LACKY Senator who voted for the IRAN DEAL Couldn't even Carry his own CountyNEVER WILLREPUBLICAN
Chris Coons is a D from De.  with a ZERO Liberty Score pure Anti-American
I don't think you know what a real hero is. It's easy as a representative to make false claims he boycotted Bush's inauguration, not his 1st
.@ChrisCoons @marcylauren WELL TWIT-LER did have his battles too.
He was marching against Democrats, Senator.
.@publius4 You're ignorant of history or a racist troll. White Southern Democrats went Republican because of Civil Rights Act. @ChrisCoons
What about respect for our new President?  I am sorry but he should be showing respect for our nation's highest office.
when trump shows respect for the office we can talk. Remember how the original birther treated Obama? Respect? NO!
Maybe it is time to put away all differences and at least try to work together. Sometimes we forget what is important.
Jones sounds more like an advocate for a race war. He's no Martin  Luther King Jr.  Typical mouthpiece. Looser.
@wechoosewisdom Please #StandWithJohnLewis and don't attend the inaugural of this #IllegitimatePresident
please boycott the inauguration. Thank you.
An American HeroSays...
I remember John words about Bernie and not a peep out of him when it came to Clinton & DNC corruption.
You should also read and understand how his words were twisted.  http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/john-lewis-clarifies-comments-bernie-sanders …  BS was toxic, sorry...
DOPE
liars represent the best of us? UnAmerican Political Hacks represent the best of us? Keep doing what ur doing.8 years of Trump!
do the right thing Senator! Do not go to the inauguration!
And he is a liar.  He boycotted Bush 43 also.  Anti-American maybe?  Anti peaceful transition of power maybe? Answer to both-YES
Lewis is senile and should have stepped down years ago...but wants to draw big tax payer paid salary . Move on, old man
.@ChrisCoons His statement & behavior is shameful.
If he was a true american; he'd be unifying; not divisive to hell with @johnlewis
true heroes speak truth to power
So Chris, you too are saying trump is illegitimate?, disrespecting the American process?
how do we protct our democracy if we don't investigate? It is all around us. Jst sit bck & drink the kool-aid?
Investigate all you want. Respect the 'peaceful transition'!
  What wud b said if dem Pres called illegitimate
I am not advocating "unpeaceful" just using my right as an American citizen to be informed and voice my views
And the worst of us.
40 years ago, boo hoo. Find a better excuse you UNAMERICAN jerkoff
.@ChrisCoons mayb so but not by the statements against the president elect chosen by the peopl.
and you voted for big Pharma hope you're getting a big kick back cuz you got blood on your hands you suck
Trump has sacrificed NOTHING for America; he, his father & grandfather have only ripped America. He dodged taxes & draft!
The #FBI is as compromised as the illegitimate candidate, Trump, it helped elected. #RussianDossier
Not so fast,. I accept the will of US voters. Trump won get over it. No free pass on poor statements.
NOT.
@advocate4truths something wrong w Trump.  He hasn't done a damn thing for our country.
being a hero is very hard for trump to understand.
we need you & allDem senators to ask DOJ to set up ind. cmmte. Related 2Trump tm involv. W/FSB to invde democrcy. We Nd.  Heroes
Have to ask yourself why there are NO civil rights related people in the GOP. Plenty of civil rights suppressors tho.
Thank you! And Hoping to see your name of the list on NON ATTENDEES at the farce called the inauguration of Trump.
next time maybe they will beat him to death and we wont have to hear it any more..
Thank you. John Lewis is our hero and salvation, says this white chick from Arkansas.  #IStandWithJohnLewis
Are you planning to participate in the Inauguration boycott?
unlike him you vote against @SenSanders amendment which would lower prescription drug costs. Good job keeping Americans sick.
thank you for standing with @repjohnlewis please boycott Inauguration please do not confirm Tillerson
he does, a hero! Any explanation for your no vote for cheaper drugs from Canada?
Trump was spot on.
it also takes courage to stand up to big pharma.
Please boycott the inauguration.
: Not so. He is one prejudice congressman those days are over  and please all you congressmen "Get over it"
Why haven't you changed your last name yet? Do it for MLK day this year!!
Thank you for standing with @repjohnlewis! #IStandWithJohnLewis http://shareblue.com/flood-of-democrats-denounce-donald-trumps-slanderous-attack-on-john-lewis/ …
and you are breaking the backs of many Americans unable to afford their medications ....
Agreed!!! Stand with him on #Illegitimate
Like when he accused Tea Party supporters of shouting racial slurs at him and then hid when video refuted his claims?
Sadly, @realDonaldTrump always jumps over cliff before realizing splat he'll become. Without empathy, there can be no heroism.
He is NO DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. AND HIS ARROGANCE DOESNT HELP HIS CAUSE.
thank you for standing with him. Please don't vote to confirm Tillerson. Please.
# boycott all democratic's
YEP ! YOU CAN BE HIS DANCE PARTNER AT THE INAGURATION, WHEN ALL THE LIBERALS DO THE  BARACK O TANGO COONS GET A  LIFE HAVE FUN
What Donald Trump tweeted about John Lewis is disagraceful & shameful 
Unlike you, who cannot even stand up to big pharma. @SenSanders was right to call you out.
but when he lies about GOP, we don't have to believe him.
@realDonaldTrump ICYMI
Boycott the inauguration.
