@SenSchumer lie lie lie no they don't agree! Dogshit brain commi anti-American imbisol!
@SenSchumer only the scientists who's grants are paid by government are in agreement, just like career welfare recipients do
You don't want to know the facts. There are plenty of scientists that disagree with human caused Climate change.
.@ChrisCoons @WellProbably
@WellProbably  45 doesn't live in the world of facts
And many scientists don't agree about climate change, sure the climate is changing but is man causing it?

Your watching to much CNN and MSNBC not all scientist agree that man is causing the change.
Send me links to peer reviewed articles of those scientists. I'll be happy to read them
The climate has been changing since DAY ONE. Get used to it.
Trump is mentally unfit to be the President of the United States #impeachment needs to start now!
“@ChrisCoons: Climate change is real. Scientists agree. So we need the facts. #climatefacts #DefendScience” Hells yeah
@SenSchumer And we all know the scientists are never wrong and never want to line their pockets with government funding.
I hope pres Trump has the US drop out of the UN, another agency that takes our $$$ and treats us like shit.
20 yr warming trend 1/3 of what #climatemodels predicted http://joannenova.com.au/2017/01/what-they-dont-say-about-the-hottest-ever-year-20-year-warming-trend-is-one-third-of-what-models-predicted/ …
All BS the figures are based on MODELS.
Climate change is a normal function of sun cycles as proven in geological record for millennia, long before humans.
@SenSchumer Unfortunately the facts you have do not connect human consumption to global warming. What you have is theory.
yes sir and thank you.
thank you
NOT A MUZZLE ON THE EPA
Actually, WRONG.  Scientists do not agree.  NASA now stating fossil fuels cause COOLING.  Why no one trusts CC.
According to Al Gore the earth should be wasted by end of 2016. He really knew how to make $$ from this hoax.
Bullshit!
yes climates change, and if you accept plate tectonics you have to agree they do it naturally
Consensus isn't science.
Hypothesis 
Testing 
Falsifying is science
By that reasoning, if enough people believe the sky is green it would be so.
climate change has been happening for billions of years . Get jobs into Delaware
@0Hour1Army eye roll .... sorry, the sky is not falling.
Also, notice how the priests of the movement ditched "global warming" in favor of climate change. Hmm
Climate change is real. Scientists agree humans are not the sole cause. 4 B yr of Facts show this is true.  #climatefacts #DefendScience
when the music stops playing democrats not will to work with POTUS or GOP are going to find themselves without a chair to sit on
Just like @algore said that they world would be over last year. No facts, just political $$$

projections of sea level change should be mapped to financial loss/risk so that climate change is measured in $ not C or F
@SenSchumer tell that crap to India and China not us
@SenSchumer Yes, we need the real science and real facts to make real decisions that will make a real difference. Not Gore's poo
everbody knows the climate and geography of earth has changed in the last few thousand yrs! And every scientist agrees on that!
Defend REAL SCIENCE not Greedy Govt censored 'science'.  The climate non-consensus
Less rhetoric. More action please.
@SenSchumer Facts is meaning less in Trumps world.
Not all scientists agree.
"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts." -Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Thank you. Please continue to fight for our climate and the truth. #ScienceMarch
@SenSchumer of course it's real, been happening for 4.5 billion years. Doesn't mean ur gunna tax it when ur 20 trillion in debt
No ... not all scientists agree ....

Nobel Laureate Smashes the Global Warming Hoax
@SenSchumer  the fact you told us trump would never win is real too.
@SenSchumer can you say it
@SenSchumer so is radical Islamic terrorism
@SenSchumer 
The left politicized science research
...
Made it suspect
So we can count on a NO vote from both of you?
@SenSchumer @ChrisCoons Read R in the Bible. The weather changes are part of the end days. It doesn't matter what we do, it won't work.
We must figure out how your constituents can help you defy him
the @EPA will be censored by the new administration. We need to demand full transparency.
Pssst....not all scientists agree that it's caused by man...or that it's a threat.
name 3 scientists
agree 100%
