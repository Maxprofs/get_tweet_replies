You think THAT'S BAD! ...while her husband was giving a speech!

There are plenty more pics from that speech and more victims. Google Biden groper images
just so you know, joe lost 2 children out of 4. This is the outcome.
just a crap attempt at slander makes it harder for real victims to tell there story #crapphotoshop
Oh yea? There are plenty more on Google images. Biden Groper
I can't take it seriously when there is a anime girl photoshop into it. Your argument is invalid.
thank you for everything you are doing Mr VP! From a 45 year old cancer survivor
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @Medium any comment on the #birddogging expose??
no, how long did Hillary hide from the media over the leaks and videos?
Thank you for your leadership! This is personal for so many Americans, including you and me.
Leadership? fighting behind school gym threats like a bully? And they talk about Trump?
Surely we don't disagree that ending cancer would be a good thing.
Will this effort be able to stay on track once the new administration take over in January?
I have lost majority of my family including my Mom to cancer. This must be a priority. Not one family is left untouched by big C
Thank u, VP Biden.  Lost my nephew to lymphoma in July. TIME is right, the nasties have taken over the Internet!
we have all lost loved ones to cancer, and have spent billions on a cure. then wait for it to be approved
PS I wish you had run for POTUS 
cancer free American!!!
really nice

#CancerMoonshot  how much funding will trickle down to us, smaller academic labs? Research funding has become like "Reaganomics"
#CancerMoonshot by Reaganomics, I loosely indicate a trickle down economic investment in research, rather than ground-up.

pharmaceutical companies do not want this to happen it will put a hurt on them.  But guess what I do so DOWN WITH CANCER!

@acs_minnesota We are counting on you! All the best to the many Cancer Survivors, hang in there.
VP Biden, you are an inspiration to so many of us. Feel you would have been a great President. Understand why didn't run.
Scientific collaboration is crucial in the fight against cancer. We stand with you in these efforts. #CancerMoonshot

My Father went thru a living hell Fromm 1948-1960 with such pain-but never showed it to me his tiny child. I  u Daddy 
Thank you.
You are a sneakyman!
The #CancerMoonshot report does not engage with access to medicines as much as I'd hoped @VP https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/final_cancer_moonshot_task_force_report_1.pdf …
The @VP has a bit on crowdsourcing IP information for #Cancer research, which was interesting
Dear @VP @POTUS: St Louis Citizens Facing Health Risk of @WestLakeSite Need #CancerMoonshot Hope + EPA Remedial Solutions
, I tweeted you Chemical Lists OU1 OU2 of @WestLakeSite, That I Presented @ Oct Mtg & Dr Paul Charp ATSDR Confirmed

Did u tell your grandchildren that u want to take Trump behind the Gym?Some pathetic role model u r.Where is your apology u BULLY
Is the @VP a cafeteria catholic? @POTUS @Medium #JoeBiden #MakeBidenCatholicAgain #justasking #Maryland #Baltimore #Catholic? #Election2016
Am I supposed to moon you?
Thank you for your work on the #CancerMoonshot
Is it readable.  Maybe the VP has more "ass" comments in it?
so you say you want to take Donald Trump behind a gym?! Again if that have been Donald smearing him! You are worse!!!
We stand behind @VP Biden and  #CancerMoonshot to aggregate #cancer #datasets that might hold answers for a cure http://ow.ly/mw8Z305o07L 
Great Job Joe. We need to fight cancer anyway we can

THANK YOU!!!!
No Voter Fraud?JessJackson came to Phila in 08&12 to role out the dead vote for you.Peoplewho worked for me rode the churchbuses.

VPJoe Biden is the best guy for this mission, no doubt about it

Did you file a report on how many times your boss Obama has lied to the American people?
So we should vote for another liar like your boss!
Years back a friend and mentor left this statement that is so relevant today. Only time and use of AI. http://www.ludwigcancerresearch.org/our-story/about-us/founder …

Congratulations on writing a great gov tweet! http://shiningsea.measuredvoice.com/VP/status/788097252522721280 … (Ranked 12th for Oct 17.)
what a great moment, too bad it didn't make any difference in the corruption of not being able to afford cost of meds

Too bad this doesn't include any $ for metabolic research. Strong evidence that cancer is a METABOLIC disease.
thanks Mr. Biden
The visit by a delegation of Italian lawmakers&businessmen to Crimea will give an impetus to the development of Crimea's economy

Thank you for your work!
I think u mean well, but 11). I could go on, and it won't make any difference anyway.
I think u mean well, but 10). Suggest u spend a little less time w/ expert sycophants, & visit the trenches - in the U.S.
I think u mean well, but 9). While ur at it, why not finally regulate supplements, which can interfere with cancer tx?
I think u mean well, but 8). Why not change how BigPharma trials and SEC put patients second, instead of first?
I think u mean well, but 7). While ur worried about other countries' cancers, why do we export so much cancer/tobacco?
I think u mean well, but 6). Because, tobacco??? Seriously? We still sell that known carcinogen?
I think u mean well, but 5). Why not legislation to fix disability ins. to allow cancer patients to work some, not none?
I think u mean well, but 4). Lack of basic H.S. science education prevents patients from understanding their diseases.
I think u mean well, but 3). You've proved the "best" don't fix everything. When u promote that tho, you undermine others
I think you mean well, but 2). We've cured some cancers for decades. Saying "someday we'll find a cure" is fearmongering.
I think you mean well, but 1). There's not one disease that is "cancer" and there isn't one treatment.
@acpelletier @InnovFellows congrats!!! 
Thanks for your service and sorry for all of the ill will of some posters here. Sad and pathetic really.
Honesty is the mother of all...
Hillary must make it easy  for the child to see the father. Man goes out bcz woman out.
Hillary u the mother, Danny is also ur son. See the cry of ur boy. He is ur daughter brother. U are a mother!!!
Plz!!!
To be men is also to recognize our own children. Where is the black son of the Clintons. U can denie ur own leg or hand
U gone drive us into  ww3. It's scary.
Hillary have been in power to long.
Time to change. New people, new faces! Plz!
great Joe ! We love you
So what does the U.S. government have planned to defraud the presidential election.   Democrats = Party of crooks and corrupt.
U really need to STOP talking junk about Mr Trump groping women when U are the one doing the groping!!
why start now and give@hillary all the credit?
why can't the report be read ?
Who did you plagiarize the report from.
must watch
@WhiteHouse I lost my Brother and my Mom,to Cancer.
terrific!
I'm with you Joe. My focus is ovarian cancer
Advanced cancer is not a chronic disease. 600k in US die/yr. More funds 4 metastasis research can help to cure cancer.
Way to go, Joe.  I lost my dad 10 years ago from Colon Cancer.  Cancer touches all of us.  Again, thanks and bless you & Jill!!
how can you say you want to fight cancer when there are still govt APPROVED carcinogens in our food?
because of the money that they make off of it.
I was there doing primary care ! 

I hate Cancer, it sucks the life away, and prevents golden years of pleasure.
@johniadarola @POTUS @Medium Pray all you like, there is no god. If this works credit goes to SCIENCE, not SUPERSTITION.
These politicians ARE CORRUPT. This is a simple fact. YOUR GIG IS UP puppets.
Sadly, there will NEVER be a cure because it would put big pharma out of business!! Chemo is a cash cow!!
Bravo! Immunotherapy and a variety of other treatments hold promise. More research is important.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @StateDept @NSC44 @NRA @NYCgov @MikeBloomberg @INTERPOL_HQ @UNPOL @GRCqc Cities: Questions to City Police @TheIACP
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @Medium Joe, Obama said you were in charge of finding a cure.
Time running out...chop-chop.
What's the cure for reversing nuclear effects of turning us into piles of ash? I'll wait for your answer.
so proud of what you are doing 
My Mother and I, both cancer survivors, thank you for your work from the bottom of our hearts.  Keep it up!  You give us hope. :)
Thanks Joe!!!!
Thank you. I didn't know there was a special name.
Thank you!
GOOD WORK JOE, there is always Hope! #TheGreatPhysician
Your efforts will make a huge impact in the fight against cancer! Thank you for keeping progress within reach!

ASCO thanks you and Dr. Biden and all your staff fir the hard work to organize. Now comes the tough part!  @VP @POTUS @Medium
فعلآ الصلاة تريح القلب وتقوي الأيمان بالله
way to go!
As a 1 yr BC survivor,  I appreciate ALL you do!
I was friends w/Beau in college, think of him daily. I met you, @VP, a few times then. Thank you for helping others live.
If only my loved ones who passed on had this chance. 
Cancer is a mean & cruel disease.
why do we never hear about the previous breakthroughs in cancer cures? too much money made in research to cure it
All that money for research and no cure. Lord Jesus!
.@3ChicsPolitico I remember when the earthquake hit Haiti & president Obama named Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. Nothing good has happened 4 Haiti
I'm starting 2wonder if the White House naming folks in charge of initiatives is the entry way 2set them up 4 life after DC
.@3ChicsPolitico the comment someone made about more money in research than cure is spot on... It remind me of George Clinton song Dope Dog
.@3ChicsPolitico "there's more money in pretending that we're stopping it than selling it" ~George Clinton
lets kill this evil disease, lets end the epedemic!!!
no money in that or it would have been done by now.
Great job in a short time. Communication is a big key to success. Thank you, Joe
Are DES related cancers included in this report?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS good interesting lost pathogen specialist fujomoto here same University Hosp. Collect notes please.
Go Joe, Go!
WANTED SEX LAST NIGHT I HID ANGELA SIMMONS IS A CHILD MOLESTER

if you want real information go to http://thetruthaboutcancer.com 
thank you for this.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @Medium don't pray for cures when the millions of babies aborted at your hands would have grown up to cure it
to be a awesome doctor and cure cancer patients is my dream vp Joe Biden
Let's stop pretending that chemo&radiation are the only ways to treat cancer.There are others: more effective and less expensive.
hello how are you very happy l like money
If you really want to do something about CANCER start with the 119 CANCER PLANTS in INDIA Mr. Obama loves. See photo op!
need to tell fda though to unlock a cure for cancer They play gate keepers. Hope to see it cured 100& no chemo
i sure hope a cure is found SOON.
Only an unenlightened person with a faulty IQ would vote for Hillary Clinton!

hey dad
Thank you so much for what you're doing to help this disease from taking anymore of our loved ones. May God Bless you!
just like a republican, it affected me so we have to pull out all teh stops to destroy it, before that who cared?

Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I will SO miss you.  If you & Jill come to a seattle I'll cook. 
AWESOME

my GOD bless you sir
Regulate the official to restore the discipline @potus
Thank you for your hard work.  I am a survivor, and I hope that any diagnosed will also be a survivor in the future.
