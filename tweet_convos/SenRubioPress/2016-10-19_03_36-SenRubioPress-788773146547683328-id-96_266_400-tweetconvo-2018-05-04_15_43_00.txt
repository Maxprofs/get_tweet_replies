#DrainTheSwamp
CRITICIZE?! Criticize? No, sir! This is historical, and you're afraid of extortion.
Sorry Rubio but we the people deserve to know. Do you have something to hide? #Transparency
@AlexConant @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC this fool I'm senate did nothing to stop the atrocities in Washington. Shut up.
.@jacobmathews @jonkarl @AlexConant @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC false. He stopped the Obamacare insurance bailout
what good did it do? Nothing obama care is still a crap
@JFKucinich @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump 
Wow, Marco, you really are a master at losing. You're political instincts are gone.
Marco Rubio is no Republican. Hope he loses his Fla. seat, then he can hang out in Utah
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC 

Principle!  Thank you, Marco
Wow, so he doesn't believe in government transparency?! We now see what they're hiding.
It should of been @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC  #NeverTrump
Uh oh I just got some respect for Rubio.Good for him
@AlexConant @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC and talk about Marco Rubio instead?
Waa, Waa
Are you for real? It all shows how corrupt entire govt is &  citizens deserve to know. LOCK EM UP
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump Sounds like Marco's hiding something big!
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump Wikileaks is saving American Patriots
if they're real, what difference does it make how the emails appear?
... I wonder why ABC would push this: Podesta Emails Reveal Cozy Relationship With ABCNEWS Chief...
- who cares what Rubio thinks. He has his own agenda.
@JenniferJJacobs @jonkarl @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump we should put our heads back down and pay no attention to the man behind the curtain?
Marco Rubio is officially part of the Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and John McCain turncoat club.
They are all traitors to the Repub. Party.
why? You worried about a release with your name on it. The truth is always the truth.
.@SenRubioPress @marcorubio are you scared of WikiLeaks? Have some skeletons in your closet, ehh? @jonkarl @realDonaldTrump @ABC #tcot #usa
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio <~U better shut up before I skip your 4 senate when I vote 4~>  @realDonaldTrump @ABC
The truth is painful.
He doesn't speak for Rs or voters of the US only Fl.  We pay all these people's salaries.
It's free speech, or at least I thought
He's right. Assange is an accused rapist receiving info from the Kremlin.  What could go wrong?
@BDayspring @ABC @realDonaldTrump
If @marcorubio were the @GOP nominee, he'd NEVER say that. He'd memorize every hacked line of it.
STOP IT, MARCO!FBI and DOJ  not functioning.Prez n Congress no help.Thanks to WLeaks we know.
@IdahoRoadapple @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC. Why, that happens to be all they have to offer.
why so they should stop talking the truth?
@NatalieBrandK5 

These hackers are dangerous to US Democracy. 

#WednesdayWisdom
Rubio just lost my vote
Rubio has betrayed us.  He's done!
unfortunately msm colluding w/ Clintons so @wikileaks doing msm job - ppl have no other recourse!
just like his buddy Rump, not a truthful word passes those lips. He's disingenuous and scared he's going to lose.
Exactly.  @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @Reince @mike_pence @tedcruz
@SueHarmon10 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump God bless Rubio, but he fights too clean which cost him the nomination.
why if I vote for you you better day o right by my vote.
@jennanjack @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump Good grief your orange god is heading for a landslide loss & you still don't get it
@jennanjack @marcorubio I guess keeping political lies & secrets okay unless revealed by a chosen source- I'm a fan but this is 
.@jenladkins @jonkarl @marcorubio
WikiLeaks hated by Republicans in 2009 for hacking the US military now so enamored with it
@Samtu78 but thanks Jen I understand where he is coming from. Don't agree but
maybe I should have phrased it better but oh well
I really was more disappointed that some won't acknowledge the content- damned if u do or don't I guess
@jbarro @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC Rubio: look at me being all, all.....*looks in mirror*
go home!
NOBODY CARES WHAT RUBIO HAS TO SAY HE IS A GOOF BALL !
Isn't he the FL senator who holds the record 4 missing the most votes?
@RallyPlantain @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC is this an "Onion" article?
@abbydphillip @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC   I would say that Donald Trump should just STOP TALKING!!
@ThisWeekABC @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC And that's why Rubio didn't make it through the primaries.
Wikileaks leader raped a young girl then fled France. Assange works with Russia. Trump hired him
#TwoSexualPredators #Traitor
@ThisWeekABC @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC there are 2 issues here and important to keep separate. Hacking and CONTENT!
because why win, right?
Rubio is such an asshat
@dtoddharris @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC it's amazing how people can't see the Russian strings attached to Trump.
Like Sanders he is a doofus
@dtoddharris @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC Little Marco
Pretty much affirms what a RINO he really is.
@dtoddharris @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC what about the Pentagon papers?
The pentagon papers weren't stolen & leaked by a foreign country idiot
Rubio is a Democrat puppet!
- The skilled lib liars at CBS ABC NBC always find some GOP weenie to oppose outing Democrat traitors.
Rubios political career should be over he has shown himself to be a weakling in the game.
@sadieark remember, he is voting for trump.
himself is part of the system (he was chosen as the 'after Clinton' President) that @realDonaldTrump wants to break
Karl is a paid puppet of hillary, #nazimedia 
career suicide
/ Dems are doing same thing so perhaps Karl you should look into this http://regated.com/2016/10/project-veritas-clinton-camp-corruption/ â€¦
@ThisWeekABC @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @ABC / Marco, are you really that stupid? The media does the same thing everyday
If Marco and Ryan can start showing compassion to middle class, working poor, avoid HRC bashing, better chances
is useless
@shayken13 @marcorubio Love Rubio for this.People forget this is just one election & we have 2look at consequences down the road.
Rubio has bet on the wrong horse a few times... Maybe he should just give up, find a job.
Rubio is an extraordinary person,would have been great potus,instead reps nominated an orange sewer,& handed Hillary WH
..& look to bettering the future...
He just won Florida.
That is why he is a loser
