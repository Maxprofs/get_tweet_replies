@orlandosentinel the shooter was born in Florida Marco!!!
terrorist's parents are from afghan and I bet he had ties to the Cali attacks! Search the family!
, & a WHITE man was arrested in LA with explosives, guns, about to attack LA Pride Parade!
anyone can becone a muslim regardless of race/religion.Do you know anything
Exactly. It's not about race. It's about theology.
It's about hate period! #NightClub #Church #Theatre #Schools #ShoppingMalls....
Dale, I'm trying to figure you out here, dude. This was radical islam  they hate us.
where is the same concern when a radical white guy shoots up a black church, school, mall...
you need to change your views on gun control! 2nd amendment must be repealed! It's the decent thing to do. Be decent.
Knee jerking to eliminating guns in a shortcut to forego the effort of actually fixing the problem.
Not knee jerk. I've hoped for a reduction in weapons in this country my whole life. It's going to happen with or without you.
There are utilitarian uses for guns aside from war and violence. I'm not going to fight off a coyote with a sword.
absolutely!! That's fine! In the UK many people in rural settings have them also.Just make them very difficult to get for others
@orlandosentinel this sort of terror will continue as long as liberals like you welcome muslims into the U.S.
@orlandosentinel ISIS will never win ?  they did in Flrida last night ! You are deranged if you think love and unity can win.
You know what else is needed? GOP needs to get their testicles back from the NRA. How many more shootings until something done?
, you are responsible for your gun laws! An unstable man gets an assault weapon and you turn it into a terrorist threat! Stop it!
Respectfully, that was an ignorant statement.
in the US Christian white men are the ones that kill anyone who isn't white and straight, end the terror from your country first
so you're saying "Christian white men" run surveys and background checks before shooting? Generalizations...
I don't know, but they do kill people. Generalizations is what @marcorubio and other racists are doing ;)
No, generalization is what YOU are doing. I invite you to come live in the US before you judge us. You know little of my country.
your country is not full of white straight men, so not, I'm not generalizing :V I know enough, so not right now, thank you tho ;)
You generalized white, Christian men. You don't know enough. Please come visit to experience American life firsthand.
I'm American, I'm from South America. I'm not generalizing you just want to play the victim
@orlandosentinel Marcone here's your chance to be by vice president why I go back into the Senate?
I don't want your prayers or sympathy. Stop putting your political ambitions ahead of our citizens safety here in Florida.
please leave this state. Shame on your actions in the senate.#disappointedinourrepresentation #jobseek
But you still voted NO to gun control. #hypocrite
time to get this fraud out of office!
you have failed to protect this state and country
@realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott 
 Already donated my blood, Shame our Pres. NOT sending funds to our @FLGovScott
@realDonaldTrump
Marco, can you help? Florida needs you #OrlandoShooting
how about supporting some common sense gun control to try and prevent the need in the future?
What has to happen in order for you to realize that stricter gun laws are what we need? More shootings? More mass murder?
We need stricter murder laws.
you represent FL and you were a "nay" help me understand  #orlandostrong https://www.facebook.com/CBSNlive/videos/1738332846413168/ …
@orlandosentinel don't be prideful you can balance Trump out. Trump's a good guy we want you as VP
You ask for blood donations and say a prayer but when it comes to voting on weapon laws you turn you back on the issue. :(
Why don't you donate some of the money you got from the NRA/Gun Lobby?
Call @marcorubio 202-224-3041 We R outraged he blocked closing gun terror gap- he wants terrorists to kill more ppl #Orlando #NRA OWNED
Blood donations are counter productive if you're not giving 100% on preventing another massacre
@orlandosentinel Rubio, you voted against the background checks? #republicanterrorists
seriously, it was Orlando's turn?!! Wth are you talking about? Is this the new normal?!!!!!
Sadly there will be a next time. We didn't think it would happen again so soon after Paris. And here we are...
I know but it hurts that we seat and do nothing to at least prevent ppl in the terrorist list to buy guns legally
Yes but the problem was FBI took this terrorist OFF the list. I question how FBI adds/remove to list.
you should be ashamed of yourself. You are just another NRA puppet .
Give it up Marco!!!!!#TrumpHumilliatedYou
why don't you help by banning assault rifles from terror suspects instead of taking NRA cock?
@CharlieCrist We will never forget your vote of yesterday.  Disregard for the will of the American people.
You know what else was needed? Your vote to tighten gun laws. Don't count on mine when you need it for re-election.
and if you represent Florida, policy change is needed. #NoMoreSilence
voted NO on closing terror gap. My friends & family living in FL will remember if he decides to run. You are DONE littleMarco!
i see how much you give a sh!t about those murdered in Orlando since you actually voted NO on closing terror gap did NRA fund U?
You know what else is needed? Gun Control laws. And the majority of Americans agree.
Meanwhile your cronies blocked common sense gun legislation that will probably lead to yet another mass shooting. Well done.
you don't care for the victims of the Orlando massacre. If so you would've voted for gun control law.
@orlandosentinel hate-filled trolling never rests.Go donate blood if u r able n willing n close by, otherwise scroll on. Sheesh
if we had gun we could have saved 103 people in Orlando.
*gun control
You know what else is needed? Sensible gun laws.  #DoYourJob
Shameful that u voted against gun control I hope u lose your senate seat  Bet u would,feel different if u had family in that bar
But not legislation to help prevent this from happening again? Nice job sir. #DisarmHate
@orlandosentinel Marco Rubio is a murderer! Supports Terrorists,
What lies. You don't care about anyone that can't further your career.
so pleads the a$$ who votes against curbing common sense gun measures.  Please enjoy your future irrelevance.
these were your consitituents, murdered with military-grade weaponry owned by a private citizen
don't pretend to care about these people when you refuse to pass sensible gun legislation
Blood donations, how politically correct of you. Do the right thing: VOTE YES FOR COMMON SENSE GUN LAWS!!!
@orlandosentinel If you are so pro-life, why do you let the gun lobby own you?
quit being a hypocrite.
congratulations for supporting terrorist access to legal weapons purchases.
@orlandosentinel 
I want Gun legislation you sin of a bitch !!!
And yet you voted no today #DisarmHate  #GOPRentBoy
don’t act like you care about Floridian. You are fake and vote against commonsense gun laws. You should be ashamed of yourself
How did you vote today, Senator?
But remember, this Senator doesn't care if you get shot by the next fellow on the no-fly list.  Give all the blood you want.
hypocrite! You are the worst!
You #MarcoRubio have #blood on your tiny hands. Shame. You serve #NRA &  not #Florida.
Perhaps if we got some reasonable gun control legislated we wouldn't be needing that blood.  Didn't happen today.
We also needed your SUPPORT of the Murphy Feinstein Amendment, but you DISAPPOINTED us. SHAME ON YOU- blood on your hands!
way to go on the vote today Robot!! Keep marching with your NRA overlords and screw all the Americans who support common sense!
as if you give a crap about these people when you just voted down another gun bill. You are pathetic...
#sandyhook
You could have prevented this.
we might as well keep donating since you just voted to allow terrorists to legally buy guns #Enough #DisarmHate
stricter gun laws could help...just saying
You are disgusting to ask people to donate blood but vote down expanded background checks. You are not a public servant.
You tweet all the time, tell us how you are voting today, coward!
knowing this,  will you vote to #DisarmHate  today?
HE didnt...
#DisarmHate 90% of the population R and D supports no fly no buy. Get out of the NRA's pocket. You work for us not them!
also, senators who vote YES to Feinstein legislation and NO to NRA decoy amendements
@orlandosentinel DISARM HATE!
show up today Marco! #ENOUGH #DisarmHate #NoFlyNoBuy
.@marcorubio much more than blood donations are needed. Change is needed vote yes on SA4720 &SA4750 @MomsDemand #DisarmHate
49 Americans are dead, & another 53 wounded, needing blood, because OUR gov't allowed a Taliban leader to immigrate to the US!
The no fly list is for radical Muslim terrorists. So why debate gun control.DOJ redacts killers ISIS allegiance PC nonsense

@orlandosentinel pass guns laws..not bathroom laws!!
you're #ObstacleCandidate who steps on friends for your own selfish interest. Rubio a Vulgar candidate #TrumpSmallHands
@orlandosentinel did you donate blood Marco? If not then get in the lane.
@orlandosentinel Gun laws are needed.
Hey @marcorubio , did you at least donate blood? Because you need to start making a difference instead of tweeting your "hopes and prayers".
vote for the gun reform to ban assault weapons on tuesday. It's important something like this never happens again
Whatever @marcorubio You support the @NRA's twisted idea that the 2nd amendment, protects our right to have mass-killing assault rifles!
please stop new Syrian immigration
you know what else is needed? for u 2 man up,and make a change,i mean after all,you allowed this to happen,and that blood's on u
@orlandosentinel Wish I could but I'm in England.
Maybe you can donate some blood. At the same time see if they have a spine. If so insert quickly. He'll see if they have a brain
if you're a Senator in Florida, common sense is needed after mass shooting at #PulseNightclub
I suggest U remember the hate U & Ur Party preached against #LGBT community. Their blood is on ur hands as well. BAN  AR15 NOW!
#ENOUGH #fililbuster  Support Senator @ChrisMurphyCT  Stop the madness - if you are going to stay then make a difference.
why do you not support gun control?  Look what happened in your state on your watch.  #enough #NotOneMore
@marcorubio
GOP can't just let Dems filibuster to ban guns. GOP has to offer it's own idea to make public safe: ban gun free zone in the USA
@FloridaGOP Rubio says "God, if I run Again, do the American Taxpayers REALLY expect me 2 Do my Job AND VOTE that's TOO MUCH"
Rubio says " Man, If I run for Office again ,Does that Mean I actually have 2 work a full day and Vote?"
@orlandosentinel instead of asking for blood like a vampire, man up & stop opposing stricter gun laws you republicans
hey Marco, as a Floridian, im not cool with ur views on gun laws.If you vote FOR background checks, we can start to prevent this
Here here! Sen Rubio listen to your constituents! Vote for background checks! #policychangeforOrlando

exactly why we need tighter background checks. The current ones dont seem to be working
Little Marco? Did you kiss Obama's rectum on the flight? You're done in Florida.
Rubio has his head so far up Obama's ass, I think he converted to Islam. @realDonaldTrump
why vote no on gun control??  FL resident who u will now not get my vote
Punch yourself in the nose, phony jerk
I didn't support you for president  I do support your reelection for senate. Run and stop the pollution of Stuart river please!
Guns aren't killing people, but your Religion is killing people!

https://criticalthought.me/story/guns-dont-kill-people-religions-kill-people/ …
your voicemail box is full. Vote yes on the Gun Bill #DisarmHate #filibuster #Orlando
You will not win, we do not want you.

please help all our citizens and pass gun control measures. Stop the madness. Fund mental health....
Gun control is needed now! #standwithmurphy
and #CommonSenseGunLaws #Enough
Run Marco Run!  We need your knowledge and courage to help us defeat these murderers who act like they live in the dark ages!
Senator Rubio, I'm sure your tucked into your sheets by now, so your not listening to the people, or your peers #pulsenighteclub
@orlandosentinel if you live in central Florida, gun laws are needed.
too bad there's a more thorough background check to donate blood than to buy an assault rifle
also, senators willing to take action
Rubio is a POS. Has always worked against equality for LGBT people. POS
Run Marco! RUN!
@JenGranholm I love you Marco... If you need a job, you can come by Mar a Lago and wash my car....
how many of your constituents need to lose their lives before you stand up to the gun lobby?  #DisarmHate #Orlando @MomsDemand
Also, how r working to prevent Americans from being gunned down with guns sold here? Tough bkgrd checks? Pls join #filibuster
@orlandosentinel not to mention you made it clear how against same sex you are. Hypocrite.  You're loving this.Pathetic parasite
@orlandosentinel Yeah your vote showed how much u care.
STOP IT WITH YOU ORLANDO BULLSHIT FALSE FLAG ATTACK YOU SWEATHOG!!
thank you, maybe i will, though i moved north for summer.
@realDonaldTrump GOD gave us FREE WILL, HE doesn't KILL, HUMANS do that ALL on their own. How DARE you. https://is.gd/LH5nkq 
Can we count on you to vote? No fly, no buy!
Spotlight and are using the shooting as an excuse to run again. You don't even matter anymore. Go home to your brew
http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/283642-rubio-says-he-will-reconsider-running-for-re-election …. Bullshit that you want to run because of the shooting in Orlando! You just miss being  in the
.@marcorubio Donating blood is great. Keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists is better. Protect Floridians. Vote #YesOn551. #OnePulse
since "it was Orlando's turn" because people like you take NO action. #guncontrol
I'm gay and negative but they won't take my blood. Gays can't give! No science for this homophobic restriction
to change #gayblood policy, we need data. We are gay MDs; please help by taking our brief, anonymous survey http://Goo.gl/vsLjHa 
.@marcorubio @orlandosentinel where are you? Where is your donation?
Senator, have you donated blood? I hope so, since your stance on gun control led to those injuries and deaths.
@orlandosentinel I already did & boy am I dizzy.. But well worth it.. Everyone should donate when they can..
You voted that it is totally okay for someone on the TERRORIST WATCH LIST to buy military grade guns.. I'm not okay with that.
I'm glad you can let people know to go donate blood after the tragedy. Maybe next time vote for gun control before the tragedy
You want jobs to stay in America but you are the reason I'm moving away. Not the only reason but one of them
I'm disgusted to have you as my senator
What about all the gay men that want to donate to the people injured who are in THE SAME COMMUNITY AS THEM
if you had voted to try and enforce gun control, these deaths (and many others) could have been avoided.
you know what else is needed? votes against terrorists buying assault rifles.  Proactive, not reactive.
There wouldn't have been a mass shooting if we had stricter gun laws in the United States.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT3wG_Wz0Ho …
You voted to allow suspected terrorists to have the opportunity to buy guns. You have blood on your hands.
thanks 4 campaign/gracious bow out. PLEASE consider working w/Trump. U R smart, patriotic. U, HE & USA WOULD BENEFIT
would you vote for a declaration of war against the #Caliphate?
@orlandosentinel #OutlawWahabism sanction countries with Sharia law, seize Saudi assets, end terrorism ideology, enough isenough
