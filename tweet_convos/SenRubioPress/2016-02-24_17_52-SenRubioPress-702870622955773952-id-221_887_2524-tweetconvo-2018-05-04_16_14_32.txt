@marcorubio #teammarco
@marcorubio Absolutely right  Marco!
@marcorubio Awesome!
@marcorubio @realDonaldTrump said he would stand w/Israel on Hannity the other night. U r misrepresenting his position when u say otherwise.
@marcorubio Mr Rubio. I'd like to see either a Rubio/Cruz or a Cruz/Rubio ticket. can you imagine how spectacular that would be?
@marcorubio keep grovelling to #Aipac & Adelson: they finance your campaign so you need to obey your masters ! Politician for sale
@marcorubio
@KatherinVII @freedom3556 @censorcensorcen @marcorubio Extreme madness.
@marcorubio How many times did you miss votes? You are the Obama Republican
@marcorubio what about the well-being of the Palestinians?
@Jacob_Ward93 Not good. They continue to teach their kids songs in praise of jihad and suicide bombings:
@Abc11Ab then after ww1 the British promise land to zionists. Thus they vanish Palestinians from Israelites. Imperialism at its core.
@marcorubio
@marcorubio  with the annual $3.1 billion or more than $350 to every Israeli man, woman, and child we send them I think we are?
@marcorubio Is that a real problem you have in Florida?
@marcorubio guess the first amendment goes out the window so u can get that Sheldon money
@marcorubio My wife and I just voted early primary ballot in Oklahoma for the only unifier of our country: MARCO RUBIO
@marcorubio people in your home state Florida HATE U
@marcorubio Why cause they are on the terrorist list?
@marcorubio That's your problem, Marco.  You tweet 
things you don't know about.  You have too many issues now to be prez, go home & read up
@marcorubio good job suppressing free speech.
@marcorubio Stabbed constituents in the back &twisted the knife

@marcorubio @Mondoweiss 
Seriously, Marco...pull your head out of your ass..
@mdp4202 @Mondoweiss 
@marcorubio has his head up Sheldon Adelson's crusty, 83-year old butt.
@marcorubio  sell  more  drugs  i will  see  you  rase to face with american  people
@marcorubio why is it the governments business if a business boycotts Israel? Stand by Americans instead
@marcorubio ...hoping Adelson read this, huh?
Israel isn't our 51st state. I guess you have to be an Israel fanatic since @marcorubio has been vigorously licking Sheldon's heinie.
@marcorubio It is wrong to suppress protests because not all of us stand with your Israel.
@marcorubio hey, why don't commend @potus for his stand against BDS by signing a bill to block any sanctions against israeli settlements? !
@marcorubio  will you stand for individual's right to privacy?
@marcorubio Natural Born Citizen Explained!
@marcorubio israel is NOT blameless in the middle east..but I do understand their precarious place there..
@marcorubio it also appears that Rubio is the LIAR! LIAR! Listen to the 1st 15 mins of Mark Levin's 02/24 auto rewind monologue
@marcorubio You'll struggle for votes in FL Treasure Coast. Your support of AAF & it's investors have come to light. Achilles heel for you
@marcorubio How do you explain this when the Evangelicals don't agree with you! https://twitter.com/lastblast5/status/702338921586302976 … #TexasPrimary
@marcorubio @lastblast5 Let me explain something to you, Mr. Catholic or whatever you are, Galatians 3. The promise is Jesus Christ!
@marcorubio @lastblast5 True Christians stand with Jesus Christ. They do NOT stand with anyone anti-Christ! You got that? Read the Bible!
@marcorubio @lastblast5 it appears to me that @realDonaldTrump seems to know that Bible better than you or Cruz! You're ignorant of it! Geez
@marcorubio @lastblast5 @realDonaldTrump You can't rip a line out of Genesis and Romans, ignore Gal:3 and God's direct promise-Jesus!
@marcorubio @lastblast5 @realDonaldTrump and your bloodthirst for war with Russia points to you being a NEOCON. We know about #PNAC. We know
@marcorubio You sound like a pandering clinton now, it's going to be great when you lose your home state.
@marcorubio #I will be AIPAC puppet !
@marcorubio Yes, let's keep terrorizing the Palestinians. So much for the first amendment.
@marcorubio Oh now u want to pitch in for Florida?? Rubio MIA!! Idiot puppet!
It's "do or die" tonight, @marcorubio, the one who can unite conservatives.  Gotta get Trump - smoke 'em if you got 'em!!!
.@marcorubio now you want government to tell us where to buy from? Sounds like pandering, not conservativism

@marcorubio Thank you Mr Rubio! Hope you win!!
@marcorubio Rubio you are very naive when it comes to Islam, do you realize the Quran in 110 verses  orders muslims to kill Christians?
@marcorubio ha ha ha ha ha ha you a funny politician dude
@marcorubio Thank you Marco!
@marcorubio Bernie stands with Israel more than anybody knuckle head.  Mr Rubio tear Down that Wall
@marcorubio I just want to thank you and commend you on the incredible job you do but mainly for standing firmly behind #israel unwaveringly
@marcorubio Let us dispel of this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he is doing
@marcorubio so that's what democracy in your US will be like then
Well done on your support for Israeli terror in its illegal terror occupation on Palestine for 7 decades   @marcorubio u 2 r a terrorist.
@marcorubio Thank you, Senator Rubio, for standing with Israel. @SuzanJHolt @JJots
@marcorubio @michaeldickson #BDSFail needs to become an evergreen tweet.
@marcorubio You are becoming a Ted Cruz .Misleading the people. You don't care about Israel , don't lie  @realDonaldTrump
@marcorubio Absolutley!
@marcorubio absolutely need to stand with Israel. Just importantly with our I.C.E. Agents.  Oh yeah, you didn't. Instead, did gang of 8 bill
@marcorubio they show up to work. You dont. #cubanheels
@marcorubio Sorry, but I didn't become a Republican to support legislatures taking stands against companies.
@marcorubio RUBIO ISN'T an Israel backer. Be president of Cuba.
@marcorubio WHY??
So they can MURDER more Palestinian CHILDREN?? Move to isreal ROBO!!
@marcorubio @jeffwkline Laissez faire
@marcorubio fight this but you dont fight companies that feed off the low class
@marcorubio Why do you want to tell private business owners what to do?
@marcorubio 
@marcorubio, so happy you distinguished between your personal position on abortion & your willingness 2 support laws with exemptions
@marcorubio why must we? Really.
@marcorubio @MWPolitics FINALLY someone has the spine to take on the BDS slime
@marcorubio Rubio is not winning, can not win, he is just their last chance, it's over now..
DONALDJTRUMP,website,Only plansFixRealProblems
@marcorubio cos nothing says 'in-the-pockets-of-foreign-lobby-groups' quite like #TeamMarco ...where treason is standard
@marcorubio I'm voting for Trump, but you were phenomenal on the Megyn town meeting. didn't trash Trump!!!Respect that! You stuck to issues
@marcorubio @PoliticalLaughs you can't stand with Israel and Muslims. Pick a side dude!
@marcorubio I think it's important to talk about standing with Israel and to get that message out there strongly.  Then see what happens.
@marcorubio Another reason that I voted for you last weekend 
@marcorubio All the while they keep building settlements on lands that past Presidents have fought to negotiate a peace deal on. They ignore
@marcorubio The FL Legislature is set to ban the state from doing business w/ any co. that boycotts Israel. So much political free speech.
@marcorubio what were you doing in the Peking, Marco?
@trump2021 @marcorubio Went to bed early last night?
@marcorubio @Mondoweiss I commend the Florida legislature for taking a stand against companies participating in boycotts against apartheid.
@trump2021 @marcorubio lmao
@marcorubio NOT VOTING KOCH&RUBIO BROTHERS,  HEADLINES, yesterday, check it
YOU CANT WIN, HAVE NOT WON, JUST RNC's LAST GUY, BEST GONE,loser
@marcorubio Israel has the bomb that WE gave them & been kicking other countries ass while being outnumbered for years.  They will be fine
@marcorubio @Mondoweiss are u sheldon adelsons boy toy?
@marcorubio IM IN FLORIDA , I DON'T KNOW ANYONE VOTING FOR YOU, ONLY TRUMP...
@marcorubio You choose Apartheid israel over the very 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and you want to be President? #loser #gotrump
@marcorubio like you stood for Florida. You've been breaking at least 1 of the 10 commandments! Bear false witness. Quit lying
@marcorubio FYI Trump said he was neutral when it comes to Israel.  You might want to point out that difference.
@marcorubio have you changed on women registering for the draft? Cruz just said you did. Please say it's not true!
@marcorubio @Mondoweiss
@marcorubio I dare you to Tweet how much $ you've accepted from #aipac in last 5 years.  You're a traitor to American values. @PACBI
@marcorubio I absolutely agree with your stance on this issue Senator. Israel is an important ally of the U.S., & a supporter of democracy
@marcorubio Are you going to continue accepting your paycheck for being a Senator - even though you haven't been to work in FOREVER?
@marcorubio WHY?
@marcorubio  Veterans can smell an anti American from miles away. You accept money to give away US citizens jobs. I vote #Trump2016
@marcorubio Why?
@marcorubio Rubio kissing The Florida legislative Establishment butts, The Koch Brothers instructed Rubio 2 Do this
@marcorubio stand with your own country for a change, "Marco"
@marcorubio "we must," "we must," over and over without any reasoning behind it. why must we? what happens if we don't?
@marcorubio Do you commend Sen Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, a fellow R, who shelved open carry and campus carry...ALL ON HIS OWN???
@marcorubio not really sure the state should penalize companies who don't agree with the policies of a foreign power. #FloridaCapitol
@marcorubio SILENCE.
@marcorubio Are you saying you agree with israel's human rights violations? The UN and Amnesty International doesn't
@marcorubio why put American kids thru school when that money can be used for better things such as burning the flesh of young children #BDS
@marcorubio @Mondoweiss Why do you think you can tell me what I can & cant buy? Marco Hitler
@marcorubio @Mondoweiss so you don't support the 1'st amendment, a true constitutionalist you are...
@marcorubio why? Should you not put America first?
@marcorubio If made in Palestinian territory then it should be labeled "Made in Palestine." Every other poor peoples-turned-LSW get that...
@marcorubio You need to successfully Trump. If you don't, you will not be nominee.  Go get him!!
@marcorubio You need to take Trump on!  Do it...
@marcorubio they are boycotting products coming from occupied territories.  PLS check UN resolutions! !
@marcorubio agreed !!!!
@marcorubio WE WILL STAND WITH ISRAEL BUT WE MUST REALIZE THAT ISRAEL IS NOT WITHOUT BLAME. ONE NEEDS TO REALIZE THAT TO  BROKER PEACE.
@marcorubio For a new foreign policy in the Middle East. No more "leading from behind" please
@marcorubio 
not Mature Enough
@marcorubio So you think it is OK for states to punish companies engaging in political speech? The Koch Bros will not be happy about this.
@marcorubio Ky has 45 delegates, I know a lot of UR supporters but no 1 can get any answers. When R U coming here? We'd like to see you B 4.
@marcorubio NO WAY, NOT VOTE KOCH&RUBIO BROTHERS, HEADLINES YESTERDAY!!!
YOUR TAX PLAN IS TWISTED LIE TOO, RAISING TAXES ON SMALL BUSINESS
@marcorubio Stand with racism and a brutal occupation. Right.
@marcorubio Who can't stand u.s.
@marcorubio Trump 2016
@marcorubio How about standing with #Florida? #doyourjob you're not an Israeli Senator deadbeat
@trump2021 @marcorubio
@marcorubio You are polling at about 20% in Florida and that is all you will get. We are giving Florida to Trump. Time for you to drop out.
@trump2021 @marcorubio This Woman HRC is Bat shit Crazy why isn't She in Jail I blame Congress Recall The AG Impeach Now

@marcorubio when are you coming to KY. I have asked several times. I am a strong supporter of you but if you show appreciation by ignoring
@marcorubio Good 4 U! However, you would be Great VP with future USA President Donald Trump!!! 
@marcorubio I'm a Texan & I'm with you!
@marcorubio you need to hit Ted Cruz hard if you really want to win. If you are happy with 3rd position, keep doing what you r doing
@marcorubio At all costs?
@marcorubio  all of a sudden you remember ,I can play the Senator from Fl. card.Get real where you been Marco?We have not heard from you
@marcorubio To bad you have such a poor record in the Florida house. Praising the legislature won't win you any more votes in Florida.
@marcorubio the first one that gets to southwest va and looks at how many jobs we've lost and actually cares about it is the person I vote 4
@marcorubio grant amnesty to them too?! That's what you'd do
