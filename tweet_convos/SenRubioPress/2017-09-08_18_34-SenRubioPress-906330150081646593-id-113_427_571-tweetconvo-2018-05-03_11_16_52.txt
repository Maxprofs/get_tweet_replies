Thank God is missing us in Mississippi

Mr Kass, respectfully please stop retweeting that moron rubio
But when asked about climate change, you said "America isn't a planet." So nobody in America needs to worry, right?
What do you honestly care?
Check out the http://Georgia.gov  website for places available to Florida evacuees. Some are free
This doesn't excuse your patriots reference the other day you know. You really came off as insensitive
These maps have been inaccurate and led to a false sense of security on the west coast.  @amhq and @weatherchannel are useless.
Thank you Captain Obvious.
Global warming hoax. #fakenews
What's sayfie??
Good thing we have a funded, robust GOVERNMENT programs and sgencies to protect people on SSN like your mom!
Too bad they Florida Americans don't hv uni-healthcare it wld help god's wrath on Florida because climate change isn't real
Tells us @marcorubio is #climate change still a hoax?
Yes it is.
WRONG. Go stand on the Miami Beach in the next day
It's called peak hurricane season.
The only issue Bay had was some wind and our Bay was sucked about dry. Sorry about the floods guys.

And 100% chance of experiencing hurricane force blowhard grandstanding by comical carnival-barker @tedcruz
Be safe!
If you don't own a tv and watch the news you're not on Twitter, rendering this 100% chance of being useless

Will you abstain from voting for federal aid to Florida, like you did for Houston?
The poor have the resources to gas up their vehicles and pay for exorbitant restaurant food and hotel stays What the fuck is wrong with you?
I'm in the red/purple
I'm in the red/purple
PLEASE HELP. Greyhound shut down all busses Without notifying. Sister stranded at terminal in Ocala, they won't tell her what's happening!
Dangerous Wind.  That should be the new name for Congress.
Earthquake in mexico 2 hurricanes with a third following.   No climate change though
ur leader @realDonaldTrump says its fake news, why believe them now? Meet him at #MaraLago tomorrow for some golf. Don't believe the hype
Stay safe Marco Rubio 
Ah Senator. Now you show up?   Where the hell have you been??  Quoting scripture.!
So what are you doing about catastrophic global climate change, Senator? From a concerned Tampa constituent.
Jajajajaja
All these storms must just be a coincidence #ClimateChange #FakeNews #LiberalConspiracy
Marco is just brilliant  Keep voting this bafoon in.
Bet you've evacuated! Just like you've abandoned your morals and America
Wow most of the state of Florida
No shit!
Hope everyone's gone but you!
@ArtGisi and I are praying for y'all. May God bless and keep all the people and their homes safe.

Hey Marco, still doubt  global warming? You will soon be the Senator from Waterworld

No need to worry about Jose', he knows he can't come here
In other words, don't expect your comb over to stay put!
I luv the idiot climate change freaks! You have no proof anything is any different & that humans can make climate change one way or back lol

I know and it is scary but do not underestimate how scary your wind is as you support the despicable evisceration of the safety net of all!
Marco, if you deny climate change after this, every death and every house that is lost is on the hands of you and the GOP. Shame
Thank you
Where u been? Why the weak sauce day old news? Shitting your pants yet?
Surfs up
But lets support the false narrative of POTUS and there is no such thing as global warming #Hurricane
So Florida is fucked, right
Basically.



IDIOT!
Maybe for 1 or 2 days b/c we have a Senator who cares. Only thing that is possible is lack of electricity, the rest is taken care by Rubio
Climate change real yet?
Wow...you are a genius...how about some more jokes about the Patriots to seal the deal...
WHY? Shit TRUMP need support FROM ENTIRE WORLD WISH him WELL

La #Naturaleza es poder, uno se inclina, es #Humilde  y sólo espera lo que ha de venir, si no hay nada más que se pueda hacer. Amén
And then US out of Paris Agreement. #climateDeniars

@rushlimbaugh told us the Hurricane was a fabrication of the MSM and we were safe to stay home.

Which one is it???
WOW thanks for the open faced threat creating hope for those remaining, way to go! #resistthefools
Tampa will be fine
If it hits Miami with the skycrappers yes if it keeps to the west no
You're in the red, you straight @J_DeCerchio
Especially those denied shelter from a cruel and unusual registry.
Don't worry. Already stocked up on beer!
