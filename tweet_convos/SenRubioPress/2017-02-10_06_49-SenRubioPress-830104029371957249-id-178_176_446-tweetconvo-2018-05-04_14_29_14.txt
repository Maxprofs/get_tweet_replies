As an old Cold War Korea soldier, I strongly endorse your Op-Ed piece.

We're in Afghanistan for the poppy right. Heroin is a problem in America.
Sure Engage the Chi Coms with more freebies and War with Russia! MAGA MAGA
It seems we have all of our Military bases surrounding Russia and Iran.
Regime change in Libya was ours also.
You should start by telling us the truth about the #RegimeChange in Ukraine.
It seems funny we have problems #Afghanistan #Ukraine #Syria #Iraq #Iran
so republicans want to engage, unfortunately it appears not with constituents.
Listen to ur people. Investigate foreign interference & conflicts of interest.Waiting
But can a delusional POTUS manage it? He is an embarrassment. We deserve better.
Dear Senator, you are a hero no matter what anyone says. God Bless you.
We know that John MCain is a traitor!!

" We will be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security..." What the fuck? What does that mean?

- where are the rest of the sensible republicans?  You're a hero, thank you.
Yet you offer no actions against Trump, a fool who would destroy engagement.

Repub. senator I've admired most for yrs. @senjohnmccain. But why vote for Betsy DeVos? Worst thing imaginable for #education. Bad choice!

Actually a GOP intervention is what's needed right now. Country before the party

Soros lackey and establishment politician!
America. needs to think beyond it's own backyard
why on God's green earth are you spelling military specifics on media? Stupidity

- I'll read it on the flight; that you happen to be on the same one with me >
Sounds great, senator. When do you plan to resist? All you've done is rubber-stamp horrible Cabinet choices like DeVos.
it's a good thing the Chinese are so much more righteous than Russia...
What YOU should focus on is AMERICAN concerns....like the Phoenix VA?
even tho u r a Republican an ur views r different thn mines i respect u & thank u 4 ur service
When will you stand up to the President on his counterproductive statements?
of course we do, but on our terms and to the benefit of US workers
Well said. Thank you Senators!
how about "why Senators should vote against a fascist president" when they said they would?
DJT is golfing with Abe,more will done in those 5 hours than all of Obama did in 8yrs
as a warrior I respect you as an American I'm thankful that Trump saved us from the alternative. It's  time to play nice
Your apparent ideas are not what America was looking for since both of you did not become President!
What about the article.  "Why America must Impeach Trump"
bla bla bla SOS elections have consequences suck it up and drive on
John McCain is a Rino, he lost his way as a Republican.
How about simple bi lateral deals and not TPP?
Avinu Malkeinu
I am a liberal, I have always respected you Sen. McCain.
Senator McCain I have much respect for you whether we agree or not vote impeach
what's he going to impeach for ? Being stupid sorry he can't
Marco won't have a job after next year
John McCain is probably the only Republican with any common sense.
we will leave it to the Trump administration, we need drastic CHANGE NOW
Curious if Donald Trump can open up a casino in China and daughter sales clothes
I'm glad Trump wised up and realize he cannot strong arm these nations.
how about some legislation then.anyone can op ed. Senators can actually do law
Yes!  READ: Sen.John McCain ,Good Friday Morning!!!!
I agree but the president can chance his opinion every minute so good luck
Like an agreement, like, maybe the TPP? Hmmmm....if we ONLY had one of those!!
.@SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio @SenatorCardin @SenJackReed @CNN Three good men, who write well. Now is the time to PUT UP... actions!
Trump will find a way to screw it up.
I'd rather read an op-ed about why you decided that 50k was enough money to sell out our children's education.
me too, or maybe how you sold out az, or healthcare GROW SOME BALLS MCCAIN
John please retire. Thanks.
Hold a town hall for once and then we'll read it.
he will never hold a town hall he could care less what anyone in Az thinks
No the reverse he DOES know what we think of him... they voted him rather than Krkpatrick...
