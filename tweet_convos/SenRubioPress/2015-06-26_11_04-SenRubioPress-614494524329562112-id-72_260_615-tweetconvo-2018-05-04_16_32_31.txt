@marcorubio enjoy never being president. #clm
@marcorubio you are on the wrong side of history mr.rubio
@madelinecuddihy @marcorubio marriage is a religious sacrament. civil unions give the tax benefits. they are and should remain separate.
@JSpragens as a born and raised catholic I get that - however the gay marriages are equally as holy&sacramental as heterosexual marriage
@madelinecuddihy only the Church determines that and not all agree but their beliefs are Constitutionally protected.
@marcorubio hey just so u know marriage is any gender marrying whoever the hell they want it's called love get over it
@marcorubio ur a stupid and I say that with all my heart @essttteeee @queennate_ @Gianni_Cruz look who could be ur future president
@marcorubio good for you - you do not need to marry any one beside a women - point is that is your opinion!!!
@marcorubio True
@marcorubio ...and there goes the chance that I would have supported you. #LoveWins #SCOTUSMarriage
@MsGraceyP @marcorubio like he hasnt had this view his entire life, like this is a surprise? "Now I'm not supporting you!" Ha what a joke
@marcorubio thank you Mr. Rubio for laying down the Godly way of marriage.  I support you!
@marcorubio one of the many reasons why Rubio isn't going to win 
@marcorubio STOP. This is exactly why your party is not supported. Like it or not just stop sharing your opinion on marriage.
@marcorubio WHY would you FORCE gay couples to consider a sex change in order to become a married loving couple to meet your satisfaction ?
@marcorubio Truthfully, what is your concern with same-sex marriage? How can it be detrimental to anyone?
@marcorubio Ditch the social agenda, it won't win elections, in the event you aren't paying attention.
@marcorubio wrong side of history. No te vistas que no vas! #LoveWins
@marcorubio good thing what you think matters not so much!
@marcorubio WHY OH WHY do you care?
@marcorubio Aaaaaand you've just lost most of your votes by saying that. I recommend that you accept the fact that you won't be a president.
@marcorubio marriage should be between 2 people that love each other
@marcorubio This is why the GOP will fail.
@marcorubio You cite the Bible about gay marriage, but throw your Pope, God's emissary on Earth, under the bus about global warming. Nice.
@marcorubio I thought yesterday was over, senator. How can you move our country forward when you cling to traditional beliefs?
@marcorubio and our country should be without you for President!
@marcorubio because...?
@marcorubio I hope you are aware that you aren't going to win the elections...
@marcorubio Are you against gay marriage? I was considering supporting you; however, now, I'm not too sure. #LoveWins #SCOTUSMarriage
@marcorubio mind your own shit
@marcorubio my mom isn't going to vote for u
@marcorubio mad good way to start off your campaign dude
@marcorubio Marco! Marco! Marco! You and the rest of the GOP dinosaurs will also soon be extinct, seen only in museums and cinema!
@marcorubio I just don't understand why you feel everyone shouldn't be afforded the same right....It's why you won't win.
@marcorubio That marks you as an ignoramus in 2015. We don't need false leaders like you running the country. Go away.
@marcorubio stay strong in your beliefs!
@marcorubio @arieltheballer I thought the bible advocated wives being possessions
@marcorubio children raised by same sex couples turn out just fine. #LGBTQ #LoveIsLove #LoveWins #SCOTUSMarriage
@marcorubio ha ... its close-minded people like you who contribute to the mess this world is in. #LoveWins
@marcorubio @CHemmeke # save those Christians from persecution #Whoever will help us
@marcorubio Ok so thats official.  Not voting for you.. Next…
@marcorubio Lucky for us, you will NEVER be President.
@marcorubio I really want to support some of your policies but this one just ruins it all for me and probably many others.
@marcorubio Then just don't marry a man. Ever think of that?
@marcorubio blah blah blah
@marcorubio well it doesn’t matter what you think because it’s law now so
@marcorubio You should have stopped after your first tweet!! #MarriageEquaility #LGBT
@marcorubio IN YOUR OPINION! I thought i would add that sentence for you, 'cause, it is your OPINION! #p2 #tcot
@marcorubio no te equivoques. No eres tu quien determina el deber ser. que no te pase lo que @realDonaldTrump con los hispanos. #LoveWins
@marcorubio http://hill.cm/SmkDSbu  #SCOTUSMarriage #LoveWins #GetWithItGOP
@marcorubio It's not a decision made by beliefs but by law.
It's about human rights, dignity and love.
@marcorubio ping @TelasonGetachew
@marcorubio yeah that's your opinion. The world doesn't live by the opinion of Marco Rubio.
@CarlosHDTV he didn't say it does. He knows it's his opinion. Why do you think he need you to tell him that?
@marcorubio But you support #SCOTUS ruling right?? Right?? #p2 #tcot
@marcorubio How do you feel about Mormons?  On that hand, about Mitt Romney?
@marcorubio Weren't you the deciding vote on Obamatrade? And you didn't even read it? Shaddup.
@marcorubio or one man and a Koch
