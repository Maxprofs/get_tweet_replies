#TexasFlood #racisttrump #impeachtrumppence
U know what shut POTUS is doing all he can do 2 help the ppl n Texas. When gov told ppl 2 get out houston mayor said stay I'm sick of u dems
N the only ppl still talking about POTUS pardon is the ppl against Trump moving on. Bc POTUS is sending help n aid 2 Texas
trump signed away legislation that could have helped Texas more, all because it was Obama admin legislation.  this sad #POS is #SAD
Even TEA Party libertarians?
The service branch @realDonaldTrump tried to slice  a billion from their budget showing why his idea was so foolish
Use your air mattresses for floating devices if you have to other wise stay put and stay safe .
