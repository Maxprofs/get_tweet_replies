@esolorzano_
that was in 2015 ........???????????
it was the first one that came up when I searched lol
 okayyyyy
I'm always right 
no. Go back to South Carolina
maybe I will
@marcorubio Nothing to say about the murder of a policeman in Colorado? If the killer had been Muslim/black, you'd be posturing non-stop.
@empireburlesque oh shut up
@DonnaHiles You don't care about dead policemen either? What are you, some kind of commie? Does Marco know you Reds are invading his TL?
@empireburlesque why is it you think people have to tweet about something just to appease you? Get a life.
@DonnaHiles Marco tweets constantly, m'am, about issues he thinks are important. But like you, he doesn't think cop-killings are important.
@empireburlesque don't pretend you know what I think - just because I don't echo your words publicly doesn't mean you know what I think
@marcorubio So nothing to say about the police officer killed in Colorado at Planned Parenthood? But you'll jump to defend illegal aliens!
@marcorubio Go NOLES!!!
.@marcorubio No comment on #PlannedParenthood attack? Need some #water? #cdnpoli #uniteblue #tcot #tlot #murderculture #nra #RWNJ
@marcorubio As horrific as this crime was and you have the audacity to tweet this.  Go to hell Rubio.
@marcorubio you can't win. You could articulate a response to a terrorist act against a cop, a woman? a vet. You rather Benghazi tho.
@marcorubio
@marcorubio way to split those State of Florida votes. Ur comments dogging FSU sports & students a few weeks ago not the wisest! GO NOLES!
@marcorubio odd...not long ago you said UF ALWAYS beats FSU (False) & that ppl only go 2 FSU bcuz can't get into UF (False). Ck ur facts!
@marcorubio nothing else to say? Unbelievable.
@marcorubio LOLOL take a lap fuckin gator.
@marcorubio
@marcorubio is this the smartest move considering lots of ppl that would vote for you are avid football fans that would disown you for this?
@marcorubio You already insulted a quarter of a million FSU alumni who reside in FL and now you don't have much to say??? #GoNoles
@marcorubio, you'll get yours. I cannot wait to see it.:)
@redhed67 @marcorubio #PoliticalKarma is get him! Yeah it's gonna get him! Sing It!
@marcorubio
@marcorubio that sure is true. nothing to say.
@marcorubio
@JuanSaaa @marcorubio and those 2 pts were gifts from FSU! If the only pts a team gets r gifts isn't it still a shut out? In Swamp beatdown!
@marcorubio
@marcorubio
I'll just leave these here for you @marcorubio
@marcorubio later gator # maybe next year
@marcorubio Pro tip: if you want to lead this country, tweet about events like the Planned Parenthood terrorist attack, not football.
@marcorubio Go Gators! #InAllKindsOfWeather
@marcorubio Your gators lost to FSU just like they'll lose to Bama and just like you'll lose the primary #schoolboy #StandWithPP #RollTide
@marcorubio
@ozzie_86 @marcorubio He roots for dolphins. He has the Patriots.
@marcorubio Not much else to say but, SCOREBOARD 27-2...Fear The Spear!
@marcorubio 27-2 
@marcorubio Thoughts? #FSU
@marcorubio I'm a Rubio fan...but I think there may be a little more to say.  How 'bout, "Go Noles"!!
@marcorubio vote rubio
@marcorubio just can't vote for a gator fan.
@marcorubio I am not a FSU fan but the gators?  They taste good and clean up carion our of our rivers. All they're worth.
@marcorubio is a real dick.....cant even use kidding.  A joke of mass proportions!!
@marcorubio If is is 1:33 in Tallahassee, what time is it in Gainesville?  27 to 2 
Go Noles!
@marcorubio you're going to lose the nomination as bad as UF got beat last night.
@marcorubio get back to me when your team scores more than a freakin LAYUP.
@marcorubio loser
@marcorubio & #Gators 2 losers in 1 tweet! 27-2 #GoNoles #Trump 
Totally amazing that @marcorubio as a leading presidential candidate has nothing to say about #DomesticTerror following the #PP shooter.
@marcorubio I can tell you and the Gators where you can go:)just a football joke.
@marcorubio Bridenstine: Rubio ad ‘despicable;’ Cruz ‘ready to be Commander In Chief’ http://bit.ly/1jrInGH 
@marcorubio nothing else to say but #GoNoles
@marcorubio Yes, because you are just that smart!  Lol Go away neocon warmonger!
@marcorubio How about congrats FSU on a great win? We are all Floridians.
@marcorubio Why I cannot vote for you - FSU degree = great education. rivalry is Football not education. #keepitclassy #NolesRule #GoNoles
@marcorubio we are having gator for dinner
@marcorubio yep, that's all there is to say, man. Great job with the leadership and stuff. #PPShooting
@marcorubio You must step down from your presidential campaign for supporting the rebels. Its a war crime to shoot down a rescue helicopter.
@marcorubio sorry Marco go Noles. But your still my guy for president
@marcorubio nothing to say on the Planned Parenthood shooting?
@marcorubio 27-2. Stuck to politics sir
@marcorubio LOL #GoNoles
@marcorubio Yes, there is much more to say: what about prayers for the Colorado Springs shooting victims and their families? @tedcruz did.
@marcorubio LOL!! Maybe you can ask Trump to make the Florida Gators "Great Again" #GoNoles
@marcorubio bahaha
@marcorubio Not much else to say but 27-2. Go Noles!!!
@marcorubio how'd that work out for ya?
@marcorubio lots of things you still could be saying about the #PlannedParenthood attack...
@marcorubio huh?  That's a shame...
@marcorubio That's too bad. You lost just like your campaign. You don't seem smart enough to realize that, so FSU alum are letting you know.
@marcorubio  how'd that go for you?
@marcorubio Nothing to say? #ColoradoSprings was hit by a terrorist attack and you have nothing to say.
@marcorubio #nothing else to say so Upick Go gators. How about Equality,US hunger,infrastruct.,edu?U R right, Plea do shut up,all better off
Not much else to say. “@marcorubio: Not much else to say but: Go Gators.  #UFvsFSU”
@marcorubio what's good Marco Rubio
@marcorubio Except like, "prayers with the victims of yet another deadly attack?"  I dunno, just a thought
@marcorubio cuz football games are more important than dead cops or terrorizing those awful #PlannedParenthood people
@BrentWagner @marcorubio Rubio is the one who acts like football is more important.
@marcorubio Football is the opium of the masses. -- Marx
@marcorubio how about rest in peace to the officer and civilians killed in planned parent?
@marcorubio like your campaign, get used to losing...go FSU!!!

ps...applied to FSU, UofF, Minnesota and Wisconsin...accepted by all
@marcorubio
@marcorubio lol
@marcorubio oh well at least we tried
@marcorubio #3yearsSt8

@marcorubio hope you enjoyed that loss.
@marcorubio Go Noles!!  Maybe you should cheer for Santa Fe Community College
@marcorubio FSU FSU FSU
@marcorubio Guess what ... @realDonaldTrump picked FSU! #GatorsSlayed
@marcorubio lol you have no votes and lost more by running your mouth
@marcorubio
@marcorubio You said enough Marco! Not getting my vote!
@marcorubio AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@marcorubio lol your taking to many loses, first all those debates and then this
@marcorubio You got butt stomped, bro! Lol #G8RH8R #4n8rs #scseminoleclub
@marcorubio LOL.....not much else to say....like UF, you are trailing in this state.
@marcorubio  Still silent on the #ColoradoSpringsShooting I see. Sad... I guess it doesn't support your narrative or political positioning
Says a lot about your judgment and inability to assess RT @marcorubio: Not much else to say but: Go Gators.  #UFvsFSU
@marcorubio Wow, nothing on the #PPShooting? Interesting that a presidential candidate doesn't comment on domestic Christian GOP terrorism.
@marcorubio Florida had about the same percentage to win in the 4th quarter as you do in the polls to win the primary
@marcorubio L's #Trump16
@marcorubio say it again?!?
@marcorubio how did that feel?
@marcorubio Buckeye Nation will be on your side, hoping for the assist.
@heatherhbrown @marcorubio You think he likes the Buckeyes. He hates you coach.
@marcorubio guess you don't want votes from FSU folks.  27-2!
@marcorubio enjoy your L
@marcorubio lol
@marcorubio try ...terrorist at planned parenthood ...or waiting for the polls to tell you what to say?
@marcorubio @TylerAntar #GoNoles #GOACC

@marcorubio FSU, FSU, FSU!
@marcorubio bye
@marcorubio LETS GO NOLES
@marcorubio will you let the Noles finally visit the White House for their 2013 championship if elected? Oh and Go Noles!
@marcorubio Let me run into your mentions.....
@marcorubio play Miami then talk
@marcorubio Looks like you'll need to count on #NolesforRubio for a win! @SFR_Florida @_SFRNC @floridastate #StudentsForRubio 
@dominiquespadav @marcorubio @SFR_Florida @_SFRNC @floridastate You can't be for Rubio and be a Nole.
@marcorubio Which performance was worse?
A. UFs tonight
or 
B. You as a senator
@marcorubio pretty sure your only move here is to wear a FSU tie at the next debate #FSUvsUF
#UFvsFSU @marcorubio is a chump. Gator fan and a Republican. Two time loser. Sit down.
@marcorubio HAHAHAHA UF GOT BOOTYBLASTED #JEB2016
@marcorubio
@marcorubio bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha loser
Bye @marcorubio
@marcorubio skol urself buddy
@marcorubio lmao you were saying?? #FSU #Seminoles
@marcorubio Get used to losing bruh....
@marcorubio 
@marcorubio C'mon man. Well, if this is the only place we disagree, I can deal with it. 
@marcorubio Go Noles!  Pay your AMEX!
@marcorubio Go Noles. Not voting for you either. #FSUvsUF
@TheHoppahh @marcorubio Go Noles. I'm not voting for you either. Not a smart move for a politician to bash the in state school.
@marcorubio I'll vote for you, but your taste in colleges is very suspect.  Go NOLES!
 RT @marcorubio: Not much else to say but: Go Gators.  #UFvsFSU
@marcorubio lost my vote
@marcorubio #NoleNation rules, unlike YOU! #MarcoRubio
@marcorubio you could say something about condemning violence and domestic terrorism but that probably requires courage, which you lack.
@marcorubio then you not a leader. Without our condemnation, PP shooting will increase national division and hate speech to conservatives
.@marcorubio Sure, don't say anything about domestic terrorism or gun violence or anything like that. Also the CTE problems in football.
@marcorubio Love your honesty. Hang in there through all the press.
@DonnaMZ @marcorubio He is so honest. Anyone who didn't go to Florida and Miami are going to a sub-par university.
@marcorubio L
@marcorubio Go Rubio. Your day will come.
@marcorubio You have a lot to say. Hang in there. You will be POTUS.
@marcorubio You could say " New American Century" again...
@marcorubio WATCH: Cruz ad deploys Rep. Bridenstine against Rubio http://washex.am/1MLkapr 
@marcorubio you might want to say, PLEASE Go Gators
@marcorubio It shows that you are not ready to be President.  Open mouth, insert foot.  (or in your case lose a few votes).  #GoNoles #FSU
@marcorubio Say that you will stop the high speed train from destroying the Treasure Coast towns and cities. Do Your Job! Still Paying you!!
@marcorubio - nothing to say about the GOP sponsored terrorists action in your own country
@marcorubio gotors 
=0%
@marcorubio how about a comment on the Christian terrorist murdering 3 people?
@marcorubio really? THAT'S what you're worried about?
@marcorubio @ImwithMarco Its ok, still  you! #GoNoles 
<----€€€------
@marcorubio Nothing much to say #deadcops #murderedamericans #domesticterrorism
@marcorubio Can't do it. Can't address a horrible crime of national importance. Officer killed. Just "Go Gators!" That's not presidential.
@marcorubio comments on the mass shooting in Colorado? I guess football is more important.
@marcorubio @nathanmichael99 go where?
@marcorubio resign the senate; how about that......
@marcorubio http://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/2843/2014/original.jpg …
Actually, @marcorubio, there's a LOT to say today
For a "champion" for keeping Americans safe, you're pretty quiet when terrorists are white
@marcorubio Seriously
@marcorubio You just lost 2 more votes with that remark.
@marcorubio - you have nothing to say most the time - r u in hiding over your rwnj's who shoot people in PP Offices ..??...no vote for you – at Singer Island
@marcorubio Being a Georgia fan I say go noles!  Though I do want you to be President.
@marcorubio this is where we disagree
@marcorubio You are a man of great courage, but I agree!
@marcorubio I'll vote for you anyways but #godawgs!!!
@marcorubio How about "GO IOWA". You got to believe. Iowa is just like KC Royals. "NO RESPECT". But they WIN
@marcorubio roll tide!!!
.@marcorubio not much else to say, huh? nothing noteworthy happened over the last day or so?
@marcorubio 
I see that football is a higher priority to you than someone you and your party radicalized who killed a cop and two civilians.
@marcorubio you just lost my vote! #GoVols
@marcorubio let's go canes we from Miami ElComandante
@marcorubio no....I have to root for the ACC team!
@marcorubio Being a Florida football fan requires a certain sense of humor!
@marcorubio I guess you want to alienate a lot of Florida voters. You lost me.
@marcorubio That's all you have to say??? What about condemning the terrorist attack in Colorado?  You must support cop killers.
@marcorubio Always 
@marcorubio Go Trump. Rubio vs Trump rallies in Sarasota
@marcorubio I love Ya but next week I better hear a Roll Tide Roll 
@marcorubio @hannahreidk
@marcorubio you see, you can't run for president and say stuff like this at the same time. It just doesn't work.
@marcorubio a pol that takes a stand hmm
@marcorubio SEC! SEC! SEC!
