Where the f have u been ? Peaceful  transfer of power there has been nothing peaceful about the dems, very hateful party
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin be proud to say no against Rex
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin - Won't your plan to move US Embassy to Jerusalem pretty much blow up the peace process?
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin Marco anything you say these days has no credibility.
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin and we urge the House and Senate to stay out of women's vaginas. Good luck with YOUR wishes.
@marcorubio  what peace?
#whywouldParislistentothepredatorsinthegop
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin Kind of like interfering with Tillerson....
@marcorubio Palestinians are the "American Indians" of the middle east! Apply pressure on Israel to end W.B. settlements
Please stand down and let Tillerson handle Putin....CURRENT politicians definitely have done a poor job!
It's unfortunately too late for that.  With that conference underway, interference is inevitable in some form.
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin I urge you to bend the knee to Trump you sneaky hellion
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin 70 Representatives at Paris Conference have no authority concerning Nation State of Israel, EVER!
@marcorubio   It's to confirm Tillerson.
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin Agreed!
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin
@marcorubio  we are working to put ours Doctor in America and the other people please make the right decision
America needs a brave leader. Someone that puts America 1st, not a party.TY for making the first step.
Yeah, who cares about the enormous and obvious conflicts of interest.
@marcorubio you r foolish to believe in a peace process. Israel wants Libenstraum not peace, and Palestinians mean nothing.
You are truly LITTLE MARCO. VOTED for REX T. EXON thanks you so does PUTIN
Why you don't like what the rest of the world thinks.GET ISRAELI OUT OF PALESTINIAN
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin Israel doesn't want peace , the They settlements and he he violent gentrification and genocide
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin cowards. Does the Mossad have good dirt on you???
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin MUST BE A TWO STATE SOLUTION.  LAND STOLEN BY UN. PROTECT PALESTINE
Israel and Palestine must solve their own conflict.  US "intervention" will only feed the fire.
@marcorubio I urge  YOU to stand for NATO and stop European destruction by Kremlin.
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin no on tillerson #rubio2020
@marcorubio vote no on tillerson think of the people  we'll support you!It should've been ur inauguration #rubio2020 #saveus
You mean, go ahead, let Israel take over #WestBank and #Gaza? Who bought you out?
Not everyone is chicken s*** like Rubio
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin there u go again little Marco...every post is foreign affairs. Never a post about American jobs.
He is on foreign affairs committee...
u r being divisive
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin mr. Marco Rubio I am a true patriot and mr. Tillerson 4 Secretary of State is no American Patriot*

@marcorubio was once a Marco Rubio supporter.  Now, I think he has other interests at heart besides the American people
Direct negotiations? That's only possible when the negotiators are equal partners.  Do more for us Floridians
What Peace process? It is clear that Israel does not want peace,they are occupying & stealing Palestinian land
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin correction Tex Tillman do not trust him as Trump both have business in Russia
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin do not vote for Texas he is communist like putin
Don't be a jerk about Rex T.

@marcorubio @SenatorCardin Vote Tillerson!
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin Can GOP explain how recognizing Jerusalem as Israel capital furthers US interests in Middke East??
Hahahahaha. Deeper hate? Nothing will apease the animals 
nothing to say when Trump views Russian Hacking as a compliment rather than a threat to national security?
@marcorubio Palestinians want one state - theirs. They don't want Israel to exist.

@marcorubio @SenatorCardin why the fuck should they listen to you when you don't even listen to your own statesmen????
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin And we hope you guys approved Rex Tillerson

don't- you will be seen as a traitor.

Scott MacDonald
Please, straighten out and fly right and support the president elect. You will not gain the following you will need to win in 2024 if you
so well.

5 After watching the way you handle Tillerson or any of Trumps Cabinet picks- I have regrets on you. I would change my mind.
or you- because you did "Support Trump" and it was obvious we wanted him to get things done while in office - is why the "down ticket" went
Marco:

1. I gave money to your campaign
2. I voted for you
3. I sent you a xmas card

4. Do not forget why a large percent of people voted
Being creative !
do not give america more problems #TRUMP #Russia #Tillerson nothing but hate and #fraud #lies #conflicts
By "peace process" you mean giving Israel whatever they want, right?
Please Senator, no on Tillerson.  Yes on transparency and HUMAN RIGHTS!

@marcorubio @SenatorCardin every post of yours is about foreign affairs. NOT ONE MENTION OF JOBS FOR AMERICANS. LOSER

I urge you not to interfere with Trumps cabinet members.
Defunding the UN would help stop their mischief. Or at least partial defund.
@marcorubio so don't get involved with israelíes but get involved with Cuba that is BS
This has been the policy of the US until the Obama admin. Thankful that your vision remains clear.
@marcorubio While I agree with your assessment of Putin being a war criminal, give the new admin. A chance to change things.
sure- A chance- BUT question everything b/c ppl deserve that- divestiture & truth- Russia and Exxon
@marcorubio @SenatorCardin. Keep Netanyahu away and progress can be achieved
@marcorubio despicable person he is.  Distance yourself from him so you'll have no regrets personally or politically
