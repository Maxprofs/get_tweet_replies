@marcorubio not to the GOP and Drumpf cabinet! We are under siege by a tyrant traitor!
@marcorubio how do you feel about Trump spending $15M on golfing in 5 weeks? I WANT NPR, NOT GOLF FOR TRUMP. Get w/ the program.
If you take the right and left wing political pundits off NPR, I want NPR.  Otherwise it's just a corrosive to the adhesions of our culture.
@marcorubio Not a Repiblican, but respect you for not joining Trump's circus during election. Always go on the side of integrity
@marcorubio what about human rights at home? Check out GOP health plan and Trump's budget cuts
2) perhaps Rubio should be worried about tillerson/Trump's lack of diplomacy that will start war w/N korea
all this talk of military build up is scary; but also puts money in hands of billionaire arms manufacturers
never thought about that..his budget has the military at 562B while they cut the EPA, state dept, meals, etc
not too many people would be as bothered by military spending if it paid service members more or took care of our vets
I imagine that Trump's $562B is probably for BIG  planes or BIG ships.. under the table to PUTIN? silence $$?
and publicly complain about the cost of a new Air Force 1. He is all lies, deflection, deception, and delusion
Healthcare now. You are not one of the 31. Gambling that the voters aren't powerful You hurt GOP voters too. They will wake up.
@marcorubio Go crawl under a rock and stay there.  Trump is still manipulating you like a puppet, you nor Ted Cruz have any balls.
@marcorubio U aren't look out 4 people you're looking 2 win like game show! No better way spend tax $ dollars than on their health!
@marcorubio Your sleezy move to pull the "Risk corridors" out of  Healthcareto destroy it will catch up with you!
@marcorubio.Like the Russians killing everyone who speaks out? Wait till the Russian connected Canaries here start singing. Trouble
@marcorubio Trump & Tillerson both have said humanitarian issues should NOT concern us and neither should Civilan casualties in war
@marcorubio you talk a good game now be brave enough to stand up to Trump & GOP.
Unfortunately, I think not.
I wholeheartedly agree with the quote message. stop undercutting it by bowing to emperor trump. In SW, senators lead the resistance
Resistance to helping Americans first?  Another stupid idjet.
I'm a vet. Definitely defended America first. Your president is protecting the rich first. He dodged mil service.
Thank you for your service.  I stand by my president and want the economy of America improved.
Isn't our country great enough to give us jobs, and clean air and water, and health? And security?
@marcorubio  Do not 4get it's important human rights remain critical in U.S.A. as well. You agree?If not, ur out on ur butt in 2020
@marcorubio Love human rights. Let's start thinking about Americans' rights as humans. Why spend time on everywhere & not us?
You lost the GOP nomination when you tried to beat Trump at his own game (tiny hands). Now you are part of the game on his side.
You have been so quite about your stand on healthcare. You called Trump a "con artist". Who are you? Are you for us or against us?
@marcorubio are you thinking about the trauma this country would go through with a president under FBI investigation?
@marcorubio Our SoS is blowing off NATO to meet the leader of the country that meddled in our election

Let that sink in; savor it.
@SenRubioPress Might be time to move some mobile Pershing Nucs 2 South Korea.That will get China's attention & stop N Korean games.
How about you focus on MY rights in USA?  or FLORIDA?  If you support Trumpcare..how about you be critical of that? #NovoteforMARCO
@marcorubio USA isn't made up of all GOP & your inability to work w/Dems is weakening the country & dividing nation.
RUBIO: Can this country afford to have a president under investigation by the FBI?
caught u Rubi! lying sack of crap... u & GOP operate like a game show... instead of doing what's best for people
@marcorubio  I want an office in the white house too, and it would not be nepotism.
Rubio is full Of BS. Rubio does not even think women are deserving of human rights
@marcorubio What about the rights your constituents have to hear from you? Why won't you talk to us? Your people? #canwetalkrubio
@marcorubio Do You believe that the Chinese are going to respect #HumanRights Sir, I have my doubts 
Dave :-)
@marcorubio U r such a liar, u trump & GOP have become an extremist party,u r taking country down w/obstruction & deceit.
@marcorubio hey Rubio "can country afford 2 have a president under investigation" isn't that what you said  Rubio about Hilliary??!
"Can this country afford to have a prez under investigation by the FBI? Think of the trauma that would do to this country" -- Rubio, 11/1/16
@marcorubio "SQUIRREL"! Focus your comments back on your Campaign nemesis Trump and the Russians.
TELL ME WHY IS IT ALLOW FORMER PRESIDENT BIDEN SON WAS ALLOW TO WORK FOR UKRAINE,
SHOW US THE PROOF RUSSIA HACK THE ELECTION, DO NOT BELIEVED IT.
WHY DID MC CAIN GO TO UKRAINE OF DEC 2016, WE FUND UKRAINE, SHOW US THE PROOF RUSSIA HACK THE ELECTION.
@marcorubio cute, considering your party wants to bankrupt people to get healthcare.
@marcorubio Food for thought.
. @CECCgov @marcorubio He is a fucking traitor. Trump needs to be impeached. #ImpeachTrump
It is wrong to not see Merrick Garland, you guys sat on your butts.  NO on Neil Gorsuch, NOT FAIR!
IT IS TIME TO IMPEACH TRUMP! WE CANNOT STOMACH A LIAR IN CHIEF AND WE CANNOT TRUST THIS MAN!
You need to take the high road here!

@marcorubio Human rights is critical at home...Stand up for our rights as American citizens. Please don't sell us out.
@marcorubio What are you doing to change the travesty of H1V visa program which replaces US workers with lower paid foreigners?
@marcorubio THANK GOD & JESUS YOU NEVER SUPPORT PEOPLE LIKE THAT! oh, wait, you endorsed Trump. Nevermind. My bad.
@marcorubio Pls HELP Our REAL POTUS U R.YOUNG U HAVE MORETIME2b a.Pres candidate but NOT on 2020 let our POTUS b d ONE  COOPERATE
No deals with #Russia? You need to investigate #Russia money laundering in #SouthFlorida.
#IndependentInvestigation
Human rights? So why aren't you fighting to save Meals On Wheels, School Lunches, Health Insurance, and Trump and Russia?
@marcorubio Marco, please call for the impeachment of @POTUS. @FBI @CIA The whole world knows Trump is a dangerous security threat
@marcorubio And this is a huge issue. @FBI needs to arrest these dangerous people before there is no USA.
NO VOTE ON GORSUCH SEN NOT FIT TO SERVE .
What about human rights in the United States After School Meals on Wheels BE MORAL
@marcorubio if you and other republicans don't stand behind trump then at mid term elections then you will loose house and Senate
@marcorubio Human rights are important. Don't take my ACA from me. Vote no on TrumpRyancare.
How about standing up for human rights here in America by standing up to & investigating your Comrade/President!

@marcorubio He doesnt stand for #womensrights #transrights #LGBT #Equality in #healthcare #EducationForAll or #equalpayforequalwork
@marcorubio funny how you say #Humanrights is critical as you systematically vote against critical human rights issues here in US
HUMAN RIGHTS Yet you are a friend with the biggest serial torturer of children MEL SEMBLER! STRAIGHT INC.
China's hardly a paragon of human rights & you @marcorubio are voting against human rights here at home #TrumpCare #mealsonwheels
@marcorubio What about human rights at home? Cutting #MealsonWheels and programs that help the poor?
@marcorubio Dad was clear about this Human rights only matter for straight white christian males in the US, so not 4 foreign policy
@marcorubio Marco the three judges who are committing unconstitutional Judicial overreach must be impeached by Congress immediately
Thank you. Please keep standing up for what you believe in even if unpopular with the current administration.
So you don't care if we lose health insurance, PBS, endowment for the arts, Meals on wheels, school lunches, and all that stuff? WOW SAD!
Suggest U make sure human rights R honored in America first, before we worry about another country. I hear UN, is going 2 investigate the US
this is a good reason we didn't elect Rubio.
How about our domestic policy? How about the human right to food? Shelter? Education? Healthcare?
Funy
@marcorubio Women's rights are human rights but you consistently vote against them.  Hypocritical no?
Sen. Rubio, how are you going to fight against the proposed budget that cuts health, science, art, education, foreign aid, diplomacy, etc?
Wouldn't it be great if we had someone as knowledgeable on foreign policy as @SenRubioPress in the White House.Could have been.
Do you really want an answer?  NO!
@marcorubio Well. He's a gosh darn fake liar! I used to think I'd like you. Thank God I learned early you r a traitor.
China brainwashed 3 generations, 1.5 billion peasants, most w less than 9 yrs of education. Communist Party knows how! @CECCgov @marcorubio
You need to look older for some people to trust your experience to be a candidate! Thank you for sharing your government activities!!!
Access to affordable healthcare is a human right, Marco.  We need something better than Trumpcare, do your job. @CECCgov @marcorubio
How about working to stop Trump from abusing the human rights of OUR citizens, instead?
@marcorubio you sound good yet have no moral integrity
@marcorubio Marco, back up the President. He's needing the party right now. Big waste otherwise.
@marcorubio Does that include human rights here in America too?  Give us healthcare!
Thank you for always standing up for human rights, Senator Rubio.@marcorubio
@marcorubio how about Human Rights for our country? Right to Health care, free press?  Anything ring a bell?
O BOY!  HOW WONDERFUL!  AND HE GETS PAID FOR WHAT??!?!??!?!?!?!?
@marcorubio I love the Trump Budget it's a good start I support everything he did on it. Can't be everything to everybody. Cut more
Support the REPEAL of Obamacare. Do not develop yet another Government healthcare plan.
And Human Rights for Americans 1st NO Legislated Health Ins.so DC can spend Taxes & fees w it..REPEAL ObamaCare n Total
@marcorubio  I'm more concerned about our citizen's rights, which you and your wussy Republicans seem not to care about!
@marcorubio you only care about YOU  hypocrite!
@marcorubio here's another man with no backbone who went running after trump like a wet puppy!! #disgrace
christy wonderful depiction
but not our domestic policy apparently. Thanks for that budget dude.
@marcorubio you don't even want human rights in America..  Feel the bern
@marcorubio   How about they remain a part of the American way of life. Think you could work on that instead of tax breaks
B.S. police the U.S. NOT the world
@marcorubio right! Just as long as they are contributing funds to your foundation.
@marcorubio that is good to hear. I'd like to hear it from  @StateDept #Tillerson as well.
Tillerson works for Bannon!
Why would a rich oil CEO follow an unkempt anarchist? Trump does because ego, stupidity and need.
@marcorubio human rights fight should start at home but Rubio has already diminished ours.  Rubio is #boughtandpaidfor
wrong @CECCgov @marcorubio
@marcorubio Rubio lies.
@marcorubio because, apparently, human rights mean nothing at home.
@SenRubioPress Human Rights are at the Core of #AmericanValues! Life,Liberty & the Pursuit of Happiness!
@marcorubio marco..get on board with trump..or get out..and become  a whacko democrat..
@marcorubio The absolute "most"
Important I believe Senator. TY
FU Rubio
Budget cuts meals on wheels elderly after your healthcare plan robs them of any healthcare. FU
