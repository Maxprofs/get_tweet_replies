It was an honor meeting with retired General Mattis today to discuss strengthening our nation’s military and Florida’s role in our defense.
please do not hold up the vote for the rest of Trump's cabinet it is only fair!!!
I agree, Mattis is awesome. Now get your head straight on Tillerson! You embarrassed FL w/ Tillerson questions! Support Trump
The People Agree! It's time to Support Your New President And his Choices. WE elected Trump And U. Do your Job!
His job is to establish confidence that Tillerson is the best choice. Trump is not king!
Not Tillerson's job to label Putin a war criminal.  RIDICULOUS.  Get an education girl
Maybe not but it was telling that he won't be hard on Russia if we need to.
Your Common Core Education has failed you little girl!
You are laughable (and so are your views) I am older than common core & NCLB.
You are the one who described yourself as a "Girl"  

Let me just hit block on you
@marcorubio Agree but what about Tillerson! Did Ureally want the US top diplomat to call Putin a war criminal on public TV?
I was very disappointed w that line of questioning from U.Impressed w Tillerson. I understand Concern over Russia
The call him Mad DOG because he's a WAR CRIMINAL in Iraq. Did u know that.???He murdered 40 innocent...
....civilians attending a family wedding.This is who U support and laud.What kind of "god" do u worship? A SATAN?
@marcorubio He may do that and I'm sure your tweet means a lot to him. You've been so courageous this year! You and @tedcruz!
@coinabs grow up little Marco wish you'll follow his example.
@marcorubio I hope that you will get on board and serve honorably as well,do not obstruct, support Trump, make America great!
@marcorubio wtf are you trying to do with your 2 stooges , showing once again that you are unworthy to be where you are,Jerks
@Floridian33480 Very Proud
so you finally see the light?  So there may be hope for RINO's after all

#MAGA
@marcorubio just another old white haired republican!
@marcorubio - I'm a Trump skeptic who is REALLY glad to see Mattis there.
@deeathomedee we from the #TriCitiesWA are so proud of #GeneralMattis 
True AMERICAN HERO..Wish we had more Leaders like him ..will sleep peaceful knowing he's on the job
@marcorubio when he's invited to meetings
Thank U for UR support for Gen. Mattis, now vote for Rex Tillerson & do right thing.  U know it is
Gen Mattis will. NOT Rex Tillerson! Vote NO on Billionaire Buddy of MURDERER PUTIN! Read:
@marcorubio
@williamtrobbins there is a lot of ISIS going to bite the dust. In other words meet their whores.
@marcorubio He was NOT out of uniform for the req. time. So rules and regs are only for Dem admins - not YOU!
Marco, you caved on Tillerson. Very disappointing. Your views were informed and well thought out, and you went against them.
@DeniseGosselin5 Good choice!
@drginareghetti Ooh-Rah! Semper Fi. Most beloved Marine in 50+ years.
ending more than 200 years of civilian control of our military. Congrats, GOP!
you know he's retired right? Makes him a civilian. Dems and GOP voted for him as well
.@SenRubioPress @marcorubio Best decision of this Admin so far, now don't turn the country to Russians. #noTillerson
@marcorubio this is one thing that @potus has done that I support.
WHEN A MAN IS NICKNAMED "MAD DOG" CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE FEAR IN THE HEART OF LOVERS OF FREEDOM?MAD DOGS ARE SICK
@sjreidhead marco Rubio attempto to saveo himeselfo

Typical.

@AnitaDWhite 
There was never any question about that.  The question is this.  After u voting 4 Kerry & Clinton - Tillerson?
Well Deserved Excellent
Rubio worried about Security when he Favors Trump,Putin,and Tillerman
No he won't
SEN RUBIO. YOU TOO WILL MAKE FLORIDA GREAT.PLEASE DO SO.I VOTE FOR YOU.PLEASE WORK WITH OUR PRESIDENT.
@marcorubio #StandUpToTrump #rejectREX
And this man is the good one of his entire cabinet. The on again , off again Villain of comic books.
I agree.  Gen Mattis will be a fine leader.
How much attention do you need? Support http://Tillerson.You  are still a Republican aren't you?
you're recent antics with Sec of State nominee make you look little and petulant.  Please stop
and so will Tillerman. MAN UP. #Trump is our choice!!!!!@FreedomChild3
I'm impressed with your support for the inauguration of POTUS,Trump. I will remember you in 8 years.
@marcorubio fact https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=He3qUvDfud0 …
#TRUMP is like NIXON. He'll be gone in a year. @SenRubioPress must vote NO for Tillerson to become the #GOP Leader to be Next President.
@transition2017 Really? Mad Dog Mattison is a true Warrior, and revered by those he led!
@marcorubio do your duty as a republican. Confirm Tillerson. That's why you were elected. Do your job!!
More than I can say about Marco as Senator.
& we need d rest of the nominees for our president elect @realDonaldTrump we the American ppl elected him & you to serve us no to sabotage
I think ISIS may have just pooped in their linens.
@transition2017  Rubio.. stop acting like a jerk!
Vote to confirm Tillerson for Sec State. Your performance at his hearing was awful. Your questions weren't deal breakers.
General Mattis will need help to wipe the scourge that is radical islam from the face of the earth.
I heard you have a secret #ACA replacement. Please provide details as soon as possible!
@marcorubio Mad Dog Mattis re: stadium filled with dead civilians?  What has become of the soul of our nation?
Thank you!
@marcorubio Agreed! A great patriot and such a contrast from the awful anti-American Obama WH.
@marcorubio Agreed. But Tillerson is a danger to our country's security and you are well aware of this. Vote AGAINST!
@marcorubio So would Tillerson. You're what is wrong with D.C.
@no2libs007 Same with Rex T... do not let your voters down
without a doubt one of the best picks for sec defense ever!
Thanks you for standing against Tillerson for Sec of State. Putin, Exxon get rich if sanctions dropped at All Americans expense!
@transition2017 WRONG!
@transition2017 Why are you forcing the retirement of the heads of the Nuclear Energy Agency before there are replacements?
Put a spine in place rather than gutting our military like obama did.
Awesome, very happy about this!
Kiss my ass ISIS!!
well done General Mattis. #MADDOG
@marcorubioRubio you are sending the wrong message by accepting Mattis and Tillerson to be in our government vote no or no 4?
@marcorubio No olviden a los Venezolanos hermano nos estan matando lentamente el regimen Cubano-Venezolano!
Gen Mattis: US pays a price for backing Israel: http://america-hijacked.com/2016/12/02/ex-general-we-pay-a-price-for-backing-israel/ …
@transition2017 i support  him too as an army vet .Cold war era i am still  able and willing  to  fight  for  freedom  for US
@VetApologist You acted like a complete snowflake! Embarrassing! Don't waste your $ running for Prez again! Got your # 
and he'll allow Trump to cuddle up with Putin
and so will Tillerson.
@transition2017 So will Jeff Sessions. Rex Tillerson,  Ben Carson and all the cabinet pics from PE Trump! MAGA
Your attack on Tillerson was juvenile grandstanding. That, along with your gang of 8, negates you as president.
I play by my own fucking rules. Always have.

@SenRubioPress
Mattis is no warmonger. Most real warriors aren't.  They know the deal.

@SenRubioPress
Being a power player makes you smart. Not a warmonger. Who supports you doesn’t define you either.

@SenRubioPress
The President and Congress give the orders. Mattis follows them. That is how it works. 

@SenRubioPress
@transition2017 Floridians keep tabs on Rubio. He's a #NeverTrumper! Better start looking for another Rep. Rubio will cave!
SenRubio likes GenMattis cause they both hate Russia. Both are very misguided and Trump should not be swayed.
I don't think Trump could be swayed on any of his beliefs, they might be swayed by him
Why pick a Sec of Def who has such different and tough views on Russia? And Rubio is so corrupt and selfish,
Trump always has his reasons, just have to trust him
Mattis was picked due to his toughness...will not sway, Trump has changed course many times, but hope u r right.
the President is Commander in Chief, Mattis knows this
Gen Mattis quote on Russia. Sure hope Trump can sway him, although tough Mattis might just walk.
@highazvalley 
Go back 2 ur previous job-u didn't learn from primaries-how reelected? Elitest. Anti-Trumper.Cant b trusted.
And Rex Tillerson as SoS.
@marcorubio live in Miami , voted for you , get on the train with all picks or get ran over - WE want things to get done
Give DJT what he wants and take what can give you. Mad Dog is a case in point try Rex you will like it.
It was really Crappy that Rubio decried Tillerson for not calling Putin a #WarCriminal. Not impressed w Rubio
@transition2017Marco Rubio, this week you started loosing my respect. Your questions about Russia were made to harm not build
nice try li'l marco we know your true colors along with mccain and graham get on the Trump train or be left behind #ChooChoo
Now vote for Tillerson to become Secretary of State!!
So will Tillerson! You better confirm him!
@transition2017 yeah?...well what about Rex?.....Rubio u need to get on board with ALL of pres elec choices
@marcorubio i would have thought you would have had more respext for Mr.Rex Tillerman! Very disappointed!@realDonaldTrump
@marcorubio Rubio is weak.....He will cave!!
Marco did you give the General a list of all the countries you McCain and Graham want him to attack?
@transition2017 very nasty to Rex Tillerson, remember you can be removed by those that voted you in! Get a grip

neocons approve...
Mattis was my favorite pick of all the selections.
Did he give you the "I want to destroy the world for israhell" reassurance you needed dipshit? Great.
@transition2017 So disappointed at your behavior toward Rex Tillerson last week.  Shameful payback to Trump.
@marcorubio you need to stay strong against Tillerson and Flynn!!!
@transition2017 vote yes on Tillerson you cuck
Tillerson is wicked smart, vast knowledge of foreign countries/leaders, overseen k's employees...Confirm Tillerson.
We are blessed  Gen. Mattis, is willing to come out of retirement and serve his country...once ...again.God Bless Gen. Mattis
Gay Rubio arrested in 1990 solicitation? Cant Believe it? Little Marco a Fruit Cake? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDH9NQmpnSg … Watch
We the ppl-delivering a huge governing mandate to President Trump &(R)'s love this cabinet&want all confirmed
@transition2017 Too bad you won't Lil Marco
good to see this- but we also are disappointed in Sen.Rubio's disrespectful attitude toward Rex Tillerson
@marcorubioyryingbto save face over his obnoxious attack on #RexTillerson. #MAGA   @transition2017
So will T-Rex, Tillerson.
@transition2017. The only reason you won is because you went up against a weak candidate I didn't vote for Rubio
@transition2017 We just spent 8yrs of telling our enemies our precise plans & time frame for engagement. Zip it!
@marcorubio yes he will!!  But Tillerson will not!!
And obamas wet foot dry foot policy change. Why? Because Cubans tend to vote republican. Vindictive isn’t he?
@transition2017 Yeah, but u screwed over Tillerson. Were FDR/Truman war criminals for killing millions of Japanese citizens?
I'm SICK AND TIRED of you "so called" republicans. Just get the hell out of politics. You are blinded by selfish ambition.
yeah that's the answer, get out.  Then we can all be 'progressive', and watch our great country follow Argentina.
That was to YOU Marco Rubio.  Sure as hell wasn't to James Mattis.  I'm referring to your antics with new Secretary of state
Frankly, I find it "discouraging" you have sold out to globalist control. YOU, sir, are a disgrace! glad u don't wear uniform
and from someone picked out of nowhere. Community activist. Could u have any respect for his previous past & accomplishments
http://nypost.com/2017/01/14/its-time-to-face-facts-obamas-presidency-was-a-failure/ …
@transition2017 now Sen Rubio get on board with Tillerson!Remember Trump won your state!
@transition2017 
Marco, we expect you to #ConfirmTillerson as well. We voted u in ONLY for #MAGA agenda @realDonaldTrump
@transition2017 Great news on Gen Mattis.  Now do what's right and approve Tillerson so we can #MAGA
And there in lies the motives. Hateful Obama. Get that straight. It ALL centers around him Obama and his shadow government
2 ur concerns about DJT and Russia. Everyone in this current admin is SUSPECT. CIA,DOJ,FBI,NSA all r serving under Obama.
McConnell to Rubio: Man up or fall on your sword. You get nothing for your vote. Not a negotiation. #ScorchedEarth
@marcorubio Sen. Rubio, time to vote for TRex.  Your political maneuvering is obvious; will cost you our support in 2020.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
@transition2017 
SEMPER FI.......
@transition2017 ~ Quiet, L.M.
@transition2017 Mattis doesn't like backstabbers! He respects ppl who keep their word & support the POTUS. You stink
@transition2017 great choice. I served in Army - Viet Nam 69-70. Proud to have served for this great country!
@transition2017 now back off on Secy of State nominee!!!!! And endorse him.
You're right on this one Just DO not blow it ON Rex Tillerson &DO not side w/ @johnmccain & @LindsayGrahamSC
And Rex Tillerson will be our next Secretary of State. You made a fool of yourself Rubio-how much $$ went in your wallet for attacking Rex?
Good cop, bad cop.
@transition2017 I voted for you buddy & ur disrespect to Rex was uncalled for will not vote for you in 2020 sir!
@transition2017 so will Rex Rubio!!
@transition2017 #MAGA
Rubio knows he'll need to switch parties if he votes against Tillerson.  It's all drama.  He'll vote for him.
@transition2017 Unlike Marco
Excellent.
We believe your press release, why?  R U kidding?  We're watching Globalist!
https://youtu.be/6X38k0cND64 
Glad to see your finally on board
Your puerile badgering of Tillerson was unflattering. @SenRubioPress
@transition2017 Now why won't YOU?
Rex Tillerson will do a great job also.
why would you force nominee to call Putin war criminal when Obama has not done that ?
What about your president-elect though, who will face ethics violations the same time he is sworn into office
@transition2017 Your reaction to General Mattis's claim that Tel Aviv is the capital of Israel?
now get onto the SOS nomination confirmation and get that over with please.
@transition2017 thank you senator Rubio, fight for Cuba they are still under the boot of communist rule!
@transition2017 They ALL need approved!!
@marcorubio U should follow his example as a profile in courage n stand up 4 Cubans that just got screwed by BHO. HOOOAA!
you need not stand in the way of the Sec of State nominee.  Don't be little Marco again
agreed
@marcorubio very disappointed in your public attack on Tillerson. Grand standing.
and what's your crystal ball say about DJT Mr angry man?
@marcorubio so will Rex Tillerson!
please ask him about his involvement in Fallujah
love him,I contributed to your campaign please stick with Secretary of State,we need all of Trump's pick he hurt&helped you
@marcorubio but he bombed a wedding in Iraq? Idk, @democracynow ?
@marcorubio And So will Rex Tillerson.#MAGA
Thank you for supporting him. Hopefully Tillerson is next for you.
@evamarielis In spite of OBAMA;
ONLY decent pick by Trump so far...Necesitamos que te levantes por nosotros AHORA.
@marcorubio how about supporting your president? You feed into the left and are pathetic Marco. Sorry I supported you!
And so will Rex Tillerson.
I think so.
@marcorubio what is you beef with Tillerson? You r my Senator & I would like an explanation, please.
To bad the same can't be said of Marco
@marcorubio as a FL constituent & voter, I urge you to vote against Rex Tillerson. Russia's interference is unacceptable
@marcorubio Stop being hard on Tillerson just to get back at Trump. The guy has experience around the world, it's a plus!
@marcorubio What about Rex Tillerson?  Please dont be a pain in the ass again! Work with @realDonaldTrump & @transition2017
@marcorubio would you care to call HRC and BO war criminals? Maybe even yourself?
@marcorubio there are plenty of articles in the public domain showing that we, the US, created and funded ISIS. War Crimes?
@marcorubio War Criminal? Do you think financing ISIS is a crime against humanity? War crimes? Approve Tillerson.
@marcorubio grandstanding is so below you. Please create an all-star team for Trump. McCain has already shown his assholeness
@vetsforMarco hopefully he will take trump down a few notches mattis should have ran for president
We the People have had enough of the corruption in our Government! That is why we support Trump !
U need to Remember who put you in office. I voted for you! I also Voted for Trump! The voters of Florida also voted for Trump! Remember it!
@marcorubio Imagine if an Obama nominee needed a waiver!!
it's great that u and McCain took advantage of Trump to get back in office  disgusting
