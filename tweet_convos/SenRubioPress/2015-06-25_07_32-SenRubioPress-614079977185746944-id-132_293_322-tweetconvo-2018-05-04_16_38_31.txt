@marcorubio
@marcorubio  The only people that like Obamacare are the ones that don't work for a living. $12,500.00 deductibles are outrageous.
@marcorubio That's why you will never become President. People like ACA- does a few minor chnges need to be done- Yes!!!
@marcorubio 
What happened to one of our core democratic values that applies to the common good!
@marcorubio = falsely claims Supreme Court tried to correct Obamacare. Umm, no, the court didn't change a damn thing.
@marcorubio Arrogance & ignorance are a dangerous combo u are are dangerous.
@marcorubio 
Please continue to declare on Twitter why you would be a horrible POTUS.  It makes it so much easier to dismiss you #GOPfail
@marcorubio 
Come to senses. Don't waste your time and country's resourses on this issue. ACA is good thing.
@marcorubio
@marcorubio Yeah because he singlehandedly wrote and passed the ACA. Idiota.
@marcorubio That's why we have a balance of powers in the constitution. Your job is to legislate, not determine what's constitutional.
@MrEvanRoss @marcorubio so where in the constitution does it allow the SCOTUS to rewrite a law? Their job is to interpret not to alter laws.
@joe_socket2me @marcorubio SCOTUS didn't rewrite anything. They upheld what was written.
@MrEvanRoss @marcorubio earlier the individual mandate clause was rewritten by Justice Roberts to say it was a TAX! Not his job to redefine!
@marcorubio ...who give you the right to vote against US majority  people?,3 of every 5 people in Dade depend of goverment help somehow!
@marcorubio You disagree w/SCOTUS decision on gay marriage?  It does not affect me, so why would a POTUS candidate say something so STUPID!
@marcorubio Obamacare IS Republican's limited-government free market alternative to single payer, you disingenuous fascist! @housedemocrats
@marcorubio getting a subsidy from the ACA gets you an enrollment doc.BFD!  Now who will pay that big deductable to actually get treated?
@marcorubio WEAK.
@marcorubio  yes. A lot of mistakes in the law. Do you have a plan to fix the mistakes?
@marcorubio @leeleemunster it wasn't an error.  It was outright partisan activism unbecoming of a court
@marcorubio @charliekirk11 Your a RINO Marco, what do you care? are you going to make these Illegals legal Marco.
@marcorubio you're a hack! South Florida hates you and will never vote for you or Bush.
@marcorubio Why would any "right" thinking person deprive 6MM people of necessity because of politics- It's absurd.
@marcorubio im with u
@marcorubio My husband and I had to wait 30 year to get married. I look forward to your comments on the  ruling on gay marriage.
@marcorubio
@marcorubio Of course you disagree with it. Your looking to the Koch brothers for help. Which means ur not fit to lead and have been bought.
@marcorubio 1) They did not err, 2) #ACA is the opposite of a mistake, 3) Average Americans win, and 4) @marcorubio loses.
@marcorubio -Yes, he made 6.4 millions mistakes, among them many of your refugee-relatives. Presidential aspirant Marco, are you blind?
.@marcorubio Someday you'll stop fighting and realize how good this is for most Americans. Some day.
@marcorubio Erred? More like another train wreck of a decision which is becoming the norm with the Roberts Court.
.@marcorubio I just read this in your whiny voice.
@marcorubio coming from someone who hasn't provided a viable alternative
@marcorubio  Supreme Ct. decision is absurd. Obama care was not ready because they were shocked that it passed.
@marcorubio All you so called Republicans, NEED to Get your head out of the sand! Move on and help strengthen the Nation.
@marcorubio @JOEROWE409 ABSOLUTELY CORRECT! No way they should've ruled in favor of Obamacare. #SupremeCourt is out of order! #ACAHereToStay
@marcorubio @wsvn What have you done for this country?? #Imwaiting
@marcorubio 18million need that coverage. and you think it was a mistake.you wont last past iowa.
.@marcorubio At least this is a reasonable wording of dissent.  Wrong, but reasonable. #Obamacare #ACA
@marcorubio @wsvn Rubio, quit whining. As usual, complaining about Dems helping people!
@marcorubio 
SCOTUS ruling prevents the GOP from dragging America further to 3rd world status. Available health care is a right for all.
@marcorubio well Mario. Maybe that's why you don't where the SCOTUS robe
@marcorubio it's why u will never be POTUS.
@marcorubio @JenniferJJacobs The Communist obama got to the justices.
@marcorubio Have the GOP come up with an alternative yet? Still working on it??? Years later???
@marcorubio U R truly for the tea bag party, not for the American people. You complain about things, but don't do anything to make it right.
@marcorubio please run for president on a platform of taking away peoples health care. That should work.
Really sad if this is really @marcorubio and not a parady account. @BenjySarlin
@marcorubio oh Marco, Will you ever be on the right side of an issue?
@marcorubio He said that there are no caps NOT TRUE caps on everything
@marcorubio This is the biggest lie and tax, who's collecting the tax per state puts it back in the subsidies? Was not going to cost us/dime
@marcorubio the only mistake Obama made was being a black man who dared to tell republicans what to do. Shame on you.
@marcorubio CANT YOU SEE, THEY WERE CLEARLY INTMIDATED.....SCOTUS DESTROYING US
@marcorubio The best part about reading your tweets....is one day I'll get to read one about you dropping out of the race. #thanksfornothing
@marcorubio You are on the wrong side of history.
@marcorubio What nerve. You sell us out on Obamatrade and then complain about SCOTUS not fixing Congressional mess you helped make. Jerk.
@marcorubio Mistakes? By the man you just voted to give more power?
@marcorubio
There were no mistakes made in the creation of Obama care. It is destroying our health care exactly as planned.
@marcorubio We the People hear Republicans speak out against the SCOTUS ruling.We hear REPEAL the whole law.Do you have a plan to replace it
@marcorubio are you referring to the republican appointed justices who both wrote the majority decision and also supported it.
@marcorubio 'disagree', 'mistakes'? So tepid, Marco.
@marcorubio It is Congress' job to correct any errors in legislative acts!! #USSC #SCOTUS does not do your job, Senator!!
@marcorubio @JOEROWE409 Obama is fulfilling his plan .... he is collapsing our system...!
@marcorubio 2/2 destroy health insurance markets?! That would be an epic #GOPFail for the U.S. people! #ACA #KingvBurwell
@marcorubio  Let's start a war, send all the poor people to war, then don't cover their war injuries under private health care, like now.
@marcorubio The #USSC #SCOTUS have traditionally followed, "plausible intent" when deciding merits. You suggest Republicans really 1/2
@marcorubio  you prove your lack of qualification for current or higher office once again. ACA is successful, improving lives of millions
@marcorubio @Varneyco Impeach the #SCOTUScare 6
@marcorubio @Varneyco . A bailout for Socialism . Anything as long it is other people's expense . At this rate America will be Greece .
@marcorubio @Varneyco True, but it makes no difference...we are doomed.
@marcorubio @Varneyco 
you control both houses now overturn ACA
@marcorubio @BenjySarlin Oh Boo Hoo Marco
@marcorubio @Varneyco and this still does not make this affordable
@marcorubio here's the irony to this, his family is benefiting from this law as well.
@marcorubio I am sure you do. Bless your heart.
@marcorubio so how do we reverse this? They thumbed their noses at the Constitution. You and the legislature are powerless. #TyrannyIsHere
@marcorubio it not Obama's mistake anymore... the Supreme Court voted... wouldnt that be the Supreme Court mistake now? WATER please!!!
@marcorubio @MiamiHerald mistakes? How about the GOP mortgaging our social security and Medicare benefits to our children? Clueless sir
@marcorubio give it up Marco Rubio you lost go home
@marcorubio really!  After the 2nd ruling!  Why are you against Americans getting healthcare?  Aren't you on the people's subsidies?
@marcorubio @BenjySarlin Your state already denies health insurance to millions marco.
@marcorubio @MiamiHerald well thank god you aren't a Supreme Court judge and you wont be president.
@FootballguruF @marcorubio @MiamiHerald Rubio toeing the company line.
@marcorubio shut up. Get over yourself and get with the millions this coverage is saving.
@marcorubio you're an embarrassment to state of Florida and The University of Miami.
@marcorubio You are my favorite candidate; but, in the wake of Obama/Roberts 2.0, are you going to give O more power through O-trade?
@marcorubio You know you're happy #SCOTUS ruling gets you off the hook. #Hillay2016
.@marcorubio dude, you gotta have a much better media strategy than this if you want get more money/vote than the other GOPers.
@marcorubio that's why u should not be President!!!
@marcorubio // Bwahahahahaha! #ROTFLMAO.
@marcorubio You don't understand any of this, but good posturing for your ignorant base.
@marcorubio lol you will never be president
@marcorubio not helping.
@marcorubio @BenjySarlin yeah..yeah...Yaaaaaaawn...
@marcorubio with all your relatives not having med ins u should be ashame of yourself. U not for the ppl.
@marcorubio @msnbc @cnn @HLNTV the court & I disagree with you & can't wait 2 hear u continue 2 say things 2 continue 2 erode support u have
@marcorubio @BenjySarlin May I respectfully suggest you suck it.
@marcorubio @MiamiHerald
@marcorubio @benjysarlin Go have a drink.
.@marcorubio I disagree with you being elected and believe Floridians have once again erred in trying to find a good leader.
@marcorubio no Marco Roberts Bulls are tied in a knot by the NSA thanks to Obama
@marcorubio I must admit, I snicker every time President Obama kicks more @gop a$$
@marcorubio Loser!!
@marcorubio Does it make you THIRSTY, Marco?
@marcorubio millions losing insurance would be your plan. Nice.
@marcorubio out of touch and only one of a million reasons why you'll never be President...get on board...you're young you can do it!!
@marcorubio STFU! U lose again. Thank you #SCOTUS, except 4 the 3 losers
@marcorubio give it a rest
@marcorubio You are getting my attention!Glad to hear Rubio speaking out about Obamacare ruling. Need candidates to speak out for americans!
@marcorubio @dbernstein Deeply compelling coming from this acclaimed legal mind
@marcorubio @USMCJuanCarlos that's it, Marco? Don't get too upset here
@marcorubio Really ... what a wimpy comment!
@marcorubio Republicans lose again.. its awesome.
@kasie19RU @marcorubio you don't follow the news much, do you?
