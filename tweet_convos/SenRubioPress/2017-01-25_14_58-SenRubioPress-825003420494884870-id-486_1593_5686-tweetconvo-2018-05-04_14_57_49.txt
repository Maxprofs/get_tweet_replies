Are you already taking names? It will be quite a long list.
Disappointed that first speech to UN echoed Trump's bullying tactics.Sad.
a new racist facist era. indians believe in karma. I hope you get yours soon for associating with that deranged conman.
Love this TEAM ,The best Administration
A vision of a diminished and unimportant role with the NSC.  Congrats!

vomit
can't believe u had the nerve 2 post this. What hapoened2 u- u r an embarrassment 2 decent Americans everywhere.
yes but same old rhetoric on #Ukraine . @poroshenko has restarted war to create tension between #US  #Russia .You disappoint me.
@debra_bonanno And what a beautiful day it is
Does your new day of strength include targeting people based upon their religion and a so-called "Muslim Ban"? How does it feel?
Gong.
nice shoes and skirt
.@nikkihaley A new fascism.
disappointed you switched your stance on trump the minute he won. Appreciated you in SC, but where are your ethics now?
I hope you work on the inside to OUST him!
.@nikkihaley I liked the old vision just fine -- One grounded in human rights & international law. Hope youll maintain it. Keep in touch -JC
Americans will be taking names too in the Trump admin who has OUR backs.
Obama's last money shower for the UN: some $9.2 billion. My feelings are united Nations are useless.
@ramseyturbo go out there and fight to good fight today, we have your back.
A birth of New Dictator &BAD opinion led to Bad Ban that held ppl hostage without DUE process. New WAY to hold ppl in Limbo.HEIL
Bless your heart. Aaand unfollow.
Best of luck to you Nikki, we are all pulling for you here in SC.
New opportunity to Make-KGB-Greate-Again. @matzimm
@debra_bonanno
utmost respect for Governor Ambassador  Haley.  Proud of you  Will do great job. SC misses you
a vision of hell
As an American, representative of USA & me to world, speak out vs. Exec Order: honor us, your parents & Ex Post Facto of Constitution.
Reflect on how you'd feel if a President happened to ban Indians from immigration. This current ban only exacerbates.
@SenRubioPress strength does not come from propaganda but from humility. Will you represent all citizens. Stop with the slogans!
Hi Nikki! I wish i could move from NC to SC. We get ripped off on gas, 30 some odd cents tax per gallon!
how do you support a gross ban being from an immigrant community yourself?
Well bless your little heart.
A new tyranny. Your association with this monster will tarnish you for the rest of your life.
For you and your boss.
Can your hypocrisy, clown.  Those in need?  How many homeless Americans have you helped get a job?
PS- this is NOT a new vision. It's the vision of the racist Europeans who first plundered the indigenous peoples of this country
are you joking? Ur a slap in the face to the so. Asian community and you are complicit in the racism that this country now reps
you all should be ashamed of yourself you destroying this country
trump is an illegitimate president.
Boooooooooo
A new day. A new weakness. A new blurred vision. 
Can't think of anyone with worse first day at the UN? WE TAKE NAMES TOO! #RESIST
so proud!!! You're the best!!!!!
Another day To see stupid things; Trump the best enemy forme USA; are you blind?
and we will not survive these four years.  Thank you for supporting a moron for President.
You are anti-diplomacy and are a horrible choice for this position. Ugh.
I thought you might be the 1 reasonable person appointed in administration. Sadly disappointed you drank trumps hateful cool-aid
It's about time...
@veganvecoh I'm so proud of our President
go get 'em.  #Winning
so proud!!
a disaster
Heroic Journalists Who Fought Hitler: http://blogs.artinfo.com/cuttingroom/2012/11/14/the-poison-kitchen-will-depict-heroic-journalists-who-fought-hitler/ â€¦
Thank God! Thank you for your service!!
we will see... We are keeping our fingers crossed
Taking names?That's your UN strategy?What an absolutely stupid and unnecessary way to start your job.
Trump is mentally ill. This new vision is a dangerous and scary one.
I can see you started noting names.
Do not forget: it's ""Theresa" not "Teresa".
you do realize when trump gets impeached ur all going down with him
Have you EVER even been out of the USA?? Sad pathetic traitor to women,this country,spreading threats and intimidation. Puppet.
a major disaster.
you have soul your soul to devil for a job - history will judge you badly when Trumputin is outed as the #ManchurianPresident
Your comments to the U.N. were unAmerican and unprofessional.  You should be FIRED.  You are already a horrible ambassador.
Starting your UN job threatening others...What kind of country have we become?  Bullies like our POYUS.
not really a new vision.....
A New Fascism
Didnt u lot learn anything from the Nazis?? Oh wait......
Yes, a new vision!
You will look back one day and cringe with embarrassment.
WTF does "taking names" mean? You lost all integrity and credibility in my book.
"That is not a part of our party, that is not who we want as president. We will allow not allow that in our country." Hypocrite!
@IsraelNewsNow best wishes
love your statement! Love the message!
so good,  so good...  Thank God almighty.
Way to go,"Taking Names" huh? I guess you got a crash course on BULLYING from your boss DJT! You made USA proud today  
with all due respect, instead of threatening that you are taking name is not strength or vision- It is  just being a bully.
A nightmare. Sold your soul.
what a bunch of racist bullies with self esteem issues?
@Veteran4Trump Haley is a rising star who understands immigration from a number of points Of view 
@Veteran4Trump Congratulations!!!
Wishing you the worst.
a new shit in office
good start, stay strong, stay confident...South Carolina has your back...just let us know what you need
@Veteran4Trump 
I fixed it for you
Way to go Nikki!! Just remember we love you here in South Carolina!!
Wonderful speech at the UN, no way would I mess with you!
@PalmBeachTrump the end of the world.  It's the 4 horsemen, the whore, and the antichrist
Cleaning up Obama, HRC messes in the Middle East like ISIS and their disgraceful treatment of ISRAEL, making USA respected again
Your comments today about taking names was disgraceful 
you are on the wrong side of history.
Your taking names comments was disgusting. I thought you might be a voice of reason in the Trump administration but not now.
taking names  I love it  You go girl!
Day one and you're issuing ultimatums?
Diplomatically unwise. Do not confuse strength for confidence.
Ambassador Haley, I first met you and Michael in Lexington when you were running for the SC House... so very thankful for you!
A new Reich.
please keep the past in mind in your new role.
.@nikkihaley The worst day since America starting participating in the UN. You are on the side of evil
Poor choice of words and impression.  "Taking names" what the teacher's pet would do in Elementary school when she left class.
@Norsu2 @Potus And a new way of distancing your country from the rest of the world! Keep up the good work!

what is the matter with you!  "Taking names".  Wow.
ZERO Experience,We need a strong NATO. You are taking names?
They laugh at you!
"We're taking names"? America is watching you Nikki Haley! Show some integrity.

"taking names"? Really?  This is the new vision?
Strength isn't gained on thought talk but rather in actions+deeds. Such rhetoric projects US insecurity facing world challenges.
you are as insane as he is.  Threatening allies is a moronic start to your job.
@realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls Do you really think the countries of the UN are going to cave in to schoolyard bullying?
Was happy to have you in the ear of @POTUS up to today. Ur remarks don't make US stronger but weaker & projects US as a joke...
@UN You are now a diplomat-be one! "Taking names?" Please don't represent me in this way.
please try to prevent wwIII Your gonna have your hands full with Donnie
a new dystopian society #notmypresident
You are sycophants who have sold your soul to the Orange devil
Congratulations and good-.luck
Lets hope u cry the integrity u showed after church shooting into ur position as US amb to  UN instead of channeling his hatred
Indeed. You opposed @realDonaldTrump and showed integrity. You threw all your integrity out the window and now bow before him.
The person in charge of diplomacy has just shown her ass on behalf of the USA. Wtg. Stay classy.
yeahhhhhhhh
Hesrd your speach at your swearing in. Your lips were moving but DTs words were comming out.
it was a bad opener
GOD help us all. A learn as you go administration.
so proud again finally
you r taking names at the UN  lol. After Samantha Power with her outstanding intelligence and competence now we have name taker
@SenRubioPress Yes we are so excited to see our Party United. God Bless!
She's just a Trump puppet, no need to listen to the monkey, just find the organ grinder.
Amb. Haley, the UN shouldn't have diplomatic immunity against US laws, & scoff at the fines they've generated. #Accountability
First day and already threatening, intimidating nations?? "we are taking name".. really??
@SenRubioPress DO NOT SELL OFF OUR PUBLIC LANDS. THEY DON'T BELONG TO TRUMP OR ICHAN. THEY BELONG TO US!!!
I'm sure you had presidential ambitions. Your association with trump will not bode well for you. It's a shame
A new Fascist regime.
well that's one perception of that pic.
you really got off on the wrong foot Nikki. Terrible speech. You aren't acting like yourself. We don't want a threatening Ambo.
"have our back or we'll respond accordingly" u sound like James bond...impressive!!! Can u plz prefix/suffix china.
Here is you "new vision".
@SenRubioPress 
Good luck. You know you work for Satan don't you?
"taking names"??? #lowrent
@SenRubioPress You follow this bully around like a lap dog. You know he's unfit. Sickening. Job & acceptance more 2 U thanvalues
what kind of "democracy" are you trying to shove down our throats? #flaweddemocracy #fascist #rascistregime
#gonikki
YOU ARE ALREADY AN EMBARRASSMENT! "We are taking names"? Some diplomat you are. You will be recalled for INCOMPETENCE.
Samantha Power; an earnest diplomat & advocate for ALL in need around the world!  Will miss your voice @AmbPower44 at the UN!
What is it with all you Trump surrogates that are so obsessed over keeping lists & making threatening & undiplomatic speeches?

@POTUS Congratulations, if President Trump believes in you, you have my support 100%. 
Blessings as you take your new post.
Good Luck, Ambassador Nikki Haley.

@TeamTrumpRussia Get'em Nikki .. we want our $ worth out of UN & be respectful our hospitality while here in USA.
Enjoy the new, well-deserved limelight. Pls don't forget #SouthCarolina
I don't know where to send your congratulatory letter, but congratulations on your new adventures.
she was grabbed by the pussy #hairybushmatters
@marcorubio As long as Trump surrounds himself w/ smart patriots like Haley,Rubio & Pence, America might be ok! 
Yes we will be ok!
congratulations Nikki. I use to live in Orangeburg. Shopped in you parents store.
Congratulations for the promotion.
you go, girl!  I can't wait to see you on the Presidential ballot someday.  This is your international screen test.  Tear it up!
