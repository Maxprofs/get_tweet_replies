Thank you @marcorubio for always standing for life. #UnbornLivesMatter We will always #chooselife.
For what life? He only cares if you're a fetus. He hasn't done a good thing for the poor people in the country, let alone the people in FL
And not for nothing, since you live in France, you unsolicited opinion of American politics isn't necessary.
Not for nothing but your opinion on what to do with my uterus and life it's none of your concern. #AbortionRules
A baby in a womb is not part of mom's body any more than one visiting the Eiffel Tower is part of the tower.
It is using MY body. Not only that but we shouldn't take raising a child lightly.
Yes, an unborn baby is temporarily in his/her mother's body. But the child is a seperate person. Seperate
organs, seperate DNA profile. And abortion always involves KILLING that child.
but once they are born forget about them, real nice
never understood this argument-would you rather have a difficult life or no life at all? I'm thankful for my life 
Would you rather live in the future or in the past? I don't understand this question... did you ask to be in this world?
and I'm glad your story turned out for you and understand your point of view
I was replying to the other girl lol
eggs are human beings but refugees aren't?
first of all America is not a Dumping Ground for world's refugees! Secondly refugees are not citizens of this country
you do realize that this country was "started" by a bunch of people who threw a tantrum right?
and then participated in the genocide of the Native Americans.
but I don't hate America because of the past. ALL countries have transgressions from the past. And?
how can they march for Life when they don't view ALL lives equally?
prolife movement today is very diverse NOT just made up of Catholics. If by "they" u mean catholics ok.
"they" refers to anyone who is pro-life but does not view all lives on the same platform. Or who support..
only sacred until it comes out of the womb. You just want it as a punishment for having sex.
All life is sacred. Immigrant life. Refugee life. Minority life. Please fight not only for birth, but for abundant life for all.
let's start sterilizing boys before they can become serial impregnators instead of demonizing women's for having a choice.
If all life is sacred then why do you want women to die from illegal abortions?
If all human life is sacred, I assume you stand with the Pope any many more of us against capital punishment.  #antideath

Please value the life of children.  Request a nominee that values the neighborhood schools.  No on DeVos.
too bad you are not representing the public you were hired to represent-hypocrite
it's a woman's choice, not yours. #MarchForLife
if all human life is sacred, why sell out to gun lobby? Your hypocrisy is sadly transparent.
Until they are born, then you don't care at all.  You are ProBirth, not ProLife.
Let us know when the march for ALL life begins. The march for our neighbors, the poor, the hungry, those fleeing war...
yes!nn
yes!
Unless that life is fleeing a war  zone, amirite, @marcorubio? #NoBanNoWall
Fun fact:  Making abortion illegal does not decrease abortions.  It decreases the number of women who survive them.
unless that life is the woman carrying the child, right? Then her sacredness and agency is at the mercy of govt., right?
if you  force a woman to raise a child she doesn't want and can't afford, are you going to force the men also?
Excellent points @sweetrocketsky Perhaps "pro-lifers" will agree to adopt children instead. Or is life only sacred in the womb? @marcorubio
if all life is sacred, shouldn't you want the life already living to have #healthcare?
weird how u don't treat the poor, homeless, vets, #LGBT, women, minorities, or immigrants like their life is sacred. #WeRemember
No one believes that these days-
Your not a woman and should not even put your opinion in on this matter.  Until you can have babies keep out of it!
I think you meant to say, only certain human life is sacred and only if we don't have to help them after they are born, right?
someone who voted to #repeal the #aca doesn't then get to march #prolife in a society that doesn't offer #healthcare
Two things you won't hear at the #MarchForLife today: 
1) Contraception prevents abortions. 2) Obamacare/ACA prevents abortions.
That's not nice to call me names :-) Have some respect. Not very Christian
who said im a Christian? You're an idiot if you think religious people are the only ones that are pro-life.
Not nice to call me names. Its not very "Pro-Life" to call me name.
if you #repeal the #aca and take away coverage fir #pregnancy how are these mother to get #prenatalcare and safe deliveries?
All life?  Even the lives of Syrian children?
I will never apologize for a women's right to choose.
please vote against DeVoss for Dept of Education. She does not support equal education. Will weaken USA
how will the government support more unwanted children.
unless you're a Syrian Refugee fleeing persecution- then you'll be sent back to die - yay, freedom.
- then support all human life, which includes taking care of the sick, poor, disabled & refugees
If human life is sacred, why don't you fight for the rights of ALL people now living?
do you also oppose the death penalty? I pray so.
What about the lives of Syrians who just want a safe place for their children. Those lives don't count? Not very Christian.
If you think that special needs kids' lives are sacred, please vote no on deVos.
Unless they grow up to be a woman, then who cares. Banning abortion won't stop abortions, it will stop SAFE abortions.
Right.....from a guy who has never been pregnant and had to make a decision concerning a pregnancy ....@marcorubio
hey what about the Syrians - you did say all lives are sacred - you hypocrite -
if human life is sacred then how come right wing policy ignores these kids once they are born?
except for those killed by guns. Or by the state in capital punishment cases.
How about the life of a sexually aboused child? Does her life matter?
Sacred enough 4 healthcare?  Or just while in the womb?   #ACARepeal #StandWithPP #RESISTANCE
do u support all this that marched around the world at the women's march?  I'm guessing not
All life except refugees.  How do you spell HYPOCRISY, Mr. Senator.  What Would Jesus Do?  Send kids back to be killed.  Proud?
our @POTUS have censored fed depts of publishing news. I hope you don't supor that!
smfh
If all human life is sacred please stop funding wars, executing prisoners, defunding health care, and lifting pollution controls
did you also support the millions who marched for the rights of those currently walking the earth?
why didn't you join in the Women's March to help support their rights as human beings?  Not something you care about too much?
Who is looking out for the 6 month old baby that the Republican band on Muslims keeps from coming to the US for critical surgery
.@marcorubio "all human life" includes refugees doesn't it?
where was support senator for the MILLIONS marching for womens rights and equality? Do their lives not matter as much to you?
ALL LIFE IS SACRED senator,please prove that by speaking against refugee ban and the lives being lost daily to Syrian genocide
All?  Seriously? What about those that will die from lack of health care?  Death Penalty? Aleppo? Refugees?
So why don't you support ACA requirement to cover contraception? Colorado reduced unintended pregnancies and abortions by >40%.
You can use bleach as a salad dressing.
.@marcorubio You forgot: "Except the lives of refugees, undocumented immigrants, peace-loving Muslims, African Americans, LGBTQ community"
If "all human life is sacred" then I assume you will not vote to defund PP or cut social services for families.
if human life is sacred then why not take in refugees that will otherwise die?
Unless you are an immigrant. You do not care about life outside of a very few from Cuba. You do not represent us.
quite a shift in your previous capital punishment position there.
crowd mostly high schl kids bussed in from area Cath Schls. #marchforLife a joke & a farce. Compare to real Womens March! 1.2M
If you believed that you would help refugees, provide health care, and control guns. I'm a Florida voter.
If that is the case, why are you not speaking out more for refugee and immigrant rights that are being taken away by Trump?
I HAVE A CRUSHED ON MARCO RUBIO?
.@marcorubio Life is sacred, you say. You will defend the #ACA, so  people will not die prematurely bc they can't pay for healthcare?
.@marcorubio You will support comprehensive background checks on gun sales? They save lives.
I love you Marco! I voted you into the Senate when a FL resident & proud you work with Tim Scott my SC Senator. God bless you!
if you truly believe all life is sacred, then show some Christian compassion to refugees! #NoBanNoWall
Your religion does not belong in our government. Your job is to represent all constituents, not just those of your faith.
prolife until the are born. Then they are garbage. 
Except those who are already born and need healthcare, are not Christian or white #countryoverparty #ivoteinFL
The late Nat Hentoff of Village Voice fame, supported life.
goody for you, like Ryan and Trump you only care about the unborn otherwise you're one big death list waiting to happen
except of course refugees #SallyYatesIsAHero #RefugeesWelcome #muslimban #StandUpToTrump #silenceiscomplicity
A convenient pro-life stance doesn't guarantee votes; nor does it make you superior to anyone! Pro-lifers are Still hellbound!
most people are pro-life , all aren't pro-force-a-woman-to-have-a-child. Y'all act like men don't force women to end pregnancies
.@marcorubio But is that ALL human life or American-conceived unborn life? You can't use this catchphrase while not denouncing the EO
stand up to Trump!
not ALL human life is sacred 2 U. U only care about embryos, & not about muslims,  poor, blacks, education. #weak #denysessions
all life IS sacred. Even lives of refugee children, Visa and green card holders? If ANY Sen. understood refugees, SHOULD be u.
You're not pro-life you're anti-choice. Next time u need a doctor be sure to post publicly do we can decide for you.
- "All human life is sacred"...except those refugees, right? Except the poor Americans? Except those in need of health care?
It's unfortunate, you stand for standing DOWN!
ALL human life is sacred. Weare all at Risk of losing our freedom. Help stop this Circus
What about refugees? Do their lives matter, too?
if all life is sacred then why are you dismantling healthcare and prenatal care?
Are refugee lives sacred? Do their lives matter? #ChristiansAgainstMuslimBan
Whe did you march for already born and raised African Americans and their sacred lives la culebra @marcorubio
you mean refugees' lives are also sacred?
What about the lives of refugees? What about black lives? What about poor and homeless lives? What about Muslim lives?
@4tinymiracles 
All lives are sacred, no matter the color, religion or belief! Hands off my Obamacare and my body! 
little Marco Rubio
Support civil liberties of women. Stop this attack on us. Since questioning Tillerson, you're the same old disappointment.
You will also never face pregnancy, poverty & desperation. Where is the legislation to take care of unwanted children?
except those that have lost everything, have been vetted for 2 years and come from Syria. #weseeyou
- you are a man. You don't know what women had gone thru. You like to control women's rights just like any man.
Can't help but love you for this. One of the reasons why I still support you.
Then oppose all they is Trump. Prove your statement.
you should be proud of all people. You should be proud of all peaceful protest. Don't be a puppet. #WomensMarch #NoBanNoWall
unless its life of children from war torn countries, right?
If you truly mean ALL life, please do something for refugees. Pics of young kids in handcuffs in the USA is an abomination.
Too bad "all life" for you doesn't include Syrian refugees.
how about Muslim lives all humans Matter WWJD he had open door policy
My choice is sacred  - stay out of it! My life is sacred too and it's my choice to make!
@SenRubioPress except for non Christian, non American life, right?
Except for Muslim life correct, & women's lives, & immigrants.  You barely won this time sir, we will not make the mistake again
Why no mention of the women's march? Trust me, we all vote!!
is all life sacred Mr. Rubio? Because the current ban on Muslims leads allot of people to think you don't really feel that way.
what about gay people? Are their lives sacred?
until birth. Then you cut help for the poor and stop refugees.
Nope. Not Syrians lives. Not Iraqi lives. If you not vote down Tillerson, we know you are the spineless twit we feared you are.
Every life except the mother's obviously.
what about Muslim lives?
Dear Marco and Family,#LoveofGodFamilyFriends and have no enemies.Will Always Cherish 10/28/16-11/9/16,#SupportingMarcoRubio,DrY
since all human life is sacred how about doing something about that #MuslimBan ? #noban #NoBanNoWall stand by your words
please impeach trump and retain full power back to the people/congress.
many in the @GOP support the death penalty and not allowing immigrants from Syria certainly seems hipocritical
So what are you doing to protect the immigrants, refugees, womxn, poor, and students who are ALIVE? Need to know soon. Thnx
what about lives of Syrian immigrants? They aren't as important as a fetus? Not buying that you care about all human life.

if you truly believe all human life is sacred, you'll oppose the entire Trump-Bannon agenda & keep the ACA. #humanrights
I have a list of women who can't afford to have babies. It costs $175K/child. Send list of anti-abortionists who will pay 50%
keep your mind off my uterus!  So creepy!!!! #theresistance #democracynow #stopsessions #stoptillerson  #traitors #WomensMarch
if you truly believed that you would want to save the refugees and lift the #MuslimBan
I am a constituent. respect ALL LIFE and take a harder stance on the #MuslimBan. OPPOSE this unconstitutional action.
except for people who are already born and need your help???
I guess Muslims aren't humans to you, huh?
oh I'm sorry, are you a woman that has to carry a child in the womb for 9 months?oh wait you're a man..
pro life includes all life, muslim, refugee, poor, all inclusive. You make a difference, now is the time #ResistTrump
LIFE IS SACRED? WHAT ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY?
If Human Life is sacred -- gun control, universal healthcare, better public education & childcare, better housing, living wage
No mention of the enormous crowd for the 1/21 Women's March? No balance.
Do U support the Women's March? We are for equality & our civil liberties. So you only support women when it's pro life.
@SenRubioPress yet you're turning away living, breathing children #ItsMy2Cents
Explain how r u #prolife &allow this to happen. Do you value #Muslim children less tha unborn fetus? Not very Christian of you
will you stand with Americans and declare refugee lives as sacred as those of embryos?  History has its eyes on us.
Refugees' lives are sacred! Muslims' lives are sacred! #StopMuslimBan
all human life is sacred. Including #Refugees and #immigrants #nobannowall
You have GOT to stop saying all human life is sacred while letting @realDonaldTrump destroy the lives of already vetted refugees
If it is Sacred, why do U not stand up for women &children refugees? Scared of Trump are we?
Amen! I believe in birth control though.
Unless it's brown children escaping a failed state we helped destabilize. Then their life is basically worthless. Coward.
if all life is sacred you should probably stop allowing this administration to devalue humans already suffering. #NoBanNoWall
, all life is sacred, huh? But not #refugees apparently. Your #silenceisdeadly. #MuslimBan #NoBanNoWall #Matthew2535
Then you should be supporting the lives  you would save by banning the ban! You are an immigrant's son! Make your parents proud
If that's true, why are we denying refugees?
"all human life is sacred"-- except refugees right? You're pathetic.
Except if you're a Muslim Syrian REFUGEE. #LittleMarco #MuslimBan #AntiChristian Jesus was a REFUGEE!
you state all human life is sacred so where is your push back on the EO Ban?
Hey Marco, where were you this weekend?
As the son of Cuban immigrants, I find your silence to 45's ban disheartening. Rise!
if you feel this way, stand up for #refugees. Their lives are sacred too! #MuslimBan
"All human life is sacred"...except for the refugees your party leader is turning away? Grow a spine Marco!
.@marcorubio Except for refugees and victims and gun violence? @GOP doesn't seem to want to protect those lives.
I agree.  Now when will you be defending the dignity of human life in the refugee and resident aliens?  Silence is complicity.  SPEAK UP NOW
really?  Notice the other matches in your state?  You represent us.
I guess refugee children are not sacred. Step up Rubio the country an world is watching #country over party
what about Muslim refugee children? Don't your donors care about them too? Why are you so spineless?
# You have never stood for our rights and your all talk Mr am not running for office today but here you are milking the cow
# How about children banned from the Middle East. And your Parents ran from cuba? And were not Banned and your a senator today?
# Republicans  are more worried about being voted out of office than the liberty of their citizens. Ban all us citizens too
But what about refugees? Aren't their lives just as sacred?
Almost all...right, Senator?
What about Green Card holders & refugees trapped by EO? Do you support them? #GetASpine #NoBanNoWall
you can speak to pro-life but not to families currently being broken apart? It is time you PUBLICLY denounce the Muslim ban.
@GOP can't denounce the Muslim ban because in that hole where a heart should be, they agree with it!
unless they're immigrants, right? Coward.
@SenRubioPress You got that Right...Life is Sacred..Tell that to Madonna and her women's March that is against everything good..
But screw the lives of the refugees? Am I right? #LittleSpinelessMarco
Even the lives of refugee children? Please stand up against this #MuslimBan. Also, do not support Betsy #DeVos!
