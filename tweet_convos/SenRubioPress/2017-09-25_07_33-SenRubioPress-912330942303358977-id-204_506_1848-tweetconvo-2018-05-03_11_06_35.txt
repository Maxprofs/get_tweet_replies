for the record, the guy you endorsed for president doesn't seem to care. But a kneeling black guy is devastating to him.
Does the "kneeling black guy" is doing anything for PR? or you? May be for you the protest is more important than 3.5 millions of citizens.
Thats the point when POTUS should be helping PR he instead tried to start a race war. He's fired. Marc Rubio should condemn the remarks.
They are... All the politicians. But he and Cuomo where the only ones supporting the puertoricans. Where are the rest of them? Blue or Red..
Thank you Marco Rubio!

Keep up the good work Senator!
Please save Rakhine state of Myanmar. Native people was killed by Bengali.
Get rid of the jones act!!!!
Climate change is real
not
IS
NOT & IS.
Please address the coded white supremacist speech Trump made in Alabama. His continued efforts to start a race war are repugnant. Stand up.
Thank You Marco! We appreciate all your hard work.  I admire and respect you. God Bless You! #DayOneSupporter #RubioRepublican
Thank you for your needed help. May God bless you.
Sound costly for no real reason .. still sad
Senator the situation is dire. The heat is horrid. No gasoline. Isla adentro no hay nada. Por favor, Puerto Rico no es San Juan nada mas

Thank you!! We supported you....Thank you for be there for our Island... Humanitarian crisis.
AMEN  !!! THANK YOU !!! 
Yes why don't you do something constructive for a change
Please, I need ice, water, food. 787-400-0648
Thank you for continuing to show leadership to our country.
Thank you. And VOTE NO to the Health not care bill.
Thank you! Please keep the pressure on to help PR NOW. To let Americans massively die of thirst, disease and starvation should be a crime.
Is the NFL kicking in money for relief to Puerto Rico? How about any of the kneelers? A dime frommany of them? I didn't think so...

Ask why major airlines not flying into the Island?
I hope you really mean this Marco.  #palante #puertorico  Please stand up for our island.
Take care of the American health care first!
Why isn't the #USSComfort on its way? #PuertoRico #SendComfort
I think Hurricane Maria stands between USNS Comfort and PR. She might have to wait until the storm passes to sail from Virginia.
Get Navy Medical ships/hospital to Puerto Rico.
I heard that the ports are destroyed, I think everything needs to be air dropped
Ports not destroyed. They have been opened.
You are full of crap Rubio. A real politician.
PLEASE make sure these AMERICANS are supported. POTUS is too busy trying to divert attention from his many self imposed issues to football.
Where is the rest of the federal aid?
@marcorubio what's the plan of action and execution?  Or was it just a photo opportunity day?  #PuertoRicoSeLevanta needs men of action.
thank you Senator
@ChrisVanHollen @SenatorCardin @VanHollenForMD #PuertoRicoRelief
You might want to share that thought with Potus. He's busy poking the bear in N Korea, firing up racists in AL and shaming NFL. 2 much 2do
Thanks Senator. Hopefully you can call attention to the plight of PR and get Trump to do something.
Love you, Marco!
Senator, please do what you can to #SendTheComfort and hospital ship Mercy. Over 51K have signed a petition for this
Thank you sir, please help Puerto Rico
@marcorubio  Thank you for the support!!
Don't know why when or who created this art Credit 2 the artist After Hurricane Maria I see all of us in it  We will prevail! 
Admit what you did to the #ACA that raised premiums for innocent Americans. Grow a pair
Give ur seat up for a bag of food.  A more valuable contribution.
You guys couldn’t take @NYGovCuomo word? He went the next day? The situation is worse now! @CNN @Acosta @andersoncooper @ananavarro
How about urging the Navy to get multiple ships with supplies and meds to Puerto Rico ASAP!
Ty Sir! 
What happened to Florida? Thought you would work for us since we voted you into this office. This is looking more and more like a mistake.
Maybe would could tell your leader to stop tweeting and get some help for the islands. #PuertoRicoStrong.
Be reminded that your beloved DJT spends more money in ONE trip to maralago than entire help to Puerto Rico
@marcorubio PLEASE HELP US 
One Cruise Ship can bring thousand provide medical care and bring them to FL 
ppl in airports 3 days?
Ayúdanos
What about the asshole you voted for to be president? What’s he doing?
Wow it was about time Marquito !!!!
Why is the President continuing to tweet about NFL? We have serious problems and we need serious people to confront them?
#PuertoRico needs a stronger and substantial response from #Congress and @POTUS #hurricanemaria
Wouldnt it be helpful if #PuertoRicans and all other Americans could count on decent medical care? Shame on u for voting to repeal #ACA
When? A week? After a month of voting? Americans need help 

NOW. NOW. NOW.

Enjoy your photo op, Rubio.
Wish I was going 2 PR so I can help!! TY & God Bless You! If you see my familia, pls tell them we love them all & 2B  safe. Sign, crying! 
Glad someone is on their way. Can you get this situation covered in the media?
@marcorubio ThankYou for your leadership & action in helping #PuertoRico
Thank you Marco for all you are doing' These poor ppl! Are they letting planes come in there now? Praying for all! Reading your schedule TY
Because they are brown
Pls. Sen. Rubio, vote no to the Graham Cassidy bill. Why quote Scripture & then condemn your constituents to suffering & death? Vote no.
@marcorubio dear sir profiteering off a trapped desperate sick person is deplorable, #VoteNOGrahamCassidy  at least children #SaveMedicaid
Why can’t the national guard do helicopter drops of food and water to the areas that can’t be reached by vehicle we do it 4 other countries
And you need to do all you can to help the @USCG when budget time rolls around. No cuts to their funding. They protect lives and property.
as u vote to take away our healthcare. I-ROWWW-KNEEEEEEEE
Thank you
Running for President again in 2020??? Trying to lock in those PR votes?
Thank you Senator Rubio. Keep us posted
Thank you!  Please keep talking about this!!
they need more than gestures!!! they need FEDERAL AID same as Texas!

You better do MORE than you can or 10's of 1000''s are going to DIE in the next WEEK! So SICK of ur lip service to Hispanic AMERICAN issues.
Thank you Senator Rubio !Puerto Rico needs help! Please keep in the news as much as houston florida!We are all Americans!Que Dios Te bendiga
Hey look a former presidential candidate doing something more presidential than our elected President. 
Thank You!!!
You should be in DC stopping this foolish HOP health bill!!!
Where's the President you supported on this?
Also, u can't be a Senator of the UNITED States if u continue to support a president that massively divides US #TakeAKnee
Well thank God. Also, you can't help them and then hurt millions by taking away healthcare & cutting USCG budget!
About time someone does something
At least ur going as expected the white supremacist @realDonaldTrump doesn't have time for Puerto Rico.
Why hasn't your president tweeted about this? How does he just forget ?
Thank you!  They are in desperate need of help.  Also, please vote NO on Graham Cassidy.
Might help if the President cared at all. He is too busy tweeting at athletes in peaceful protest. Trump cares nothing about Puerto Rico.
For once..stay in Florida and vote against Trumpcare!
Get funding there now and any form of aid we can get down there... it's taking too long, this should have happened already
Thanks & Gracias mil!
Please vote "NO" on G-C Bill as it will hurt FL constituents, make that Americans.  w/med experts if you have ???
What's needed is the following:  1.  Significant flow of funds immediately 2.  Debt forgivenesses 3.  Infrastructure rebuilding by Military.
Ya about that.. the WH is planning on sending a relief bill in the 1st or 2nd week of October.  Got to go after the @NFL first!
Vieques and Culebra are Puerto Rico, please help them!
Get over to the USVI too...they need media attention and assistance as well!
@SenRubioPress @USCG send Navy too- they are desperate.  Save our citizens!
Please help our family in Vieques
Thank you for helping 

               BUT
WHERE YOU STAND ON HEALTHCARE Mr Senator?!

We all hope u vote NO
Where is an ear mark FED relief funding for PR You NOW depend on PR constituency for your US Senate post
#PuertoRicoStrong Older folks who can leave for US won't because their PETS won't be allowed on airlines.  IMPLORE airlines to waive rules?
Can you pass an Aid Bill in Congressional and act faster - thanx
Rebuild with solar and wind, underground power lines.
Get Trump to pay attention.
Come on, Marco! This is on you and other Senators! Get the relief rolling faster! Please!
Thank you
Help blue water Navy veterans get their earned agent orange benefits before they die.do that
why isn't @POTUS doing more to send relief instead of delaying? These are millions of Americans in crisis!
POTUS is. See @AirMobilityCmd page
so much support for your helping P.R. We need your help with your foreign policy mojo. Get #45 straight on nukes and NK.
That would be great. They need a lot of help long term. Not just a day, week, month.
Stay safe
That's great. But, not addressing the divisiveness coming from @POTUS drowns out you evading standing up for US. #Puppet
maybe consider putting power lines underground? Just a thought...
That would cost money.  US tax payer money goes to war. Not infrastructure, healthcare, education, or anything else that matters.
PR is TOO BLUE&TOO BROWN to matter to .@POTUS He will NOT LIFT a finger to help them! 3.5M BLUE voters w/soon relocate to mainland- Prob FLA
Thank you for your attention to & time with this. Please help push for USNS care ship(s) & any other medical boat help ASAP.

@ricardorossello @realDonaldTrump @VP @Jenniffer2012 as a veteran I know that if you call @ltgrusselhonore he will help P.R call the man!!!
Thank you Senator. And please vote NO on Graham/Cassidy  healthcare bill. As it is now,  it will adversely affect Floridians.
Good for you, Marco
Amount FEMA has disbursed so far in #PuertoRico: $2.1M 
Amount EACH of Trump's visits to Mar-a-lago costs: $3M
Please do what the president won't do.  Help our American citizens.
Please tell us how we can help here in Florida! What can we send? Get @POTUS out there with you! They need help in PR!
Good work! thanks
I CAN FINALLY THANK YOU FOR SOEMTHING!!!!!!!
Glad you're helping--please come home when McConnell calls the vote and #VoteNoGrahamCassidy! Bipartisanship so the American People win.
Thank you.
Hey Marco. Will that include the Virgin Islands
@realDonaldTramp this is what your focus should really on. #US #PuertoRicoRelief 
Make sure you enter the airport bldg. and see the conditions ppl have been subjected to while waiting for flights out!
Thank you!!!!
Photo time wear your big boy working clothes
Is @realDonaldTrump going with you?
Need to get people off the island, send big boats!! Open air traffic  #WhosTheHero. #HelpPuertoRico
An emergency bipartisan relief bill is needed for #PuertoRicoRelief. Please grab a Dem co-sponsor and get one on the floor ASAP.
Make Americans proud, vote no on Graham Cassidy bill!
It would be great if the President would show more concern for Puerto Rico.
Thank you Senator! #PuertoRicoRelief #PuertoRicoStrong #PuertoRicoWeCare
When is the aid arriving!?
Federal govt needs to do more.
TY!  We all need to help them.  When you return vote NO on G-C- What does @GOP know that ALL Med groups & orgs don't?  It's horrid for #FLA.
Did @realDonaldTrump offer any assistance? He hasn't publicly said anything about the devastation in #PuertoRico that I'm aware of.
Nice that you are silent about @realDonaldTrump ignoring the tragedy in Puerto Rico. But hey you are getting money.
Thank you Senator Rubio, you always showed leadership in moments of crisis. I know help is on the way! #PuertoRicoRelief #PuertoRicoStrong
We need US Army help with logistic, security and gasoline and Disel transportation. Urgent
POTUS has to stand strong with PR, CeeBee's land and repair essentials.
Ty Marco, for giving Puerto Rico same & attention  you have given FL. Your ability to assess needs & provide solutions is invaluable 
What are we doing to help PR? Is President involved?
Thank you, millions of Puerto Ricans in Fl. Will remember who helped and didn't. Don't forget about the U.S. Virgin Islands!
What about USVI??????
yes help puerto rico but rubio acts like hes a god or something for helping people in need
Take Hillary with you and leave her there. 
Stuff it
Heh, heh, heh.
How much does sayfie pay you to pimp them every post?
Thank you Senator. We can forget about what is going on in PR. They need so much help!
Maybe you can let Trump know about the PR devastation and that they are US citizens he probably doesn't know that
And meanwhile this weekend, the orange butt plug spent more of our tax money to be on his golf course then you're taking to help 3MM people.
FINALLY....pressure @realDonaldTrump to get on board...maybe withhold YOUR health care vote so FL gets more money like AK & ME
Great!  While you're at it, could you also announce that you will do all you can to help your constituents by voting NO on Graham-Cassidy?
Maybe we can secede P.R. from the Union and start over

You of all people should be speaking out against this Nationalist Administration
Please set up some basic communication a website where people can see their loved ones are ok. My aunties 75& 80 no word from them.
It's good to see you do something positive for once-pray with your actions
Maybe you can help heal them all by reciting biblical verses.
GET BACK TO DCA AND DO YOUR JOB AND QUIT TAKING JUNKETS
PR courtesy of USCG is not exactly a junket right now, and it might help put politicians set priorities when he does get back to DC.
Please do so and when you come back vote NO to the healthcare proposal. 
Thank you.
Take Tiny Don with you please #leavehimthere
Thank you Senator Rubio!  If you can get POTUS to focus on  and get over the whole kneeling thing that would be great.  Priorities!
Why are you promoting a partisan blog #Sayfie when ur supposed to be representing ALL Floridians the last time I checked #factsmatter
Thank you. Perhaps you can convince @POTUS and @FLOTUS to visit and give support to our fellow citizens as well.
Shouldn't you be in Washington voting on health care?
Praying Puerto Rico can start getting some substantial help now. Thanks for being on scene to help set priorities, Senator.
sure.  HOW?
I am "Taking A Knee" on Puerto Rico

This time, how about we let Puerto Rican's take care of Puerto Rico  
#PuertoRicanRelief 
#TakeAKnee
Hey ... I thought you died man. Where u been?
Go to #USVI on the way back. #HurricaneIrma #HurricaneMaria also affected #StCroix #StThomas #StJohn.
Any good that you do is cancelled by your #GrahamCassidy vote to cut healthcare access for everyone & kill vulnerable sick.
We are w/o hope.
What exactly is going to be done? They need more than just emotional and social media support.
VOTE NO ON ACA REPEAL
Is there a verse from Bible for that?
Romans 12:15
"Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn."
Can the President you support help or is he too busy tweeting nonstop about black men playing football games?
Hope you have a Blessed day!
Protect children... #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
Good, but you're late.
When will your president say something?
Call @POTUS
