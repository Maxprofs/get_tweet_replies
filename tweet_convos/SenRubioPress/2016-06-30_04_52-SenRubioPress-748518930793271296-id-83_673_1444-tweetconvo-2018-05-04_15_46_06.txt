You keep saying no for Hillary to be POTUS!  Quite frankly I do not believe you.  Because you refuse to back Trump.  SHAMEFUL!
Jeez you must live under a rock. He already said he was going to vote for him. Grow up. @marcorubio
wrong. If he openly supports DT  he'll lose like we all will. Screwed either way
Well you should have voted for a guy who can actually beat her @NoOnePatriot @carolehers @marcorubio
No the 12 million Dems who stuck GOP w/ Trump specifically 4 us to lose @NoOnePatriot @carolehers @marcorubio
stop pandering.  You don't give two shits about those people.  Typical politician
If you really believe that, then you know nothing about him at all.
if you believe he does, then you know nothing.  Says on thing does another.  Just like Orlando. #marcotheOpportunist
He's a great politician, not a complement, his best skill is talking out of both sides of his mouth
Like this? He doesn't speak out of both sides of mouth like others.
More like this
Nope. More like this. Stop the spin. Who do you rep.? Murphy or Grayson?
neither.  I had some respect for Rubio when he went to Olando, but turned into a photo op.
@Larterlia Are you still tweeting distorted statements while you ignore occupation and theft of Palestinian homes ?
you keep making things up palis always play the victim card but they are terrorist scum
Not scum,  West Bank Civilian People never ever done harm except asking for refugees return to their stolen homes ?
We must always stand w/our ally Israel. Thank you, Senator.
False, he not advising Israel, the truth. Friend tell his Friend truth so that his friend can avoid future trouble.
I hope you never leave politics Senator. We need intelligent and strong leaders like you to protect us and uphold great values.
Have you even once taken a non biased look at the FACTS on the ground in Israeli occupied Palestinian lands?
Funny Since Rubio COULD CARE less about the mass shooting of a LGBT community in his own home state
WE COULD CARE LESS WHAT THE MUSLIMS DO TO THE JEWS OR CHRISTIANS..YOU DESERVE EACHOTHER
@SpeakerRyan HS WB Philip Haney spoke to 45 poltns about Obama changing reports to put islamic terrorist in a good light.treason
Ignore Nazi #Israel Illegal settlements & Gaza Siege > Kiss #zionist arse little Marco! https://twitter.com/ThamiBOUHMOUCH/status/741634485511421953/photo/1pic.twitter.com/djTQIGPVej  #fuckisrael #BDS
well if you focused on Florida problems maybe we would care not a tweet about #toxicalgae
I am a Floridian and truly embarrassed by your two-faced hypocritical go-wherever-is-self serving-to-YOU game. We see the facade
Love the passion. Get the word out, VOTE, and make sure @marcorubio keeps one of his promises and is a private citizen in '17
what about the sionists terrorists they are really cowards
Pray, but DO SOMETHING REAL, too. #StandWithOrlando #EarnYourPay #SeatsUpForGrabs
Tell Israelis to stop  provoking Palestinians goes both ways  maybe attacks will end
little marco, you must be needing some votes and $. pray for the hundred of victims terrorized by gun violence in ur own state.
SO...Marco...WHEN are U going to STAND UP FOR TRUMP??  U do not have my vote until U do!
TEPID AT BEST/TRYING 2 GET VOTES/WANT 2 HEAR PUBLIC ENDORSEMENT/REPUBLICANS HAVE 2 PULL TOGETHER & SAY NO 2 HILLARY
Only way to make sure @marcorubio out of politics for good (forget 2020) is to beat him this fall. FL voters it's up to you #flsen
your prayers? wtf do your prayers do? #EndMagicalThinking
I wish you were our nominee!!
where's the moral outrage and condemnation when #israel kills innocents? Or is it not also #terrorism dropping #bombs from f16 ?
what abt what they have been doing to Palestinians and the ones who are not even armed. Load of #rubbish
Maybe Israel ceasing the building of illegal settlements would be a good way to stop incitement?
You made a pledge before Americans that you would get behind the nominee whoever was that a lie
The religion of peace murdering another innocent child .
the child stabbed was American !!!!
Obama is probably sending condolences to the family of the murderer, for his unjust arrest.
#MarcoRubio
#IStandWithIsrael
@LiorHaiat Thank you, Sen. @marcorubio
Start supporting Trump and be on the side that will end terrorism . Safe Secure Boarders, vetting , coming in legally !
the world will be better when bias people like u die out. Did u stand by Palestine when a Palestinian family was burned alive?
@johnkasich @JebBush @ScottWalker
I'd like to see you condemn Israel the same way. Puppet.
you are the only qualify to keep the USA safe
you and all corrupt politicians should be in prison. Where are your prayers for our survival? http://www.wptv.com/news/region-martin-county/jensen-beach/blue-green-algae-in-ocean-spreads-to-st-lucie-county-closes-beaches …
ty for always standing w isreal
Oh please!! You don't even care about the people of this country. Please stop it with your feigned concern
yet Israel bulldozing Palestinian settlements is not a big deal? The Palestinians should just move out of their houses?
@MsAmericanSnob Marco has already stated he will support nominee, but because they differ on many issues can't be VP!#OnlyMarco
agreed !
@IsraelMFA Thank-you for your words of support.
why don't you tweet to the families of victimized Palestinians?
Bill Clinton & Loretta Lynch meet on private plane so no one can hear the conversation FIX IS IN #Trump2016 #CROOKEDHillary
Thank you for standing by #Israel in her time of sorrow Wish I had the option of voting for you as POTUS
I have always admired Rubio personality. It's goodness in that man,  wonder how did he become an republican.  Something in his
@MKreports may the terrorist flesh be nibbled in public by vulture birds.
Special thanks to @marcorubio for these honest and touching words.
encourage Florida Voters #NeverRubio Unless he endorses Florida state Republican Nominee
.@marcorubio The comments on this thread are ridiculous. So Rubio is responsible for a conflict that's been raging for decades? Please.
Mine too.hope you can learn something from this. @realDonaldTrump 
between you too FL can be GOP territory. if you love the USA.
thank you for being one of the only normal politicians in USA to stand strong with our greatest ally in the middle East ISRAEL!
YOU ARE KIDDING RIGHT
Feel you need an edge in getting re-elected we all know the one endorsement that will help @realDonaldTrump get on the train
We stand By Israel' we Stand by Marco Rubio who is so on top of his Game on ISIS! #•••Marco is in it to win it.
just curious what has Rubio done to isis
Protocol I to the Geneva Convention of 1949, (Act 1 C4), passed in 1977, armed struggle can be used. (http://www.un-documents.net/gc-p1.htm )
so you thinking stabbing a sleeping child to death is acceptable?  Disgusting.
@florida_strong #good luck in November
they're incited by lifestyle they hate Jews Gays Infidels and anyone who isn't a Muslin it's not anything we say stop pandering
and when does the Israeli form of apartheid end for the Palestinian people. When will the Israeli terrorism in Palestine end?
Def of apartheid- a policy or system of segregation or discrimination on grounds of race.
does this describe IS?
And just who are you blaming for the " incitement "  you back bitting loser ?
Sacrilege!  You didn't say "Radical Islamic Terrorist."
yes, it is horrific. Equally horrific is your sanctimonious tweet, you feckless charlatan. This isn't about condolences for you.
The "incitement"...they kill to kill...that is their "incitement"
