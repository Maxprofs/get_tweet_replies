Every time you overhear someone calling you “little Marco," I hope reality sets in.
I'm hoping Marco rolls his eyes and thinks "ick, liberals" and feels encouraged like most of us @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump
I hope you roll your  when there's no money to pay for this . Marco's a coward
Nah, just the "little Marco"  @TheRyanParker @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump
Well @realDonaldTrump gave him the nickname and he's earned it. Coward and doesn't show up for work!
Uh huh lol @TheRyanParker @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump
that's typical I hit you with nothing but facts and all you can say is LOL uh huh
"..coward..earned it..didn't show up" .. All opinion. Learn what facts are. @TheRyanParker @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump
because he didn't insult people this time doesn't mean it was a good speech. #standardsarelow #sellout
see how low we have set our standards. Maybe that was the plan all along.
thats what Im thinking.  Meanwhile he robs or puts us in war. Thats how cons r pulled #donthecon
@michael_cacio @realDonaldTrump Easy to do when the bar is set so low!!!
Thank you for finally supporting & not fighting against him
Right, reading made up stuff on the TelePrompTer changed the country? AND how long did this last?? Just > lies
I gave a better speech than @realDonaldTrump to my littler box last night #catpoop #resist
Hurray! He managed to speak in sentences! #doyouwantacookie?
Full sentences at that but the funky breathing was annoying!
hey, what about @realDonaldTrump and your ties to Russian money. The Russians have your email and you know it.
, words are empty if they are not reflected in policy.  So far, policy is cruel and inept.
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump 51 lies in 60 minutes, Little Marco.
Ooh! Let's everybody clap, clap, CLAP! We heard pretty words!
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump because he can read does not make him presidential! #PutinsPuppet
So they served Koolaid again?
Nobody denies he had a way with words. Next step is his actions.
Until or unless we are given reason to trust his word, we will judge President Trump based on his actions. #JointAddress
Marco.

Polo.
really? Sounded like a 4th grader reading a report he didn't write, low low bar
Why isn't his nominee's & agenda getting pushed thru Senate? Get tough, get it done w/out Dem's
@nytimes @cnn @FullFrontalSamB @StephenAtHome Oh Marco,why don't you suck his tiny hands too? SAD!
and then he Tweeted
what happened?
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Try reading the speech. It was contradictory and very very thin (if it existed) on detail.
just missing #EmbassyMove
alas it lasted less than 24 hours. And with a low bar set too.
.@marcorubio Low bar, don't you think, Lil Marco?
Like all former NEVER TRUMP GOP  cronies, Little Marco has come crawling back on hands and knees. Such a FL phony.
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump actually what we need to hear is "we're investigate his ties to Putin."   Standing by...
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Marco do wake up!
A ;little bit late. he must taken some drugs to keep him so calm because he blew it a few days later!!
he repeats same speech word 4 word in every venue to brainwash the masses. Old techniques  of brainwashing!
Senator he called you "lil" Marco? DJT is unfit to lead; He's hurting NATO, investigation?
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Using a grieving wife as a prop and the 10 minute applause ...cause that's what matters...the best!
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump you saying he is presidential sounds like you're trying to convince yourself he is. U know he's not
Speaking in complete sentences; telling multiple lies & fear mongering. You've set the bar very low Marco
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump he read off a Teleprompter, actions speak louder than words. You know that
Too bad he didn't adopt the same tone at the #Inauguration. Let's see what happens next. #NotConvinced
Little Marco how does Trump taste?  You swallow right?
not what country needed 2 hear. What GOP wantd 2 hear. Remember, DT LOST popular vote. Approval ratings abysmal
Yeah but his latest stunts TRUMPED his speech. He's a horrible man and President. Plz keep him in check.
that was a once in a lifetime moment.
Yes we def needed to hear about new bogus immigrant crime office—right out of Hitler's playbook—to help build DTs hate movement
Shame on you, Senator Rubio.
lol remember when he called you Little Marco?
I think it's because Dems dwell on petty stuff and throw stones when the don't win. When Liberals...
..are your opponents anyway, you learn to ignore petty names, and move on.
Thanks, Little Cary!
Considering the source,,, moving on.
OK, bye, Little Baby Cary!
I agree with you. Also glad you are in the Senate to help guide him.
I remain completely dissatisfied and disappointed with the current administration. I have never seen this beautiful country more divided.
@jaketapper @pattonoswalt This like congratulating JeffreyDahmer for going a whole day w/o killing anyone.
Little @marcorubio Admit that philosophically you think it's better that people die than government provide or support healthcare.
Rubio "says MAN;; Trump is a GREAT CON MAN. I am TRULY jealous"
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump reading a speech does not make one presidential. You guys are pathetic.
good speech,but he took some of Obama's infrastructure plan u voted against. Ur still little Marco.
boot licker. OJ read a speech from a  speechwriter to parole board and  he's now a free man doing good!
Actions speak louder than words, remember? he is a fake
That presidential feeling didn't last long did it?! Lots of news this week. @marcorubio What are you thinking?
Ha = proved that he can read others words and stay on track for once.  Policies  against the people & chilling
One hour of mediocre reading of Ivanka's words from a teleprompter vs approx. 959 hours of 'decidedly not Presidential'? Sad!
The speech may have been "presidential". When will the man become so?
No-speech he needed to give & country needed to hear was his resignation.
DO YOUR DAMNED JOB & INVESTIGATE HIM
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump it showed he is able to read a bit but he still told many lies and people see through that
Rubio u Coward, Trump walks u around the White House lawn on a dog leash.  U make me puke!
Trump Golden Showers Republicans Daily!Whatever GOP can do to OPPRESS is more important
Exactly!
Things are a little different today, 3/20/17, eh? @POTUS should have given up #Twitter and talking for #Lent
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Now we can go back to the clusterfucking mess we were busy with.
@msoto2930 @marcorubio @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Let's not confuse things, trump read in soothing tone, words off prompter!
Seriously? He actually went 1 Hr without acting like a clown. That doesn't make him presidential.
Just wait until tonight. Crow tastes delicious I am told.
the bar is set really low for him. One basic speech does not make him suddenly presidential.
Your standards has gone down the tube, Mario.
Shame he's still a racist, sexist, unintelligent, corrupt piece of work.
ES TAN HERMOSA CUANDO LA USAMOS PARA BENDECIR LA 
FAMILIA DAR APOYO SALUDAR REIR...
The only thing he has accomplished thus far. Reading a well written speech. 
@Matt75125563 Thats why we voted for him...next
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Don't you mean the best speech he's ever READ from a teleprompter. #SAD
Who wrote it? Only reason he acted reasonable is because getting so much push back!
I agree. Continue to use your influence as much as is possible.
except for all the lies.  But, who cares about that.  You don't.
that's right Mr. Rubio, now you guys can concentrate on repealing and replacing Obamacare
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump 75 minutes does not make a president. His actions in last 6 weeks say  otherwise. Wise up, MR.
It was a 70 year old man with extreme narcisism who read off a Teleprompter without screwing it up. Same hate
How much were you paid to say that? Do your job.
Obama spent more than bush did for the war , and have nothing to so for it then a militarized me, Africa, Asia
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Exploiting that Widows grief was despicable.
Don't worry Marco we heard him a long time ago. Now get to work
y'all aren't real.
Too bad he 1) didn't write it; 2) didn't believe it; and 3) won't follow through. We're not stupid.
we already know you are a self serving opportunist, so you can stop digging now
The bar was low. If he'd done it in belch-speak, it would have been an improvement.
it was awesome. Who was the screenwriter?  That was quite a performance. Provided quite an escape from reality!
what's a matter Rubio , you rather kill seniors than foreigners, in eight years Medicare has taken a hit
that's a pretty low bar considering the rambling incoherent speeches he's known for.
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump which means Hillary was right - he is not always presidential.
Little @marcorubio, @realDonaldTrump hates you and America. One nkt awful speech does not = good president. #Resist #Persist
i wouldnt give #OrangeMussolini two seconds on my tv!!!! #IMPEACHTHISNUTJOB
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump he was barely able to read, so yes, it was his best. Presidential?? Impossible.
Terrific, another cowardly tweet re: @realDonaldTrump? NOT what this country needs to hear. Thanks for nada. #HistoryRemembers
are you deluded?! Same vile human being using some good words that someone else wrote.
I did not need to hear the lie that my people are murderers. #asshole
So now base competence at reading off Teleprompter makes someone presidential? Wow, bar is set reeeal low for 45.
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump thirsty Lil Marco?
really is the same thing he's been saying forever. It just had a different tone. #buttkisser
Yes, so impressive; no name calling, no insults, minimal defaming (well... just a little).
Little Marco it was just a speech - and you are still a coward afraid of the big bad constituent!!!
amazing what he sounds like reading someone else words they wrote for him vs his own press conf/twitter rants
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump words alone shouldn't sway anyone, judge Trump by his actions. Anyone can read a speech.
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump lil Marco, kiss ass, shill, liar. He read words. Off a TelePrompTer. Lil Marco
you're just kissing his rear
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump "best speech @realDonaldTrump has ever given"="hey, look, he's the tallest Munchkin"
Actually what we need to hear is Marco's, @SenJohnMcCain, @SenateMajLdr ties to Russia. We know they are there
he managed not to have a tantrum. Very presidential indeed. Mr. Trump is tremendous, eh, #LittleMarco? Kiss ass
you are ignorant just like your boss
sure as hell he didn't write it.
If you think reading a speech that was written for him poorly and slowly a good speech! He's clearly illiterate
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump putting the little back in Little Marco.
Yep, get in the line to fall off the cliff with the rest of the lemmings Rubio.  Party before Country.
douche bag says what?
except for the fake facts
that's like congratulating Lizzie Borden for not axing her parents more times.
@cravennewworld @marcorubio
oh Marco you know better than that. We will wrap him around your neck. Dont forget.
lo que no me gusta de Trump es q coloca a todos los inmigrantes como delincuentes y no es así. 1/2
okay sure. Remember you are still lil' Marco to him
I hope you move your children out of Miami so your great-grandchildren aren't porn there when Miami is underwater in 200 years.
Great.  Still doesn't change the fact he's rolling back civil rights and enviro protections left and right.
Actions speak louder than words Marco. All Trump ever does is spew lies. Narcissists dont care! @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump
are you going to support the nazi like dept of crimes committed by immigrants? Hitler had one too...just saying
With the exception of taking responsibility for Capt. ‘Ryan’ Owens death during a failed raid. Sad!
and you are at best marginal in your thinking- hopefully you can be rounded up and sent somewhere anywhere - ass kisser!
it contradicted SO MUCH of what he said on Fox THAT MORNING!  #RUSSIA #russianhacking
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump it's rather sad when everyone is excited that he sounds Presidential! Low bar!
coward
please do all you can do to urge your Dem colleagues to come to the table and work to #MAGA
I will support Trump when he delivers on Small Govt, Liberty, Conservatism & rebuilds Military
he'll need support to do those things
so sad that you even have to tweet this. First President that we judge on not being Presidential.
Way to really lick some boot, Marco!
1 investigate Russia 2 halt hate crimes 3 release taxes 4 divest conflict interest ... #3285 read TelePrompter
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump you know he can't get you re-elected? You spent a week avoiding the ones who can. People remember.
what are the healthcare details?
It was pablum for the masses and gullible.
how long has it taken him to act adult like? Long way to go for presidential like. Long way.
Maybe you're right, but "best speech" is meaningless. Simply put, what the country needs to hear is the truth
So you're supporting the American Gestapo "VOICE"? You're supporting TAX DOLLARS to go to RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS?
The Russian installed puppet read bullshit from a teleprompter. Are you OK w/treason?
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Really I thought he sucked....He was still too stiff and looks like he is reading.
Awww Lil Marco is so adorable
"Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action #RobotRubio"
doesn't erase at the hateful and terrible things he's said and done.
@Fahrenthold Yes successfully lowered bar 2 where not mentioning Apprentice ratings or calling the IC names b4 C is celebrated.
 #WagTheDog
lil Marco, let's not forget the pussygrabbing, mocking the disabled, hate filled speeches. Now he has a writer
Recusal is not enough. Sessions should resign. Who is next? Steve Bannon?
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Thank God he didn't write it himself.
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump nope... just nope.
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump
Are you in the Russia mess too?  Time will tell.
Why does it seem all you Rs got together and agreed to push the "presidential" idea? He's not. He never will be
@SenRubioPress @realDonaldTrump The bar wasn't very high.
Not throwing a tantrum is now the bar we set for Presidential? He said nothing of substance.
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump lol
when are you going to hold a town meeting in Florida marco? you know, the state you're representing
he sounded better sure but still some scary crap in it. "Access to healthcare", voice
the speech was presidential. That does not make him presidential.At least u are able to drink water with 1 hand
You Are A Bought Traitor. U lied To Florida. And you sold yourself To 45. You Are A disappointment to FlA Marco
As a son of immigrants, you should be ashamed! Do you approve of VOICE? This will lead us into darker times.
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump such bravery little Marco - still in hiding?
@tempteststorm2 We r counting on u 4 Cuban People. They should b 1st in line as refugees. Suffer much. Wet Dry
except it was all lies!!!
then why every time the camera was on you, you looked like somebody pooped in your oatmeal?
It definitely was, but not his words or sentiments. Has he ever talked eloquently.....nope
