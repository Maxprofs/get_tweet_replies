@marcorubio People having health insurance is a bad thing?
@sadoffeli @marcorubio there are no more people covered than before, and the cost is escalating. Wait another year and see what happens.
@georgecarl1955 @marcorubio My health insurance costs went down a lot. Obamacare has been considered a success by economists from both sides
@sadoffeli @marcorubio mine didn't go down. I honestly don't know anyone whose did. Is that b/c of a subsidy?
@georgecarl1955 @marcorubio it was because of a subsidy for mine. I know with ACA your mileage may vary but it's helped for me personally.
@sadoffeli @marcorubio the subsidies are a problem. I'm all for healthcare. There is no way to pay for the subsidies for everyone.
@georgecarl1955 @sadoffeli @marcorubio NOBODY'S WORK MERITS BILLIONS they must pay taxes, our capigalism is broken and we ruined the planet.
@mastergame @georgecarl1955 @marcorubio I would disagree with the idea that no one's work merits billions. I think jobs like that exist.
@ggonzalez03 @marcorubio Do Republicans think if we elect a GOP president he/she will be dictator who can end laws by fiat?
@marcorubio @cgpb  Why hasn't the GOP congress repealed Obama care?
@Artmoves1 The House has voted 54 times in four years on Obamacare. Here’s the full list.
@cgpb This year was the first time they have had control of congress.So your telling me the previous 53 times voted  was for image building?
@Artmoves1 no point repeating ad nauseam what Obama will veto. Only hope was scotus. They Twice bamboozled us. We wait, we repeal & replace
@marcorubio @JBRichard50 Sadly the Republican Party, after becoming the majority in both houses, had done nothing to stop this law.
@marcorubio And you lousy Republicans did nothing to stop it because you didn't want to. You all suck. The whole 535 of you.
@marcorubio Isn't it ironic how socialism reflects no up-front socializing.. since they needed "to pass the law to find out what's in it"..
@marcorubio And yet you have no alternative.
@marcorubio @precint13 Marco, you'd better fix it.
@marcorubio @JebBush @TheFix same sex marriage is the LAW so if you support the courts you also have to support Obamacare Law. SAY CONUNDRUM
@marcorubio You have to be joking. If not for ACA my family would not have coverage. You're the male version of Sara Palin. #NeverbPresident
@marcorubio PROVE the ACA is "still a bad law that is having a negative impact on our country and on millions of Americans.” With facts.
@marcorubio From one Latino to another, I disagree. If you don't like this law, why can't your party fix it??
@marcorubio Why SPECIFICALLY is #ACA a bad law?
@marcorubio showing just how incredibly out of touch you are, grow a brain cell the one is lonely.
@marcorubio @anamargaritam No es cierto, por eso yo voy a votar por Demócratas ahora mas personas tienen acceso a la salud, ente ellas YO.
@marcorubio You're having a negative impact on our country, dope.
@marcorubio @hrkbenowen So Senator we want to know what is your plan to fix this train wreck called Obamacare? It's ruining the country.
@marcorubio @hrkbenowen then do something about it. Words mean little anymore
@marcorubio preaching to your own choir won't win the presidency. Especially since so many have benefitted from the ACA
@marcorubio
@marcorubio Go Phuuck yourself you GOP puppet.
@marcorubio But what are we doing about it. Republicans are not fighting hard enough against this non sense.
@marcorubio john Roberts is another disappointment of Bush #2.
@marcorubio no it's not. More people have health care than before.
@marcorubio Still trying to wrong good things. Why do you & so many others sit by the unfair child support enforcement of caring fathers?
@marcorubio I pay $450 a month in health insurance and I go to the Dr. Twice a year @20 bucks a visit where does the other $5360 go? Anyone!
@marcorubio @TeamMarco When you get the job  #POTUS President of US YOU can do something about it! Many have tried but you can do it! #Faith
@marcorubio you had 800 symbolic votes to overturn it, now with the majority, republicans are gutless
@marcorubio You apparently don't know the millions of individuals who have been saved by the ACA.  Stop wasting tax $ trying to take it away
@marcorubio @StupidBoomers American government is useless. No checks and balances. Facilitators in treason. Criminals&Cowards.#putuporshutup
@marcorubio Some real information would be nice and not just regurgitating Faux News Talking Points - which suck btw.
@marcorubio No, the rich and their loop holes are having a negative impact on our country!
@marcorubio Yes, 6 million American's can't be wrong.
@marcorubio I know! All my friends with pre-existing conditions now have access to care & won't go bankrupt! TERRIBLE!!!
@marcorubio Then come up with something better and offer it to the American people to vote on. May the best plan win.
@marcorubio Trust us, we get it that Republicans will NEVER care about the nation's poor and middle class. U just don't get it, never will.
@marcorubio @StupidBoomers 

What's the matter? Didn't their bribe match the one for your ObamaTrade vote? 
STICK IT you #PoliticalWhore !
@marcorubio my premium went up over 30% this year bc of Obamacare... Makes it incredibly hard to save for a family
@marcorubio Maybe we should take away your FEHBP plan and see what you would do?
@marcorubio Can you articulate HOW it is having a negative impact? And why is universal health care a bad thing?
@marcorubio @bayes46  Rubio logic Obamacare bad Obamatrade good?? LOL
@marcorubio  then make it better not repeal it
@marcorubio troll much?
@marcorubio Most adorable Twitter tantrum of the day! Today's nap is well-earned, slugger.
@marcorubio numbers say otherwise, but i suppose you wouldn't know about that. #Arithmetic
@marcorubio you are having a negative impact on our country and millions of Americans...#shitforbrains
@marcorubio Showing your ignorance again!  ACA has insured millions and bent the "cost curve" down. Shame on your demagoguery!
@marcorubio
@marcorubio Millions more covered, affordable, improved coverage.  Where's the negative? GOP just talks, never suggests improvements.
@marcorubio lololol dim bulb
@marcorubio No it isn't!  Can you please stop lying!
@marcorubio economy is growing, more people at work and more people have health care coverage. You've got nothing!
@marcorubio Actually that is not true. Could be a lot better. Work on National Health Insurance!
@marcorubio How so?  Millions are benefiting and costs are going down.  Repeating a lie many times does not make it a truth.
@marcorubio @EthanDemme No it's not.
@marcorubio Unfortunately, it became a bad law due to concessions to commerce. The way to prevent forced purchases is federal-budgeted svcs.
@Snapai @marcorubio  i saw the stuff on the tax return forms... Was kinda terrible looking. I was ready to put my union's and Medicare info.
@marcorubio Without "Obama Care", we'd be planning my Mom's last days. She has cancer. She can't afford other healthcare. ACA HELPS HER!!!
@marcorubio how are you going to propagate that the #ACA is negatively effecting millions when it is clearly HELPING millions of Americans?
@marcorubio fucking moron. Look at the figures. EVERYTHING in the economy is improving
@marcorubio You're right. We must have people get sick and die. That's in the GOP platform, isn't it?
@marcorubio good one, #NOT!
@marcorubio course, no big deal that millions are better off eh?
@marcorubio Yea i'm sure those millions of americans that now have health care coverage for the 1st time are bummed
@marcorubio the only "negative impact on..millions of Americans" would have occurred if they'd voted against the ACA. This is a win for all!
@marcorubio My son now has affordable health care, what's your plan for his health care? U don't have one do you?
@marcorubio you are a bad lawmaker having a negative impact on millions of Americans
@marcorubio Will you please share with me your understanding of bad loser?
@marcorubio you are out of touch with America today. Pandering to your base will not get you elected in this country!!
@marcorubio -- 67 times GOP tried... just give up... Supreme Court has spoken!!!!
@marcorubio how can you say it is a bad law? Being sick and uninsured is no picnic. Why is it that you don't want health insurance for us.
@marcorubio are u brain dead   Or just flat out ignorant born in Miami long before you got there
@marcorubio no it's not get over it and you will never POTUS   Crook
@marcorubio Maybe the congressmen/congresswomen should have to buy insurance on their own instead of getting subsidized?
@marcorubio @Norsu2 . Thanks, Capt Obvious. Why did you guys vote to FUND the damn thing!
@marcorubio Repubs have yet 2realize the futility of their fight 2day against #ACA.  Looking forward 2 their 2016 campaigns agnst it.
@marcorubio Are you really this ignorant?
@marcorubio Agree!  Obamacare is a HORRIBLE law for the insurance industry & its investors.  GOOD!
@marcorubio ha ha ha get over it it's here to stay
@marcorubio @Norsu2 So do your job and fix it! So tired of listening to GOP whining and doing nothing! You have both houses!
@marcorubio NO. You're wrong.
@marcorubio what an unbelievable asshole you are to say that. MILLIONS of Americans covered, and you say that's a bad thing #RepubAsshole
@marcorubio 

So you're mad that the Court didn't take away the subsidies you were afraid yesterday people would lose?
@marcorubio @abitx2u Marco you support TPP or whatever it is called now, and didn't read it. That's no better than Pelosi or SCOTUS decision
@marcorubio how is health care a bad thing?
@marcorubio What color is the sky on your planet, Senator? #ACA#Obamacare #SCOTUS
@marcorubio YOUR COMPATRIOTES CUBA AMONG POOREST COUNTRY IN THE WOLRD < FREE HEALTH CARE >
@marcorubio Can you tell us what was wrong with decision?Do you even know which issues were being litigated or are you making shit up again?
@marcorubio SCOTUS has spoken. Stop wasting tax payers money by continuously fighting the ACA!
@marcorubio i wish canada had obamacare :( owait
@marcorubio @TheRickWilson If it is true that we get the government we deserve, we have been very, very bad.
@marcorubio The percentage of uninsured is now 11.9% (down from 18% in '13). Repeal would add $353 billion to deficit
@marcorubio So, it seems that in addition to not being a scientist, you are also not an actuary or a mathematician. http://jaybookman.blog.ajc.com/2015/06/23/cbo-repealing-obamacare-would-make-the-deficit-soar/ …
@marcorubio wrong again, dopey
@marcorubio what negative effect is that exactly?
@marcorubio Funny how you forgot all the gov't goodies your family got once they fled Cuba.
@marcorubio look up Texas v White it defined 'the state' now this ruling overrules that case and it has serious consequences
@marcorubio #Obamacare has now killed my personal health insurance TWICE !!!
@marcorubio Our ins was $25/50 copay. Now 50/50 payment. How did this help working legal Americans?
@marcorubio YOU ARE SUCH A STEREOTYPICAL GOP TALKING POINT.  YOU CLEARLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE.
@marcorubio @SheNeededMusic I wonder which America he is looking at.  LoL
@DJ81 @marcorubio This America. ObamaCare is trash.
@SheNeededMusic @marcorubio that's not a specific complaint.  Forcing people to be covered or be penalized is a better complaint.
@DJ81 You didn't ask for a complaint. You asked which America he was referring to. Either way, you answered your own question.
@SheNeededMusic i know what i said.  I was merely commenting on your general dislike for a law w/o specifics. Just saying.
@marcorubio I guess your plan is to take the Health Insurance away from the millions who gained it via #ObamaCare?  THAT should work great!
@marcorubio GET OVER IT !!! You're starting to sound like a broken record !!!
@marcorubio ...but it isn't. Just graduated with a Communication B.A. in May and you know what? Medicaid is a great thing.
@marcorubio nope its a great thing.
@marcorubio @Patriotvnvet Says the fool who just voted to fast track TPA
@marcorubio I agree that it's far from what we desperately need in this Country. It's 2015, we shouldn't have people without healthcare.
@marcorubio if you'd said that to us in the UK, we'd laugh at you.
@marcorubio maybe it's time for another meaningless symbolic vote to repeal? Then off to fundraise! #gopfail
@marcorubio why?? Give me a reason
@marcorubio . Can we depend on politicians to repeal it? Not the current Repubs.
@marcorubio You are wrong. This nation needs to insure everyone has access to health care.  ACA beats the GOP plan... Is there a plan? #Fail
@marcorubio find me the negative impact? I keep looking for it and can't seem to find one
@marcorubio you mean like the Secret  Obama Trade "Law" you Voted for without Reading, No POTUS for you!!
@marcorubio Are you delusional?
@marcorubio ACA doubled my premium and co-pays while my deductible went from $300 to $1000.
@marcorubio ALSO a positive effect on Millions of Americans. So what is your plan?
Talk is cheap Senator.
@marcorubio then u turn around and vote for Obamatrade which is going to be as bad a law if not worse. Guess your votes follow the flow of $
@marcorubio so what are you going to do about? Probably just bemoan it with the rest of the paralyzed GOP
@marcorubio moron!!!! You have nothing!!!
@marcorubio - your lost your conservative card yesterday on the trade vote, dude.  The ACA is similarly a corporate (medical sector)giveaway
@marcorubio by negative effects, you mean the millions covered and the greater millions saved on premiums right? Thank for playing.
@fargolawyer @marcorubio: If you believe that millions saved lie then maybe you need to look a little deeper. You obviously have no idea.
@PCBasher @marcorubio I deal with people saving on insurance for their families daily.  It has gotten better.
@fargolawyer @marcorubio: I deal with people who had their premiums go up. Some as much as 50% and are looking at another increase.
@PCBasher @marcorubio where are you at? We have pretty decent companies up here.  Most didn't have cut rate plans before in this area.
@marcorubio absolutely true
@marcorubio @WordsOfSarah NOPE
@DCBeerBill FYI: RT was for the record, not endorsement
@WordsOfSarah I don't believe you. You strike me as a pretty ardent Rubio supporter. I can't be fooled so easily.
@DCBeerBill I'm an ardent supporter of the Democratic process :)
@marcorubio what Americans are you talking to?
@marcorubio stfu bruh
@marcorubio Written by insurance companies for insurance companies
@rnw101563 @marcorubio Rubio wants to give the power back to the insurance companies, the insurance industry spent millions on defeating law
@_pascuzzo @marcorubio The ole I was for it publicly but was against it in the background routine :-D Hmmmm..very shrewd
@rnw101563 @marcorubio Rubio will never be president he comes across as a petulant child.
@marcorubio I disagree. It might not be a perfect law, but it's a very good start
@marcorubio nah.
