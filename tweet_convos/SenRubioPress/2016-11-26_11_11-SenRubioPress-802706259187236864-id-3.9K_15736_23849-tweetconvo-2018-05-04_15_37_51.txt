Statement by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the death of former Cuban President Fidel Castro:  http://ow.ly/5oUS306xx4A 
 has been supporting the Cuban people for yrs. Also, google Castro and Trudeau. Educate yourself b4 asking stupid questions.
@jjauthor @CanadianPM Is an embarrassment to Canadians. I want you to know, he is not speaking for all of us.
@BillKristol @CanadianPM such tiny hands Marco!
@CanadianPM Ahora vienes a sacar cara por los cubanos? Shame on you Rubio... No sirves
@ladylibertas76 Birds of a feather...socialism is just communism-light. Not surprising that Trudeau and other lefties loved him
like father like son
@ChrisCuomo @CanadianPM And yet you support trump and all his hate filled followers like Bannon, Duke etc. Just saying
@CanadianPM It's Canada bro. They're a parody of a country.
and remember... we'll always be on top bitch! BTW..... I'd say your new Prez is the real parody!
Must be nice to not have to invest in defense because we protect you.
I'm a rank and file member of Justin's Liberal party. I agree with you 100%
welcome to our nightmare.
@lraitt @DianneLWatts @BobSaroya @AlexNuttallMP Sadly not even @TheOnion could've written something this pathetic
@CanadianPM as a Canadian I agree...BUT you need only to look at your county to see the definition of shameful & embarrassing!
you should be ashamed of representing America
The smart Canadians are embarrassed by the photo addicted Trudeau.  I am ashamed that he is our Prime Mininster.
@cstockwell_s Mr. Rubio doesn't follow Canadian politics obviously.   Justin is just following in his father's footsteps.
@CanadianPM What about @realDonaldTrump praise of Vladimir Putin? #doublestandard
Can. relation with Cuba was intact even during the embargo. Don't see how 2 defeat communism by punishing the people.
Please remember that PM Tater Tot does not speak for the vast majority of Canadians.
Little Marco pretended to be tough to Trump, but then bent the knew like a bullied child the second Trump got power, coward!
Maybe you should check with Canadians.  We respect Castro, because he was a man of the people and not the rich. Stick to #losing
Seriously? Trump's lovefest with Putin should get you more upset.
you're pretty embarrassing to our country
, I just wish the Canadian prime minister had a twin brother, that could be our president. I know it's not possible.
What's shameful is you sucking Trumps balls.
@WinnaWinna2016 this is disgusting.  He was a DICTATOR-he hurt his ppl period.
@CanadianPM What do you expect from a country which legalized beastiality?!
@CanadianPM "Little Marco Rubio is just another D.C. politician tht is all talk & no action #RobotRubio” #vivaFidel #FidelCastro
@mdubowitz @CanadianPM Not sure a US Senator should be publicly critical of Canadian PM like this. The old norms are falling.

Congresswoman condemns prime minister of Canada statement 
He's joking, right? Or maybe delusional?
@CanadianPM you are shameful and a poor excuse for a patriot,where is your Pride,stop hiding behind the GOP wall#theydespiseyou
i apologies for our scumbag of prime minister...
@therealcuba Absolutely right. Unfortunately, this is a real statement, though unbelievable. Shameful is the least we can say...
Conservatives in Canada are still embarrassed by this.  It won't be forgotten in the 2019 election.
@tstewart666 No joke. That's our National embarrassment.....
super glad you found something to get all self-righteously worked up about, man
Right because I am sure you are living in Cuba under those same conditions right?
For once, Little Marco is right. @marcorubio
Okay we get it. Move on please.
The point needs to be made @marcorubio
which point is that?
Canadian PM releasing an embarrassing statement that looks more like a parody @marcorubio
I guess - but is Rubio the guy to make this point?
Are you aware of his history?  Stance on Cuba?  Yes, he's the guy to make the point.
I get the history but shouldn't that make him more influential in the advancement of Americans / immigrants / the oppressed?
I'll let you know after the Michigan game.
@CanadianPM I can understand @JustinTrudeau being diplomatic but that statement is waaaay too kind. Castro was DEPLORABLE. 
so true #Monster
The real embarrassment is all those Cuban-Americans voting for Trump who is a racist and a bigot so  don't lecture other people.
Hillary supporters such as yourself are unethical w/no morals values who supports corruption.
Leaves one wondering what planet the PM of Canada lives on???
So glad U are finally "embarrassed" by something as yr own actions bring shame on us ALL. ERA is NOT outdated!
.@marcorubio Stay in your lane, seriously. You can't even stand up to the "leader" of your party, & now you think you can admonish a PM?
Mr. Rubio, do not pretend to know what is "shameful & embarrassing".  PM Trudeau is a Statesman and a gentleman.
I'd must rather have my Prime Minister than you soon to be joke of a President!
most Americans are thinking the same  why are we stuck with idiots like Marco Rubio, Trump, Ted Cruz 
I think Marco Rubio is more qualified to judge issues regarding Castro’s Cuba than Canadians.
Yes! It is and as a Canadian I support my #PM.  Now, let's discuss your #shameful  #embarrassing & #revolting act shall we?
which was? If you say Trump, please provide data vs irrational Canadian emotion. I don't care how you feel, I care about facts.
This is a FACT... Mr. Marco Rubio used Vancouver Canada's Skyline in his Campaign.
So ironic that black people fawn over Fidel Castro. Castro referred to Cuban Pres.Batista as "negro de mierda"="shitty nigger" 
Everything you talk about is CUBA. GO back to CUBA and make it great again. WHY can't you stop ISIS?? TRAITOR for NOT voting REX
@CanadianPM I'll never visit Canada.
and we thank you for it
What follows are excerpts from real article by Trudeau's brother & snr advisor, TorStar, Aug 13, 2006, pg A4 #TrudeauEulogies cc @marcorubio
Wow. The Trudeau's are complete Castro butt-munchers!
It's real. AND a disgrace. In NO WAY does it represent what Most CDNs thk or feel about this repressive monster. #embarrassed
well said.  I'm a Canadian. Appalled at his comment but not surprised. Brainless!  A disgrace to our country.
he praised Cuba's capacity 2educate, house, guarantee healthcare, +basics 4all Cubans: beyond @marcorubio 's capacity/desire
You obviously have never been to Cuba, nor are you aware of the situation Cubans actually live in.

If you look into Cubans' living conditions, you'll get why praising Castro is nearly sinful.
@bcbluecon sadly it's real. Absolute embarrassment for Canadian people
You don't speak for all Canadians, Gerry. I am proud of our PM and have no problem with his statement.
if you compare both you have to admit Harper's about 90% less effusive
The bottom line is that the PM's statement was perfectly fine, and you shouldn't make pronouncements about what Canadians think
If you want to get all righteous about Castro, your $15B weapons deal with the Saudis is a rather large elephant in the room.
you mean the preliminary deal that the Libs completed?
Yes, that's the one.
I'm not the one trying to claim the PM failed to stand up to a repressive regime (posthumously!) - You are.
.@marcorubio But being a jackass to a foreign leader isn't? Siddown Marco.
I'll take the word of a Cuban over a Canadian when it comes to the death of Castro.
the Cuban who lied about his Cuban parents today?
Or lied about from whom they were fleeing maybe? @MeanGreanHare @marcorubio
I don't know if you're a troll, or desperately wanted to suck Castro's dick.
@GarySadlemyer @CanadianPM Is this a story from the Onion?
@CanadianPM How pathetic is Rubio.  Lacks the basic empathy taught in all religions.  He needs to seek counseling.
Disgusting, but considering the source, hardly surprising!
@CanadianPM dont feel bad, this is what every pansy ass democrat in this country thinks but wont say.
worry about your own swamp nation
Real parody isn't TRUMP ? Another parody is your CIA, and their failed attempt to assassin FIDEL. Viva la Revolución.
this from the country that brought us waterboarding?  Go back to hiding under your rock.
@CanadianPM #canadian communist ties exposed, I want stricter northern border control
@CanadianPM If you paid attention to him you would have known I did
it's real check out #trudeaueulogies for Twitter reaction!
@CanadianPM Very well said, Senator. It's a sad day when brutal dictators are praised by supposed "leaders" of the free world.
@CanadianPM amen brother
@CanadianPM Perhaps you should build a northern wall as well, for safety's sake.
#Conservatives in #Canada wish that it were a parody & that #Trudeau as PM was simply a bad dream
I'm embarrassed to say that it is. Please don't take this as representative of Canadians. @JustinTrudeau is a not a leader #fool
@KellyannePolls @CanadianPM opinions opinions, no one cares
Keep reaching for that bottle you failure of a politician.
@CanadianPM sadly real and embarrassing
- I apologize on behalf of Canada for our idiot of a Prime Minister. But as you know, people sometimes elect the wrong person...
thank you sir for standing up for democracy againt a tryrannical communist distatorship and @CanadianPM for his lying statement
Fidel stood up against the USA for 60 years and can RIP tonight knowing he was victorious. That must chap your ass.
If its any consolation, the majority of Canadians didn't vote for him.
U are a little Pro-consul of the Empire PM Trudeau is not a lackey Canada Sovereign e Independent is not ur backyard Back Off
You're country will be governed by the BIGGEST "DICKtator" on this planet! Can't wait to see America crumble to pieces!
@shelliecorreia @CanadianPM 

Ya Marco, its pretty embarrassing.  You guys have Trump who slams Castro, us?, no,no, cant do that
@CanadianPM Trump is your ELECTED political leader and yet you're calling this statement embarrassing? LOLOL the USA is a joke.
@KellyannePolls You are shameful baby Marco! Put on big boy pants and go to work #absenteerecord
@CanadianPM  He sure does not speak for me or for I would say the vast majority of Canadians.  I Apologize, it's so shameful.
Just Plain Stupid  just like Obama
, the hypocritical lying little worm, puppet of death merchants, supporter of wars & killing, has the blind gall to say this?! FU
Yanno, the Canadians are preternaturally nice. And Trudeau is doing what ppl do everywhere when Uncle Joe dies. Speak well of em
Fugencio Batista's corruptions contributed to Castro successful revolution. Castro is a disaster.
What's embarrassing is that your country supports dictators around the world https://goo.gl/MHl2Ge  2/2
don't worry, he's just another MUPPET.
@PaulGregory2173 @CanadianPM Explains it all if his father was friends with this monster. Good luck to Canada...
A shame for us is little Marco now Donald's friend; Pierre was a personal friend of Fidel and Justin is his son.
Right On.
 Um...speaking of embarrassing.... #NotMyPresident #notmyTeam #notmyTeam
I'd never vote for Trudeau, but as pathetic as he is. I'm glad he's not the Republican John Edwards with a moronic lisp
@CanadianPM 
No todos piensan como tu.
La libertad d expresión q tanto presumen los Americanos no se te da para nada 
@CanadianPM #MarcoRubio America is with you on this #Cubans have been wronged greatly by #Castro
@CanadianPM Pray for Canada Marco our pm is an embarrassment
What is happening with these leaders and their praising of Fidel Castro anyway?Marco!
@CanadianPM Rubio, you're the worst,most embarrassing,shameful type of Cuban. A "salta para atrás". Show some respect. #RIPFidel
just to bad on your eyes are hanging clap coz its hard to think u could write such a tweet. thanks for what u did Mr Castro
Well gosh, @marcorubio - other than whining about @POTUS and @CanadianPM 's statements, what do you have to say about Castro's passing?
@CanadianPM Marco! When do you actually work for Florida? Put in a 40 hour week and you get an opinion.
@CanadianPM Truly sad & a display of the PM's ignorance & communist sympathy
Rubio...you're pro war, anti gay, anti social security for seniors, cut college loans for human sciences ... FACE IT. YOURE BAD
You have @DonaldTrump as your next prez.  Who really is shameful.  Went from "con man" to I'll endorse him in 2 sec flat.
@JustinTrudeau you are an embarrassment!
after he get the help and making false
of hongzhi li, get the benefit from hongzhi LI.

hongzhi LI has right to control him,
We have as PM what you had to deal with in Obama for last 8 horrific yrs. The US and the World has a second chance with Trump.
@SenRubioPress @CanadianPM I am still angry about the people in this world praising Castro. It's sickening
@CanadianPM you're shameful and embarrassing!
@Ben_S_Harper @CanadianPM so is this. http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2012/04/ten-things-you-need-know-about-marco-rubio …
Cuba was so much better off controled by mob and sugar companies. Castro is gone and historical...you're done and hysterical.
MARCO, STICK TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY.  CANADA IS FAR MORE CIVILIZE THAN YOURS.
you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that
@RitaPanahi @CanadianPM oooh Canada your in trouble with a radicalised leftie p.m,
Marco this is how gone the left is.  Lesson learned here, is the left is way worse off then you thought.
Tank you Rubio for being right on !!!!
@Jonathan_Witt Canada has nickel mining interests in Cuba. Been long time benefactors.
you're the man who actually implied the size of the now president-elect's was less than able during a campaign rally!
@CanadianPM  stop the negativity, I was hoping for you in the primaries but when yo went negative lost respect.
Go easy on him, it looks like he's mourning his father.
" Canada has the best fence in the world, AMERICA, it's foolproof if you can afford it" Daniel Tosh...
@CanadianPM it's call freedom of speech so don't be so concerned, and your statement about the Canadian PM only degrades you.
is a Marielito, of course he doesn't like the man who cleaned up Cuba from scumbags like Marco's parents! #HijoDePuta
@MaxBoot @CanadianPM It seems that Trump was the only international lifer that had the courage to speak the truth
maybe you should focus on getting back the country's respect after selling your soul to the devil #Trump
ok , but why doesn't anyone denounce Ronald Reagan, who sponsored/glorified the mass murder of communists around the world??
Having suffered first hand how crooked politicians make the poor poorer and the rich richer in a country that's a puppet of USA
@CanadianPM Rubio, we PAY u 4 this? Have u noticed who r president-elect is and how his racist hate speech is causing chaos here
Here's a parody RUbo marco of HRC & WJC Nov 10-
And how many millions did America murder chasing Weapons of Mass Destruction? Screw off hypocrite. A Canadian PROUD of Trudeau!
3/ of much more disgusting and shameful acts of barbarism and human rights abuses!
Trudeauks father also PM was friend
.@marcorubio @paulmeyer745 Agree the @CanadianPM dishonors the memory of every person Castro oppressed or killed
Thankfully, not ever politician shares your peculiar point of view, Little Marco.
@CHSommers @CanadianPM the usual crap from our prime mangina…
#trudeaueulogies
Republicans don't get to tell Cdns (@JustinTrudeau) what's shameful & embarrassing... Worry about your own problems.
hahaha... an american politician trying to make lessons to the world!
@mikegcraig @CanadianPM Hello pot, meet kettle
I have heard some Canadians echo your sentiment @marcorubio
and other family heroes..Che,  Chavez, the ayatollahs and Vichy French fascists.  Never forget
@CanadianPM Trudeau like Obama is a communist sympathizer!  Shame on them for complimenting a monster!
@CanadianPM taking a break from kissing Trump's ass are we?
Marco, he's the Northern Obama.  No brains, no morals, etc.
@BillKristol The GOP is shameful and beyond embarrassing. I would add dangerous and destabilizing. Afraid for our country.
@CanadianPM trump love Putin and Putin love Fidel. So stop hating at Canadian PM. You voted Trump. Remember?
P Trudeau was dead right to find regional partners to resist US domination. Castro beat crooked Nixon as a partner any day.
.@marcorubio @Ben_S_Harper @CanadianPM
You know what was "shameful and embarrassing?" Your performance as a senator and candidate, asshole.
@CanadianPM We should build a wall on the northern border just for that statement alone. Castro was pure evil.
@KrisParonto He is much like our POTUS. I pray he.does not attend or send anyone to attend the funeral services.
@Ben_S_Harper lol being taken to task by Rubio is beyond hilarious
I agree. It's right up there with you not carrying Florida in your Republican primary - shameful and embarrassing.
well we already know you were a huge Batista Dictatorship fan, Marco. #WhatElseIsNew?
What about guy who said: honor to be complimented by Putin who is so highly respected in Russia." (Trump)
DISCUSTING. I'M CANADIAN. @JustinTrudeau doesn't speak for the majority. We don't honor dictators, mass killers.
@CanadianPM yes Mr. Rubio, he is an embarrassment to Canada.  A shameful disgrace.
how many water bottles were filled with your sweat, while tweeting this? #Nestle #Dasani
"Fulgencio Batista murdered 20,000 Cubans in seven years ... and he turned Democratic Cuba into a complete police state—destroy
embarrassing only to sad haters.  Castro raised GDP more than any other Carrib Nation, raised literacy, addressed racism.  US?
It must be excused, because of the cold it happens to have frozen head in Canada
Marco who?
Please don't worrie about a dead Dictator worrie about your President elect praise a Living Dictator
@KellyannePolls @CanadianPM it is not shameful and embarrassing, I am proud of our Prime Minister JT!
@CanadianPM you mean shameful in the way trump made your campaign look? Oh the irony little marco
As a Canadian I am amused  Trump's Bitch telling My PM what to do!yeah anybody not listening to TrAmp just grab them by Pussii!
Is this a real statement or a parody? America voted Trump as president. Glass houses buddy, glass houses.
Statement true. Unfortunately  PM's the parody. And ya shameful & embarrassing.
Castro will be judged by God as we will be judged for allowing crazy narcissistic behavior in the Oval Office
