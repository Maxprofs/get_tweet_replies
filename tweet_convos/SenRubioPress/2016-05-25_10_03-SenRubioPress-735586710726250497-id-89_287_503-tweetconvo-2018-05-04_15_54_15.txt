@MiamiHerald Thank you Senator. Most Americans don't understand what a refugee is. As a FL resident I have seen massive abuse!
maybe, it would save money, but it wouldn't significantly decrease the deficit and it is very unfair to Cuban immigrants!
Why??  Why do the sneak and and feel like they deserve our money?
of course, only guys in southern small towns like Collierville,TN are deserving our money. it'll be good invested in it! /sarc-off
Its tax payer none,  not illegal immigrants money.  America 1st.
so, the man you admire is an illegal immigrant? doesn't he deserve taxpayer money? he gets plenty of bol paychecks from the gov
He's not illegal and not he doesn't deserve taxpayer money.  You earn pay checks, they aren't handouts.
2. who do you think is gonna pay the money Senators, Congress(wo)men, @Cabinet, @VP, the 2nd lady, @FLOTUS & @POTUS are earning?
Finally Get It Done #RepealCAA #EndSanctuaryCities #UniteTrump4Potus #NeverEverHillary #StandAloneKatesLaw
they will come via Mexico, is it possible you are figuring out we can not support Cubans, Mexican & Muslims in unending numbers?
... miserable apatrida!....is that how you pay back to the cuban community that supported you? ¿Do you work for the cuban gob.??
@MiamiHerald Muslim refugees r being registered to vote this November check it out
Says Mr. I got mine.
Read, Learn. Will make you sound much more credible.
As I said. Little Marco got his benefits. Now he wants to deny others the same privilege he was provided when he came to U.S.
Uh, he was born here.  He got  no privileges.  Nor did his parents. Like I said, Read. Learn.
Ok, how about all people from the Americans, or are you somehow thinking Cubans deserve different?
@sandiv11 The refugee resettlement industry is a huge drain on tax dollars, and many lie to gain entry. Read #AdiosAmerica.
No Refugee should be getting anything. IF they cannot contribute to America, they cannot be here. We have freeloaders of our own
but give #muslim #refugees thousands
great idea Marco, Miami just can't handle any more of this.
Sir you should request to investigate these claims.They 're receiving benefits &living in Cuba.Bringing the communism to
why do we owe them benefits?  US needs to stop these types of things and start taking care of our own.
no hay peor cuña que la del mismo palo. Represalia pk los cubanos de la FL no votaron por el. Miserable.
we give too much subsidy....when we have Suffering AMERICANS, VETS etc.  we struggle ourselves and GOV slaps us in the face
Interesting timing , now that Cubans you disagree with politically may be coming over you pull up the entitlement ?
please look up the definition of refugee. these benefits were for refugees. I live in FL. There's massive abuse!
Yeah, Floridians love him soooo much that he couldn't even win a third of the votes in his home state. #Loser
Worst of the worst turning against his own people and the rights he himself benefited from. Fucking hypocrite. #DoYourJob
What have they done to deserve my hard earned money, give him yours.
What if my money wasn't hard-earned but came quite easily?
Mine doesn't, most people who put in a full week would agree.
repealing the Cuban Adj Act of 66' will save millions! End the 50 years of "Open Borders" and get in line like everyone else!
this from a guy who can't manage his own debt and credit cards, thanks @realDonaldTrump, how funny. Hope you have pLan B!
@MiamiHerald Ppl not aware many Cubans return home & relatives  lforward their gov $$ to them.  Fraud costs US taxpayer millions
.@marcorubio wow u don't have a oz of decency do u now u support Trump u have no balls
How come if you want "to save money" to the US you don´t ask for a law stopping benefits to the african-americans too, Mr. Rubio
How much are paying you, the Castro´s regime, to attack the cuban community, Mr. Rubio?? Tell us the truth
@DCacoon @MiamiHerald  
+ YOU NEED TO ENDORSE TRUMP NO REASON NOT TO -NOW
as well as anchor babies and welfare for illegals! What other country supports non citizens! And better than our Veterans!!
#ISupportIsrael #ISupportRubio Because God is Real & so is He
I think if you come to this country it should be because you want to WORK for a better life and country-not for the free stuff!
@MiamiHerald really Marco are you saying that not using money to pay for stuff is simultaneously saving money? Dude!
thank you, those Cubans are a shady bunch:(
@MiamiHerald too bad they didn't pull this before your family came
Big feather if you can get that changed.
@MiamiHerald Marco, you are the one we need!
@MiamiHerald we should eliminate it for all. We need to help people where they are from not bring them here.
This needs to be ASAP.
So would not paying you a federal pension.
You have come a long way since gang of 8. Lil Marco is growing his balls now. Good job honey.
@MiamiHerald can we just elinate you instead?
@MiamiHerald Why do South Florida Cubans hate their own people so much?
Its not hate to cut off money they haven't earned?
, please remember that your brother is a Cuban immigrant and that your parents also migrated from there!
Senator Rubio, no refugee or immigrant should abuse the American people regardless where they are coming from.
Quite the humanitarian, you are.
IF ONLY THIS COULD BE ENFORCED FOR ALL NON-CITIZENS? IT MIGHT EVEN BE SOMETHING TRUMP WOULD SUPPORT?
At least someone can see that!
Maybe a silly question but why do immigrants get and benefits? Shouldn't that be the responsibility of the immigrant's sponsor?
- Okay Marco, now that is a great comment. Now,, get busy & get this craziness stopped !!!
@MiamiHerald and you wanted to be prez, Ur r weak, #noprez4u
@MiamiHerald Marco lil hands talks about u like a dog, u support him, Really, r u teaching Ur kids, get bullied,  but support em
@MiamiHerald Wow...! How did we allow this to happen? America feeds poor countries why steal from us?
le das la espalda a tu gente, tu cultura. La verdad que eres un ser humano sin principios ni valores humanos... #Lástima #hate
WE NEED GOD BACK IN CONTROL! 
I pray for God to be welcomed in all homes, school etc. Very sad to see how heartless WE became!
@MiamiHerald 
"se ahorrarían $ 2.45 mil millones en 10 años si los cubanos recién llegados a EEUU no se les dieran ayudas"
Of course. Anytime benefits are reduced money is saved. Water is wet, sky is blue.
The only benefit received by any refugee should be the benefit of being allowed into our country. That's where it needs to end.
@MiamiHerald  Also middle eastern immigrants.  #StopTheMadness
@MiamiHerald about time.
really, how much time and money was wasted to point out the obvious, I bet stopping all foreign aide would save money also
I think eliminating all the money for the Syrians muslims that Obama wants into the US would save MORE!
Et tu @marcorubio?
cubans come here and they get everything, an American single mother can't even get food stamps to feed her kid, justice?
@MiamiHerald illegals and refugees should never be given more than any US Citizen has. Help our own first!
@MiamiHerald agree!!!! It is wrong to open relations and travel, lift sanctions, and yet offer $$ to temporary 'refugees'.
@MiamiHerald   Private sector finance.....
@FinzZombie you a reporter now ?
You hiring?
hating on your own people to pander to the new people you work for? This isn't compassion or authenticity whatsoever.
It's not hate to do what's right for american taxpayers.  Our country is in debt up to its eyeballs.
What would really save U.S. $ is #MentalHealthReform! Please act now!! #YouAreNotAlone
@MiamiHerald says the guy who supported amnesty!
@johndlynch8:Savings are miniscule in the big picture!
I don't think your a bad guy, but this Is ludicrous
Cutting spending saves money, you don't say.
@MiamiHerald Now that we are normalizing relations this should be done.
.@marcorubio Eliminating automatic human benefits for Cubans would save U.S. money, report says #HumanCrisis
come back please!!!
@MiamiHerald little Marco
