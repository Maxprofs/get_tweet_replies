@marcorubio 
Have you no Shame? Cuban freedom fighter my ass.
@marcorubio Considering you've failed at everything else, no one will be surprised when you fail again.
@marcorubio A move to Draft Marco Rubio at the Convention after the 3rd Roll Call Vote. #DraftRubio
@marcorubio Marco we need you in the GOP fight against Trump. Christian conservatives need you! Partner with Ted.
@marcorubio what you are not running for another term? 
@marcorubio  I live in Fl supported you Twice /U would of been a great Pres/ You made a promise that Trump will not be nominee/ Back Cruz

@marcorubio join Trump
@marcorubio you should be joining Ted Cruz's presidential ticket as VP and finish your what you started
@marcorubio are you showing up for work and voting now? How about the committees, you attending those too?
@marcorubio Self Righteous Greedy Obstructionist Pirate
@marcorubio Do you plan to run for Any office?
@marcorubio @createtruespace Shared on http://LumpyNews.com 
@marcorubio  These are NOT "religious liberty" laws. They are nothing but hate & discrimination. What is wrong with you people??
@marcorubio  Why don't you partner with Trump & make a deal for Sec of State.  You'd be good at it, then run for prez in the future!
@marcorubio @Amarillotxsguy Don't worry Marco, After DT, TC, other, and/or Hillary destroy the US presidency, they will come begging for You
@marcorubio Do you see what's happening to this country you love? See what Colorado's corrupt GOP did? That's why we support Trump. Change.
@marcorubio @RightForRubio Such a great guy!  I truly hope we haven't seen the last of him in the political arena!  The US DOES NEED him!
@marcorubio @pessell_anna do you have any idea how depressing it is that you are leaving DC when we need you most.
@marnes @marcorubio @pessell_anna We have to keep hoping; with a 70% disapproval rating things are looking up
@marcorubio you should focus on being pretty, don't worry your pretty head about this sort of thing.
@marcorubio thank you and please please please when the time comes support  #TedCruz  we have to have a true #Constitutional Conservative !
@marcorubio looking forward to see you in Cleveland accepting nomination for Potus.
@marcorubio 
Hopefully Anticipating your presence at the convention in Ohio!
@marcorubio Thank you Sen. Rubio/President Rubio
@marcorubio 
Trump who is so out there like a psycho, yelling like a 5 year old. Write you're name in and in Cleveland you WIN
@marcorubio 
Writing you're name on the ballet. You still have more delegates than Kasich and you are way better than Canada ted and stupid
@marcorubio will you real release  your delegates for Cruz?
@marcorubio Marco have more delegates than  kasich
@marcorubio  Yeah kill them Marco, fist me harder daddy, shove your thick religous freedom up my tight little bussy daddy. #yas
@marcorubio that requires you to show up to work though
@marcorubio maybe you can start by doing your job
@marcorubio you concentrated more on Obama than what you will do for Americans. You were into repealing this and that. Still miss your balls
@marcorubio looking forward to seeing you out of the Senate and American Politics. You are the poster child for what not to do in government
@marcorubio Love you Marco! Get back in the race, we need a real President! http://OnlyMarco.com  #OnlyMarco
@marcorubio that sounds very "popular", but who are we "protecting religious liberty" from??? would that be our "Government"?
@marcorubio Are you actually going to start showing up at work?
@marcorubio GOOD. CRUZ WONT. AVOIDS SENATE JOB
@marcorubio please release your delegates and endorse @tedcruz
@marcorubio Why start going to work now?
@marcorubio @TeamMarcoMiami Will Marco be on the Ballot in Pennsylvania???
@marcorubio   Marco you were correct about ted he will say anything to get a vote.
@marcorubio @TeamMarcoMiami Thank you Marco and God Bless u and your family u have a light inside u that shines bright
@marcorubio As a #democrat I liked you until the primaries.
@marcorubio When are you endorsing Trump? USA need your support.
.@marcorubio awesome. I was just wishing for some comedy when I saw this tweet. 
@marcorubio Thanks Marco!
@marcorubio You need to stop the refugee influx and open southern border and the Iran deal. You are still in the Senate and need help us !
@marcorubio though I am democrat, but I am waiting for 2020 to vote for you.
@marcorubio @Sjr1022 I seriously doubt Floridians will re elect you to the senate. You didn't do the job they elected you to do
@Iceleg @marcorubio    That's your opinion....god bless!
@Sjr1022 Indeed it is...and I'm not alone in that opinion!
@Iceleg good for you.  You support your candidate I support my senator.  Have a blessed day
@marcorubio we ask you to reconsider and stay in some form of political status. Our principles and religious beliefs in which we founded 1/2
@marcorubio are at risk. Your movement was felt around the world. #GOPConvention
@marcorubio Expect to see you on a ballot in July as the only Repub. candidate who consistently out-polled Dems in all major demographics.
@marcorubio   I'm a Canadian that winters in Florida. So very disappointed that you had to pull out of the race for the leadership.
@marcorubio I thought you were all about amnesty for criminals.
@marcorubio Hey, #MarcoRubio, remember how those GOP consultants said #amnesty would get you elected? How's that workin for ya? #pjnet #tcot
@marcorubio My mom and I are writing your name in for President.  We wish things had turned out differently for you!
@marcorubio loser
@marcorubio @PrayForMarco We miss you and our prayers are with you every single day!
@courtchauncey

Linda

Marco Rubio has been fighting against Obama's Plan to give Colombia to FARC-ELN Narco Terror

Look at next tweet

.
@marcorubio Do you think you can show up? You let down millions of Floridians with your poor attendance!
@Mzsmurfqueen actually has a better attendance record than McCain, Obama or Hillary when they ran. Cruz is right behind him too.
@marcorubio ......just go away
@marcorubio You would have a major role doing this in @tedcruz administration, I'm certain; let's unite to beat Trump who wd lose big in Gen
@marcorubio NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO YOU HOLDING DELEGATES AGAINST TRUMP!  IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHOM WE THE PEOPLE ARR VOTING OUT!
@marcorubio we need you to stop thinking that you matter to anyone.
@marcorubio I don't want any religion; how do u protect me?
@marcorubio you need to be Cruzs vp
Thank you, @marcorubio for stepping up to protect our religious freedom!
@marcorubio if the klan said it's their religious beliefs to discriminate, is that fine too? Bigotry is horrible
@marcorubio You mean you're going to show up for work?
@marcorubio you should have some balls and refuse to endorse Trump.
@marcorubio Your view on immigration were never understood. Present your ideas in the form of stories .People will listen and remember.
@marcorubio This just was not your time. You are a nice person. President Obama presents himself as a nice person, but has everything wrong.
@marcorubio then support Trump and get a sweet cabinet position! Cruz will and has, stiffed you. #trumprubio16
@marcorubio make sure you show up...on time
@marcorubio Fuck You Rubio, give it up man! You are a BIG LOSER, get it?
@marcorubio I'm still writing you in , I'm tired of GOP
@marcorubio tiempo te sobra para ser presidente de USA Dios primero
@marcorubio @GOP #NeverTrump #NeverCruz Marco we're forming a prayer time 2  4 convention & that you'll win president!
@marcorubio your a communist looser...
@marcorubio am huge supporter & writing you in state of Washington in may
@marcorubio missing you   Hillary will win the election. No Trump no Cruz have a chance. #GOPlost
@marcorubio: You mean you might actually show up for work sometimes?
@marcorubio @OnlyMarco2016 God has plans for your life, and we believe that is as president. Please don't give up on us @marcorubio
@marcorubio   Wish you would endorse Ted Cruz in the interest of this great country.
@marcorubio Religious "liberty" means no "coercion" or "imposing" your religion onto me...at home and abroad.
@marcorubio going to miss you. This New York stater and a lot of people I know supported you.
@marcorubio miss having your voice in the race....the rest of these candidates are lacking...
@TracyJeffords @marcorubio Tracy, there is an obvious void. No one can speak about the issues with the passion & love of country as Marco.
@dsteffey @TracyJeffords @marcorubio #thepassionofthemarco
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress plans for the convention http://www.redstate.com/diary/earhartam/2016/04/02/watercooler-4022016-open-thread/ …
@marcorubio If you are true Patriot, which I hope you are, you should stand with the people & expose est. corruption & support Trump
@marcorubio I have litmus test 4 every political candidate forward "Did you vote 4 Trump?" If answer is no then they don't get my vote!
@marcorubio Step one: Remember that religious liberty does not include the right to tell other people how to practice their religion.
@marcorubio looking forward to carrying your message in my home state. Miss you!!! Never say die.
@marcorubio nice to see you have you're priorities straight! Forget poverty, crime, workers rights etc they're not the real issues #disgrace
@conalmccrudden yep, instead of helping those struggling, @marcorubio supporting laws to continue to hurt others who are already powerless
@marcorubio @Morning_Joe Marco, just turn over all of your campaign money to the RNC so it can help others.
@marcorubio Randi Weingarten just said that "Republicans are taking away religious freedom!"  ??? Say what? So not true !!! Ugh
@marcorubio Sorry you are leaving the Senate, but there will be a place for you at the big table in time. Perhaps sooner rather than later.
@marcorubio Marco, you need to line up behind a winner, I believe you would make an excellent VP for Trump but need to watch his background
@marcorubio Haha funny little man.  You're actually going to show up?  I guess better late than never.  Clown
@marcorubio we the people made a choice and....you're not it!    STRONG EOMEN VOTE FOR TRUMP.... Don't let the polls fool you
@marcorubio you are still my choice for President
@marcorubio We miss you!!!
@marcorubio Another term in the Senate would sure extend your impact.
@marcorubio I never took you for a quitter must have been wrong
@marcorubio 
I still think Marco Rubio would make a great President.
@marcorubio Does this mean you'll ACTUALLY show up?  Your tenure in the Senate as my U.S. Senator has been useless and a waste of my taxes.
@marcorubio Thank you Marco for all you do for our country. Looking forward to you becoming President in the future. #OnlyMarco 
@marcorubio how about doing your job, not playing politics like a petulant child
@marcorubio what by missing more Senate votes?
