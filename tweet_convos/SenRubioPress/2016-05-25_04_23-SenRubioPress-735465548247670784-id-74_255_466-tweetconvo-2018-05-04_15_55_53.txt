delegates pls #DraftMarco natl security expert who crushes Hilary with his dignity
So what are YOU doing personally to fix things besides mulling your reelection bid vs sucking up to Trump for VP nod? #DoYourJob
@wisdomfromage read that Zika $ spent on something else, possibly refuges
why is no one talking about the 22% of refugees who are bring TB into our cities, is it drug resistant? Passed like a cold.
And whose fault is that? (Hint: take a look around you.) #doyourjob
@SenRubioPress 
#ISupportIsrael #ISupportRubio Because God is Real & so is He
@TCPalm that's your party's fault. Now go get your shine box!
Your party will wait for deformed babies then try to blame the President. #ZikaVirus
why ru attacking Senator Rubio 4fighting hard 4 $ 2 fight Zika? He looks 4 bipartisan solutions. ur part of the prob!
Leave Sen Rubio alone! Enough already. Why don't U try running for Pres., & see how that works for U. #Rubioforsenate
How about you do your job and influence your peers to do theirs as well. #NoShowRubio
maybe things would move faster if you actually showed up and worked
He represents me & I think he's OVERworked... but ur pt was to be obnoxious so I bet I can guess your candidate! LOL!
@SenRubioPress  ASK THE GOP WHY SO LONG, ONLY FOOLS IN THAT PARTY HOLD IT UP.    TALK ABOUT THAT !!
Bless U Marco 4 standing up & fighting this @ a loss 4 words w/@SpeakerRyan Seems so cold hearted TY Marco 4 leading & caring
@TCPalm It's time to take out the trash counting the days!
6 min left in #CombatZika TwitterChat. Join the discussion with @OpenIDEO @CDCgov @USAIDGH
@TCPalm
Tell Legslature this: WTPeople r already pissed off
Reelections r already at risk
Pass the damn bills
P.r.o.t.e.c.t U.s.
@TCPalm Cancel the Zika bill it's all intimidation from the Obama admin just like thy did with Ebola, what say u Marco Rubio
Wow - will you actually show up and vote on this?
@KazmierskiR We need extremely aggressive mosquito control AND the bill to pass quickly, pls. #Zika
Obama is too concerned with bathrooms and that Trump rattles foreign leaders, to be concerned about health & safety of Americans
Because you're at thr forefront of addressing national health concerns..You are such a phony
So when the issue affects Florida, all the sudden you critique Congress for doing nothing? Now you know how rest of US feels.
It is also unacceptable that the Senate is holding up confirmation hearings on Merrick Garland. As Floridian I implore u to act
i know, they should've done that more quickly

Keep fighting for us Marco! My daughter/her husband trying to get pregnant in Dallas area. The Zika virus is a concern to me.
I may have to unfollow you. It is still so upsetting and disappointing to me that you are not the Republican nominee.
Thank you for standing up to this threat. Wherever your future takes you, I'll be there to support you.
That sounds whiny....who is blocking it from a vote??? That's how to use Twitter.   Tell your followers to contact/tweet X
@TCPalm Obama spent all the Zika funding on a pet program of his...there is your challenge.
@SenRubioPress Throwing cash at regulation wall built by Obamas EPA so they can redirect it to climate change. Smart corruption
He's too busy taking care of other countries
@DeargDionadair It would help if @BarackObama wasn't stealing from the Zika fund to get money for his pet climate change.
Tell Obama to ask Clinton Foundation for the money!
Are you doing your part twisting some arms in Congress, or does your Venezuela obsession take up all of your time?
@TCPalm Republicans control both Senate and House, do something besides complain.
No Olympics!  That's the single best thing we can do.
why do you think the public has such a low approval rating of the congress???
@BeckyQuick Aw c'mon it's just a little global warming. Nothing to worry about!
When you hitch your wagon to the wrong horse, it's kind of silly to complain it doesn't move like you want it to, Senator.
thanks to your republican friends
Then maybe you and your GOP colleagues should get moving on it?
And what about #MentalHealthReform? Why is that legislation  taking so long? Just as life threatening as zika.
@TCPalm what's the matter with these people? Why can't they just move the Ebola money to Zika crisis?
sometimes you have to split the difference and move forward. Too many in Congress fundraising instead of working. Immigration?
@TCPalm sure the virus has nothing to do with our borders being wide open
But wait! A trans woman is going to pee in a public restroom! #priorities
Is it true that SOS used Zika Funding for Global Warming? There were reports, but I don't believe everything I read on internet.
@TCPalm you need to get a refund from Bosely.
Ahhhhhh, if only you were in a position to do something about it.
We already have 2 confirmed cases of Zika virus here in St Johns County. It will spread. via @WOKVNews http://www.wokv.com/news/news/local/second-case-zika-virus-confirmed-st-johns/nrSXX/ â€¦
you should probably talk to your republican elected officials ... They also want to decrease the amount approved
You're too busy trying to figure out how to blame this on Obama.
it is unacceptable for everything that makes its way across politicians desks to take so long
#Zika The concern should be, are the Summer Olympics just a petri dish waiting to explode!
@TCPalm security number one priority for Goverment, need to get it done today
@JohnJHarwood who controls congress?
@GOPtoday Or maybe its a lie to shift BILLIONS of dollars into the pockets of evil politicians running for Office.
... As the mosquitoes continue to bite #needthemosquitoemoji
@TCPalm maybe no travel in and out of South America . And no conception there either. Why fix something . Avoid it!!!
There are people in this country, already infected with Zika virus. Where you moving, to "avoid" virus?
where did they get It?  They brought it here.
maybe Rs should have funded sooner.
it's taking about as long as it took you to drop out of the race. Forever
100% blame is on your party for making even life and death political. #Shame
@TCPalm so how we blaming democrats for the republican majorities slow speed?

We've known congress is slow for decades now
,,good ole boys of washington!
,,this is why this year's election is for TRUMP.
@TCPalm So tell @HouseGOP to send you guys something you can work with.
