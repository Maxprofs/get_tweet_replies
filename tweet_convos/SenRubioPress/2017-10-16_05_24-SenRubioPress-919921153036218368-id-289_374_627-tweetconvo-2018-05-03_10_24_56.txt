Marco quoting CNN. Funny. CNN #PrimaryRINO’s #FAKENEWSCNN #FireRyan #DitchMitch #SupportOurPresident
Big picture sir it’s called caring for the people in PR it’s not a D or a R thing is called caring about others.
Big pic is the San Juan Mayor politicizing relief efforts at the behest of the democrat party and they’re blind legion of leftist trolls....
No your hanging onto words of the Mayor becuz she didn’t agree with Trump! There are innocent people and children that are in need of help!
Is this what yourtalki g about contributing to relief efforts?!?! Sorry ur entitled to ur opinion but not ur own facts. #FireSJMayor
Thanks I value my opinion,I also believe in helping others no matter what people say or think it’s about the PEOPLE not words or collages
She’s also taking much need supplies and giving it to political cronies
Have a great day! You have fun hanging onto every word that you don’t agree with and not looking at the point of people needing help!
Tell that to your assface fake president that!
So what are you doing?
Tell that to your boss. Talk is cheap,Marco
How about reminding @POTUS?
Why aren't you as vocal in tweets about #PuertoRico as with #Venezuela, #ChildTaxCredit, & #TaxReform. Investigate #WhitefishEnergyPayola
Tell Obama to go help rather campaign for a lost cause.... since he's so great
what is so gd hard!??
Water purification sys & additives
#FEMA should be called in front of congress & b given 5 days 4 all 2 have safe H2O
What direct action are you taking? You want credit for telling us what we already know?
What do we as regular citizens need to do?
So stand up to your president! he's given high fives for shit response
Do something Rubio
Question, what are you and your party doing about it?
More than your party
Not according to your President whom you are too cowardly to start impeachment proceedings against. You support a self indulged man child.
I wish you knew someone in a position of power who could help them. 
When are you going to grow a pair and call out Trump? #ImpeachTrump
Stop tweeting & do your freaking job !  Put pressure on the Trump Administration & stop being a mealy-mouthed enabler.  Show Leadership !
Tell that to your buddy potus that thinks he is doing a great job
Drinking water and lack of power are two of the many things missing.  Puerto Rico needs help to solve the electricity situation.  Serious!!
So take border wall $ and move to saving lives in Puerto Rico
IGNORANT COMMENT.
According to your Supreme Leader, every thing is hunky dory in Puerto Rico. IMPEACH TRUMP and Pence NOW!
But trump and the governor says they did an A plus job...
Marco, you sniveling weakling. Why complain to Twitter? Your boss is the 1 that doesn't care about Puerto Rico. Tell it to @realDonaldTrump
So fucking do something about it!  Hello????
But @POTUS said everything's going well there and FEMA is going to leave
Tell your buddy @realDonaldTrump because he was telling everyone what a great job he did yesterday
Don’t tweet, do something.
What's stopping MOC from helping?
Bsides showing every1 how useless u r & how u idolize our pos #CIC. U r shamelessly putting party over country. #coward #PuertoRico #RESIST
Then do something about it! Republicans are so incompetent. They don't give a shit about anything until it happens to them.
Reminder: Your party's leader is @POTUS If #PuertoRico collapses it'll be his/ @GOP fault. #PuertoRicoRelief @fema @JLo
Y don’t u tweet this directly 2 ur boss? U think Tweeting abt something is the equivalent 2 decisive action? What purpose does this serve?
Instead of tweeting your sitrep, actually do something, heartless coward
3 weeks and counting and things are not any better. The electricity part is also a mess without solution in site
Yes! Who has been listening to the liar in Chief?
No S, Sherlock! Come ON! Put the FEMA metrics up. Do you even KNOW what they are. What are we paying you for? Get back to PR& see for us!!!!
Mr. Rubio tell the President.Tell Congress and explain the need.They don’t seem to understand or care that these are Americans dying!#Yulin
PR Gov is lazy.  People of PR used move behind and help themselves.
Tell the morally bankrupt piece of garbage occupying the Oval. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Please remind POTUS that they are Americans!
But you support the liar-in-chief that earlier said all is good... u r a sick dude..u can't even stand up for Puerto Rico you traitor
Do something about it!!!
Wait, I thought @realDonaldTrump said things were going great??  I am so confused.  Could he have actually...lied...
But you wont call @POTUS out because you have no backbone.  Every once in a while I still get hope you will stand up, but you always fail.
We need help Senator. Recovery is going painfully slowly.
If only you knew the president or something....
, Do something! And while your at it, get those Impeachment papers going!
Could you please explain it to the ass hole that you have for president
Nah, your boy Trump told me everything was great and they're doing amazing work.
If outraged by fed gov's treatment of US citizens in PR stop blame and take action: tell your cong. & senators to end US territorial system!
@JMGNole And the US Virgin Islands!
That's nice. Why do you still lick Trumps boots, since he's letting PR die?
Cnn is there.   Start helping instead of blaming?   Help urgently needed.
I want to know what you are doing about it?
DO SOMETHING
The entire world is already aware. What’s your plan of action?  Stop quoting bible passages.  #helpPuertoRico
Thank for keeping it in focus.
They are desperate for help! No matter previous debt!! Priorities should be Lives Before $!
Por favor vuelve y corre para presidente.
Why is Florida NOT one of the states n the USA that has signed into alliance with the Paris Agreement? We need 2 be more involved than most!
Due to the other ass hole Scott
Nice tweets about how bad it is in #PuertoRico and how govt needs to do more, but you keep forgetting to add @realDonaldTrump!
What are YOU doing to motivate @POTUS who seems to think everything is going fine?  Telling them help cannot stay forever???
Again.   Any help is welcome.   If everybody start helping instead of watching TV and blaming PR  will be rebuild in notime.  Try it!!!!!
They need help that's what I government is for that's what our taxes are for stop smiling and do something
I would like to thank you for every Puerto Rican in and outside of the island for your kindness and support #PuertoRicoSeLevanta
Maybe you could share this info with @realDonaldTrump
If the best country in the world can’t solve these problems — They can’t be solved. Period. So forget about it.
Tell that to your boss, @realDonaldTrump In case you forgot, he threatened to pull out of #PuertoRico and you said nothing.
You might want to update @realDonaldTrump he seems to think everything is fine
@realDonaldTrump ignoring #PuertoRico is like parent deciding not to be responsible for adopted child. U.S adopted PR & responsible for them
Reminder situation: @realDonaldTrump needs to be impeached, at the very least for dereliction of duty.
Many US citizens doing their part. What is GOP doing?
Apple News? We Know, We Saw, All The Bottled Water Delivered to Puerto Rico..You Must Realize the CROOKED MEDIA Has an Interest in Impeaching Our @POTUS with Continued Bad News..Why Aren't Puerto Ricans Out in the Street Cleaning Debris when reporters there?
Remind your buddy “45” about situation - Americans are dying!

Marco, please STOP! PR is getting what they need! Get up and get it!
If only we knew someone who could help...Most of us have hard time getting through security at White House. U can though. Try it!
You want to help and show we people that you are true humanitarian. Please help my family in Puerto Rico.
Talk to your "president"
WE know that drinking water in PR and Detroit is poisoned. Perhaps you should mention this to @realDonaldTrump who doesn't care. @POTUS
Throw more paper towels at them like your POTUS.
Build solar stills,  anyone can do it.
Clorox, a couple of drops per gallon of water, let sit for an hour, ready to drink.
#SenatorRubio, Please tell us you are doing something substantive to help....
And what leadership role are you playing with your colleagues to ensure that safe drinking water is available. #PuertoRico
WHY DONT YOU PUBLICLY CALL OUT TRUMP FOR HIS LACK OF EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP
Big picture plan?
@MiamiHerald Marco, why not send out one of your little prayers!!
@MiamiHerald Once again Marco identifies problems we all see, but offers no solutions. No solutions Marco!
Yes it does so make something happen!!! #PuertoRicoSeLevanta
A poor island only looks worse when catastrophes happen. I do feel for them. 
I'm confused. Didn't we offer PR to become a state? And didn't they refuse? Seriously asking this
Maybe you can tell your President* during the next commercial break
We know! Tell that to @realDonaldTrump and @GOP
And #45 is playing golf....
But @realDonaldTrump fixed it all. Everything wrong is their fault remember?
You do know your party controls the Senate, right?
What are you doing about it.... where are military airlifts like in Berlin years ago?????
When are YOU organizing a water & food drive 4 #PuertoRicoRelief ?
I'll gladly donate again & have @amazonprimenow water
@nbc6 @FLSheriffs
doesnt detroit struggle to find clean water too?
Hey Little Marco - You are aware, of course, that your leader is causing far more pain and suffering by his inaction. Right?
What of all the claims of corruption? Is the support sent reaching the people?
How about you tell @realDonaldTrump this? #rubiocoward #coward
And you keep doing nothing but talking about it. Nice!
Tell it to your @potus
And @POTUS keeps golfing #Shame #PuertoRicoRelief #GOP #Trump
Marco why don't you do something to help instead of flapping your lips. You know the water systems are shot, needs major construction.
You don’t have to remind us, you have to DO something!!!
YOU can do something about this. #ImpeachTrump
#GOP
@realdonaldtrump thinks #PuertoRico
can just Reach for a #Bottle of #Clean #Water
like @MarcoRubio,@MaeveReston
Reminder situation in #PuertoRico remains dire as our fellow Americans struggle to find safe drinking water - CNN https://apple.news/AH6C8wdlBTDqBUkcD6UWjKw …
And yet? You continue to snuggle up to tRump and won't cross him or call him out! You really are a tiny man inside. Be a damned AMERICAN!
Why dont you talk to the administration you helped get elected, little marco?
Yes. Push what they need. Just push until they are getting what they need.
Of course you watch CNN and then push the Fake News they spew. Say goodbye Little Marco! You’ll be out soon.
Meanwhile your cronies golf with #BLOTUS the sexual predator pres!
You are a senator. Walk over to the White House and talk to DT!
IGNORANCE ABOUNDS
Puerto Rico will never improve until the status is fixed. What about acting on the will of the people? Statehood won. Twice! #Democracy
Reminder: #Congress has the power to do something about that. @realDonaldTrump made it clear he doesn't care. What're you going do about it?
PS Here's someone who's using their platform to help. @Lin_Manuel has talent and heart—aiong with the artists.
All the while your president trump is relaxing at his golfresort ...
Isn't your party responsible for this?
I think so...
Little Marco, too scared FL people will hit back in 2018? Too late, you spend last 3 weeks talking about God and ignoring PR. DO YOUR JOB
DO something! We need more action from our so called government!
@marcorubio , would you please let @POTUS  KNOW ABOUT THIS DIRE SITUATION! he thinks things are just fine!
Time to step up! Be a big boy!
Reminder 
No contact with   "Adoptions"
No business with  "Trump towers Moscow"
Who care  interfered in our election "TRUMP"
Try telling our ass of a President! People are suffering.. Trumps goes golfing. This is life and death and he doesn't care. Impeach now!
Youvare reminding the wrong people! You need to be reminding Trump AND your fellow Senators that Trump isn't doing enough!
Praying for all people devistated by the hurricane and fires.
Don't remind me. Remind your lord & master @realDonaldTrump
WHY DOESN’T THE GOVERNMENT DO SOMETHING TO HELP THEM!!!!
Talk to #Trump abt that. He says it's the best recovery effort in history. #PuertoRico
So did you talk to your boss about doing more for those fellow Americans little marco, or are you continuing to kiss your bosses ass
Just throw a few bible quotes at it. Maybe a thought and a prayer too. That should fix everything
Please tell your president . We are all aware and are trying to help our fellow “Americans” the best way we can . Action please not words.
GOP POTUS doesn't want to fix it.
Senator Rubio, Why talk about it, as a member of the U.S. Senate I’d like to know what you’re doing about it.
Talk to the nonuts in the white house
DJT says that a “great” job there. Potentially contaminated water used for drinking????!!!! Disgusting!!!!
Tell that to Trump.
Might I recommend the home of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz as a place to start looking...
So what is being done about it? You are in a position to take the lead on this.. take it
Senator aren’t you Embarrassed how a president of your own party ignored the needs of Hispanics
@realDonaldTrump says we are doing a great job. Instead of tweeting, try rallying the Senate to get aid. Confront his lies.
YES BUT YOU SIT ON YOUR ASS AND HANDS AND DO NOTHING
Flint Michigan is still struggling to find clean water too
Yes I live in Michigan and we donating water all the time it's a mess still here and our governor does nothing, it's a blame game now
Tell Fidel Carmen to do her job, organize her municipal workers and deliver the relief supplies.
@realDoaldThump so what's being done?
Can't be true. @realDonaldTrump says he's doing a great job there. Maybe you can try to inform the buffoon?
FEMA & US MILITARY PERSONNEL are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico
Tell that to your President
U R COMPLICIT in electing an ignorant, selfish, reality tv star. Start ur repentance by personally helping all the lives u have helped ruin
Yes, we know.  Stop telling us and talk to POTUS
Racist @POTUS & @WhiteHouse would rather fight with @CarmenYulinCruz than do anything for 3M Americans-do your job. @SenateGOP @CNN @MSNBC
You have been silent and hiding. You just tweeting like the moron? That's obvious and sad.
What are you doing about this?
A more productive tweet would be to get someone involved.. like @BillGates regarding safe drinking water options?
Congress should do something about it.  Remind your colleagues.
Don't talk! Do something about it.send some water purification units
And yet the Jobes act got reinstated so businesses could make $$ Who cares about the people of PR?
Isn’t it ur job to improve this situation? Can’t u help stifle the Moron from blowing up Iran Deal or from dragging us into a war w No Korea
Not according to the leader of your party Marco. When r u gonna stand up to him like u tried to do (and failed) on campaign trail!
CNN lol
Reminder, the US Army has water purification barges that can be placed around Puerto Rico to provide potable water. COL(ret) @rodst6
So where is FEMA!? I'm white 58 yr old college instructor n I'm appalled by the lack of help to our people! What if they were mostly white?!
FEMA is there... stop believing fake news

Susan Collins: Trump is "affecting the ability of vulnerable people to receive health care right now." 
Maybe you should share with the President of the Virgin Islands
Please help family there. They are barely surviving. The need your help just like many others do. Please donate.
Tell the fake POTUS that. It's apparent he doesn't know that Puerto Ricans are Americans.
We know. Maybe send a memo to @realDonaldTrump? Tell him that—amazingly—the paper towels didn’t fix it.
Yeah, we already know that, we watch the news. What are u/donald doing about it? having a lunch to discuss, "Working hard"?
Aside from talk what are you doing? Donny is all talk.
Puerto Rico is also struggling to find food. Most stores have 2 hour lines to get into the parking lot,to find empty shelves
Should you be saying that little Marco, won't the big bad boss punish you for telling the truth?
Standing up to him huh Marco? All talk, no action.
Who are you reminding Marco? What do you want me to do...drop a case of water off in Puerto Rico on my way home?
Maybe if they could get to the docks? Really think about what you are saying. I wonder how the Virgin Islands are finding waster or food?
You built that. #trumpsupporter #zerobackbone
Then don't waste your time tweeting bible quotes, you fake christian and useless representative.  Talk to your non-caring party.
Do something about it, Senator
Agree with helping PR until the job's done. What about the fellow Americans without safe drinking water in Flint? Action steps for both?
