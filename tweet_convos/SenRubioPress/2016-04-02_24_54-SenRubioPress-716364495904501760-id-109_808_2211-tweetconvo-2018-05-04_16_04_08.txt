@marcorubio Miss you and thank you for caring for children with disabilities. I know families that have children with Autism. It is not easy
@marcorubio I support you but please read why this family isn't #LIUB for our autistic child #REDinstead
@marcorubio thank you so much for the recognition @PatgJA912
@marcorubio I know you don't care but #LIUB is a garbage campaign you shouldn't support
@ZackBudryk @marcorubio Those of us dealing with autism prefer action over awareness.
@marcorubio I Pray to live long enough to see you elected President.
@marcorubio put your support behind cruz, help unite the GOP
@marcorubio Thanks for letting know.  I'm proud of MY autistic child who knows more than most people forgot.  He's very smart.
