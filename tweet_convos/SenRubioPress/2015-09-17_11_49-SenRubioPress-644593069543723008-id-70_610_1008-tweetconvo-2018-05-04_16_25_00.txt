@marcorubio Great interview with Bret On fox. Very impressive!
@keithandreen @marcorubio Im sorry, where does it say the word marriage in the constitution?
@keithandreen @marcorubio "Marriage? No." I dropped my keyboard.
@marcorubio Schools don't teach kids the truth about the constitution any more. So you lose kids when you say Constitution. RE teach it!
@14boisest8 @marcorubio My son learned about the #Constitution at #shool AND AT #HOME #parenting #teachyourkids #theyneedtoknow
@marcorubio you rocked the other night.  Really showed how ignorant trump is on real issues.  You would make a great POTUS.

@marcorubio You  broke the constitution you are not qualified to run for office
@marcorubio did you get this ring with rubi Tamares mepes?
@marcorubio need more retweetable tweets like this (opinions/platform/quotes) several x/hour to keep your name in forefront.

@marcorubio @RickCanton Here's what @POTUS @BarackObama feels abt our Constitution that he swore to support & defend.
@marcorubio @TimGamble could you tell that to  obama?
@wrenchtwister2 @marcorubio @TimGamble  A socialist like Obama can't comprehend that!
@marcorubio you & Fiorina had a great night.
@marcorubio @RBPundit Could we do so without a giant red star of communism?
@marcorubio Yes and its a shame ur work for the Oligarchy NOT us as u proved when u pushed MASSIVE AMNESTY bill S 744 for which u were paid.
@marcorubio Hot!
@marcorubio HP made millions in sales to Iran under Carley. Put the heat on Marco!
@marcorubio you did good last night Marco really good...#WakeUpAmerica
@marcorubio u did great Marco ! U really know your facts !
@marcorubio The Patriot Act has been ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL,when can we count on your vote to repeal it? You say you support the Constitutio
@marcorubio You have no credibility supporting the COnstitution when you voted for the Patriot Act and its extension. You are a fake
@marcorubio @RickCanton Stop missing votes and do the job you are being paid for.
@marcorubio Supporting an act ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL makes any oath of office you swear to uphold, meaningless. Typical phony politician
@marcorubio Then why did you support the Patriot Act AND its extensions knowing it was ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by the appellate court?
@marcorubio Tell me where does it say you work for corporations & pHARMa & not the people? HR1599-TPP-HR6 Shame on you!
@marcorubio The GOP never ceases to ignore it when it comes to right to privacy and separation of church and state.
@marcorubio our POTUS and SCOTUS should read it more often. Oh, and Capitol Hill should fight for it!
@marcorubio Thank you for standing up for the Constitution of the United States.
@marcorubio and uphold it!
@marcorubio to you as well Great debate night 4u
@marcorubio good job last night, I'll be looking to hear more in the future.  Currently undecided, but loving our process
@marcorubio you look good. 
@marcorubio - How about updating it...
@marcorubio 
The big question is do conservatives belive in every amenment of the constatution?
@marcorubio have you considered actually reading the constitution? Might be a good place to start.
@marcorubio
@marcorubio Great job last night. Keep workin it....nothing will look the same in 6 months!
@marcorubio Amen Marco.
@marcorubio Tell that often & explain pls what makes it great since it is NOT taught in public schools.
@marcorubio funny it seems to just be a piece of paper lately !  Continue to hear very soft voices if any defending.
@marcorubio You were conspicuously missing in the vote #stopirandeal today. Is this a noble way to defend #ConstitutionDay @CNNPolitics @hrw
@marcorubio Says the guy who is number 1 in the Senate for not showing up for votes. Trump exposed you last night and killed your dream.
@JamesJa15494083 You need to listen better.
@Dellapearl Fact. Rubio missed more votes than anyone. He made excuses but there is no excuse. Period.
@JamesJa15494083 Hope you didn't vote for Obama.
@marcorubio mis bendiciónes Marco y que Dios y San Miguel Arcángel  vayan contigo. ..Amén
@marcorubio Well you believe in open borders and redistribution.  Where is that in the Constitution? #ConstitutionDay #CNNDebate #GOPDebate
@marcorubio so when Bush Sr changed it to keep Cannabis out of religion. Will you respect religious rights. Jesus Mota RVR Spanish Bible
@marcorubio ...until it doesn't support something you want, then you do whatever you can to ignore it. #roevwade
