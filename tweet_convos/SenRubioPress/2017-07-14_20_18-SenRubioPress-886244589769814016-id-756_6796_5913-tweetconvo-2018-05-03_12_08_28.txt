All the people that responded on this post doesn't know about the crisis in Vzla. hello people the regimen are killing us!! #SOSVenezuela
So govt just going into innocent people's homes & killing them? Or killing ppl like that crazy guy riding in a helicopter dropping bombs?
There are protesters being shot using tear gas grenades aimed at the body, and with 9 mm automatics @cresentema @nenaguara @marcorubio
That is also how the US controls peaceful protestors. And I agree that it is wrong.
I'm not aware of USA riot control forces firing point blank with tear gas grenade launchers (see photo) @cresentema
Well I have..
Looks like a fake. I looked up the Wislansky case, it was under grand jury scrutiny. One of her buddies refused to testify @cresentema
So you believe the photo of what the Venezuelan govt did but are calling fake the Wilansky photo? Really?
Venezuela is not socialist
I think this will help you, Jorge https://twitter.com/jpiedrah/status/886050695195045888 …
I'm Venezuelan, I against the government. So I don't need help. Venezuela is a communism, wich is different. Both left wing, but different.
Eeehhhmmm el socialismo y el comunismo no son cosas diferentes. El primero es una etapa (la primera), del segundo término.
Que se necesite pasar por un estado socialista para llegar al comunismo es diferente.
#SocialismSucks
Venezuela is not socialist
Stop obsessing about Cuba and Venezuela.  Your job is to protect the US.  What are you doing about Russian hacking of our election?
Everybody in #Venezuela knows about crimes and mafia of @dcabellor
but listening to @marcoribio said that is awesome #No+Dictatorship
You are going down with Trump. Clear stuff now before it's too late
YOU american goverment can do better in this matter sir.
I believe that I can smell the fragrance of burning sulphur...
Is this also true for @realDonaldTrump and @DonaldJTrumpJr ?
What about hillary and her promiscuous  husband ?
WOW you a really are intellectually challenged. @realDonaldTrump has cheated on all 3 wives.
Senador Marco the reazons why  cabello is mad are: 
1 maduro did not give him the sword because you did not include him in the last list.
You can't help yourselves with this obsession Trump derangement syndrome this post wasn't even about USA was about socialism & comunism
Put this salvage thug is jail.


Kinda like the traitor you helped put in the White House, huh? Trump is handing to Putin. And you're letting him. You're all traitors.
Would prefer that you concentrate on the actions of our president and his staff on Russia interfering in our elections!
Dear Senator, when the US will release the proof Diosdado Cabello is the drug lord? Investigation has taking years, but no action yet.Thanks
In the interim, we allow him to massacre innocent people. Over 100 innocent protesters dead and he feels emboldened by our inaction
That's ironic isn't it?, so is the evidence of your President's and GOP Party's crimes, wowwww!!!!!!.....
Evidence of Trump's crimes continues to mount, Little Marco too much of a wimp to act to protect the nation
Ah, isn't he your buddy?
#SHOUTOUT 

The #GOP and I welcome ALL Foreign Governments who would like to Collude in our upcoming 2018 race.

We're always.....
Venezuela is important but what are your views on Trumpcare and it's abandonment  of Floridians. YOU represent us.
Did trump borrow money from them too?
#TheResistance you see why we can't get a Townhall with @marcorubio he's always advocating for Venezuela never for #Americans #Louse #Liar
Sort of like the leader of your party?
Meanwhile, more innocent venezuelan die everyday
Can we expose Venezuela to anarchists in USA? Are anarchist brainwashed, can't see the Hitlers/Globalists of today promote slavery for all?
Former associate of your brother in law,is He?
Why don't you say that about @realDonaldTrump
Is the US doing anything substantial about Maduro and his narco administration? I don't hear anything from the WH.
Yeah just like Donald Trump ... #NotMyPresident
i never saw marco said anything to trump for taking money from Maduro government
did Venezuela put you in office or USA.
You excuse great crimes committed by those w/access/power w/no allegiance to U.S. They threaten our great democracy bc of your spinelessness
Tic tac tic tac
Maybe refocus your attention to our most serious domestic issue, who is living in the White House
CHAMO TE AMO. VERGACION.
Hey Marco, if you guys have anything on @dcabellor now is a good time to throw us a bone, we really need the info
#ConsultaPopular16J  #16JSiSiSi #Venezuela
Cantwait to see him wearing an orange suit
.@marcorubio @robertoepons @dcabellor closer to home other crimes are closing in on a certain @POTUS and his crew. What will u do?
Venezuelan people need an immigration policy to stay in US during this hard time. It is now when  they need US support. Rise your voice!
@GuardianRover @dcabellor That reminds me of someone else, funny.
Ya cumpli con mi sagrado deber!queremos un país de libertad,progreso y bienestar,esperamos que Ud. Siga apoyandonos!muchas gracias!!
Reason your dear leader tweets is the same, the walls are closing in.
Look who's talking!
Aquí a eso no se le llama nervios aquí se le llama está cagao!!!! Él sabe que tarde o temprano tendrá qué responder por sus crímenes
Thank you Mr Rubio , from Caracas Venezuela
https://victorhannover3.blogspot.it/2017/07/roma-venezolanos-hicieron-una-protesta.html …
Sounds like you just described Trump's situation
Thanks for your concern about Venezuelans tragedy. Today we are seeking for freedon by the vote not the bullets.Soon, We will be free again.
Ha!! Take a look at the idiot you protect every day. His walls are closing in too. He's a criminal and you are in bed with him. Complicit.
Evidence of crimes and walls closing in are happening closer to home in DC as well. #ETCallHome #ETmeetRussians #EricTreasonous
 So the real reason @realDonaldTrump is? Oh yes! The same reason @dcabellor is nervous
El mundo al revés! Los verdaderos narcotraficantes acusando a los demás de narcotraficante ... https://twitter.com/ideassocialista/status/760283036579667968 …
Geez, the scenario seems to be catchy here in the US.
@GuardianRover @dcabellor sounds like Trump
Sounds like our President*
you can't close the door when the wall's caved in
Why are you ignoring the depths of Russiagate? In league with DeVos due to contributions. Where do you stand? You have missed a chance.
So is Dolt 45 and all the Rep, who took money from Russians.
Wait you overlooked trump and went all the way to venezuela, piccolo marco grow a set of balls
Low blow
POTUS seems to be in a similar situation.
Who. The fuck. Cares right now.
I care about all people, that's my prerogative as a human and American. @GOP doesn't give shit or do anything. People keep voting them back.
Bitch at them and @TheDemocrats they've all forgotten who they work for!
Yeah, I was replying to Rubio, lol
i.e. bitching at him
R U talking about Venezuela or tRUmp? Cuz the walls are closing in on tRUmp. R U going down with tRUmp or will GOP do their job? IMPEACH 
Wait would that be Donald Trump you're referring to? Stand up Marco or you'll go down with the rest

http://youtu.be/X4fNQW_Yr_k  por favor vamos difundir para que todos vean lo que está pasando en nuestra amada Venezuela
Don't you mean @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @mike_pence @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @IvankaTrump @jeffsessions @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump ????
Thank you @marcorubio ! For keeping your eye on Venezuela an exposing the thugs that rule there
Sen. Rubio, I bet lots of people are thinking that your tweet is very clever & reusable. All one needs to do is change the names in yours
No way out
And the same could be said of the Trump regime. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Marco, you should add to the message to @dcabellor this:  tic tac, tic tac ....
Así esta chorriao como decimos por acá Senador pero pronto saldremos de esos narcotraficantes  gracias por su apoyo! #16Jul #SiSiSi 
Is "Dcabellor" Spanish for "Trump?"
Build the wall !!!! Oh wait what wall do you mean? If unsure Build Trumps wall @realDonaldTrump

Inmorales cuando quieren enlodar a alguien acusan de narcotraficante, siendo ellos los mas grandes narcos del mundo. https://twitter.com/ideassocialista/status/582931949188190208 …
A ver imbécil, cuantos aviones de pdvsa han capturado con drogas?... A ver dime.
Same reason our President is so nervous??? 
No different than your #SR118. Shame on you.
Same for @realDonaldTrump, maybe you should focus on that a bit.
La constituyente va. No podrán ponerle mas la mano a Venezuela. Si Dios está con nosotros, quien contra nosotros.
Jajajaja, callate maldito pajuo, y vaya a hacer su cola por su bolsita de clap.
Can we confiscate his billions and use that to keep Medicaid so US citizens don't die?
We don't have to look to Venezuela to see evidence of crimes growing and walls closing in. It's happening here and not soon enough. Beware!
Speaking of walls just use some of that money to build the damn thing
THERE ARE TRAITORS IN THE WHITEHOUSE.  

WE'VE GOT BIGGER FISH TO FRY, RUBIO
Sounds just like @POTUS !
This tweet could have a few word substitutions & could be about trump and his regime.
Si el es el Capo como es USA no han dictado orden  Ej El Aisami .. no hablen más no amenacen más actúen ! Eso es lo q se espera en Vzla
For that reason they cling to power, it is the lair they still have.
The Castro's Drug Terrorist Regime. R Castro has an indictment in a Federal Court in Miami for Drug Traf. Is it T We have two set of Laws.?
#FreeVenezuela #SOSVenezuela #EndSocialism #SocialismFail #StopMaduro #FightForVenezuela Pls RT everyone #SupportForVenezuela  @SLadreda
Marko how many of your constituents will suffer or die because of your vote for TrumpCare??
The same thing is happening to the Trump Crime Family. The walls are closing in.
@acarrrillom
Any truth to this article that links you to drugs and shady business?
https://m.facebook.com/groups/162591360580435?view=permalink&id=738971519609080 …
Thank you for your support @marcorubio
Huh?
With total impunity and disregard for human life I might add @decabellor @TareckPSUV
That is correct, they use the Venezuelan military bases to send that poison to the United States and Europe, @decabellor @TareckPSUV
Just like your buddy Trump. Don't be on the wrong side of history, take a stand against #Trump. #TrumpRussia #Criminalsinthe WhiteHouse
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR CATCHING HIM! Mr Senator Rubio. we have to thank you for all you´ve done to help our democracy.
Así es senador!!!

Where r u on this family?
Dear Marco sounds like Washington DC.
METETE TUS SANCIONES POR EL CULO PITIYANQUI VENEZUELA SE RESPETA
.@marcorubio WE NEED THIS DRUG DEALER BEHIND BAR FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, AND WHY NOT CAPITAL DEATH BECAUSE OF HIS CRIMES .@dcabellor
That is possible. God heard you
Fixed it for you:
"The reason why @realDonaldTrump is so nervous? Evidence of his crimes is growing by the day and the walls are closing in"
Please Senator Rubio, no more politicking, come to the action, Venezuela agonizes in the arms of Maduro and his Band of CRIMINALS.
2/2 Finally, goverments must accept the new transition goverment until it can be chose a new goverment and Democratic goverment must accept
Replace Venezuela with United States and dcabellor with @realDonaldTrump OR @DonaldJTrumpJr and you could actually be making sense
1/2. A positive result from the popular consult must conduce to choosing a transition goverment, and then it must call a general electtion.
Whoaaaa, are you talking about Trump or someone else????
Kind of like Donald trump huh??
If you were in Venezuelan politics, would you enable him as you're enabling @POTUS?
Why don't you say that about our President
I'm picking up what ur laying down about "Venezuela" ( USA) and "@dcabellor" (@realDonaldTrump )#winkwink #redhanded
Verga camarada Rondón Loperan es bueno para eso
I sincerely hope that these are not empty threats.  Even without the ANC, more pressure on these thugs is needed.
I don't share most views with him but  Rubio is spot on regarding #venezuela. Diosdado will be sweating in the clink shortly.
Little Marco more worried about Venezuela than he is about his constituents. 
PERFECT

Dear @MarcoRubio: Florida faces a $2B Medicaid shortfall if BCRA passes. 65% of ppl in FL nursing homes use Medicaid http://spr.ly/60178qNmD  
Little Marco
That's fucking grate!
Rusia Rusia Rusia Rusia hahahahhas Rusia Rusia hahahahhas
Thank you for all your support to my country senator!
Sounds a little like @realDonaldTrump
Inmigración debe remover malditos chavistas pobres y ricos devuelta a Venezuela,no merecen vivir en ese hermoso país generoso
What you should do Sir,is send back Venezuelan chavistas back,remove them from United States, rich and poor..
Mr. Rubio Washing your fucking. O mejor dicho en criollo. (lavate el culo)
Same for your buddy @POTUS
Evidentemente sólo los ignorantes chavistas creen que Diosdiablo es una "blanca paloma", creen que come CLAP y habita en una GMVV! Jajaja!
Senator Rubio. We need to free Venezuela and from there we'll go to free Cuba. We have to eliminate the infection from the origen
maduro is killing/torturing ppl, police/military have defected b/c maduro is a dictator, so ppl talk trump cause he hurt their feelings. lol
Venezuela needs help, the people needs guns. Teenagers are getting killed just because they want a free country. SOS.
Now, he'll say that is another strike from the "fascist right-wing". His horrible feeling that the whole ship is sinking has him nervous!
Expose your boss.
kinda like @realDonaldTrump
Necesitamos de su ayuda senador los venezolanos somos un pueblo indefenso ante estos delincuentes asesinos del Gobierno.
SWEAR HE IS GOING TO PAY FOR ALL THE MESS
Los trajes que te esperan @dcabellor y Compañía.
The walls were closing on Hillary and the Republicans knocked them down.
I  U @marcorubio! Vengan y llévense al NARCO mayor para que acompañe al Chapo y a los Narcosobrinos en NY
SI USTED @marcorubio CONTINÚA MENOSPRECIANDO MIS DENUNCIAS CONTRA LOS DUEÑOS DEL CIRCO (#G2CUBANOS) REPETIREMOS LA HISTORIA DE CUBA EN VZLA
Marcos muchas gracias por el apoyo para Venezuela, desde mañana se ratifica la ilegitimidad de estos delincuentes.
Apreciamos tu labor !!

Unless Venezuela is like the US .The democrats are not held accountable for their iniquities!
Uy !
Why are you too much of a coward to address this murderous healthcare bill that will kill your elderly constituents in Florida?
Get ready Marco to build that wall
You misspelled "Trump" and "crime family."
If you want to do something really good VOTE NO on the Trumpcare bill!
You had a typo.  You meant trump right?
Shut up until you are ready to stop kissing Trumps butt!
Why don't you work as hard getting to the truth about Trump as you do other countries problems?
Irony.
Gracias senador excelente!!! No nos abandonen SOS, queremos la libertad plena!!!
This regime is genocide and narco state. They support guerrilla (FARC) US have to be aware to all this irregular situation #SOSVenezuela
Much like the President you still haven't taken a moral stand against.
The daughter of his frontman Rafael Sarria is currently studying in the US in Columbia and living in NY @verosarriah Veronica Sarria Hidalgo

Hmm. You think trump is also nervous about evidence of his crimes? WH walls closing in?   Of course talking about Venezuela is easier?Yep.
Stop Meddling
Same reason GOP is nervous! Evidence of crimes growing leaps and bounds! No one is above the law! Gowdy, Ryan, et.al
Shouldn't you be off somewhere, pretending to be a Christian? Why worry about drugs in Venz. when you don't care about Big Pharma here.
You misspelled @realDonaldTrump.
And he's taking the anxiety against innocent people! He has to pay for his crimes! He's the worst of all of them
Talking about @realDonaldTrump ?
The reason @DonaldTrump is so nervous? Evidence of his crimes is growing by the day & the walls are closing in-It's like MadLibs-BOTH apply!
