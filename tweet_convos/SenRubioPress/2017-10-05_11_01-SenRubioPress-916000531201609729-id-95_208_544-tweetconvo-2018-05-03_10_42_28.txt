Where is #Tillerson? He is the wise one!
You will never dictate how #SovereignNations choose to defend their People, borders and interests. You have no right to #PoliceTheWorld
America will forever suffer the consequences of its actions generations will seek revenge for the slaughter of their loved ones #Iraq #Syria
Did you ask Nikki Haley about her vote in favor of the death penalty for LGBTQ people?
Little Marco hasn't a whiff of competence in Foreign Affairs. In any thing else for that matter. Lightweight.
Easy. Keep the Iran deal in place. It's working
Best way to confront #Iran nuclear is by bombing there nuclear hidden projects . don't trust them . 20 years bluffing USA . This should end
Your English is awful/take some classes.

When is the UN going to meet about the current threat inside the US White House? He needs to be restrained from society let alone Twitter.
Can't stand that a smart black man made a deal.
Must smash it! Adult day care.
Iran isn't a threat
two Israel firsters both unworthy of power
Nuclear missles? Hahaha like Iraq nuclear missles before..  Don't forget to copy the same Bush agenda
uhhhmmmm Trump is on twitter declaring was with N. Korea...you may want to fucking do something!!!!!!
Step 1)You both resign and get talk shows on Fox News Step 2)Let grown ups handle the situation Step 3)Multilateral Diplomacy
Myślę, że powinno się pozostać przy dokładnych kontrolach. Iran nie chce wojny.
Nie sądze by Iran dążył do konfrontacji na dużą skalę czy samobujstwa. Prawa Islamu ???
Po części Iran czuje się również zagrożony.

Note To Fellow Americans on #Haley, #Iran and #Hypocrisy https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/10/27/haley-iran-and-hypocrisy/ … by @NatCounterPunch
US actual withdrawal from UNSC-approved #IranDeal shows Washington's unreliability, why would #DPRK negotiate with them?
A portent of the future? More closely following for sure. Thanks, @nikkihaley for your strong voice.
Funny how you cretin's ignore #IAEA findings!Also, when you discussing #Israel illicit nukes ya bunch of hypocrites!
Your obsession with Iran is enabling Saudi war crimes in Yemen http://tinyurl.com/y9lctljx  The intentional starvation of civilians.
I  play  a  role  every  day ;  and  thank  you .  Minister  Haley .   From  Japan  .
Should have discussed voting to stand with banning murders of gays..
No deal with Iran. No Trust with this regime. Push up the sensation to stop Iran just we stopped Russia by Reagan.
Could you ask princess Punjab what her grade was for South Carolina roads to be paved?
Nikki,
After voting to support killing of gay people around the world, your credibility is now a negative number below zero.
@lisamurkowski
Why don't you discuss Israeli Violations of U.N. Security Council Resolutions.
Perhaps, look inward
You mean those threats you're making up to quash the working, multi lateral agreement?
Dear Rubio Iranian goverment is the center of problem and iranian goverment with syrian regim together support and educated ISIS trust me.
Regim change by Iranian people, that's what we need

Tools of military/industrial/Congressional complex meet to discuss how to spread more global strife and chaos.
http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/politics/nikki-haley-hatch-act-violation/?iid=ob_lockedrail_bottomlist … Nikki Nikki Nikki. Your boy is going down anyway. No big loss. U all know your careers r going 2 b short anyway,
It's not rocket science - excuse the pun....
Don't forget people of #Iran who are on the frontline of victimization & #HumanRights abuses.
You're doing a great job Senator

Oooh, let's caption this. I'll go first:

"Look, Nikki, my hands are not that small. You gotta believe me. Please don't make me filibuster."
I'm so grateful for you both when it comes to FP & that you continue to have some influence w/the Prez.
You need a meeting to decide to leave Iran alone?
Start by not letting @POTUS decertify the Iran nuclear deal. SIMPLE !@RWPUSA #GOP @SenJohnMcCain @SteveSchmidtSES @MichaelSteele #DEM
.Jajajaja! Este loco-viejo GUSANO  hablando mierda.  Hahaha! This GUSANO piece of shit talking bullshit about Iran. Iran must be laughing.

Right..we all know who the terror sugar daddy in the region is: Saudi Arabia, your "friend and ally". What terror groups is Iran supporting?
#GOP joins #Shariah Nations  #SHAME #UN #NikkiHaley #resign
Best way to handle anything is one of 3: Invoke 25th, Impeach or get Trump to resign. Maybe then we can work in a bipartisan framework.
Idiot
Certainly not by saying, go ahead and reconstitute your nuclear program an the US will be the only one to have sanctions...
How about addressing the terror here at home? You are complicit in atrocities simply due to inaction. #Shame #Bloodonyourhands
Obama gave 150 billion to Iran. The blood of every Israeli slaughtered by Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah is partly on his hands.
Why you didn't discuss about drcongo because kabila he killing the population . 12million of death but you keep quiet
#RegimeChange in Iran by Iranian people & it’s resistance the only way to get a non-nuclear and Free Iran 
#FreeIran #expelIRGC
Just like high school:  pull out.
Senator, did you also discussed Israel nuclear arsenal, missiles and State terror against Palestinians? Hypocrites!
You could start by insisting that Trump keep his mouth shut! His stupid rants undermine diplomacy and American credibility!
I hope you covered this portion, at least...
Dunford, last week: “Iran is adhering to” deal 
Mattis, this week: “yes” in US national security interest to keep Iran Deal
Trump, next week: Deal not in the national interest of the US

…
Stay in the nuclear deal. 
No more North Koreas!
Bullshit. BULLShit. BULLSHIT.
Talk about her Hatch Act violation, voting for the gay death penalty and backstabbing of Tillerson.
https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/915937808845606912 … @GOP
Clarity is needed on this important issue. http://qklnk.co/1bsBSb 
Did you pat her on the back for her vote allowing the execution of gay people?  #MAGA!
To follow the GOP follower logic, do not touch the missiles. Missiles do not kill people, people kill people.
You look like feeling relax and good.. 
And don’t even care what would happen to Iranians.!
Easy lil' marco lol. You gotta hate that 
interesting since @NikkiHaley voted  against a ban for countries like #Iran to kill gays. Moment of #WTF #GOP Failure #UN #WillNOTFORGET
How about discussing our moron president who's gonna start an unnecessary war? Not enough people killed yet? Still have weapons to sell?
Just STOP before you f it up. PLEASE
Do you want a cookie?

Did she wear heels?  If so she is TALLER than you are......
You gonna vote to allow more gay people to be killed like little Nikki?
leftists now love Iran, number one terror state, because Trump justifiably hates them. You are inadvertently rooting for another Holocaust.
Horrible judgment.
.She does what DoTARD tells her to do even if it is the most stupid thing you can think of.
Biggest threat is in the OO. You both ignore his hate. Maybe you're hoping Rex exits & you both move like pieces in a board game in Admin?
