Thank you Senator! Moral clarity is America's greatest resource for global change.
holy crap you actually did something I can support, stop the presses!
Symbolic BS. Province of politicians everywhere. I thought you hated the Senate? McCain/Graham third wheel status appealing?
@jaketapper wow, that's really standing up to the Russians. Investigating White House ties is far less important, right?
I hope one day people on twitter realize it is the buttholes like them that deserve that butthole president, let him do good
@jaketapper listening to your constituents will remind them why they voted for you.
Floridians supported Rubio's reelection bid overwhelming, nearly 5 million voters entrusted Rubio with the job. He's proven. #GOP
He's proven that he's a sell out!
How is he a sellout? He's committed to our democracy & works hard to improve the well-being of all Floridians. #GOP
After condemning Trump as totally unfit - supported him; Put on a show against Tillerson -voted for him.
Campaign rhetoric is far different than effective governing. The GOP is unified & #ReadyToWork for the American people.
Deluded or lying. Probably both.
@jaketapper para de hablar paja. Do your job and support Prez Trump.
@McFaul Duritskaya ukr key witness to Nemtsovs murder bought 4 apts after that.Any idea of who could give the money Putin or?
Keep on Nunes..
Amen Marco
@jaketapper but this is meaningless if u dont push 4independent investigations! #Trumprussia
what's the difference? U don't listen to yours!
WOW...and this is what Congress does while American taxpayers pay them 200,000 per year...CONGRESS MUST B CLEANED
I approve of the effort, but let's remember he has been silenced.  Deeds, not words.
How about #AlexOronov street?  And keep a street free for #DmitryRybolovlev, @realDonaldTrump #moneylaundering Cyprus contact
Could you possibly do anything that would make less difference than this?
More worthless gestures. Investigate Russian ties to the White House!
Dissidents won't be silenced? You got that right.
That is just idiotic.  Put your time to better use than renaming streets.
@SenSchumer @MaxineWaters @SenFeinstein @SenateDems Voted against potus tax returns...but wants street named after Russian?
and you shod STOP Trump - he is a dictator!
@jaketapper that's how you get tough w/Russia; select committee? special prosecutor? no. Changing street names will show them
Republcans are about performative patriotism.Instead of naming a street,you should be investigated the Russian mole in the WH
Hear! Hear! I 2nd that! Rubio, is such a Hypocrite! 
@McFaul securing independent validation there are no security risks in the WH would send a stronger message
you get this done, I stop calling you little Rubio!
You Russian Conspiracy Theorists crack me up
@jaketapper You know who else won't be quiet, your constituents - the people who voted for you in Nov. and you won't meet.
who cares. Rubio is weak.  Lied about being in Europe to dodge constituents.  That's a weak, weak leader and MAN.
@jaketapper investigate Trump. Teach the same lesson.
@McFaul or, you know, you could investigate the ties our current commander in chief has to Russia to send the same message?
@Kasparov63 Great idea!
#FullRepeal Stay focused!
@McFaul how abt investigating Russian ties to admin & interference in election!
outstanding little marco!! I am IN!!!!
Why are you more concerned w/dissidents in Russia than @realDonaldTrump having Russian ties?  Stop ignoring #Trumprussia
If Mr.Rubio SERIOUSLY believes that Putin ordered Nemtsov's murder it tells me a lot about the level of Rubio's intellect.
all it will remind is who the true master of these "Putin dissidents" is. Discrediting them even further.
нам всё равно!  НемцовоГозманамиАмнуэлями русофобы, бабники, либерота... 
Короче, бездельник .
@marcorubio you're a joke. Im embarrassed for your wife and kids! #trumprussia #russiagate #trumpdossier #doyourjob
Better focus on 45's attempts to silence the press, hide taxes, Russian connections instead of grandstanding.
@jaketapper Dissidents in Russia won't be silenced, but those in America are when the press and critics are attacked. Hmm.
coward
offer boulevard against the US Embassy called the name of Snowden
Yet you support Putin's puppet... #hypocrite
so you got his permission first?
@jaketapper What??? He still has #Trump
Surprised they aren't naming it after Trump!
1 Boris Nemtsov Plaza or 22715 Boris Nemtsov Walk?
It should be made. Nemtsov is the hero of the USA. He helped  #Оbama‘s team to fight against Russia
you're a joke Rubio
You are a joke. No war with Russia, no weapons to Ukraine, no war mongering, no more wars. Focus on our country
there are 1000 journos and Intel working asa network at this very moment how long do you think it will take ?Hint count to 10
Do you understand that because of your initiative may have been killed Vitaly Churkin?
@jonfavs @jonlovett @TVietor08 Check out Rubio tackling the big issues.
@jaketapper Rename 16th Street?
Excellent idea!!!
Senator Rubio, knock this nonsense off and get to work. Get with Cruz, Paul and Lee and ditch McCain and Graham.
Seriously? Why not investigate Trump ties to Russia? Is the @GOP machinery threatening you so much?
@McFaul Really, a great idea! Now, please hold @GOP accountable. Otherwise this is like sipping champagne on a sinking ship.
@jaketapper Rubio the coward. No integrity AT ALL. #Tillerson #russiagate #Coward
Marco, no time for town halls but you have time for this bull**** legislation? You are embarrassing FL.
@Kasparov63 #MarcoRubio #DoYourJob #DontheCon #CountryBeforeParty
@McFaul He finally sponsors legislation for window dressing but can't face constituents?
@McFaul oh how wonderful you taunt the puppet master but refuse to address the puppet. Why party b4 country?
- Drop the Russia crap.  Cut taxes and repeal Obamacare!
@McFaul Yet you let a little ole town hall silence you!
LOL  seriously? You've been complacent w/ #Trumprussia you think some damn street is gonna make up for our lost democracy?
@McFaul Are those...are you getting pimples?  Oh wait...I think...I'm not sure but...is Marco growing balls?  Are those balls
@McFaul Senator, quit with the gimmicks and support an independent commission to investigate Trump's ties to Russia.
Piss Putin off&we get to see the truth of what's going on.I didnt believe it before but @POTUS is definitely hiding something
empty symbolism. :( Party before country.
#BorisNemtsov - a thief and a murderer. And Senator Rubio - cheap populist.
And yet, you refuse to meet with constituents. Confused about your commitment to free speech & assembly. @McFaul
From the hypocrite Senator Rubio who supports Putin's puppet!!
Make sure it's a one-way, dead end street; and name it after yourself and your party.
@jaketapper sick
Are there any other empty gestures you're planning this week?This one is so laughably pointless, I'm sure you must be tired.
Go get him L'il Mario
Rubio, 

You are officially IRRELEVANT. 

Signed, 
Everybody
@jaketapper Commendable and all, but you have no interest in investigating possible treason and you're dodging constituents.
That's an idea !
maybe should should rename Calle Ocho to #noshowmarco
@jaketapper Perhaps instead of trolling Russia, you could do something substantive, like investigate the hacking the election
it's a good move. have you come up with a name for the independent commission to look into ties between trump camp and putin?
maybe focus on your constituents and your own dissendents, rather than worrying about streets in DC. #AttendYourTownHalls
if u need me to go to the White House or kremlin I'll go these Islamic raticalist we can't be captors  a bad war in u favor
your best or move is to igknowledge Isis as a threat attack them embrace trump and eliminate them
You know what else would remind Putin, maybe supporting investigation of Russian influence in administration.
@jaketapper, investigating this administration's contacts with Russia would be better.
investigating Trump's ties to Putin would probably send a clearer message.
trump wants the same agenda terrorist abolished and us and Russia allied we aren'tscared they hate caucaisions Russ or us
@jaketapper what U need to remember is your Constituents won't either but your safe you have 6 years to be the Titanics Capt
Do something substantive for a change,Senator.
North Korea needs a check vx should come upon there leader killing his servicemen we don't want to use nuclear what can u do
@bethanyshondark except that he's dead...so I don't think Putin is too worried re street naming.
@jaketapper do think this will make people forget you blowing off Russian influence in election and WH? #coward
The cynical opportunism of #LittleMarco and the #GOP can shift the focus but NOT the smell #TrumpRussia #TREASON
@jaketapper do we need to rename 1600 penn as well?
You know what would send a better message. Investigating Russia/Putin/Trump interference in US election.
the democrats and media is fighting him he makes them look stupid join to fight Isis with the us and sanctions will drop we
Why don't Remind Trump That?
@jaketapper maybe naming in Trump Lame (oops, typo..
Lane) would be appropriate.
You know what would also be good? INVESTIGATING HOW PUTIN TAMPERED WITH OUR ELECTION &!TRUMP 'S INVOLVEMENT! You chickenshit.
@jaketapper dear Sen. Rubio stop being a rubber stamp for teeny weeny pres. trump
@Kasparov63 I just hope the Russians respond in kind with Trump Avenue
he thinks logically for the best of anti terrorism help him not to inialate the adversary
@jaketapper what? You better show up to your town hall rather than coming up with stupid idea like this.
1) Are you kidding me? 

You're letting his puppet loot our country & you think renaming a street is "sending a message?"
3) The American lives we be your fault.  You could prevented what's coming, simply by upholding the constitution
Donald trump is a genius well over he's looking out for ur people too
#AssHat
continuing with that theme, how bout we name the street in front of McConnells house "Elizabeth Warren Blvd."
better yet, actually stand up to Putin for real and investigate his bestest and orangest friend
nuclear is peace because of it destruction for years help trump defeat Isis and sanctions will fall
Not giving an audience to your dissidents is a lesson that is only lost on he who has silenced his conscience. @jaketapper
Nor will #TheResistance
@Kasparov63 And embolden you to attend town halls with constituents
if u worked with trump we could destroy Isis that would probably drop ur sanctions we want the same thing the Cold War is ov
show up to a townhall so we can remind you of how you tried to silence your constituents
Super. Now, about the indep investigation regarding the Russians... If you pursue this, then we may let you keep your job.
@jaketapper Why don't you just do a real investigation?
just go along as Trump tries to silence the American press huh Little Marco
@Kasparov63  Please you are such a phony. Meet with your constituents! This announcement is a smokescreen for cowardice.
this is ridiculous. You think they care about the name of the street? They just bought you a new president. 
@jaketapper Senator, please respect your constituents. The American people need you. Investigate Trump team and Russia.
@Kasparov63 What a hollow gesture. I'm sure Putin is really intimidated by his puppet's puppet.
@Kasparov63 Wonderful!  About as effective as "hashtag diplomacy," no doubt!
Better yet, stop #TrumpRussia.
#Crimea #Ukraine #RussiaInvadedUkraine #MH17
@jaketapper yep that'll do it!!
Doesn't mean **** if there's no formal investigation into Trump-Russian ties
@Kasparov63 
@jaketapper bro,have u lost your mind?putin dont care
Marco must be mentally sick!!
I think the US needs to rename the street in front of White House as Immigrant Street to remind u of origins.
Really? You think he cares when the Republicans are keeping his guy in the White House? #TrumpRussia
do we have to rename w Kennedy Blvd to finally get your attention?
Investigating the 2016 election and the Trump-Russia ties will remind Putin the USA won't be infiltrated @SenRubioPress @jaketapper
Gosh, that's a swell gesture. But maybe you should think about not carrying water for treason.
Hows that #Trumprussia inquiry going or #TrumpTaxes 
We should get our house in order before taking to the streets.
@jaketapper Should rename it Trump Street. The own him as already!
@jaketapper What streets should we name to stop him from silencing American dissidents thru Trump? #freepress
@jaketapper Marco, cut the window dressing and lead your party by demanding an investigation!
.@SenRubioPress .@FaithRubPol That's cute and all, but how about investigating Russian election interference?
You renaming it The Putin Parkway? #littlelyingMARCO #goplies #DoYourJob #persist #resist #TheResistance #Trumprussia
@jaketapper That Marco is brilliant. Well done from across the aisle.
@jaketapper Ok, well you and the GOP certainly have been silenced about everything going on with YOUR president.
@jaketapper That is quite possibly the worst use of time & resources all funded by taxpayers. Do your job! Stop effing around
Naming a street is meaningless. Investigating Russian hacking and Trumps ties to Putin is what America needs. Do your job.
@MaxBoot why don't you call on Trump to release his tax returns
@jaketapper Listening to your constituents should be more important than naming a street.  Stop wasting tax dollars
@jaketapper Yes Senator, dissidents.  Like the ones you fear from a town hall meeting.
@jaketapper #IndependentInvestigation
give me a break. GOP has introduced laws in 18 states to silence Americans. Do something about that.
Only investigations into Putin's impact on the election and contacts with @realDonaldTrump campaign will be silenced!
@jaketapper are you freaking serious? Investigation into #TrumpRussian ties would be better.
Can we rename K Street to Primrose Path?
Try pushing for an investigation of Trumps collusion with Russia in hacking the election. Or are you just little Rubio ?
Constituent here...may I suggest spending your time actually investigating ties to Russia or perhaps hosting a town hall?
What about the guy at the White House? Keep ur shallow pranks to yourself.
@jaketapper oh! Now u come out from under your rock.. Meet with your constituents or crawl back under little Marco!
legendary cowardice
Nice symbolism - now investigate #Putin manipulating #US elections! Protect our #Democracy & #Constitution! @jaketapper
@kenkircher1 Hold town hall meetings so we can tell you we don't buy your mierda, Marco. #marcorubioisasmarmyshit
How about meeting with your constituents? That would be a start.
this is a useless, empty gesture.
@jaketapper so weak
@jaketapper Is this the same brave Senator who can't back a probe into Russia Trump ties or his own constituents?
@jaketapper Good Idea but Putin is in the White House.
@jaketapper just show up at Townhalls. Trump walked over u n campaign & u haven't the courage 2 standup now like all GOP!
Yeah, that'll show em. Weak. Sauce.
I'm renaming the street in front of your office #WheresMarco Way. We'll just meet there

@Action2gethrTB @Indivisible_TPA @SenRubioPress
@jaketapper Yeah. That ought to do it. No investigation needed. Problem solved!
so I assume next up is investigating Trump's ties to Russia and his tax returns or is being a Russian puppet ok
@jaketapper talk tough little Marco it's all you've got #ImpeachTrump #Release45Taxes
@jaketapper Yes I'm sure Putin wonders about the address of the RU embassy in the US while ordering RU diplomats killed.
@jaketapper

Rubio is another all talk, no action, GOP Trump enabler.
Show me something senator or please be quiet.
@jaketapper Yes, let's worry about a damned street name. Confirmation #Trump has something on you too, eh? FL is embarrassed!
@jaketapper Marco you act & think like a high school student council member not a US Senator!!
Do your job! Special Prosecutor to Investigate that Orange Monster.
Yeah, unlike silly things like "investigating treason" or "questioning corrupt behavior".
@jaketapper - Big deal! Where is #Rubio's concern for #Russian interference for #Trump in U.S. Election? #TrumpRussia
