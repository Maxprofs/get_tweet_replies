He should have been fired.  He could cost a veteran his life because of the irresponsibility of the VA system. I lost my husband to it.

Punch a reporter and get elected to Congress and the GOP leadership has yet to condemn his actions
Neither should the VA!!! Do something about it Shulkin
Marco. A bill to stop this? Crickets
When are you going to do something about the foreign doctors put in the VA that are switching out meds & harming our veterans?
Our vets deserve better then thise
Really OMG WHY? Get him out he is no good. Who made this call? This is 

I agree
VA is a DISGRACE and has been for a VERY LONG TIME
My father's #GrandOldParty not the @gop of today. #Russia is NOT our FRIEND! #TreyGowdy @rodblum @vp @housegop @marcorubio #maga #SEO #rt
Thank You @BarackObama for showing the world that #America is still the #LandOfTheFree #HomeOfTheBrave @potus45 betraying #AMERICA!. #RT
New Circa Report proves Obama illegally spied on Americans for yrs., seriously violating the 4th Amendment. What are you doing about this!
Really, yet OIG sanction and this leader is still in charge and you do nothing? http://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-15-02560-365.pdf …
Yes we need #accountability
I notice no tweet on cbo score. 23,000,000 fewer insured but you complain about va care. Hypocrite marco
My doctor, messed up my meds, said I was a alcoholic.Covered up,by putting I was a alcholic in my records. I pulled them for evidence .
Sad thing is. It was PTSD not alchol! I have my records to show this is true. He messed my PTSD medication up and tossed me to the wolves!
@POTUS @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @MilitaryTimes @SecShulkin  Let's fire this idiot mentioned above. I have my records, but no one is listening!
Don't ignore this Mr. Shulkin. I will be heard!
VA doctors are not the cream of the crop
. Only veterans should be in charge of veterans affairs.  You people dont respect us.
Ya can't get VA to take care of my service connected injuries. I'm paying mad stacks monthly out of my pocket for what they should be doing
@marcorubio defends #trumpcare #ahca cutting #MedicAid #foodstamps #WIC from #23MILLION #Americans.#trumpbudget #TAXCUTS4TOP1% #IMPEACH! #rt
Sounds like the Cleveland, Ohio VAH.
Except for HCA and Florida Gov. Rick Scott. He pleaded the 5th, got no jail time for the largest Medicare fraud in history.

McConnell: Trump's presidency is "indistinguishable" from what a Jeb Bush, Rubio administration would look like http://hill.cm/pPOrc51  
The Tomah WI doctor who treated our son was the candy man, still issues with that facility.
I can honestly say the care in Orlando VA is now very good.  Otherwise most places it is just horrible.
I'm curious how people who served their time should be able to earn a living? Should they all go on welfare?
One of our employees hasn't shown up to work for 2 months may finally get fired? We can allocate the $ somewhere else for veterans.
Need to fire the POS
Thank you for your support of this legislation. Only way to reform the VA making vets the first priority not docs!
I am glad you think that because the #VA has been getting away with murder for years! Now you will cut #Vets benefits with this nee budget?!
After 30 days in jail, a vet loses his benefit!
Good as long as u don't abuse the authority! Previous culture condemns whistleblowers. VA is all about the good old boys.  Screw up-move up!
You sir are clueless and the VA has proven over the years that thay don't give a Damm about vets!! Where's the number we can call!!!!
no wonder im going on 18 years for a simple claim.  this is dispickable!  @POTUS
Not very many companies (public or private) would rehire if one of their employees were convicted of a felony. Was a "demotion" in order?
thank you for your leadership! You have our full support
whos claim is he working on?
You break our laws you should lose your benefits. Enough coddling. Time to be responsible adults
Then why are they returning?
The union has brought problems forward. Then management attacks. Don't buy the union bashing.
Very true. Strange policy? In other sectors they would've been blackballed on any possible future employment. U commit a crime U go to jail
Yes Sir that person should be fired without a doubt should be fired it should be put on his record and then higher or a veteran
How can you have accountability when you have a registered sexual offender working in labor relations! @HouseVetAffairs
Totally agree. AFGE plays a BIG role in the lack of accountability. It seems there is only accountability for whistleblowers. Best of luck!
Hear no see no
Question: What % of VA employees are Veterans?
Very few from what I hear.
Dwayne Thurman HUD/VASH counselor killed his wife and still works for the Spokane VA. Case is still active too.
Hes never been placed on admin leave or anything. Look it up its all over the Spokesman Review and CBS KREM news
Exactly!  Either dump the union or rewrite the contract
@AmericanLegion I believe the federal employee statute states if you are convicted of a crime that is grounds for termination...
You are the secretary, do something about. Vets should run the VA. @realDonaldTrump please make a change.
don't hide behind the government to do the right thing. Put a Vet in as Sec and U Secretaries.
You're pathetic. You need to help these poor people with addictions instead of just tossing them out like they're nothing.
Again... Fire the manager for not doing their job. Obviously the 'executive lobotomy' you received was a splendid success. #quitscapegoating
If supvsr didn't document prior issues properly (like most FedGovt supvsrs) then you have no recourse
There is no accountability in YOUR office!!!!!
No other hospital system would deny speaking with their top man as you have done with my advocate and myself.
Was approved for retro pay and is at RO. When asked when I get money, answer is "it is a need to know basis" and "when they feel like it"
And we are watching you VERY CLOSELY to make sure you CLEAN it up! Hopeful for Success! #MAGA
Could you provide proof with your claim?
MA"VA"GA!
They want to privatize VA fool
