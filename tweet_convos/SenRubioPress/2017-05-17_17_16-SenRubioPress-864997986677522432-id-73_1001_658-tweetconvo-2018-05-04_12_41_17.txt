God bless you, Sen. Marco Rubio. We're very thankful for all you do in favor of our democracy.
Unless we are planning on taking over #Venezuela for their #oil, can you focus on #Florida and #America #AmericaFirst #tcot #maga @gop
Nnbpp,x,
Why don't you condem this here in the nation's Capitol
Senator u should take a look to those "chavistas" living here #Miami like Kings with money stolen from #Venezolanos, they should b punished
Maduro Chavez Regime living in US, purchase many things for Regime that shoot peacefull Protestors. We are close to have another Cuba. Help
Thanks Mr Rubio
maybe you should concentrate on would-be dictator and traitor @realDonaldTrump
Yeah, #Americafirst Remember?
I disagree w/u on everything but I thank you for this. Venezuela's opposition needs to know what they are doing is not in vain.
Maduro and his cronies should receive English courses in a Federal Prison ASAP! They are deeply involved in undermining regional security
Thanks @SenRubioPress we are deeply thankful for what You can do for us.
@gemiluna Excelente intervención gracias por su gran ayuda la historia cde nuestro país nunca lo olvidara

You should be condemning Mussolini Trump... But we will remember you played politics instead of truth.. Who you support tells me who you are
We will vote them out! @SenRubioPress @CommishDiaz @NicolasMaduro
thank you senator Rubio. We need more sanctions to be applied to the thugs who support the dictatorship
Winston vallenilla le toca renovar la visa, ese chavista que se beneficia de los dolares del pueblo deben negarle la visa americana
Nunca deje que un payaso como este influya en nuestros países. Suficiente hombres somos y no necesitamos alienados ni estúpidos como éste.
Thank you senator but that wont work. Vzla needs stronger measures. Think Gambia.
Thank you @marcorubio and good bless you!...
thanks Marco Rubio for taking time to think of Venezuela. You and Justin Trudeau have done something that many haven't.
Dios lo Beniga, necesitamos ayuda
But what about Saudi Arabia's Regime ?
Thank you Senator, the help is needed. Venezuela has thugs in the Government!
Many of your "protesters " attack LEOs, set fires, block roads carry weapons. #DontTryThisAtHome
As your constituents condemn you for not having #TownHall meetings.
#Fidel #SANCTI #Escambray  En Cuba comunista  las elecciones son fraude,  Partido comunista esta en poder por fraude.
We don't want fake elections, the dictatorship must end, then provisional government, new voters register, new powers and elections.
Thank you  Senator Rubio for your support and fight for a FREE Venezuela
Please add to your condemn list, PUTIN, ERDOGAN, AL-ASSAD,  DUTERTE, you know all TRUMP'S HEROES.
Wait. Ur actually taking a position on something? I wonder when that will change. Remember immigration?
SOS VZLA - @globalnewsto @CityNews Here you have a very clear message from our Friend @marcorubio about what is going on in Venezuela -thx

Should watch South of The Border by Oliver Stone on YouTube 
We need support from the #EEUU : sanctions against #HumanRights Violators and STOP BUY OIL at TERRORIST DICTATORSHIP in #Venenzuela
sanctioning only makes eco sit worse--more rioting--more people die--maybe civil war...been down this route before...
Marco rubio no es el senador que no cree en el calentamiento global?
SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS HURRY UP
Urgent help now
 #SosVenezuela
But you support @realDonaldTrump after he took Venezuelan cash from those cronies and probably Russian too. Sad and unpatriotic
Thank You Senator Rubio. Please do not forguet to freeze their assets (extended families included) within the US and overseas where possible
So glad you never let up on Venezuela!
Thanks for these strong and very needed words @SenRubioPress
I condemn Venezuelan dictator @NicolasMaduro for murdering protesters and call for more of his cronies to be sanctioned. #Venezuela 
Thank you so much and God bless you Mr Rubio 
Make it 10x harsher sanctions on Maduro Regime. deported All Chavistas who living in the US! Keep welcome pro-US Vzan Opponents in the US

Thank you 
excellent speech senator
Senador no dejen sólo al pueblo de Venezuela, que dolor como están matando a los jóvenes sólo por protestar y querer libertad.
#sosvenezuela #sosvenezuela
Thank you for being our voice in the American Senate! You only speak with the truth! We really need help! Maduro is a genocide #SOSVenezuela
#PuertoRico @ricardorossello @Almagro_OEA2015 #SosVenezuela
Maduro isn't a dictator but a tyrant. In #Venezuela we're under a tyranny.
@marcorubio @ASH_hematology Thank you very much, for caring 

@elcitizen @NicolasMaduro Venezuela necesita ayuda YA,están matando a ls jóvenes!hoy hay 7 heridos graves de bala.Dios mío.
Going to condemn Trump's crony, Erdogan's thugs for beating up peaceful American protesters today?
Statement is pretty damn watered-down though.
At least he said something. He usually stays away from anything that's within 6° of Donald Trump.
So... We know, every country in this world hate him... Do something, just saying "I condemn him" is TOTALLY useless.
It should be fast! They are Killing us! #Help
