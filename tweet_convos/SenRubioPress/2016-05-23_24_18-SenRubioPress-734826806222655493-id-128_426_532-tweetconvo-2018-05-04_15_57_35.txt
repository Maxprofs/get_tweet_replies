TOO MANY PASSENGERS AND NOT ENOUGH SEATS? HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS APPROPRIATE SOME MONEY FOR MORE DOCTORS. THEN YOU CAN TWEET.
The VA is a corrupt sinking ship. They would only throw the money away & no doctors would be hired
OKAY THEN FINE DO SOMETHING ELSE. DOING NOTHING AT ALL AND THEN WHINING ABOUT DISNEYLAND QUOTES IS DUMB
Get your facts straight Rubio is working on this and working hard. TRUMP owes VETS money he promised.
SHOW ME THE MONEY SYLVIA
You should ask Trump that question.
THE DUDE'S NOT IN CONGRESS...
The dude raised money for the VETS 6 million and didn't deliver.
@DeptVetAffairs "Misstatement"=LIED Why was Sec. Mickey Mouse McDonald not fired for LYING???

@marcorubio
U can't make this up - candidate calls opponent unsafe, unhinged, incompetent and then says I'll support him.Self-awareness zero
@SenRubioPress 
#ISupportIsrael #ISupportRubio Because God is Real & so is He
Veteran's What about middle class people they want to go too, to Disney specially their kids is their dream to go one day?
We are living the Year of the Moron.
@DeptVetAffairs Does Sec. Mickey Mouse McDonald use VA hospitals? Does he wait the usual time or get special treatment? @marcorubio
you comment on VA, but illegals and Muslims have no wait, get better benefits $, that is why we support #trump
maybe Mickey and Minnie can walk him to the unemployment office where he belongs. Thanks to Obama far too many know that line
@PoliticlyJaded @SenJohnMcCain was notified by the whistle blowers years before the scandal he did nothing
My disgust is about the VA Chiefs comment. I've known about VA issues since retirement too.
#NeverDems
Isn't that the truth. Obama is a piece of shit and so is Hiliary Clinton. She should be in prison
Although the verbiage is not optimal, the sentiment is shared. I would also put #CrazyBernie in there as well.
@SenRubioPress Rubio for VP #MakeAmericaGreatAgain @ConcernedVets @Vets4TrumpORG @VetsStump4Trump
@SenRubioPress
And Trump has said worse things every damn day for the last 10 months, yet you support him now?  You are SAD!!!!!!  Grow a pair
@FreeBeacon you can not let that thing represent all republicans...he will destroy the party and the country #NoTrump2016
@FreeBeacon Why not make a requirement that all employees of the VA be vets? Level of care and concern for vets might improve
Regarding the Disney/Veteran comparison- I never heard of a single person who died because "The Matterhorn" line was too long.
Perhaps if @realDonaldTrump actually donated the $6 million he said it wouldn't be so bad...
@rlboutin @FreeBeacon
@FreeBeacon Perhaps the VA should be privatized so the accountability will mean something.  Small business do not wait in lines.
Please do something about it.  We really want you.
out-of-touch VA McDonald probably took his family to Disneyland with his big $$$ bonus! Our tax dollars at work ... NOT
and people think God hasn't judged America! Pretty sure this is proof He has.
Doesn't think much of veterans.  Worships  Locobama.
a veteran is not some person in line for a ride. & Disney does track wait times. That how u get that "time from this point" sign
@FreeBeacon let's put him on a permanent ride out of DC
Is he fired yet? Dumb *** comments. Disney is a choice the VA us NOT
Those VA waits wouldn't be so long if your party didn't start so many needless and expensive wars. Just saying. @marcorubio
Trump will nickname him Daffy Duck
Very sad.
We need to take better care of our veterans. We should abolish the VA and give the vets insurance to go where they choose.
horrific
Missed you at the NRA convention
maybe he wants us vets to sign up for a fast pass!
how does he still have a job? put him and the rest of the Govt employees on the same plan and not tricare and lets watch
fire him!
Outrageous
RUN WITH TRUMP AS V.P. AND HELP GET RID OF PROBLEM.
this Assclown and the one over at the IRS need to be removed!
@FreeBeacon unconscionable! We need your leadership Senator! #DraftMarco CRUSH Hilary return dignity to America
@sleepywizard The lack of appreciation for our #Vets by this admin is breathtaking. Reduced them to amusement park fans...
@SpeakerRyan On behalf of myself and my fellow veterans, we demand that the VA Secretary be fired!
@FreeBeacon what an analogy. They're not even remotely alike.
Nope what you can't make up is the fact that little marco lost his senate seat and presidential primary because of stupidity.
Dept. heads...this is where we need to clean house! Find a way to fire them, not transfer or retire them.
Trump needs to clean house starting with this clown and justice dept
Fake outrage much homie.if u showed up to vote once in a while u could do something about it# little Marco # fundraising queen
Oh yay and the consequences are exactly the same. #sarcasm
loser Marco!
my kids are so terribly annoying while waiting or a ride at Disney at any waiting period here or while driving to Disney - sucks
@FreeBeacon At least at Disney you have fun after the wait.
except it's not the happiest place. Usually scared worried who would take care of your family if God forbid. But u know.
Until these people are held accountable and bad ones are FIRED not promoted or transferred, none of this will be fixed.
some adults hate being at Disney World, some geographically unfortunate have to go to Disney Land and hate it even more.
this is a typical Obama appointee.

Disney measures wait times. Their app tracks it. Unbelievable. Where is the VA app? This is their lives, not a ride on Dumbo!
because he was a vet, hospital and surgeons wrote off what he couldn't pay.
fortunately I worked for surgeons at the time and they repaired all damage done during cancer treatment.
@FreeBeacon politicians still don't get it instead of posting about it make some recommendation draft legislature something
VA waiting time us crazy. My brother had a bowel blockage after cancer treatment and they wanted him to wait 3wks b4 scan.
@FreeBeacon
dumb when indisputable evidence is so readily available.
I've worked in VA Hospital while REAGAN/Republicans cut their Budgets! So how come I have to wait 6+ Months for Dr. at Civilian
@FreeBeacon pitiful.. especially since it's been a general complaint and Veterans need both physical and mental healthcare.
.@marcorubio That's what happens when you drop the ball, wasting your time trying to shut down states' #poker websites for Sheldon Adelson.
@FreeBeacon not a very wise comment . What in the world was he thinking? He will never live that one down.
this is why we need you to run 3rd party!! Hillary and Trump won't fix this!
hahaha mr Roboto
at least at Disney you can get a fast pass.
#va secretary is an idiot.  Wait times ARE part of overall satisfaction and #Disney is always working to improve theirs.
As I earlier told Sen. Paul Ryan, " There is nothing #MickeyMouse about my suffering in pain 24/7 !" NO, MOST OF US AREN'T HAPPY
Republicans want to privatize the VA. Why not take a club and beat wounded and sick vets as soon as they come home?
so people are dying while waiting in line at Disney? unreal
@FreeBeacon Don't think the Disney line is life or death, big difference
Can you do something about #ObamaCare before June? How am I supposed to afford $1,800 a month? It's CRIMINAL what Obama has done
If not for medicare I would be fined for not having the money to pay $10k a month for medical. Due to depression
It's just crazy what #Obamacare has done. It's DESTROYING peoples' lives.
except for the CEO's in the insurance giants. Their profits has gone through the roof since it went through.
do something about!  Let's see some action!  After hearing Ben Rhodes & the WH dupe u senators about the Iran deal. Do something
@FreeBeacon and what is little Marco the senator doing about this..or is he spending all his time worrying about Venezuela?
@FreeBeacon well a hour or two wait is still better then a year or two wait for medical care
@FreeBeacon He would, both are anti-American.
feel free mr secretary to submit your resignation by tonight
@FreeBeacon  What a shame. Risked their lives for our freedom and can't get needed medical care.Keep fighting for our vets MARCO
Disgusting!  We can't afford 8 more years of this! You're a good guy. Time to get on the Train.
Not exactly. He said, "What’s important is, what’s your satisfaction with the experience?” Go home, Marco. Your time is past.
At least at Disney they make accommodation for those with special needs.
@FreeBeacon been hearing good things about Marco...way to step up...
So yet another politician puts his foot in his mouth, shock horror.
@FreeBeacon he is in a fantasy land just like obama
@FreeBeacon can any of the vets get FastPasses?
@FreeBeacon the Secretary of Veterans should be ashamed of himself for allowing that to go on he should stand up to President
@FreeBeacon Should be replaced immediately.
what.....the.......seriously???!!!!
you all should be demanding his resignation.
Another moron in the Administration-Go figure! IT tells you how seriously they take Vet lives when they say something that dumb!
How disrespectful can you get?
Idiot.
I was recently denied service when I'm 100%
everyone e mail McDonald ask why he said that. Robert.a.mcdonald@va.gov  I know I am going to
@realDonaldTrump I just sent an e mail to mcdonald. We'll see if he has the balls to respond
he lied about his service and he's mocking vets and he's rich why want the press attack him?
.@marcorubio Is there a way to privatize the VA? Let vets use any hospital? US should not be in this business, but owes to our vets.
its disgusting!Please come back 4 POTUS!We need u dnt leave uswith @realDonaldTrump n @HillaryClinton it's provenyou cn beat her
since the GOP helped put him in office u r also the blame
It's like the unpopular kid in school trying to impress the cool kids. It never goes well. He should apologize.
He should have compared it to my wait for you to shout me out and help me get votes for a scholarship http://www.wvscholar.com/vote.cfm 
-Send this man to the magic castle.
if there was a Fast Pass...
uh atlesst u can get a quick pass at Disney
you can't make this up: Rubio supports Trump #fraud
don't think you'll see Rubio campaigning for Trump.  Rubio 2020
