I'll work to ensure that if the @UN wants to continue to promote anti-Semitism & anti-#Israel views, it will do so without U.S. taxpayer $$$
I'm glad you're itching for a war. Your new #BFF is also, so we can change the alignment of power in favor of #Russia.
Actually, Israel is by far the biggest enemy to freedom today. Just look at how many thousands they've kicked of out of home
@marcorubio wait... you cried about Benghazi... then you support cut back in security at embassies???
@marcorubio Israel expands illegally is ok, Russia does it, its not ok?
@marcorubio no hes not hes looking at the bigger picture not just the one- the entire region.  Stop lying to suit your agenda
@marcorubio @tempteststorm2 ur battering of Rex Tillerson  was unnecessary today. Is is political? Ru looking to future?
#rubiocisdevelopmentallychallengedcanttellthedifferencebetweenrightandwrong Someone call a doctor.head is vacant
enemies of freedoms? If you care don't nominate Tillerson or Session.
@marcorubio you must ask Obama the same question u asked Rex Tillerson Is put in war criminal?
--'ask Obama Is Putin a war criminal? As vigorously as u drilled Tillerson
@marcorubio Speaking of "freedom's enemies", you might want Trump to stop playing footsie with Putin. Settlements r illegal.
The two-state solution was designed to produce peace. Kerry's approach is two states without the "solution," that is, peace.
@marcorubio its a misguided strategy.
-not saying theyve layed out a clear alternative, but id be happy to explain it to you.
How will the embassy be better in Jerusalem then it is in Tel Aviv? Will it bring peace and safety to Israel?
.@SenRubioPress @marcorubio So does trump.  He, Putin, and Le Pen are creating a new USSR.
. Try some fairness when you speak about Secr. John Kerry. In fact everybody has supported Israel and royally, too royally

How many Israelis have to die to allow progressive Jews in the safe United States to feel better about themselves?
the Q is how many more Israel has to murder to realize they neeed to share land
Where is your outrage with Obama?
@marcorubio Trump emasculated you during the election now you were his dog BingBing Little Marco
@marcorubio & @tedcruz Push Bill That Wld Hold Diplomatic Security FundsHostage.#absurd http://heller.senate.gov/public/_cache/ …
This is why we need your vote! To confirm Pres-Elect Trump's nominees. Please vote for them. God bless you & fam!
@marcorubio you voted for him.
Stand tall - protect our country & its democracy. Have you forgotten what your family ran from? Use your power.
@marcorubio Republicans R threat to freedom and democracy. Have you listened to your incoming tyrant?
@marcorubio you say you support Israel but don't support 4 million US citizens of Puerto Rico...ur just like trump
@billpostmus Stand with Israel !!!
move their. Enough of this blind idiotic support to most racist country in the world
@marcorubio .  Shame on you for voting for Tillerson.  How low can your standards go?
@marcorubio Hyperbole gets us no closer to peace. It only makes you feel good.
how long is America going to support Israel?
@marcorubio wow it's so clear why nothing ever gets done on Capitol Hill. Do U all sit down & tweet every 15 minutes.
Actually we've been supporting a two-state solution since WW2. Read a history book and stop listening to the #altright.
Hail Kerry, Hail Kerry, Hail Kerry!!!
.@SenRubioPress It must suck for you to work for such a corporate whore. And he never shows up to work! #UniteBlue
our 1st amendment is gone! watch video!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvCi1qekfdA …
@marcorubio re:Rex Tillerson Keep friends near,enemies close negotiate with friend http://Putin.Vote  yes4 confirmation
@marcorubio once again the Republicans have just decided to cater to themselves and reduce ethical oversight.
don't you repubs have a mind of your own? You have to operate in lockstep as if this was a dictatorship?
You're a wimp or you would talk of Trump's catering "to the demands of freedom's enemies" being pals with Putin.
@marcorubio    Please give this to the Senate Intelligence Committee.  http://patruso111.blogspot.com 
@marcorubio stand up again a corrupt, treasonous, 
President elect and his cronies
Senador y lo mismo está haciendo Kerry y Obama aquí en Colombia apoyando a los asesinos de las FARC.Por favor ayúdenos
@marcorubio Freedom's enemies? People looking to remain in their rightful land? Read at least their history not football mgs.
@marcorubio  thank you Senator for taking a stance against possible genocide once again
Kerry is still recovering from being Swift boated... He sure does like to talk about himself
@stateofisrael Freedoms enemies? Really? Is that the best you got?! How about charging him w #treason for aiding & abet Hamas
@marcorubio Senator Rubio stay behind president Trump, Republicans need to stay United. End this corruption called.. "UN".
@marcorubio
Trump's buddy, Don King, beat an employee to death with his bare hands over $600. "The beating was a brutal, almost demonic assault." 
really, marco? you actually believe israel's settlements in occupied territories are a positive for peace?
@marcorubio Forget Kerry. Theres a larger issue. The US cant keep her head in the sand re occupation. Even Bush knew that.
Israel founder Begin, knifed to death Palestinian villages. The goal was to expand from the 1st. They know this.
Given its history Brits/Begin they have no cause to trust. Most Jews dont want settlements & feel damaged by them
@marcorubio US media on Israel is pure propaganda. Tell me a part of u wasnt sicken at the bombing of Palestinian hospitals.
@marcorubio go Kerry!! He speaks the truth! Sometimes the truth hurts. Israel is a terrorist state. Israel is nothing
@marcorubio No 2state solution with Israel's illegal settlements in middle of Palestine. Israel is 1 immoral apartheid state
#defundtheUN it is not longer an org of peaceful Nations now filled w/ murderous dictators & terrorists stp funding PLO
Disgraceful!!!!!
@marcorubio  so just continue to give Israel billions with no responsibility to do what Christ like. #Israelneedsjesus
@marcorubio Freedoms enemies? What do you plan on doing about Russia's involvement in our election? #hypocrite
@marcorubio It's up to you and congress to do something Obama must be stopped
@marcorubio i guess Russia is our Friend now.! Why Little Marco never Barks at Trump for sucking off Putin.! He scare aint he
@marcorubio This is moral clarity we need in defense of Israel. UN is now farcical & dangerous; end US financial support now.
Well said Senator January 20 can't come soon enough this administration is shameful!
@marcorubio Say goodbye to Obama's crew and their destructive policies.  So very sorry, Israel.
@marcorubio   Sen. Rubio, once again, panders to a random group. Wonder who it will be next week.
So Sec Kerry is against freedom now? Is he a communist too? Or is it that you just disagree with this one thing?
@marcorubio Amen Marco! We must stand by Israel! God's chosen people'this administration can not leave fast enough!
1/20/17 Muslim Terrorist family will be evicted from the White House(People's House)-notice served by voters
@marcorubio.... So you choose to speak negatively instead of offering suggestions.  What a Congress we have!
@marcorubio sad and disappointing
@marcorubio y'all just want to fight everyone, huh? Not one of you in @gop are diplomats. All warmongers w/ $ interests
Thank God Kerry is out the door, and the world knows it!
Sec Kerry upheld the truth held by all member nations. Israel is destroying the two state option.
I am glad when they are gone.
It
@marcorubio Y do u HATE Reagan?  Did same thing Res 471. Get a clue. #partisanship
I am proud of sec Kerry.He might have lost in your court but won in God's court
Not surprising to see u side with a middle eastern theocracy and against America. No wonder @realDonaldTrump beat you.
These people might not be white Christians hispanics they have the right to enjoy the freedoms you do
While looking for Jewish vote also reflect on what God expects of you
@jennanjack no recordo a venezuela .donde tenemos 18 años de dictadura .hambre miseria  SOS VENEZUELA
No its called dialogue... two state solution by GOP and Dems for years ...you own this fucked up mess with TRUMP..FYI.
@RickCanton Kerry's a dipsh$t
@marcorubio That's our boy! What a miserable diplomatic record he has to show for himself. He has brought us to our knees.
@marcorubio so you are good with Israel expanding illegally??  Wow!
@marcorubio This is how the US Supported apartheid South Africa for decades and called Mandela a Terrorist. Kerry is right.
big surprise now lets fund raise off of this like the dems do. who cares what kerry thinks.
NY & cali want EC changed or seceding. Trump is a tyrant & not stable, he went against customs, please reprioritize.
@CathyTo47590555 You're a good man, Senator. Much respect, sir.
@marcorubio impeach OBAMA before he starts WWIII! He has 23 days to run havoc on the American people and other countries
@marcorubio you people are so freaking evil I can't wait until it backfire on you all no Gop are the enemies think you on top
Still bitter about the loss, eh?
@marcorubio Democrat LOSERS. 1st Gore with his faux climare change, Kerry with his anti Israel plans, what will Hillary do?
I agree.
@marcorubio Who is this "Freedom" and what does he look like?
@marcorubio Kerry NEEDS TO GO HOME. Come on Kerry You Are Done GO HOME BOY!!!!!
The only thing undermining America's standing is Trump's election. Re. Israeli setlements, the world is agreed.
Thank you @marcorubio for your unequivocal  support of Israel & the Jewish people today and everyday!
https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/09/28/the-emerging-connections-between-the-muslim-brotherhood-and-never-trump/ …
You are a broken record. You have never had the best interests of anyone but yourself in mind...typical politician!
The settlements are wrong. Threatening the UN for what amounts to a finger wagging of disapproval is also wrong.
Obama signed a $38 billion military aid package for Israel this year and you want to play the partisan card? You disappoint.
@marcorubio Por favor, Kerry dijo la verdad y Tu lo sabes.
Stop channeling Trump. You are helping further Putin's agenda to dismantle the UN and NATO? Illegal settlement issue only.
@marcorubio KEEP UP THE FIGHT FOR ISRAEL.
@marcorubio it's as if he was going to move out Earth. Kerry should take Obama w him.
Israel has the right to commit murder because someone lives on the land they owned millennia ago. Makes sense.
what people don't get is that if peace deal was done, Israel /Palestinian, Israel lose their US $$$$. @SenRubioPress @marcorubio
@marcorubio 
Kerry throws Star-of-David over the wall!
@marcorubio you say you will work to do this or that but, do any of you do anything in Congress? Not really just waste time
Your ignorance is showing.  17 dedicated people barely keep up logging the legislation of Sen. Rubio
:)
@marcorubio if the GOP no longer supports a two state solution then what is ur plan? Problems will not go away.
@marcorubio May God bless you for protecting His land and His people!
Although I believe #johnkerry tries hard, he's got this wrong!
@marcorubio @JohnKerry @realDonaldTrump Sen. Rubio: That's Partisan NONSENSE & You Know It !!
@JohnKerry and Obama are literally burning the village as they leave, should be some legal action against them.
Israel needs to start complying with the 4th Geneva Accords and stop expanding into territory that is not theirs.
3 More Weeks Ugh
"Freedom's Enemies" would be the majority of the UNSC? Like, our allies?

You're a giant breast, you know that?
@marcorubio Thanks for speaking on this @marcorubio. You are always on the right side.
God bless you Senator Rubio
