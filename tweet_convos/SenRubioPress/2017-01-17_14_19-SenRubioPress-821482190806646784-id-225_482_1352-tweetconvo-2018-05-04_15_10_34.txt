@transition2017 couldn't have anything to do with the $98,000+ @BetsyDeVos donated to you could it? #notqualified
Trump love trumps hate
no hatred here. I express my concerns. No demeaning or belittling. My goal is to go high.
Better off staying high
no negativity here. Think you should reflect on your own tweets/responses. "Libtard" is hardly showing love. Have a pleasant night
kids should be able to get the best education no matter where they live. Privatizing isn't the answer. #DumpDevos @BetsyDeVos
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos How much money did she give your campaign?
Troll
Heres a list of those she's donated to that will be voting for her confirmation.
You believe evey child deserves good education, than you should voted AGAINST @BetsyDeVos regardless how much money she has!
$98,000 reasons you voted yes.
You supported DaVos because of a different set of numbers. $98,300 to be exact. #SellOut
@transition2017 here's the list of her campaign donations. Not surprised to find you here. #DumpDevos @BetsyDeVos
you have a lot of free time!! Do you have a job other just a professional instigator?
I have a full time job, spend 100s of hours each year volunteering, and know how to take a screen shot of someone else's list.
so what is that suppose to mean you can take a screenshot?
I'm impressed
@marcorubio Precisely why you should oppose @BetsyDeVos. Please join @SenBillNelson and support the children of FL and the US
disgusting human beings
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos this is unfortunate since Betsy DeVos propped up politicians with her money Instead of schools
Trump love trumps qualified
"at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now I concede the point. They are right. We do expect something
SENATOR.  SHE HAS NEVER WORKED IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. Wishing you would be like those who #holdthefloor
for traditional American virtues. We expect a return on our investment."
No @SenRubioPress You voted to confirm @BetsyDeVos because she gave you nearly $100k. This is corruption & why I voted against you!
How can you support someone that doesn't know the laws on education?#specialneeds
and she has said herself, that her money buys people to push forward her agenda
Bullsnot Senator!  If you truly believed each child deserves a good education, you backed the wrong horse
I agree 100% Senator Rubio.
.@SenRubioPress for your constituents and America, vote NO. Our country's students deserve better. #noDevos #NoonDeVos
You also support Devos because she gave you a $98K bribe. But we don't expect you to address your own corruption.
“Our desire is to be in that Shephelah, and to confront the culture in which we all live today in ways that will
We couldn't get you show up. And then you show up to sell us out?  Explain your ethics please.
another disappointing vote for you Senator. I don't believe she will do this AT ALL, it's not just the children she'll hurt
Lobbyists shouldn't be able to buy power, so I told @senatormarco_r to say #NotoDeVos. https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/ …
You have it wrong sir.  She represents what is wrong with Washington.  1% dictating policy they know nothing about. #swamp
I support @BetsyDeVos' nomination, because every child deserves a good #education regardless of their zip code or how much money they have.
@RestlessNativ @SenRubioPress @BetsyDeVos Mario. Not good idea to destroy public education. Charter  school are terrible Choice
charter school are only responsible to stock holders
"in return. We expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy.consisting of limited government and respect
"My family is the biggest contributor of soft money to the RNC. I have decided to stop taking offense
you voted for her despite her lack of qualifications, and your constituents plea to vote NO. No excuses!!!!
Tremendously disappointed in this decision. She is horribly unqualified & will be a disaster for public ed. PLEASE RECONSIDER
Thank you!
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos and children of all religious affiliations and family backgrounds should expect the same
I proudly voted for u Marco but to vote for DeVos  has left me disappointed with you.  She doesn't rep. me or other teachers
continue to help advance God’s Kingdom, but not to stay in our own faith territory,” she said.@SenRubioPress @BetsyDeVos
.@SenRubioPress @BetsyDeVos YES, every child DOES deserve a QUALITY education, regardless of zip or $$, which is why you need to #DumpDevos
Good words to shout, but DeVos is the wrong person to represent or support
All students deserve the best education regardless of theIr wealth.Every. Single. Child. Invest in public schools
Deflect much-If you really supported education for all children you would have voted against her.
Sellout easily bought. Must awful to be so weak & have no ethics. Money talks & ethics walk away.
2020 and you are out little buddy
Flip..flop...flip...flop! For us...against us...for us against us.
Senator Rubio, every child deserves a Sec. of Education whose competence is actually IN the field of education.
Please listen to your constituents! Florida DOES NOT want DeVos! VOTE NO!!
Rubio, you accepted $98,300 in campaign $$ from Betsy DeVos & need to recuse yourself from her vote confirmation
What in her skills & experience informed your choice of candidate?asking on behalf a few million children.
Do the right thing.Keep my tax money out of private & parochial schools. Vote no on Betsy DeVos   #nobetsydevos.
Please do not support the complete privatization of America's school system and reconsider your support of #devos.
Every child regardless of their needs deserves a good education. 

You're  a disgrace.
@marcorubio 
"good #education "
"Betsy DeVos"
One of these things is not like the other
Vote NO on Betsy DeVos
I am a new resident of Florida.  Please vote NO to Betsy DeVos.  She is bad for our schools and our future!!!
Just some corrections. I support @BetsyDeVos' nomination, because she bribed me with $98,300 and money rules.
vote NO on Betsy DeVos. @SenRubioPress @BetsyDeVos
putting wholly unqualified person in charge of the DOE is not a partisan issue. DeVos is incapable of answering
you still have a chance to vote no.  All of you voicemail boxes are full at your offices so I can't leave a message!
NO!   Do no vote for her. She is not fit for the job.  It will be the last vote you will get from me Rubio.
Please show respect for nation's children & vote NO on @BetsyDeVos. Totally unqualified & will undermine fdtn. of democracy
I don't know who voted for you, it wasn't me. You are the devil's advocate. Shame on you. Remember the children
re @BetsyDeVos Come on!!!! You have glimmers of a spine and then you just cave again & again. Why do we keep electing you!!?
didn't you mean how least money a maj of the pop. has.  DISGUSTING. WILL WORK 2 ENSURE UR FAKENESS IS EXPOSED.
You have got to be kidding.  She is wholly unqualified and seems you are too.
How can U be so wrong? She is least qualified person ever nominated. Being rich does not make her right or smart
Unions don't allow BAD TEACHERS to get fired. That is the biggest reason why the Public Sch.System is a failure
VOUCHERS are the entrance to a better world. Parents pd.for Public Sch. already. They must get $ for their choice
I've taught in both http://Ed.Systems  for over 20 yrs on ea. GOOD TEACHERS DO NOT NEED UNIONS. They teach.
privatizing edu turns kid's futures to for-profit companies that exist for that purpose only – profit
if every child deserves a good education that's exactly why DeVos should be opposed!What planet r you living in?
Did you bother to check the havoc she's wrecked on MI schools? Wrong decision based solely on $$ contributions.
wow that's backwards as fuck lol
@marcorubio I think she is NOT qualified Senator--you're only supporting her because she is a major contributor!
Vote No on confirmation. No background in public education. Failed in Michigan w/charter schools. Only made $ for investors.
as an educator & parent in Florida I ask you to NOT CONFIRM @BetsyDeVos. Support public education!
you are giving public $ to private entities, & supporting an inexperienced manager. I thought you were different
I'm sorry to hear that you, who welcomed advocates of SWDs this summer can vote for @BetsyDeVos with her lack of knowledge
Disappointing decision, but fully expected. I guess that $98,000 bought your vote.
Wow.  You do?  You're hopeless.  Ashamed to have you as my senator.  She doesn't support public schools.
fam also gave $98k+ to @marcorubio campaign! How much do our public schools need to give u to earn your support?
.@BetsyDevos She doesn't have a clue about working class and poorer people. Charter schools & vouchers will segregate the poor from the rich
Yes, they do. Even PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS. Would be cool to have a director with experience in that sector.
Exactly why we should fully fund public schools instead of diverting public funds to private, unregulated schools.
ok, so your days are numbered Senator...good luck in the job market of the future.
I cannot believe that you are not willing to accept that this nominee is very against public education.
Support someone who has experience.  Vote with your conscience, Marco Rubio, not your wallet..
poor choice
#littlemarco have you watched her hearings?She should learn a bit more before becoming our education secretary.
She joins the list of bad choices. You must hate public education. Another one who is dumb as a box of rocks.
Charter schools robbed our public schools and families.  Charters are scamming tax $ and not education
Please DON'T. She is least qualified cabinet nominee. Please put country before party (and campaign donations)!
Have you lost your mind?
Senator Rubio, I am very disappointed in your support of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education! #Unqualified!
are you supporting her because she gave you $98,300.? Do you care that she has no expirience with public schools?
Every child deserves a good education, and the voucher system and Betsy DeVos will NOT accomplish that!
This is a person who does not support the public school system. She is totally unqualified for this position.
She is not qualified to lead the dept of education. Vote NO!!!!!!!!!
Did you not watch or attend the hearing? How can you support someone who is so unqualified? So disappointed!
Sadly, he's just following the money. What a coward!
Ms DeVoss is not qualified for this position. She has proven she will weaken our public schools & remove needed funds
VERY disappointed in this pick Senator.
She seems unqualified, clueless and incompetent based on her hearing performance.
I retired after 41 yrs of teaching. She had no idea about very basic education questions. Worst possible choice.
Listen to your constituents and vote NO on Betsy DeVos!
Really what an embarrassment to anyone working in or having a child in our Education System.  Find someone better
The most unqualified person in America is the best person for the job? #trumpism #unfit https://youtu.be/oNVtJFK5xdc 
I am disappointed in your backing of @BetsyDeVos Someone with zero pubic school experience should not be in that position.
PLEASE DO NOT CONFIRM,  CLEARLY DEVOS NOT QUALIFIED. from south lake county concerned parent
That's unfortunate. One would think that having someone qualified would be important to you.
If you truly felt that way you would not be supporting her nomination.
as someone who voted for you I wish you would reconsider devos. She really isn't very smart
Why would you support DeVos? She knows zero about public schools and doesn't want to educate herself on them! #DumpDevos
how exactly is she accomplishing that? by privatizing schools?plenty of research shows that does’t work
Really?  Pls sign up for remedial listening comprehension classes, you are in need
I have special needs granddaughter, under proposed plans will she still get services? She needs 1on 1 right now
She was "confused" about what IDEA was, the federal law that protects the rights of students like your granddaughter.
You have to be kidding me! This woman has zero experience and has destroyed Detroit's schools.
Ms Devos is woefully unqualified to serve as the Secretary of Education&has conflicting money issues. Vote NO
Siphoning money from public schools, redirected to private schools with religious curricula: insane.
gave you almost $100k, of course you support her @SenRubioPress!  #Disgraceful #shameonyou
Yeah, in PUBLIC SCHOOLS. She is in no way qualified to be Sec. of Education and you know it.
<#WeDontBuyIt as a "Clerical Error". Why wouldn't you've corrected that record?
Betsy Devos lied to @SenatorHassan during questioning: https://twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/821524884136325120 …
FACT:These 'Charters' can &do CHERRY PICK their students... just not ones w/disabilities.
Betsy DeVos isn’t going to stand up for students with disabilities. She just said so: 
Here's what Betsy DeVos means when she said she "Supports Public Schools". She neglected to say... "A tiny bit"
Is this really what u support? >Betsy DeVos wants to use America's schools to build "God's kingdom"  http://ln.is/www.motherjones.com/HRLiP …
#DumpDeVos #NotMySOE   
Isn't there a more appropriate person for this position? Think about it..
If I'm so wrong on Betsy DeVos, why then are Republicans conducting a shotgun hearing? Afraid Dems might reveal her extremism? #DeVosHearing 
Some of us lose sleep over things & it's my turn. Please #DumpDeVos & #RejectREX!!! It's for WE THE PEOPLE, KIDS
Do u know that > @BetsyDeVos even profited from the #FlintWaterCrisis? A dang BILLIONAIRE!!! Nice! & She still OWES $ out too
Private schools/Charters are fine but NOT w/our tax $$$. Any ole' body can open one & drain from public schools
We implore u2 re-study >@BetsyDeVos. Separate Church & State! My pastor is even against this nominee! Charters r UNSUPERVISED
Well that's a given! But dont you know that Charters discriminate? They don't accept ALL ppl. They turn ppl away!
Good. Now please get on board with Tillerson. Still feel foolish 4 supporting you. @SenRubioPress
I support @BetsyDeVos' nomination, because every child deserves a good #education regardless of their zip code or how much money they have.
@LisaAMoyer @BetsyDeVos All well and good.  But have you heard her answers?  I don't think you're on the same page.
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos you should support all of @realDonaldTrump nominees or go back to being "LIDDLE MARCO"get with it
You support her because she donated a lot of money to the GOP.  We'll blame YOU if you confirm her and she destroys public ed
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos Good educators  is needed  yet an experienced  businessman is not?
Trust  and verify  his experie
She's a horrible person and a dangerous foe of public education. She is not qualified.
If that's what you believe you most definitely don't want her....
That's why you SHOULDN'T support @BetsyDeVos. How does privatization help accessibility? Education shouldn't be pay to play
please focus on bringing FL public schools up the list of states that invest in education. She is not 1 to assist w/ that.
Thank you Sen Rubio the common core stuff they are teaching is a disaster and needs to be removed
-  Rubio's attacks on Tillerson ensures he will never get a vote from my family members.
Liar.
Every child does deserve a good education. It is Our promise & responsibility. @BetsyDeVos will not deliver such promise.
So are the vouchers gonna cover the whole cost of tuition at her Jesus Indoctrination Camps, or just some of it?
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos absolutely Sen. Rubio.
@Avik @BetsyDeVos Are you saying we should give up on public education?
@TimMoran3  @BetsyDeVos do you believe that every parent knows best for their child.  Do you believe education should be loca
What?? Is this the twilight zone?
MARCO, SUPPORT REX T... WE ARE WATCHING!!!
Marco you know she isn't qualified. Why don't you want the best for our children?
I want every parent to choose where they want to send their child
Don't you love his wisdom on this.

@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos lower taxes.  What the hell do you have to lose!
The largest charter school org in US is ..... MUSLIM. These folks talk out of both sides of their mouth. Cog Diss
this is what a contribution of 100k gets ya.  Nothing but love
That's boilerplate deform crap. How's that working in DeVos' Michigan?
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos asking you to confirm tillerson. Do your republican duty. Don't hold a grudge!!
We support Rex Tillerson
I agree and feel each student be placed with the best teacher that meets their needs Especially Special needs
then you should disqualify @BetsyDeVos based on her record alone http://wpo.st/GxLS2 
DeVos contributed $1.45 million in 2 months  to Michigan GOP lawmakers to derail bipartisan oversight provision
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos iio
And you seriously think DeVos is goal is to give EVERY child a good education or force creationism on EVERY child? Let's be honest here
@Italians4Trump @BetsyDeVos now your talking keep it real
Who cares who you support Little Marco?
>I support Betsy DeVos--just wish she'd speak-out (loudly); however, I wish #Rubio would go away! @LadyPatriot777 @BetsyDeVos
as a homeschool mom I'm totally happy about this pick...
We expect no less from you. Represent the majority of FL, not just what u want to do.
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos hmmmmmm better get that in writing
There is no such thing as a free education.Dissolve the agency!My school taxes-over $9500 a yr.
Please support our Secretary of State too. Thanks ...!
Don't agree. SURE,she's a @gop mega donor & I too believe in FULL CHOICE but her ignorance on teachers is HUGE NO.@BetsyDeVos
@Italians4Trump Something needs to change, being ranked #27 is pathetic.
Taxpayers should not subsidize the wealthy's private school educations. Separation of church and state.
I voted Trump and have 2 kids with ADHD, would this disqualify them from voucher program
@transition2017 @BetsyDeVos you need to get behind President Trump .you are showing your true colors. Big government
Interesting statement, have you seen the damage she has done to Detroit's public school system, while she profits
you support her because of very big $$$  she donated. Nations public schools will suffer.
Finally can agree with Rubio on something
I think your mistaken only zip codes included in her bribery were 4 profit charter http://schools.save  public education!
@Italians4Trump  how nice of you
"Change can only take place when you sit at the table" Steve Harvey. Steve gets it. Donald gets it. John Lewis never will.
Then put someone in there with Public education experience! She has none! Never even attended a public school!
Or regardless of their sexual orientation, too, right???
Agree Senator!

Tanx Marco 4 finally giving me something 2 read frm u! Been wondering wot u were up 2, after d Sessions hearing!
the Democrats don't the Republicans need to change you got the power Reach Out to American citizens
@msgoddessrises @BetsyDeVos why does this not surprise me
You should support all of @realDonaldTrump nominations @SenRubioPress . Your vitriol fueled questioning of Tillerman was ridiculous.
I agree. I am for school choice.
we need to teach history as it was, not as the libtards want it to be to promote their agenda
"Libtard?" Research mental retardation and write an expository essay b4 using that
every child deserves it and probably can get it in this country
