Wow, could you be more LIMP.  Your impotence is pathetic on so many levels.
not so long ago really eh Rubio.
I'm sure you "hoped" things like this wouldn't happen when you voted to confirm him.
Sending mothers to detention separating them from their children .Nazis did that They were not strong on human rights either.
and then maybe you will be all hopeful about the environment.  Eyeroll on both counts.
@WritePurpose @StateDept you sir, need to get a backbone & work for our Country, not sit back & watch trump & bannon destroy us
"Colin Powell didnâ€™t do it. Neither did Condoleeza Rice."
glad you finally said SOMETHING. Trump wants to cut SD budget by 40% what do u say?
The @StateDept is now a subsidiary of @exxonmobil. What did you expect?
REMOVE TILLERSON = RUSSIAN AND EXXON  CONFLICT OF INTERESTS = FOLLOW THE MONEY.  PUT COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY!
We do not have a Secretary of State. We have a man who is destroying our COUNTRY. I think he works for Putin,not USA
Marco don't start with the bashing of how our president handles things please unite
#RINO and you wonder why you didn't get the Republican nomination @marcorubio
you were defrauded.  By foreign interests. Save our nation.  Now or never
@POTUS We can't really with our current leader pursuing trivialities while our country implodes.
The GOP does not believe in Human Rights, witness the refugees losing fingers in Canada,  + those drowning in the Med
That's a LOSER comment. Try thinking like a w-i-n-n-e-r,  like your new (great) boss.
.  Did you criticize Powell and Rice when they didn't attend at first.
if only there was someone on Capitol Hill with the power and voice to do something about it! #gopsellouts
let up on the criticism...support our President and Cabinet, goes alot further.
please Marco don't wet your pants over this since it's happened countless times before.
what is the explanation for this?
You didn't realize the consequences of confirming #Tillerson's nomination, eh? This guy has no conscience & Putin on speed dial.
Maybe Tillerson is just following your lead? You know, avoiding public meetings? #wheresmarco #CanWeTalkRubio #MeetDontRun
you need to get your facts straight!!!!!
You need to recognize the error of your ways and investigate. Also it's ok if you are gay. You could be a good Democrat if you just own up.
strong stand there coward
Need strong action not a weak response
You didn't get #45 Message, Tillerson's only job is to bring home oil/gas deals to the US CEO.
abysmal but when the administration is not worried about human rights this happend.
When you confirmed him, you knew he had a 600 million oil deal with Putin, right?  These cabinet picks are not there to serve America.
Like Congress and Trump, he works for Putin.  Why would he pretend to care about human rights?
should have #humanrights #FreeIran #Freedom #Iran #Terrorism & meddling in #Region as Top priority
you voted for him you hypocrite
so why did you vote yes on Tillerson's nomination?  Because you represent wealthy donors instead of the people
they don't care about human rights. Rex told you that in his confirmation hearings
Save the theatrics. You voted for Tillerson against the interest of your constituents. You are to blame for his (in)actions.
You voted for him. And you continue to support this irresponsible administration.
Been watching Office Space?
@jamespmanley @StateDept you voted for him
You're a slimeball @marcorubio
I hope U @marcorubio , who SEALED YOUR BIRTH RECORDS in 2015/2016 like OBAMA, will be totally removed from USA POLITICS
Well for the 1st time in a long time we have an oil company running the State Dept, so big surprise. Thanks, Marco.
you were impressive grilling #Tillerson over human rights but folded, bit late to be critical now
Start the impeachment process. Trump is only going to get worse and do terrible things to all humanity as well as US citizens
you could have, and should have voted no. I have no words to describe how horrible you are as a person and senator!
@jaketapper @StateDept What u expected Marco? #HumanRights r bad PR for GOP's Russian masters so there u have it now live wid it
Please. Not buying your fake concern for human rights. How many yea votes to confirm 45s Cabinet #putinpuppets ?
@rebeccagberg @StateDept The list of 1sts grows by the minute with this administration.
Human Rights are not a priority of the current Administration, but you knew that already.
I read that Colin Powell and Condalesa Rice didn't either. Thought you were Republican? #GOPSTANDSTRONG
No Marco, you're wrong! Neither did Colin Powell or Conelleza Rice. Correct yourself please
I hope you reconsider your confirmation
You are responsible for this shame Se. Rubio. You voted for him because you put party over country
Marco, you got to stop knocking on Republicans after all you're supposed to be one
Are human rights not important to this administration? Silence speaks volumes.
and I will enjoy your treason trial, you are despicable.
Current Secretary doesn't want to be associated with Kerry's failures
You had your chance to vote against him.  Instead, you chose to remain Little Marco.  You don't get to complain now.
Seriously? You shouldn't haven't voted for the fool!  Your words are hollow. @StateDept
still feeling good about voting to confirm Tillerson?
@steveschale @StateDept Marco, grow some balls and be more aggressive with Trump
please support visit florida
facts matter,not who presents them
maybe you can present them at a town hall
maybe you shouldn't have voted for him to be confirmed...
Glad to see you join all the other RINO hacks.  We don't really need Dems anymore with you, Graham and McCain.
u voted for him knowing exactly who you voted for and where he stood on human rights. With Putin and with big oil.
Unreal. Thank you Senator Rubio.
@joshgerstein He's not in this for the job Marco, he's in it for the oil. Are you really that dense? #trumprussia
you voted to confirm #Tillerson Buyers remorse? He was busy talking to #Putin #RussianConnection
Marco, just to be clear: You will never be President.
@WestWingReport @StateDept Good job Senator!
Very SAD for humanity!  Thank you for saying the RT thing.
@jaketapper Bannon plan to deconstruct admin. Gut/destroy state dept. where is Tillerson?

we hoped you'd reconsider voting for unqualified cabinet choices or holding townhall meetings. Coward on both counts.
Marco, their intention is to violate human rights. Please stand up for America. We are under siege. This is a coup.
When Putin changes his opinion on #humanrights so will Trump admin
@jaketapper @StateDept you can understand that Mr. Tillerson is busy, he must feel like Red Adair, putting out fires worldwide
You think? Keep on protecting the Russia loving dictator wanna-be. History will remember your cowardice!!!
sell out Rubio, now pretending DT is a good guy with good intentions, so you can ride on his coat tails.Trader bigly!
.@marcorubio Wow! powerful stand, Li'l Marco - This tweet is just as irrelevant as your call for a Russia investigation #followtherubles
@jaketapper @StateDept Senator this is a show, it is meaningless.
didn't trump call you a wimp. was he right
At a time when you can prove Trump wrong, you consistently come up small little Marco
you have completely sold out to #Trump. remember when he ridiculed you publicly? No shame. No honor.
THIS is what you worry about? There's a bunch of folks in FL who have important questions for you!
@jaketapper @StateDept WHO CARES OUT WITH THE OLD AND IN WOTH NEW!
Um, what about last year?
#RexTillerson been a little busy cleaning out #Obama insiders so we can #MAGA
This report is always slanted against America.  Do your job and leave Tillerson alone.
hope is not a strategy #HumanRights
You get what you endorsed Lil Marco.
this is all on you, Senator Rubio.
Regretting voting Tillerson in yet? I called your office and begged you to reconsider...
keep standing up to them. They're selling our country to the Russians. Join the #RESISTANCE
With enemies like you, who needs friends?
Maybe you need to start standing up for the country.
Why? You voted for this shit show!
seriously? And what did you expect when you voted to confirm an oil exec for the top diplomat job? #votersremorse
lol what the fuck do you care?
Nobody wants to hear from Rex fucking Tillerson. Even Exxon is tired of him at this point.
Just another step in the Democrats' coup to overthrow Trump and kick him out of office.
Funny, I thought you were a member of the GOP. Show up for work occasionally & maybe you could change a decision or 2
Me too, and Sen. Rubio, I respectfully request you hold a town hall.  We have legitimate questions.
If only you had a job where you could do more than just hope to prevent this. Oh wait. You do and you didn't.
the guy you elected believes neither in the state dept nor human rights.  Your move.
Can't you do more than HOPE in your role????
Then why'd you vote for the Secretary of Petrostate?
IMPEACH HIM !!
Stand up and do your job. You won't be alone.
We need our country to be represented the lives of the exploited count on it. It's not a one person fix reconsider
grow a pair.
Until I change my mind about it a few hours from now.
yeah you're a spineless shitbird who refuses to put country first. Your half-hearted "hope" can stuff it.
you make my day and you are absolutely right
The sentiment is thoughtful, but your actions will define your future voter support We're watching Rubio 2022?
You should have voted against Tillersons confirmation. #weak
Maybe you should have reconsidered your vote for Secretary of State. You only have yourself to blame.
glad you stood tall and voted against his confirmation. Oh wait ...
@tmbrown327 @StateDept You care all of a sudden ? #Hypocrite
All talk, no action
What a shame! It'll def. send z wrong message2 repressive regimes. TY Senator 4 being a true champion of human rights
@jaketapper @StateDept I wish YOU would reconsider your voting record and attendance rate. #hack #shill
step up senator! You can force this issue. Don't let the USA back away from human rights
Come on, Rubio. Sell your soul or don't. There is no gray area.
@jaketapper @StateDept That would be because DJT was the best your party could put forth.
"America First" is what matters to this admin, it seems.  #humanrights are a distraction? Hope is not enough. #fight
http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/03/politics/rex-tillerson-state-department-human-rights-report/index.html â€¦  Fascinating dance around a "yes" or a "no."  #humanrights  #fight
Absolutely. They need to reconsider to publish it. This practice  is ongoing consistently.
- Florida regularly elects s
you're a joke Rubio. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT for once, besides hissing and whining...
...(then backing down later when it's more politically expedient for you to do so). GROW A PAIR!
you voted for him
@jaketapper @StateDept you voted to approve this guy. Have courage and stop being two faced. Put country first
This is terrible.  DO SOMETHING.  All talk - have you actually helped to stop any of this mess we are in?
@jaketapper @StateDept And you voted to approve Tillerson so YOU OWN IT.
@jaketapper @StateDept But if they don't you will shut up and do what your party says.
@jaketapper @StateDept This is all on you and GOP, Marco. Thanks for nothing.
@jaketapper @StateDept I feel like Trump and his Russian friends have dossiers on all these folks and that's why they pivoted
@jaketapper @StateDept talk is cheap marco. Do stuff.
. PLEASE GET THESE RUSSIAN OIL NAZIS OUT NOW. STOP  THEM.  @StateDept
marco can you find out what this is.
@ReaganBattalion @StateDept MARCO NARCO you better watch out or Rexski will give you a special  'heart attack'.  And FL will 
Its your party running the show. OWN IT. You backed him Little Marco.
Trump/Tillerman R all about the $$$$.
They C no $$$ in Human Rights around the world, so can't B bothered
You reap what you sow Marco. You had the vote. Step away from your keyboard and meet with your constituents, coward!
@hrw @StateDept Found a new office yet Senator? Schedule a town hall?
@jaketapper @StateDept Since when as GOP do you care about human rights?
@jaketapper @StateDept  You know you could've prevented this with your vote. Instead you stayed with the party line.
YOU can stop this shit...DO IT
Thank you, Senator. Now start doing some of the things you promised to get elected.
Do we remember correctly that you voted FOR Tillerson? Yes? This is on you, too.
YOU KNOW DARN WELL THE PUTIN/EXXON/ @StateDept  DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS. Welcome to Russia.
@jaketapper @StateDept Marcoroni: you do know the @StateDept has been demoted to VillageDept. Because it takes a village . . .
well you voted for Tillerson, you still support Trump and Pence, let's us know when you find your balls
thanks for voting for the man whose company destabilized gov for business leverage @jaketapper @StateDept
@jaketapper @StateDept mayb if there were going to be Russian ambassadors there to make it worth it
Americans are still waiting to to say for the first time in a long time we have a government we trust!!
@aaamanda @StateDept 
I hope you, Marco Rubio, reconsider meeting with your constituents. Not doing so is a cowardly act.
@jaketapper @StateDept your party doesn't care about human rights it's the party of greed...
@jaketapper @StateDept you and your cronies will destroy the US.
@jaketapper @StateDept So Little Marco, what are you going to do about it?
@jaketapper @StateDept you voted for Tillerson. Rubio. Lets show them what they've won, Bob? A North Korea America. Thanks.
@jaketapper @StateDept Rubio will be golfing with Trump in Mar-a-Lago but he could not do any town halls. Who is the boss?
