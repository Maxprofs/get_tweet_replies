For the sake of our nation & persecuted Christians; For the sake of the Republican Party please work together!
@simon_schama "persecuted christians"? Oh please! Are u laying the ground work 4 #SteveBannons War/"Crusade"?
I think you mean christians are persecutors, not the persecuted! #reality
they are both, like most religions
I'm speaking in present day terms, not historically. This logic applies outside religion

they enjoy a privileged status in this country and many other western nations
- prayers only working on safety and (false) strength. Please stand up and help with wisdom. #NoBanNoWall
so much for your wishes of wisdom. Fell on deaf ears.
why? He's in the midst of slaughtering Americas soul
it didn't work
Amen
Apparently you need to pray harder. So far, it's not working.
NO to DeVos
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump you're kidding right? Trump will destroy our nation if it makes him a few bucks.
I think you have Trump confused with OBama.!!!!
Obama had 60% approval . . . Trump not so much.
Information about the nature of the poll is most always missing. That is what makes the poll legitimate
Google it.
we need new leadership.prayers won't help that evil bigoted monster.
Mr Rubio your 1 of several great Republican leader
wisdom and strength!? Hahahahahahahaha
May GOD gove you some brains!
might want to pray a bit harder for the "wisdom" because it obviously didn't take
And help you understand that murder, stealing and adultery are contrary to the law of Moses, Christian.
Looks like your wanted Hillary. I guess if it's not you a dem is preferable. Protect America 1st, it's YOUR job
Marco your prayers were not answered. You are drinking the kook aid.

More than prayers. Be a leader @marcorubio  you know he's #UnfitToLead
Pray, huh?  #BLOTUS would be happy to see u in hell. He is outside all bounds of reason and intelligence.
Still waiting for that wisdom to kick in. He's more like Saul than Solomon.
Guess God didn't hear your prayers.  Let's try again. #StandUpToTrump
you might wanna give God another nudge, I think he missed your tweet..
#TheResistance #ImpeachTrump #NeverTrump
phony.....
Don't think even GOD can give someone wisdom that refuses it or strength to lead when they want to rule instead
Trump needs your support and you should be working for him and us!
Little Marco kissing his bully's ass because that's what Marquito likes. No integrity, no backbone, no balls
Wisdom and compassion. Try again.
Better to pray for America
Your prayers did not work, Mr. Rubio. I think you are a better man than to support this wild president.
please do not repeal Obamacare without a replacement that includes a mandate
u pray4TRUMP Marco? I pray every nite that insufferable deranged lunatic has a massive coronary in his sleep eg
Maybe you should pray for the rest of us. We're gonna need it
The whole duty of man, according to the bible is to love mercy,do justly and to walk humbly with God.Tell Trump
he has no wisdom. Be a true patriot, block this insanity. Step up, he is ruining our country.
why are the White House phone lines down to citizens?  Can't you guys step up and work for the people? What gives?
please.. what's right for the country, not the swamp
Where are already appropriated $$ moving to pay for Wall??  Don't want it
Missing the wisdom chip from motherboard
#NoDAPL #NoWall  #NoBetsyDevos#Getoutoftheswamp
The very same prayer I say.  I know God will do remarkable wonders for USA if @realDonaldTrump listens closely & acts wisely.
hope you prayed for the American citizens too. We need it more then he does & I have a feeling you understand that.
what a scam y are you and trump will vote you out
PLease Send Me A note for my fathers military funeral at Fl national cemetery. In February. Much appreciated
I would add this: Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
I also prayed that he gets impeach before he destroy our country
Trump is the devil
has worked yet .. keep praying.
Where is your balls now?
you're such a total hypocrite you called TD a con man said he was dangerous to his country spineless Marco
Your prayers failed.  He's still talking about crowd size & 3-5 million illegals voting.  Embarrassing.
amen
Class.
Wisdom??
and I pray for nothing but pain and suffering for Trump and his family.. may they know pain! Amen 
HE IS NOT CAPABLE of LEADING our country and YOU should be more perceptive of this!!
I hope you prayed he'd keep thebpussy grabbing to a minimum #rubioisacoward
I'm sure he feels the same as you little coward Marco He's laughing your weak all mouth. I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR LAST TERM
you are a courageous and useful human being #alternativefacts
THANK YOU FOR NOTHING, I WILL PASS ON THAT<
TIME TO PRAY FOR THIS COUNTRY SINCE RIGHTS ARE ALREADY TAKEN AWAY!!! WOMEN SHOULD CHOOSE-NOT BIG GOVT!!! LEAVE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT STRONG
may god give you the balls to do what's best for America first not the crazy Colonialists in Israel
quit praying and get to work. DJT  does not believe in anything but himself he has no compassion or class
And may he not sell us out to Russia.  Amen.
prayers dont affect demons
Thank you, Mr. Rubio for your well-wishes.  WE appreciate your kindness and support!
Just keep your daughter away from him. Remember the one you said you had to look in the eye? You are despicable
Seriously ... How can Jeanette stand you?
you both r Traders and Russian spys
@SenRubioPress @realDonaldTrump Barf
perhaps your prayers should be God protect us from this abomination. Unfortunately that would take a backbone
please vote No on tillerson
if there actually was a God then he’d be struck by a lightning bolt.
Republicans sold out our very country to Russia. U broke it, will pay for it.
..yeah we need to pray for our basic survival as Trump & Putin rule the U.S.
May your god protect us from your ambitions.  Seems like just yesterday... http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/08/16/marco-rubio-still-thinks-donald-trump-con-artist/ …
I suggest you pray for the American people. Trump doesn't need your stinkin prayers, he's got #PUTIN.
You missed two out of two.n The people are bagtting zero.  2018 cannot come sooner.
Could you please also pray that our government chooses country over party? Thank you. God is going to be mad if it is destroyed.
God doesn't like ugly! Trump is an anti-Christ
Pray that the prez grows up and stops the trivial, egomaniacal tweets. Hard to have faith in him now.
@SenRubioPress @realDonaldTrump & "wisdom " together? Ha! It's like u w/ a Spine! #AnotherBrokenPromise #cowards #RussiaFirst
It is a little late to ask God to help us. U people in gov have screwed us enough. We need term limits 4 u guys
U should pray for gods forgiveness for being gutless wonder that Votes to cover is own ass instead 4 the people
Save your prayers for our country. Not your country, Russia.
or just plain old common sense would be nice too 

We will all need God's help protecting us from this madman. God help you for your lack of integrity.
@SenRubioPress @realDonaldTrump then block Tillerson
Wisdom? Hate to break it to ya Marco, that ship has sailed. Pray for the protection of Gays, Muslims, Women...
#FakeChristians
. Wisdom he should have already but does not, his strength is bullying. Not positives for anyone. Very Troubling
blah blah blah
Serial philanderer, liar, racist, thief, mysogynist & nude model wife. I'd be more concerned w lightning bolts
aw.. That's so sweet and I wish the same thing.. God Bless you and your wife/kids this year..
God wants nothing to do with Drumpf.
Don't give in to his poor choices.  Stand up for USA and don't hand over all three branches of govt. to him pls
I feel sorry for his wife he shows no respect.
That really would be quite the miracle! #unfit #UNQUALIFIED #unpresidential #NotMyPresident
And you will vote how? A man can't ride your back unless it is bent. Stand up.
Not appointing Mr. Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State is US loss. Deuteronomy 1:13 , "Choose wise." God bless
@jerryvs33 then starts doing up and back him! We are!!!!
yes & I pray that you Repubs support our President & get something done 4 a change,be the solution not problem
Rubio, are you now to going to support Trump?  We Americans voted for him and he is for US.
and may God lead you to making the right vote  vs just voting from the right
Marco, help him out..confirm Rex, be a team player
please give him the vote he needs. A registered FL  Republican
You think you deserve the best healthcare, paid by our taxes, and you want to take ours? Sickening. Elitists!
#TRUMPLETHINSKIN
