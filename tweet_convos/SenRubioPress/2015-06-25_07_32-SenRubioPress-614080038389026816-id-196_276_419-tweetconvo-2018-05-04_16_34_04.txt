@marcorubio  HUGE example of why receiving a SCOTUS seat should not be a lifetime appointment! Bad when SCOTUS skirts the constitution!
@infantry1026 Actually this wasn't a Constitutional issue, it was a statutory one. There's a difference.
@Pawlenty4VP I understand that, I am speaking more to the first decision, sorry
@infantry1026 Ah. So you think your understanding of the U.S. Constitution is better than that of the Supreme Court. Got it.
@Pawlenty4VP so you think that forcing people to purchase health ins. Under the threat of penalty....is in accordance with the constitution
@infantry1026  I'm not aware of a right to be uninsured, and therefore force your medical costs on others. But feel free to enlighten me.
@Pawlenty4VP I am not a gainer healthcare reform, but nationalized healthcare is not the way!
@Pawlenty4VP not against, sorry my phone is being difficult
@marcorubio Defund it! The American people have repeatedly said no to Obamacare. But GOP hoped sold out Supremes would handle it.
@ArturdTheZero @marcorubio Give back the 3/4 trillion stolen from Medicare. Seniors are entitled to it because they paid for it!
@ArturdTheZero @marcorubio And what about Obamacare?
@ArturdTheZero @marcorubio What proceeded Obamacare was better than Obamacare.
@marcorubio That's a clever phrase. Did you focus group that, or just come up with it this morning?
@marcorubio we do not need u telling us what we need.  Shutup
@marcorubio @MensaMax2
Beawear from turky
@marcorubio What does that even mean??
.@marcorubio We no longer have @ObamaCare. It's now @SCOTUSCare. Haven't you heard?
@marcorubio You voted against Consumer Care too!
@marcorubio thank you Chief Justice John Roberts for looking after the sick and poor of America
@marcorubio Marco you fool, "Obamacare" IS a consumer-oriented plan.
@marcorubio It's A Lot Better Than The GOP I DONT CARE & Let Them Die Or Go Broke. The ACA Saved My Family $9300 TY
@marcorubio No, we need you deported.
@marcorubio what we 'need' is fewer politicians and more Statesmen/women. Christian? I think not.
@marcorubio By the way, the law is the Affordable Care Act -- not Obama Care.
@marcorubio 

??. It is not Obama Care. It is ACA. I thigh I can trust tin the next elections. I'm having doubts now.
@marcorubio what does that look like exactly
@marcorubio PENDEJO CUBANITO DE MIERDA
@marcorubio Oh please, bro: try to dimish the name by calling it Obamacare" Now is baptized ...TY #ILoveObamacare
@marcorubio HOW is any of this Health Care garbage the responsibility of the Federal Government? Which of the enumerated powers allows this?
@marcorubio Would that be the Consumer Care you have consistently voted against? Yup, that's about what I thought. You have nothing, Marco.
@marcorubio We need Child Support law revised not ignored and allowed to ruin lives! Oh, I know "the separation of powers thing again? bah!
@marcorubio WE need COURT CARE . . TO PROTECT US. Take the money away form them. Pay salaries and no more. Usurp no more.
@marcorubio Thank God for the Affordable Care Act.  I went for a few years with no healthcare at all.  Thanks Pres. Obama & thank God!
@marcorubio well, the republicans have failed so far, hello
@marcorubio Not every brainfart which passes through your head actually needs to pollute Twitter.
@marcorubio Does this jackass actually think before he spews some nonsensical soundbyte simply to feel relevant.
@marcorubio what's your plan? Don't get sick
@marcorubio  Well, you Republicans have had five years to come up with a "Consumer Care" bill that would provide guaranteed health insurance
@marcorubio Consumer Care? Did you think that term up this morning? Cry me a river.
@marcorubio Marco, you need to up your game. Any suggestions to improve Obamacare? I want to hear about it.
@marcorubio u are a tool. Do something's my useful for once.
@marcorubio go marco go....
@marcorubio I sm in huge medical debt that I never had crore Obama care . Thanks a lot for notginhing !!!
@marcorubio #NoRubio
@marcorubio And what, exactly, are your plans for affordable healthcare?
@marcorubio As long as you see human beings as "consumers" you will always fail. #fucktard
.@marcorubio More than anything else, the ACA IS Consumer Care as it is intended to protect health care insurance consumers from insurers.
@marcorubio do not fund subsidies
@SHARHAIR @marcorubio Excellent question and one Justice Roberts should have asked! BTW he asked zero, zip, nada, questions! #SCOTUSCare
@marcorubio said: "We need Consumer Care, not ObamaCare."

Translation:  Profits over people. #GOPClownCar
@marcorubio no, we need health care, not cu$tomer care
let's see the plan!  quit talking and take action @marcorubio
@marcorubio If you're talking republicants Marco, the care 'we' need is psychiatric.
@marcorubio What is wrong with you? Why do you not give one s__t about your own constituents? Tell us about YOUR plan. FAMILY VALUES MY ASS.
@marcorubio it's actually called the #AffordableCareAct the @GOP and the likes of you have called it #Obamacare cloud the point of the bill
@marcorubio @RightForRubio Todays Supreme Court decision verifies that a drastic overhaul needed in D.C, Someone got paid somehow.
.@marcorubio False. We need Citizen Care, not Only-If-You-Can-Afford-It Care. #singlepayer
@marcorubio YEAH!  MORE PROFITS!! YEAH!
@marcorubio Does this ruling mean that we no longer have to follow any laws?
@marcorubio insurance companies are charging outrages rates. and so, Obama/Clinton will achieve their goal of single payer health care.
@marcorubio Hillary will win party due to Obama care. then single payer will replace it as consumers (businesses) realize that (cont'd)
@marcorubio It's not new that Republicans originated Obamacare name. You did not know that? They came up with that name to bring negativism!
@marcorubio Hey Rubio, I'm a citizen not a consumer, you dim wit.
@marcorubio Also republicans who aren't into treason. Ass.
@marcorubio What an empty and vapid remark.
@marcorubio Of course you see the American citizenry as nothing more than "consumer". More of than "maker versus taker" mentality. #disgrace
@marcorubio We need *health* care & until we get a single payer system, ObamaCare is better than alternatives--including yours, sir.
@marcorubio again, you have negative comments but no better ideas or solutions to anything!
@marcorubio And we need Hilary Clinton in office in 2016.
@marcorubio And we need governance and leadership, not empty platitutdes.
@marcorubio We need a Congress that works for the American people, not American and foreign corporations, Rupert Murdoch & Koch Brothers.
@marcorubio Then why didn't republicans bring forth a plan so that everyone can have insurance? #Hypocrites
@marcorubio You, sir, are a waste of a #Senate seat, and another #GOP #emptysuit filling a seat on the #GOPClownBus #FoxNews @FoxNews #tcot
@marcorubio @floridalass Until you need it.  When you have a child aging out of your insurance with a pre existing condition, come back.
@marcorubio you want more money for the rich,less for the poor,long live obamacare
@marcorubio @Atkinson4459 we need you to be consistent with your vote on the TPA yesterday you proved you can't be trusted
@marcorubio You Mr Rubio have NOTHING in place to Replace our Health Care...until  you do...SHUT UP!
@marcorubio What exactly is ConsumerCare? Empty rhetoric? We have healthcare MARKETS.
@marcorubio Thank god we don't have politicians like you in Canada
@marcorubio @NYT @WSJ @NEWS12NJ @DAILYSHIT  you have no intention but to kill or not have any kind of healthcare for the masses
@marcorubio Agreed - Universal health insurance - take out the CEO pay and Wall St profit.  ACA is one step, let's take another step forward
@marcorubio
@marcorubio we could use a government for the people, not corporations!
@marcorubio you just as corrupt as the west. U will not get my vote. U advance the top.
@marcorubio no one will be getting it from you, that's for sure. @NYT @WSJ @DAILYSHIT @DAILYNEWS @NEW12NJ @NJ.COM
@marcorubio 
America needs health care, not slogans.
Obamacare is working. The GOP is not.
@marcorubio hey SFB you folks named it. And we thank you.
@marcorubio I have insurance thanks to Obamacare. I world thank you kindly to keep your corrupt hands off it.
@marcorubio your Tweet was quoted by @NPR -
@marcorubio Time for universal medicare [single-payer] like EU, Japan, Brit & Brit dominions--that would cover the remaining 4M+...
@marcorubio   Then make all gov officials have Obama care instead of being exempt
@marcorubio And you did absolutely nothing to stop this.  Why vote republican when all they do is side with democrats.
@marcorubio Look up Consumer Care- there's no health plan, but Bayer aspirin  Your health care answer - give them aspirin.
@marcorubio More like #SCOTUSCare now.
@marcorubio try having cancer or another terrible illness and not being rich, then you will change your tune! #ignorant
.@marcorubio The solution is the Health Care Compact. Learn more at http://HealthCareCompact.org  #KingvBurwell #SCOTUS
@marcorubio Who named it "O" care? Regardless , the point is moving healthcare reform forward. POTUS set table for future needed reforms!!
@marcorubio Dumb remark from a man who cannot manage his own finances
.@marcorubio cause we're all just consumers to you?
@marcorubio ObamaCare IS Consumer Care, Knucklehead.
@marcorubio Its called the #AffordableCareAct. You lost, so quit crying about it.
.@marcorubio What does that even MEAN? Can you elaborate? Signed, self employed mother of two who has benefited from ACA provisions
@marcorubio That is the province of Congress, not POTUS, who cannot enact law, only veto it. You can't even get how government works right.
@marcorubio no!
@marcorubio Seriously? Is that the best you can do?
@marcorubio YOU FOOL..WAKE UP!
@marcorubio
@marcorubio so,... how did the ACA actually get the name "Obamacare/"
@marcorubio You NEED to give it up.
@marcorubio I think you are driven by ideology and not for common good of the American people.
@marcorubio  You lost me on TPP
@marcorubio easy to say. Come up with a better plan, which no one has, and it might make a difference. saying it doesnt work is not enough.
@marcorubio   If people have to pay for high cost healthcare plans, they won't be spending $$ to help the economy.
.@marcorubio Consumer wha…? Shut up pleeeze
We need Consumer Care, not ObamaCare.
@marcorubio Consumer Care for a price, right? Gotta feed the lobbybeast.
@marcorubio great idea, how about single-payer consumer care?
@marcorubio When it comes to health care, I'm a patient, not a "consumer"
.@constans @marcorubio When it comes to insurance, you are a consumer.
@marcorubio what we have now is RobertsCare, not ObamaCare.
@marcorubio Republicans controlled Congress for more than a decade and had plenty of time to pass health insurance reform IF THEY WANTED TO
@marcorubio No, we need #MedicaidExpansion in Florida. Stop denying 800,000 Floridians healthcare. It's your job as a public servant to help
@marcorubio so because its Obama name on it, its wrong? Would you feel better if a white man developed the same law?
@marcorubio SOUR GRAPES!
@marcorubio Remember, he's like SCOTUS. He thinks corporations are people. They're the people who pay him!
@marcorubio you'll never touch #ACA #rubidont! Loser
Lamest response so far --> RT @marcorubio: We need Consumer Care, not ObamaCare.
@marcorubio You are moron; I trust the supreme court way more then a right wing clown like you.
@marcorubio  the GOP are cowards. Totally backed down on this one.  Empty promises now.
@marcorubio With your support of #Obamatrade you're no longer a viable candidate for president sir Save us all the hassle & quit now! shame
@marcorubio you could set up a FL exchange that works better than the federal, gives us great health care and costs us less
@marcorubio Tell the truth, Man, you want Corporate Care.
@marcorubio 
Please make sense with your comments. A VERY STUPID COMMENT.
@marcorubio we don't need obamacare but we need Obama's fast track.you have forgotten who put you in DC.now we will forget you.you're out
@marcorubio President Barack Obama... YES WE CAN!
#SCOTUS upheld a key component of #Obamacare that helps makes insurance affordable in all 50 states. #happydance 
@marcorubio  it's called the #AffordableCareAct #ACA
@marcorubio Sore loser.
@marcorubio don't u mean we need insurance companies in charge of our healthcare?  PROFIT means the consumers are never in control
@marcorubio Y0URE AN IDIOT!!
@marcorubio https://twitter.com/theonlyadult/status/614076448945606656 …
@marcorubio NO!!! we need for you to drop out of the race... what you are up to 4% in the polls... go get a drink of water!!!
@marcorubio And then what exactly is your solution? Quit bashing it and figure out a way to fix it. If not, then shut up and move on. #aca
@marcorubio we need single-payer.
@marcorubio Is that like a number I call when my vacuum cleaner stops working?
.@marcorubio You're right. You should get together with @elizabethforma and discuss the Consumer Protection Bureau.
@marcorubio ObamaCare premiums are killing me in CA.  I am triaging my own care as I can't afford the outrageous out of pocket amounts.
Until then, try and hang in there.  We've made it this far. @janblake2015 @marcorubio
@marcorubio we need you to jump off a very high bridge!  Thanks
RT @marcorubio: We need Consumer Care, not ObamaCare.
@GarryRSmith @marcorubio what's that even mean?  Like, call a help line or something?
@marcorubio We are not consumers, we are living breathing human beings that need access to affordable healthcare. #ACA #SCOTUS
@marcorubio Are you prepared to deal with the label of "heartless bastard" that the press will thrust on you when do what is right? Hope so.
@marcorubio whatever, please continue falling in line with the all talk and no action Republican controlled Senate and House.
@marcorubio It's a little late for that.  Maybe it's time to move on to other issues you can actually influence....
#Obamacare is necessary insurance reform to protect Americans. And it's the law, @marcorubio
@marcorubio   We need Congress to Grow A Set ...
@marcorubio just stop you could not look more ignorant
.@marcorubio In addition, your party does hold the majority in congress. Pass a bill and force @POTUS to veto it.
@marcorubio then come up with a plan not written by business.
@marcorubio idiot
@marcorubio great job by your press team on the talking point but literally what does that even mean?
@marcorubio lol get a life buddy
@marcorubio With @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerBoehner #Obamacare repeal doesn't stand a Chance! Both are to the left of #NancyPelosi
.@marcorubio Um... What? Do you have an actual plan or just platitudes meant to make Republicans feel better? #SCOTUS
@marcorubio Now the great corporatist shill cares about consumers!  We won't forget TPA/TPP.
@marcorubio Oh..hey..you missed a big vote yesterday.
@marcorubio You lost. Take it like a gentleman. Put people before politics and be grateful Scotus did the right thing.
Pathetic! RT@marcorubio We need Consumer Care, not ObamaCare.<-What a juvenile and a whiner. Reason why he will never be ready...
.@jtatsuno @marcorubio Did you forget that the first two words of the name of the law are Patient Protection? It IS Consumer Care.
@jmax7 @marcorubio ahhh...I guess conservative SCOTUS Roberts and Kennedy know about the law....get over it.
@marcorubio well thank G Bush for Roberts. Enough of you big govt republicans. The Bush family is a Big Govt machine..
@marcorubio I agree! So...does that mean the republicans are going to stop blocking single payer healthcare?
@marcorubio @jeharguindey hermoso
@nicogimb La ley la quería Reagan y la Heritage Foundation, pero son otros los tiempos.
@marcorubio Ahhh we seem to remember YOU&others in Congress SWEARING you would repeal #obamacare/#SCOTUScare What happened with that?
@marcorubio Time for removal of life time appoints for SCOTUS. Let's add that to your agenda along with Term Limits for Congress.
@marcorubio Well said.
