。@marcorubio Our Republic assigns the making of law to its Congress。#SCOTUS only INTERPRETS the law。States need to nullify this decision。
@BraveLad @marcorubio so by that logic states had every right to ban mixed marriages and determine equal protections? wrong side of history.
。@RustyHughes13 @marcorubio This bogus interpretatin fails on so many levels, which is another discussion I'll deal with tomorrow。#tcot #sgp
.@BraveLad @RustyHughes13 @marcorubio What about Romans 13 which states submission to the state & its organs as they carry out God's will?
。@jerijerod14 @RustyHughes13 @marcorubio Since rulers are God's servants, no one who does not serve Him is a ruler。Therefore ...#tcot #ccot
.@BraveLad @RustyHughes13 @marcorubio Roman's 13 is fairly clear; The State was est by God for God = doing God's will
。@jerijerod14 @RustyHughes13 @marcorubio Which is being a terror to evil behavior, not to the good, which rules out a socialist state。#tcot
@BraveLad @RustyHughes13 @marcorubio so could Romans 13 not be used to legitimise any dictatorship? The Kaiser Reich and First World War?
.See! I told you @marcorubio is part of the Washington Cartel along with McCain, Graham, McConnell and others. No moral leadership! #TCOT
@BooBooBear4U2 @JrcheneyJohn @marcorubio he has virtually the exact same voting record and stances on the issues as Cruz.k
@roachman61 @JrcheneyJohn @marcorubio Rubio is for Amnesty of illegal aliens. We need to enforce immigration laws. Deport by boxcars & guns.
There has always been a SIMPLE SOLUTION TO ILLEGAL ALIENS,  Secure The Border, & Enforce the LAWS @BooBooBear4U2 @roachman61 @marcorubio
@JrcheneyJohn @roachman61 @marcorubio Ditto Simple Solution. We could've detention camps in Area 51 & boxcar express them over border. ;-)
@BooBooBear4U2 @roachman61 @marcorubio If laws are enforced most will leave on their own but nope, we reward them with benifits, via tax $
@JrcheneyJohn @roachman61 @marcorubio Any evidence of using welfare or social programs, automatic deportation of entire families regardless.
@BooBooBear4U2 @roachman61 @marcorubio Not sure I understand your question
WRONG! An Unconsitutional Ruling is NOT LAW! Just another one of MANY Reasons YOU MUST NEVER be President @marcorubio #PJNET #CCOT
@eph4_15 @marcorubio Looks like Doyl flunked civics.
Doesnt take a 5th Grader 2Read the Constitution & Words of the Founders, Nor to Reason & Think 4 ones self... @BobbieMitchell #PJNET #CCOT
@marcorubio Wow, you coward. So much for wanting to lead. Please drop out, let the adults step to the head of the line.
@BibChr @marcorubio hahaha Dan. What a tool.
@BobbieMitchell @marcorubio Isn't he, though? And I had such hopes.
@BibChr @marcorubio lol I was talking about you. The senator is right on this.
@marcorubio Marco, the "law" is not the purview of SCOTUS to write.  No, we must NOT abide by their perversions of logic.
@EmeraldAntiHero @marcorubio Might be.  Don't care that much.
@marcorubio If the SCOTUS makes it constitutional to kill Christians do you plan to follow that law??????????? Even though you disagree?????
@marcorubio , SCOTUS does not get to make law. The Constitution is the LAW OF THE LAND, regardless SCOTUS. @tedcruz @RandPaul @BobbyJindal
@marcorubio @BraveLad SCOTUS is not empowered to "make" law!" Only the congress is. Why do we allow it to continue? Your tweet is a cop out
@marcorubio @BraveLad Rubio is no conservative, I don't care what he says. Just a young RINO.
@marcorubio @BraveLad It was done illegally. You have to refute that if you want to be POTUS
@marcorubio No we do not abide by law against GOD! You will never get my vote. You a moron for even thinking that!
@Ps5725 @marcorubio another idiot that has no idea how government works in America. Its called judicial review....get over it.
.@BobbieMitchell Hey, I had very smart guys write my papers and take my tests when I went to law school. I know the law.
@marcorubio you've thrown your career away for nothing - you won't get the nomination
@marcorubio And why is that?  Our government isn't
@marcorubio @BraveLad politician's statement not a candidate's statement, too bad
@marcorubio   Actually I think it is time for the Church to wake up - Civil disobedience has a place.
@marcorubio WHAT LAW ARE YOU REFERRING TO? WHOSE LAW SHOULD WE ABIDE BY? THE CREATED OR THE CREATOR?
@marcorubio actually Acts 5:29 says the opposite
@marcorubio nope
@marcorubio it should have never passed what has happened to US
@marcorubio grow a spine, I thought u were 1 of the good guys
@marcorubio SCOTUS doesn't have authority to make laws in America...
@marcorubio UP YOURS FLUNKY/PIMP-You R bought and paid for-you're FINISHED
@WellingtonKnott @marcorubio Rubio-engaged in appeasement-no fighting spirit 4 da Constitution or American Values-think U should know that?
@marcorubio Really? Since WHEN does #SCOTUS write law?
@marcorubio is forced acceptance still acceptance? Speechless...
This is too much
@marcorubio and in a Republic there are was to deal with judges who make laws from bench. Impeachment that's in the Constitution unlike this
.@marcorubio Is that the advice you'd have given to MLK?
Are you talking about MLK, the misogynist and objectifier of women? @corrcomm @marcorubio
@commoncranium I assume you understood my point and are trying to make a completely unrelated one. Knock yourself out. @marcorubio
I understand it, but you chose MLK. I've decided that if history is going to be cleansed let's do a thorough job. @corrcomm @marcorubio
@marcorubio Too bad our sitting president does not feel the same way.
@marcorubio  Unless the law violates freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. Religious liberty is teetering on the brink.
@marcorubio What law is that sir?  Our Constitution has been shredded!  So you're saying we must follow those who so deem what is to be?
@marcorubio dude...  are you even interested in the people you allegedly represent?  What the heck are you doing? Vacation ?
@marcorubio I have to agree with the majority here laws are made by the legislative not the judicial branch.
Now what does the #2ndA say?
If @marcorubio believes this then his view of the SCOTUS is a dangerous unconstitutional one.
@marcorubio we have never heard of civil disobedience when it's an unjust law?
@marcorubio We are not buying what you are selling Marco.
@marcorubio We the people will no longer just blindly obey unjust laws. There is a global awakening taking place you know. Wake up!!!
@marcorubio No, we don't.  No, we won't.
@marcorubio Unjust Laws?
@marcorubio 2/2 write a law protecting religious freedom so pastors, bakers, florists, etc won't face persecution
@marcorubio Sorry...that's the way to tyranny and gets a straight up NO from me
@marcorubio I live in FL. Your my Senator & I'm very disappointed sir. It isnt SCOTUS's job to make laws. It's urs so why don't u write 1/2
@marcorubio Next:
@marcorubio more pandering towards  the left, just like Rand.
@marcorubio Even if you know the law goes against all that's right? Obamacare is a great example of a law that's all WRONG!!!!!
@marcorubio but will never failed to follow Gods law over mans law.
@marcorubio sure we have to obey law otherwise jail time. Why can't the govt obey the same laws? Hillary has lied and broken the law already
.@marcorubio When five nonelected lawyers make law, we no longer live in a republic.
@marcorubio We have recourse: 5th Amendment, Convention of States. Read "Liberty Amendments," by Mark Levin. COME ON PEOPLE!
@marcorubio I will stand with God's laws first! Not man's law!!
@marcorubio probably the only rational thought you've had since announcing your candidacy #SCOTUS
@marcorubio #LoveWins
The most powerful people, are those who can buy anything they want, even, the conscience of the righteous. #SupremeCourt @marcorubio
@marcorubio you are so wrong, this is God's Word which is greater than man's law, this will cost you dearly from Christians
@marcorubio where in the Constitution is SCOTUS granted the authority to make law? Sorry but you are not qualified to be President
@marcorubio At least you got that much correct
@marcorubio You would be a happier person if you had an open-mind and true love for people.
Rubio bows to evil - #LostMyVote
“@marcorubio: While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law.”
@marcorubio  How can you respect a total dismantling of the Rule of Law?
“@marcorubio: While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law.”
@marcorubio first time hearing relatively reasonable words from a tea party member
@marcorubio Wrong Marco,,,, If it goes against God, we are not obligated to follow it. Acts 5v29
@marcorubio lol
@marcorubio This spineless and unconstitutional reaction is why Rubio will NEVER GET MY VOTE.
Says @marcorubio who's TPA Vote lwill destroy the Constitution and lead to a NWO Controlled by Multinational  Corporations @carlalykins
lol “@marcorubio: While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law.”
@marcorubio This law makes LGBT able to live a life the same way straight people do. It's not oppressing you in anyway, so if by +
@marcorubio "obeying the law" you mean going on with your every day life and letting america be a better place, then your right. Obeying
@marcorubio this new law doesn't affect you but makes a group of oppressed people finally free. So it should be pretty easy for you to obey
@marcorubio And we the people will ultimately disagree to ever allow you to run this great nation!
@marcorubio This decision is outside the power of the court. It is a nullity. People will not respect it.
@marcorubio @CorlessJones let's start with government obeying the law.
@marcorubio @CorlessJones What happens when they start arresting pastors?
@marcorubio Thank you-one of the more mature negative reactions I've seen today.
@marcorubio The Law is nonexistent to Obama and, now, SCOTUS makes it irrelevant and totally ambiguous. What's to abide by? Say it out loud!
@marcorubio It's time for States to say "We will not comply." What would happen?
@marcorubio    The Supreme Court continues to ignore the LAW.

We are now in a Lawless Nation
@marcorubio Why must we abide when the highest court in the land does not? #judicial activism
@marcorubio wow thanks 4 ur cooperation!!
@marcorubio When will republicans learn that hate doesn't win them elections -  #LoveWins leave the social issues alone and focus
@marcorubio Why? SCOTUS doesn't
@marcorubio flip flop flip flop flip flop flip flop
@marcorubio Why? You don't feel it necessary to support, abide our enforce immigration laws. #GangOfEight
@marcorubio until you can get  a new majority in the supreme court realizes it is bad law.
@marcorubio me pàrece justo y valiente que lo diga, y no compre simpatizantes a cambio de vender el alma
@marcorubio I abide by man's law until it requires I break God's law.
@marcorubio I say thank you for speaking your mind and values. I think it's childish all the name calling and hateful words on here!
@marcorubio. Welcome to Sodom and Gomorrah. Anything goes.
@marcorubio You're a softie.
@marcorubio ooops , one miss step and You're out. Which law is most important? #GodsWord
@marcorubio Oh how one can change because he knows he is running on empty
@marcorubio USSC interprets law. This should be revisited as it places the 14th above the 10th.
@marcorubio No we must place God first, the Republic second!
@marcorubio read Isaiah 9:16, and Romans 1:22-32
@marcorubio With all due respect, Mr. Rubio. It has become quite apparent that laws mean less now than ever.
@marcorubio Marco, we also live in a republic where the SCOTUS must also, but they didn't. #IgnoreSCOTUS
@marcorubio Laws based on a Constitution the SCOTUS doesn't adhere to? Should we all interpret laws as whimsically as the SCOTUS???
@marcorubio Marco, they ignored the law as it was passed
@marcorubio Letting judges legislate outside their authority, on arbitraty whim no less, is not a #Republic. Republics have constitutions.
@marcorubio well... not just ANY republic (Cuba, Iran, etc).
@marcorubio Jeopardy correct? Answer: What would have been said in 1964 when Civil Rights were passed?
@marcorubio this was not a"republic" decision. It was made by 9 appointed not voted on, judges. How is that "for the people, by the people"?
@preacherthoward @marcorubio man, you're right. We need a new system. That has to be a better way. How should we do it?
@marcorubio This is not law. We have a responsibility to ignore the ruling if our state doesn't want gay marriage.
.@marcorubio Because the current Admin does so well at abiding by the law.
@marcorubio "must abide by the law"?  Exactly what was that the Chief Justice did yesterday regarding the Really affordable health care act?
@marcorubio Time for Spr Justices, Congress and all fed employees to live by the laws they pass.....including ACA!!
@marcorubio @GOPtoday We can always revolt or secede - we dont HAVE to do anything we dont agree with.
@marcorubio this tweet was your most important today. Thanks for accepting rule of  law. One day you'll accept equality before the law 2.
@federley @marcorubio Well said.
@marcorubio 
Do you still keep reaching for the water pumpkin....?
@marcorubio 

If U don't call 4 IMPEACHMENT of Roberts+5 for ACA travesty that undermines The Republic>

U will expose yourself as CROOKED 2
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress no we don't the POTUS hasn't now it's our turn to tell them NO NO NO NO not going to comply with that decision
@marcorubio But is it the Supreme Court's power to re-write laws?
@marcorubio but it breaks the law so we should NOT JUST ACCEPT
@marcorubio when the state infringes on the rights of the individual (eg tax/adoption codes relating to marriage) the SC must step in.
@39wdsss he just said that
@marcorubio Well that's real big of you.
