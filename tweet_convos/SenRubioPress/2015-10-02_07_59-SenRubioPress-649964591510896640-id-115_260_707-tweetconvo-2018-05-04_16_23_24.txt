If you cared, @marcorubio, you would help enact sensible gun control legislation.
@iShakeTheThrone @marcorubio Marco is 2 respectful, reverent 2 make tragedy political, 2 intelligent 2 think viol 2nd amend=fix unstable ppl
@JSpragens @marcorubio ignoring multiple preventable tragedies is not the answer. We've already had more mass shootings then days this year
@iShakeTheThrone @marcorubio these crimes are committed by sick, hate filled people. w/out guns, there r knives, blunt objects, cars, etc
@JSpragens @marcorubio why object to limiting assault weapons? Why would any American need to kill so many fellow Americans in seconds?
@iShakeTheThrone @marcorubio ur changing the subject. why object to addressing the real cause? sick minds, hatred?
@JSpragens @marcorubio not changing the subject. Mental health definitely an issue. So is access to weapons, high-capacity magazines
@iShakeTheThrone @marcorubio 2 different subjects, 1 is compassion driven, the other is driven by an agenda to rewrite our Constitution
@marcorubio Your prayers mean jack shit, just like the rest of your #GOP cronies. Talk about sensible gun laws. Or Bramen doesn't want that?
@Pearljamjay @marcorubio violating 2nd amendment does nothing to fix unstable minds, cure hatred
@JSpragens @marcorubio Nobody is trying to "violate the 2nd amendment." But we must create new legislation for stricter background checks
@Pearljamjay @marcorubio  must  reinstate institutions 3 treat, care 4 the mental disturbed. Encourage family, friends, tweeps 2 rpt erratic
@marcorubio @Rickniceguy4you thank you Marco for your respect and reverence.
@marcorubio Thank you for your respect and reverence
@marcorubio so what the fuck are you going to do to change it, pubio
@PatricknHennion @marcorubio violating 2nd amendment does nothing to fix unstable minds.
@marcorubio Thnx. But what are your proposals for curbing America's incredible gun violence?
@aflasbar @marcorubio More guns in the hands of law abiding citizens who have proven time & time again they have lessened casualties.
@gmvdr0225 So do you suggest the federal govt buys us all a gun? @marcorubio
@aflasbar @marcorubio Nope. I suggest all non-criminals b allowed 2 carry everywhere 2 protect same as POTUS is protected by firearms 24/7.
@gmvdr0225 @marcorubio Why would that reduce mass shootings?
@aflasbar @marcorubio Or in limited words, Only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
@gmvdr0225 @marcorubio Well, global data strongly suggests it's much more effective to take away guns from bad guys. Check it out!
@aflasbar @marcorubio How do they take guns away from bad guys who steal guns?
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress What r ur proposals 4 fighting gun violence. Please b specific not asking 4 what we shouldn't do
@marcorubio Prayer. When you don't actually want to do something meaningful to help.
.@marcorubio What is your plan to take action against #GunViolence? Voters want to know. #GunSense #WhateverItTakes #Everytown
@marcorubio No UR not. Is that all you can say? Ur a fake individual.
@marcorubio Please do all you can to stop interstate flow of guns. #StopGunViolence
@marcorubio 

Screw the NRA Screw the NRA Screw the NRA Screw the NRA Screw the NRA Screw the NRA Screw the NRA Screw the NRA Screw the NRA
@marcorubio You have blood on your hands... forget your prayers, all of your actions have lead to these slaughters. Stop the NRA.
@marcorubio yet you blocked a simple background check bill. Hope you sleep well at night with all the blood on your hands senator.
@marcorubio https://iliketoast.net/uploads/images/scaled_full_5a825a6d6b36f9184ae1.jpg … #guncontrol #GOP #singleIssue Canadian law requires background check, safety course, + 28 day min wait.
@marcorubio Still allowing the proper authorities to be able to operate conventional firearms to protect law abiding citizens!
@marcorubio Where law abiding citizens can still own firearms for home protection not to mention hunting!
@marcorubio Good afternoon Mr Rubio, can someone please create or push for a " Smart Gun" that senses a no gun zone!
@marcorubio Blood On Your Hands...http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=89d_1411198955 …
@marcorubio SAD SO SAD.  IT IS SUCH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. IF IT WASNT GUN. THEY JUST USE SOMETHING ELSE.   HEART GOES OUT THOSE FAMILIES
@marcorubio Thanks Marco for that lovely message.  Only you and Gov. Walker showed true compassion for this tragedy. The others were frigid.
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress Stop praying and do something about it.
@marcorubio I think we should pray for everyone that is in a "gun free zone" when one of these sickos shows up.
@marcorubio Hey Marco, an idea on sorting out the mass killings.
@marcorubio An AMNESTY candidate is a NO STARTER!
@marcorubio How about praying for the 100,000,000 people who are out of work instead of promising AMNESTY in Spanish?
@marcorubio The OR shooter bought all the guns legally.  Therefore, he was not one of the "criminals" that you claim cause these massacres.
@marcorubio you're just another politician repeating the same BS. Why don't you actually VOTE for stricter gun laws? #UCCShooting #gunlaws
@marcorubio Praying does absolutely sweet fuck all. Doesn't help victims, doesn't help the poor, does absolutely nowt.
.@marcorubio starts praying... about a day too late. Action? Never #bloodonyourhands #UCCShooting
@marcorubio Praying isn't helping Marco. It's the guns!
@marcorubio Hmmm. You have a chance ya know. President Obama will be a hard act to follow...by anyone. Separate from the pac.
@marcorubio #require background checks for the private sale of guns at gun shows, thru the internet, across the nation
.@marcorubio Pass sensible gun control laws. THAT will show you care. Prayers don't mean shit to the victims/families
@marcorubio I always find it interesting that you claim to be pro-life except when it's murder by gunfire.
@marcorubio Challenge the President. Prayers are enough if you believe. put God back in government and schools. Replace the devil!!
@marcorubio & P.S. Mr. R., a licensed conceal carry man would not pull his gun 4 fear of being shot by the police-good guys w/guns not help!
@marcorubio You got to kiss your children goodnight.  What are you doing to protect other children? NOTHING!
@marcorubio Thank you.My family has spent the day in prayer and offers to help those affected.We will not back down from evil. #UCCShooting
.@marcorubio Sorry Marco, prayers don't help. How many more mass murders to pass sensible gun control? #GunSense
@marcorubio Hey Marc, why don't you come down to Australia and see how gun laws make a difference? No mass shootings for over 19 years.
@marcorubio Praying? How about you get off your knees. I think @NraWayne is more than "satisfied" by you.
.@marcorubio what a feckless, useless statement you made rejecting sensible gun laws. Very brave as a #GOP candidate to pull the "pray" card
@marcorubio he always knows what to say #genuine
@marcorubio No one cares about you "praying". What is your plan to FIX the problem?
@marcorubio Rubio says we don't need gun laws, if someone is going 2 shoot someone then so be it, Rubio likes that NRA money 2 much
@marcorubio Words are empty, action is meaningful, When Will GOP make better gun laws and get out of NRA'S bed
@marcorubio If u claim you are "the future", why not create a new path and go against the current grain to stop another #UCCShooting
@marcorubio not to "echo" @POTUS , but prayers are just not enough...how many more have to die: http://shootingtracker.com/ 
@marcorubio Do something then!
@marcorubio What about the inaction of your party on gun control?  That deserves a sarcastic "Thanks a lot" for making the shooting possible
@marcorubio  THIS is the conversation we need! 
http://watchingthewheelsdad.net/author/blazakr/ 
@marcorubio stop praying and do something about it.
@marcorubio Thank you.
@marcorubio Every School needs security guards for the safety of the children. This is getting to be a very sad time with so many shootings
@marcorubio you pray for the victims while collecting NRA blood money.
@marcorubio Until prayers can pass gun control laws and fund programs to help the mentally ill... Do something with your Senator status.
@marcorubio Believe you are an effective leader who cares about rights & lives. There's common ground where there is common sense.
@marcorubio @RickCanton And Surgeons, Medical team, Nurses who deal w/ physical & emotional traumatic aftermath, & ancillary support help
@marcorubio @RickCanton first Responders..CAME AFTER!! it was AMERICAN KIDS who stood up to him!!?? #Corruption #Pandering #AnchorBaby
@marcorubio We've had enough prayers, they're NOT working! Why don't you just stand up to the #NRA and pass sensible federal gun laws??
@marcorubio Then pass President Obama’s proposal for stricter gun laws. Who are  controlling the Republicans on this????
@marcorubio @rightwinglatina And thankful for Chris Mintz who assured fewer deaths and injuries.
@marcorubio Thoughts and prayers are not enough. It is time for legislative action to end this insanity. Do Something!!!!
@marcorubio we are tired of your prayers for victims just like your "support" for our troops - it is as empty because your record is empty
@marcorubio empty words, until you and the rest of the politicians do something to make change keep your prayers to yourself
@marcorubio Do u ever say anything of substance everything u say is do generic stand ip b a leader
@marcorubio and it will continue until the mental health issue is addressed
@marcorubio  the reason for this miserable reality is the failure of american capitalism. The US has become a factory of deranged stupid ppl
@marcorubio Thanking the brave first responders, who probably saved many more lives, and praying for all involved is class.  Stop hating
@marcorubio Why pray? These are just more blood sacrifices to your 2nd Amendment death cult. Human sacrifice is the result of your policy.
@marcorubio It seems that your "prayers" simply aren't enough to counterbalance the horrifically enabling effects of your votes. #gunsense
@marcorubio don't forget Army Vet who ran at the coward, shot 5 times. Go see him, he's a patriot.
@marcorubio do you people ever do anything but talk and talk about praying let alone actually pray? how dare you suggest being Christian?
@marcorubio CBO says obamacare less exensive to nation without individual mandate, what say you?
@marcorubio U should go on Rush's program. He love's your Climate Change stmts & other issues, but he's propping up Trump the Entertainer.
@marcorubio What about Obama politicizing event but not being consistent with other loss of life, that doesn't fit his agenda?
@marcorubio Let's not forget heroes like Chris Mintz!
@marcorubio You and your background check blocking Senate buddies have blood on your hands. Victims need action not prayers.
@Greg_Coogan @marcorubio Guns don't Kill PEOPLE... PEOPLE Kill People. An armed Guard or Student would have Stopped this PHYCHO..
@pbarone160 @marcorubio Really? How many die before he gets winged? 5? 10? What number you good with? Better gun is never there. #repeal2nd
@Greg_Coogan @marcorubio listen cause your a Thick headed guy I can tell. A criminal will ALWAY Find a way to get a Gun..
@pbarone160 @marcorubio I like this argument. Except all the mass shooters weren't criminals. Other than that it's brilliant. Well done!
@marcorubio Your "prompt" (21 hours after the event) response is appreciated, though we have to wonder why it didn't come sooner.
@marcorubio senstor it's come out that this guy wanted celebrity status. This was very similar to Sandy Hook. Very scary.
@marcorubio Please don't stop at prayers. We need sensible gun control legislation.
@marcorubio tell me senator Rubio what will preying do. Develope a conscience. Take guns away from people with. Emotional issues.
@marcorubio prayers are great. But what is your policy position on gun control? Leadership requires action, not words.
@marcorubio enough prayers, do something about the guns
@marcorubio what's your stance on gun control? I've been following you & interested in donating. Are you Pro or Con gun control?
That's fine @marcorubio now how about supporting responsible 
gun legislation to see that mental cases don't have access to guns.
@marcorubio Fantastic! Instead of doing anything you're just going to THINK really loud & hope something can hear u. Maybe. If u get to it.
@marcorubio our prayers are sent across the states
@marcorubio You mean preying.
@marcorubio proud of first responders and ashamed of members of congress who just does NOTHING.
@marcorubio Thank Chris Mintz
@marcorubio u r a beast
