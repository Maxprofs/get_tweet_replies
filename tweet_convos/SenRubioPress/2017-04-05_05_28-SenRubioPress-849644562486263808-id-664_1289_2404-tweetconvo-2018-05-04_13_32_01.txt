You are a gift to the likes of Assad.
Yes riiiight. The poor love. Why are people such meanies to poor innocent put-upon Bashie?
I'm not even going to dignify this fake news crap and your inept, crushing gullibility with a response. Besides this one I guess.
They obviously missed some.
Regimes that murder children and the innocent are despicable.  That includes the US and its allies.  Murder is murder.
you need to stop lien to get us into a war without poof they did this
Don't tell us. Tell the man in the Oval Office. Grow a backbone!!
The rebels must answer for why they did this to their own people for political gain
Shhh. The grown ups are talking. Go play with your tin foil hat elsewhere.
Use some common sense dude Assad is dominating, gas doesn't tactically work other than generate outrage. Day before summit ?!? Wake up man
what is the difference?
@POTUS has got this Little Marco.
Thank you for tweeting this picture! It's painful to look at, but we HAVE to!!! God bless the souls of these little ones.
THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THIS!!
Oh, if you can convince Trump to go after his buddy Putin, now that would be an accomplishment.
Putin is ready for war. he is waiting for the right time to strike us. like a venomous snake. patient and swift to strike at anytime.
putin is clever plus he is tje leader of a mob
Then why did you not give Obama green light for the same? your racism is showing.
wow, neo-con -- you are are really milking this aren't you, there's a hell for you, Thank GOD!!
#palmsunday #Hama #syria #assad area..u should tell us how they r terrorist in #EgyptChurchblast and freedom fighters in #Khan_Shaykhun
It amazes how quick you elected officials are to send us off to war but have never taken the courage to raise your right hand and the oath
derp
Where was this anger when #Israel killed just as many children ? Only matters if its someone you don't like huh?
THERE ARE STILL,  ALOT OF  UNBELIEVERS
WHAT DOES IT TAKE?
Cool ready to sign up your nieces and nephews to ask those questions with me and the rest of my brothers ?
Oh those are kids we turned away from country! those beautiful babies are banned here, THATS WHAT TRUMP& the Gop HAVE TO ANSWER FOR, phonies
@sheipet912 
I never want to be on the side of globalist neocon Marco. WAKE UP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS!!!
What have u done for them lately? Think we should ban Syrian refugees? Orginize a trip to Jordan to see how Syrian refugees live in camps
Good luck getting @POTUS to cross his boyfriend..... #trumpocalypse #TrumpLoaf #moreofthesame
So are you going to vote for war?
He'll have to check with his polling firm to see what the favorable response is before answering your question
None of them should ve saying "whats POTUS going to do?" Militarily speaking the answer should be nothing until congress acts.
@batterman_terri HUGErespect 4U&UR support 4POTUS in strikes vsSyria Clear UR GodFearing man standing4 another Relief 2GodFearing Americans
Syrian explanation sounds plausible.
You r right about that and it is time for Dems to realize America is done with people who use words+never back them up.American Strong.
Just this? Where have you been?
Always knew you were a neocon. Show pictures of what are allies are doing in Yemen? Or to their own people? #NoMoreWars #MAGA
And when will we answer for the more than 500,000 Iraqis US killed under George Bush?
Are we going to show pictures of aborted babies. It's on us also!
But for the 100,000's of Middle eastern Civilians Children Babies you have Slaughtered, When do You Answer?
That is not proof, expect more from elected officials, you should be ashamed.
republicans also
Did MCCAIN sell ISIS that gas ..sounds more probable you Zionist lapdog
after Netanyahu upgraded his missile shield, HOW DO YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T DO IT? US SOLDIERS IN #SYRIA R AT RISK NOW BOZO! CONGRESSIONAL VOTE?
Putin knew exactly how to manipulate @POTUS 'US attacks will have consequences' - Trump's ego is a national security risk @FBI @DHSgov @GOP
Weren't you one of those never trumpers?  interesting! I support him now and I supported him then, and you? Change your mind ?
@DianneMarieTH
Do you agree with @realDonaldTrump's decision to attack Syria's airbases with 50 Tomahawk Missiles?
I think he had no choice-I don't like it but I agree w/him-these R tough choices-we have 2 make-to show our strength

God love their precious hearts.
Careful little Marco, that's Trump's daddy you're badmouthing.
Who stands to gain more with a 'chemical' weapons attack that kills only 70 people, Assad or the (((people))) against him? #SyriaHoax
Why the hell don't you blame who REALLY caused it? US funded Isis rebels! Do we need to do your work for you? Ask John McCain about it. Smfh
Had you ever worn a uniform I might be at least inclined to listen to you. But you have not.
Horrible real evil!
Where's the beef? Don't blow smoke and think we'll just believe whatever politicians say. I see a devastating picture. Now, show me proof!
And this is what you too must answer for. You voted for Tillerson. He gave Assad a pass. Remember this pic for the rest of your days. Shame.
You fricken LIAR @marcorubio 
It's YOU & the rest of the TRAITORS in D.C. who must answer for funding undeclared genocidal war's for !
screw u Rubio, as you bathe in the florida sunshine you conspire to send more US soldiers to their deaths for ungrateful muslims who hate us
@flowerlady61 and Trump
U must have evidence the rest of us don't. Besides, what on earth does Assad have to gain?

Arms dealers/manufacturers on the other hand?
and you blame Tillerson .. shame on you.. Call Jim Phelps take the sucker out. POW ! Wham !
How do you answer for meeting training arming AQ/ISIS in Syria? Your so called "Moderate Rebels"?
If this is a war zone, why is everyone perfectly clean? Clean clothes, clean bodies, not a speck of dirt on any on anything? Just askn
No little Marco, this is what Obama and Bush should answer for.
And yet you support not giving these poor people refuge. No respect for you.
Is that the same Putin who installed Trump as POTUS? GOP make me sick. Can't wait to vote against you and every other republican.
How did you vote when Obama wanted to do something?
This is an obvious frame job on Assad.  Why dont you answer for the Mosul deaths before U get others to answer for fake crimes.
Fake news!!
Don't forget Obama.
I'll support a response when it's your Manlet ass on the front lines little Marco. Otherwise, stop pushing for pointless war.
How do you know it wasn't your homies Little Marco??
Because the US has never been led into war in false pretenses.
Bull.... Warmonger!
Wrong again Marco. Thje world and veterens are not buying it
We will not support you or the other senators War mongering. Syria is Saudi's problem
What proof do you have that these two are guilty. Foolish to rush in with the blame game.
let's be clear, the destruction of @POTUS would  be a bonus for you, Bushes, McCain, Msm, libs...
@JSpragens Attacks on Children should be a uncrossable redline for the entire International Community.
how's it putins fault?
no tienen perdon 
It's time u get your head out of the clouds & answer constituents instead of voting on party lines. U work for us in the US!
YOU JUST VOTED FOR PUTIN'S SUPREME COURT JUSTICE PICK. YOUR HYPOCRISY IS INSULTING. YOU HELP PUTIN EVERY VOTE YOU GET. EVERY TIME.
Really? What about your buddy #Trump he does not blame #Putin because he's in bed w him. I guess the GOP is ok w/ that.  #russiagate
It's time to make this regime go away. Really children!!! That's fu$) up!!!!!
NO WAR IN SYRIA! We are not able to be the world's police! This will end badly if we enter.
Let's support al quaeda and ISIS and label them "rebels"

-- Neocons everywhere.
You forgot "moderate"! Not extreme just moderate rebels. Notice how neocons AND neoliberals joined hands and are asking for war together.
Let's go to war in ME when terrorists kill babies to frame a country and drag us into an embarassing quagmire.

-- Neocons everywhere.
They would've been saved had we welcomed them into our country.  This atrocity is on all of us.  Our fear has destroyed our humanity #noban
@mrubin1971 better than you about analysis on ME terrorism inside #NATO #gladio #Turkey #shâm #MuslimBrotherhood http://malisnews.com/fr/selon-michael-rubin-erdogan-cherche-a-semer-chaos-afrique-de-louest/ …
Your boy @realDonaldTrump backed them both, and you back him so what yall going to do?? Oh I know, blame @POTUS44
I'm not sure Assad did it, remember Iraq don't jump to conclusions
Any evidence that they actually did it?
But won't!
was someone's hand actually up your bum when you typed this?  Or can you play puppet by yourself now?
Senator, be aware that there are those in Syria who reject the argument that Assad committed the CW attack. What of them? .@British_Aladdin
Prove it with action @MarcoRubio not empty words. #Russia, #Syria TRUMP is UNFIT to lead. Human decency before party! #Action2GetherTB
What action would that be? Hopefully you're not talking about sending people to war? If you want that, you can go. #army
There no proof it's #Putin or #Assad there a bigger chance it #Neocons #alqaeda #moderaterebels ..WakeUp Marco don't be a puppet
And Obama, and Clinton, and Kerry.
U HAVE NO MORE CREDIBILITY MARCO!! U LET THIS MANIAC IN THE WH!! BACKED HIM AFTER U SAID U WOULDN'T!! WHY WOULD ANY1 LISTEN TO A WORD U SAY!
Maybe @SenJohnMcCain should answer.  Wasn't he just there weeks ago to arrange this atrocity? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
..last time sarin was used by the rebels and they were rewarded with aid & support from the US. What'd they learn?
The "moderate" rebels are lying terrorists
@realDonaldTrump Don't send young Americans into the middle of these cycles of apparent revenge killings.
How dare you create these conditions  under a false flag event. Russia will answer to you, just not what you think
Quit being a elitist puppet Marco. The bullshit has got to stop.
Rubio you are the worst example of a politician and a Floridian. You are no better than #Assad you just attack the elderly and immigrants
Its not our business! Are you going to answer for failing Obama care? We have enough problems in FL
I would hope that you, as one of the people who will decide if we go to war, would bother to find out first who actually committed this act.
You siding with AlQaeda groups? 
How many times have the ISIS rebels tried to frame Assad in a SarinGas attack since 2013
#SyriaGasAttack
This is obviously a terrorist attack, but we'll just go ahead and label this one an Assad attack.
you have been with @POTUS tell him that. you need to stop suporting that idiot and confront his stupidity. IMPEACH that ignorant
Whomever did this must pay!! Lets get to the bottom of this one!!!
Are you really that stupid? Why would Assad do something like that now. It makes no sense. This is a false flag operation.
Those are not Americans! What about all the kids killed in Africa? We are NOT the world police! You go to Syria!
You're a little trigger happy, Little Marco
You don't give a damn about the death squads in the Philippine murdering drug users. #WarForOil #SyrianPipeline
Stop you warmongering propaganda, it was a terrorist chemical weapons stash that was hit by an airstrike.
@RonNelson77 @MdlMurray @royparrish This would not be happening if Obama had kept his word and walked across the red line and stopped Assad!
Thank god you weren't the nominee...
Pray
According to the State Department all chemical weapons were removed in 2013, seems like a false flag like the last one. Rebels are losing so
...and Trump for not allowing them in as refugees.  Don't promote hypocrisy, Marco.
YOU SPELLED "FREE SYRIAN ARMY" WRONG!!! YOU FOOLS ARE TRYING TO START ANOTHER WAR WITH YOUR FALSE FLAG ATTACKS!!! #wagthedog
I don't believe this was intentional. They bombed an ISIS building with chemical weapons in it. NO REGIME CHANGE. @POTUS
What am I looking at? Healthy, well-fed kids with plastic bags rigged up?
Putin is our president though...and you helped him win!
You must answer also. Remember you let tillerson out of committee #Trumprussia
then the #USA #Israel should shut the yinon plan and agendas down and work for the american people #NotInMyName
Thank you for your strong statement about Assad and Putin.
Hasn't @POTUS gotten intel and briefings about Assad? Hasn't he seen images of Aleppo? Is he just waking up to the Assad/Russia partnership?
