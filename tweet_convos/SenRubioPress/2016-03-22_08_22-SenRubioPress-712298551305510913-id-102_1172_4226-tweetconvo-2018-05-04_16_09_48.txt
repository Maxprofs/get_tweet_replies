"My condolences to the families of those lost today and my prayers go out to all those who have been injured." - @marcorubio
@marcorubio ditto that Senator Rubio. A very dangerous world. Even scary with the thought of Hillary or Trump in charge.
@marcorubio

@marcorubio presidential race isn't the same without your voice being heard
@ray_davee @marcorubio humiliated himself in debate by throwing out little hands low under 18 insults to Trump. Karma he dropped out.

@marcorubio Marco I hope you're in Washington? You still thinking to support open amnesty to illegals immigrants?Trump looks better daily?
@marcorubio come back! We will be waiting!
@marcorubio you're the only one who actually understood how to deal with ISIS. Shame that the country doesn't see that.
@micah10193 @marcorubio couldn't even deal with his home state people. Get your job done first.
@ClintonsMoney and Trump has bankrupted multiple businesses and doesn't self fund. Maybe tell the truth when trying to be president.
@marcorubio 
@marcorubio :-)
@marcorubio Your country needs you. You should join Cruz to help defeat Trump.  If you refuse vp at least endorse Ted.  We need you!
@marcorubio we miss you. Please come back :(
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress miss you.  Peace be with you and do what you can to defeat ISIS and keep the world safe.  May God quite you.

@marcorubio this country needs U now and we miss U. No 1 else can say an intelligent word about the issues plaguing our country. Come back.
@marcorubio Marco, your proposed immigration policies would facilitate the type of terror that occurred in Belgium.
@marcorubio Are you in Cuba?
@brucehallsports @marcorubio no he wants cuba libretto. It's not going to happen
@marcorubio Time to make peace with Trump!
