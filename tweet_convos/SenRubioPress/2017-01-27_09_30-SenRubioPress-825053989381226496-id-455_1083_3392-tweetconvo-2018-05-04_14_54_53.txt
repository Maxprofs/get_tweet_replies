have you seen the problems in Europe? It's not propaganda.
oh look another Virgin hiding behind a cartoon frog
you know your mom already took my virginity.
that was my dad. I know its weird...dont ask. Lol
then stop kissing up to Trump and his hateful agenda. Stop contributing to the marginalization of Muslims, Mexicans and women
Really??? Then why the Muslim ban? A holocaust is happening right now and you turn them away.
but you don't support the plight of others around our world trying to escape wars and oppressive regimes? #hypocrite
So you will oppose any #MuslimBan, then? Otherwise, this sentiment is worthless and hypocritical.
The Muslim ban is only for three months to gain control of our immigration and set up a system. Is that so bad?
1. That's a lie. 
2. Really think about that question you just asked.
3. Re-examine your life.
Trump isn't as bad as you think. Give him a chance, you'll see.
thank you for saying what the administration did not.
Shame on you.  You do not deserve to say #NeverAgain and serve the Bannon agenda.  Get him off NSC!  Where is your spine?
lost all respect for you and fellow republicans that are not speaking out against the fool you call President.
Amen.  All republicans are off my ticket next election.  33410 is watching Marco and we are pissed off!
And, yet we're moving in that direction with DT and gang in the house. No Muslim Ban!  A fair and just and inclusive US.
still had to make the Holocaust about #TeamMarco? Sad!
there were less than 2,000 registered jews when that story began. How did they multiply in captivity?
what do you say about the thousands that you supported Russia killing in Syria? Your silence is equal to approval. Coward
Practice what you preach, please. Supporting @realDonaldTrump 's policies on immigration is the wrong choice.
.@marcorubio According to @POTUS and anti-semite Bannon, Jews not victims of Holocaust.  Just part of the good people who were victims.
you gonna stand for religious tests little Marco? While you preach Holocaust rememberance to sound good.
- TY 4 remembering all the Jewish ppl who died & turned away at the border #NeverForget @Stl_Manifest
http://ln.is/www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/oFL7y …
using the #NeverAgain hashtag but not speaking up to save refugees is hypocritical
#DirtyJohnToilet (DJT)
how can we say never again and turn our backs to Syria as if they aren't being slaughtered by the thousands? Stop it!!
#NeverAgain seems to be happening now. Not all Muslims are terrorists. Not all terrorists are Muslims.
#NeverAgainIsHappeningNow
Others Have Paid the Price of EVIL in Ths WORLD
hypocrite.
We are headed down this road
Muslim registry is a myth.
I wasn't refering to that.
#NeverAgain - So this means you disagree with a Muslim registry and stripping Federal Funds for Sanctuary Cities, right?
we are well on our way to a repeat of one of the biggest tragedies in world history. You say #NeverAgain I say #stopithappening
What about the Syrians perishing right now? Dead baby on beach doesn't even tug at your heart??
.@marcorubio #NeverAgain is happening right now in Syria and you are looking the other way in hopes to advance your political career.
Our Nazi president intentionally left out any mention of Jewish people.
Do you remember how we turned Jews away bc they could be Nazi spies? No BAN No Wall
If you believed that you would OPPOSE white supremacist propagandist Steve Bannon who's taken over the White House and NSC.
Do we remember? What is Bannon? Never again? Impeach Trump then! Treason, emoluments, election fraud and misdemeanors. Bill wors
@SenRubioPress if you mean what you say, please oppose the #MuslimBan. we desperately need to step away from Trump's fascism.
if you truly mean that, then do not support Bannon on NSC, he is a proud anti-Semite!  PLEASE do not put party over country!
You better believe never again. And not in this country. #WomensMarch, 2018. Time to get religion out of government.
please don't vote for Sessions.
- Florida resident
then you must not support Trumps ban on Muslims.  Otherwise your words are hollow
seriously??? But yet you love Trump. Ooooooookay
Yet you can support a man that used this particular day to lunch his ban on Muslims. Get off the sidelines and get in the game
yet you're letting the same type of hate manifest itself in our country! Stand up for ALL! No seas cobarde!
Muslim Ban echoing the cries of refugees from Germany forced to return to torture and death at hands of Nazis. Shame on GOP.
Thank you Mario, since  POTUS & Bannon & the other in the WH refuse to recognize the suffering of the Jewish people.
Thank you @marcorubio for standing up against hate. We know will be on the right side of history. No on Tillerson and Sessions please! 
Don't let the Trump admin bully you! State Dept won't talk to Congress? THIS IS NOT OK!!! ACT!
you cannot be for this travel ban, can you?
you mentioned Jews ! Your buddies in the white house (nut house) forgot
is that what we do @realDonaldTrump ?
but the White House refuses to acknowledge Jews. You are aiding tyranny.
hmmm well there is an opportunity to prevent similar hatred today. Do it instead of spouting off here.
If you truly mean this, please, take a strong stand against Trump's immigration ban! #NeverAgain
I wish the Steve Bannon White House would have expressed this. #BannonOut
We are counting on you to protect us from authoritarian POTUS and his white supremacist advisor!  Impeach is needed.

No me interesa que me escriba una maldita antisemita!
y usted apoya el terrorismo! por gente como usted es que Europa va para el infierno!
#NeverAgain means fighting Trump and his ban, which is doing it again. You know he's dangerous- please fight for American values
please lend support to ban. Diff measure 4 sure but necessary. U r respected on issue, please help clarify & a support. MASA!
Than stand up to this Muslim Ban!!  DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE MADNESS!!!!
At least you mentioned the Jews. Thank you.
then don't let it happen to our Muslim brothers and sisters #neveragain
Try and remember the millions who will die over this shameful ban.
what's the point of remembering them when you're not going to do something about the Holocausts of today  oh yeah. Haven't seen
its repercussions have we? Urge you to travel abroad, and look beyond the mind's shades if you refuse to believe the pictures.
once again rubio shows his rino side. Trump has not ordered anyone gassed or put in camps or starved.  Go Trump do your job!!!
if you mean #NeverAgain then come out strongly against #MuslimBan - Please be consistent with campaign rhetoric! #NoBanNoWall
For once already, grow a pair and stand up to your schoolyard bully @POTUS. Denounce the religious ban and vote down Devos.
@SenRubioPress What then is your reaction to President Trump's executive order barring so many legal immigrants and refugees?
Next time you see @realDonaldTrump remind him about the Jews in the holocaust, he kind of forgot to mention them.
how are you keeping it from happening again? Looks like we're set to repeat it and you're not standing up! #NoBanNoWall Help Us!
➤#tRUMP➤YourStandingOn➤#EdgeOfTreason
IF YOU SUPPORT➤#TRUMP
YOUR SUPPORTING➤#TREASON
#MuslimBan #NoBanNoWall @BookNerdBecca
we are holding you to the #neveragain . Please fight against @POTUS' inhumanity.
what do you think of Bannon in the White House? Why do you think they deliberately left out the Jews in his speech?
Thank you for using the word,Jews, in this message. Trump is clueless. He is also mentally ill. Consider impeachment.
Don't let #NeverAgain be now.  Break your silence on #MuslimBan.
If #NeverAgain is important to you, you must work to stop the Muslim ban. As a constituent, I implore you to take a stand.
why are you not speaking up against the exec order to ban immigrants ...
Thank you for specifically mentioning Jews...not everyone did.
AND................................... ?
You are awfully quiet Senator! Another statement might be in order about the Muslin ban Trump and Bannon put in place.
Why haven't you stood up for Muslims?
# Double talk how about the Muslims am not even a Muslim and am shocked, am not a liberal either and am speaking up and you?
Never again, unless you have to speak out against the President, that is. Your silence on the #MuslimBan is deafening.
you are showing how more and more you are the weakest more spineless senator country has ever seen. #MuslimBan
just in case u haven't noticed #NeverAgainIsNow refugees are being turned away to their deaths and you haven't done anything
You remember the past but are doing nothing for the present as you stay silent on the #Trump EO on Muslims
Trump just made a nazi leninist commander in chief. What are you going to do about it? #StopPresidentBannon
My thoughts and prayers are with the Rubio family after his spine replacement surgery. Future confirmation votes depend on it.
on the same day this administration banned muslims from coming to the US - shame on you.  Your silence is deafening.
#notonteammarco disappointed
really never again?  Then where are you at right now? You've gone silent about the ban. Stand up!
Right. Which we honored by banning refugees. Seriously? Never again? How can you be silent??? #stopMuslimBan
Never Again is NOW. You aren't remembering the Holocaust by remaining silent on Muslm ban.
Never again? It's happening now with refugees, what are you doing about it?
#NoBanNoWall  no #SwampCabinet  no #bannonspuppet #presidentbannon  wake up!!
yet we are repeating history turning away those in need or risk death ? Where is your voice now ?
what about christians by muslims? We need to ban muslims from USA you know they teach to kill and hate us. they kill christians
and now your party on on the move to do this all over again. Sellout RUBIO
Please oppose Trump's Muslim ban. Out nation's identity is at stake.
do you remember how the US turned away Jewish immigrants and they went to their deaths?
why nothing against the immigration ban??? Use that spine presented to you...Do your job!  Don't be a traitorous coward!!!
You should be standing up and saying something. Being quiet is giving approval. The next act of terror is your fault.
so you should also be standing up and speaking out against unconstitutional and deplorable travel ban!
never again?? You're an elected official. Get up and do your job.
you need to stand up to trump! This ban and saying Christians have a priority is unconstitutional!
We must act now to Preserve: diversity, justice, freedom religion/Press,nation of immigrants. Democracy. Make you voice count
HOLOHOAX, ONLY 284,000 JEWS DIED IN WW3, RUSSIANS LOST 20 MILLION, THAT THE TRUE HORROR. THE GREAT RUSSIAN PEOPLE.ISRAEL SUCKS.
Stop being a coward and do something. @POTUS is ruining our country.  U know better and that makes U worse.
ty for this we need more Republicans to stand for our American values and speak out against #fascism #MuslimBan
Will you also remember the people who will perish as a result of @realDonaldTrump's immigration policy? Where do you stand?
This will also go down in history as the day US Democracy failed by banning Muslims
No one believes you anymore @marcorubio: We know this is purely marketing yourself and nothing more. Do the right things and prove me wrong.
then you should publicly state you oppose the #MuslimBan . I am a FL voter and son of an immigrant
How could you write this after Trump's executive order? Aren't you pro-immigrant! Pro-American? PLEASE FIGHT HIM!
Your silence on the Muslim ban contradicts your msg.Trump's EO is unconstitutional & inhuman. Help the Syrians now #neveragain
So you support the new Hitler!#NoBanNoWall #nomuslimban #Coward #standup
#neveragain ?? What happened yesterday? I think you have integrity. Do you? We're watching to see how you respond to #MuslimBan
so you'll help fight the travel ban executive order?
and you honored their memory by....remaining silent while refugees were banned?
@SenRubioPress what about speaking out against Trump's Muslim ban?
never again? And on the same day, POTUS has done exactly that. He's traversing toward dictatorship. Stop it now!
dear senator, please take a stand and be the voice of reason in your party#stopmuslinban
never again? So why are you staying silent while trump and his team take over?
Still waiting for you to speak against Muslim Ban. A son of migrants should know the importance of right to Travel. #NeverAgain
SIX MILLION to be precise.
Where are you? Where are your principles? This isn't us!  Please forget party politics and do the right thing. #WeThePeople
Waiting for your statement against the #MuslimBan. Any time now.
You can't say #NeverAgain and stay silent on #MuslimBan Show real leadership and denounce this vile act #NeverAgainisNow
what.. nothing to say about the chaos that's occurring today? Thought you and @tedcruz were pro constitution. sellllllouts
Funny, the @POTUS left the Jews out of it and you stayed silent. Hypocrite.
a very coherent politician, a.k.a. #votebeggar this is what you're supporting today
I am Joachim Hirsch. I was turned away by US immigration in 1939. I died in Auschwitz (Ps Canada did no better) 
what about EO to ban immigrants, what do you stand for?
Where are your comments on what is happening today at airports across America?!?No statement?? Are you that far up Trumps ass??
Hmmm...never again. You so sure?  Read any good executive orders lately?
Very disappointed that you have not taken a stand against this attack on our freedom of religion.
you have no right to pretend any empathy toward any group of people allowing Trump to enact his baseless blanket ban.
opposition to #MuslimBan is a good start to a never again
you say #neveragain and yet you are letting it happen again!  Please fight for America!
you're literally letting it happen again, today. #StandUpToTrump
hypocrite, your silence is deafening. How can you call yourself a Christian?
pity you are standing aside to see the next wave of persecuted perish on your watch.  #MuslimBan Except 4, rest of GOP disgusts
remember the Holocaust started with religious bans. #NoBanNoWall
and what will you say today?
Hypocrite! Speak out against the Muslim ban.We are watching you Marco
at least you mentioned Jews. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS didn't.
...it is time for you to show some backbone and stand up to the tyrant in the WH. If you don't you are what he said you are.
yet you support the new holocaust that is happening before our eyes with your silence. speak out. this is the end of America.
what's next a Wall between here and Canada!
because nothing says #NeverAgain like doing the same thing again.
Way to remember the Holocaust Victims as you support Trump in banning refugees.  Good job with saying Never Again.
So let's celebrate by detaining Muslims and sending them away, including citizens. #impeachtrump
too bad you're forgetting as we speak, and not advocating for refugees...
you're my senator where you been today
hey what are you up to today marco
We will remember this as the day the GOP stood silent as their Pres banned refugees from a war torn nation and you stood by him.
this comment is an insult considering what you are NOT doing to stop the tyrant called trump!
what about those suffering right now?
So how does it feel to see YOUR president causing havoc around the world and putting troops in danger in Mosel?
"never again" ? So let refugees in, right? DO SOMETHING!
never again until a few hours later Muslim ban 1/27/17
Unless they're Muslim. No mention of Jews in the @WhiteHouse statement. Muslim ban the same day? Fl Green Cards have voting fam
It is happening again. Right now. In America. Stand Up Senator. Be the check in the system.
how about the millions of innocent Muslims being refused from entering our country? Speak up, Senator!
you post this and do nothing on the ban on innocent people. 

You never learned the lesson of banning people on a religious test
How can you say "never again" but say nothing about turning away refugees who need our help?
@SenRubioPress #NeverAgainisNow I hope that you stand against this tyrannical president. I am in disgust with what is happening
You are doing same now to all the refugees. PLEASE remember! They already get strict vetting. Don't punish wrong people entry.
You tweet a photo that says "Never Again" yet you support a President who's doing it right now. Grow a spine and fight back.
If you truly believe this then you’ll stand up to Trump on the refugee ban.
If you truly believe this, you should voice concern over a ban on citizens from countries persecuted in the same way. Be brave.
where is your voice against the #MuslimBan? This post means nothing if you remain silent. #NoBanNoWall #LetThemIn
Your silence on the #MuslimBan will be remembered. You will have blood on your hands and your name. History will not forget.
"never again" but we are watching it today at JFK. Speak against trump or you are OUT.
