@marcorubio @SeanParnellUSA she was a Classy 1st Lady and a true warrior for her husband.
@marcorubio trump called, he wants to know can get along w/ Christie when you endorse him because you need the money?
@marcorubio your Tweet was quoted in an article by @CNET
@marcorubio 
Think of it this way little Marco: the cactus is a giant desert pickle that does not like to be touched.
@marcorubio Yeah epic sweet racist and devastating drug war & ramp up of prison industrial complex.
@marcorubio may she rest in peace as she is reunited with the last great former president
@marcorubio She was a great woman
@marcorubio But NOT a True Conservative...
@marcorubio @ConservativeWD last week I saw Mrs. Reagan on an old rerun of "Different Strokes" last week. Clearly a wonderful lady.
@marcorubio Prayers do sooooo much good....Really
@marcorubio Marco, yes a sad day with the passing of a fine woman of grace & integrity. I just can't believe it's sincere coming from you.
@marcorubio #rubio2016 es hora q tu esposa salga vamos Con todo!
@marcorubio Nancy Reagan told in her last interview, she was disgusted by the 2016 campaign and you shall keep her words in mind! #Rubio
@marcorubio Sad Day today in our country Nancy Reagan will be missed along with President Reagan two of the best the world knew. May she RIP
@marcorubio still standing with you in Florida
@marcorubio RIP Mrs. Reagan! I hope the Rep. party's underdog has made you as proud as he's made his supporters.
@marcorubio YOU GOT CRUSHED LOSER-HOW DARE YOU EVEN MENTION REAGAN-YOU GOT PLAYED FOR A SUCKER BY HE GOPe and ended your career-LEAVEFLORIDA

@marcorubio A closet gay man is not a scandal we need as our Commander https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfq87J8_Ip4 …
@marcorubio We luv U Marco! Prayers being lifted 4 the Reagan family. Deep gratitude.
@marcorubio Probably best that you stop comparing yourself to him now.
@marcorubio Marco, what makes you think you have the right to comment on anything. You are an embarrassment to the GOP. Get out of the race
@marcorubio ok good tweet
@marcorubio RIP Mrs.Reagan a beloved First Lady
@marcorubio The Reagans would have hated you. Larry King just said she was appalled by the candidates in this year's election.
@marcorubio Not like today where presidential candidates make dick jokes.
@marcorubio @ConservMemes R.I.P. Nancy Reagan. I am waiting for an older statesman to tell Marco, 'I knew Reagan and Reagan you are not.'
@golfnut332 @LexingtonBobby @marcorubio midget
@marcorubio you're awesome Marco.  Truly the right conservative.  The Reagans would be proud of you no matter the outcome.
@marcorubio Beautiful words spoken today.
@marcorubio May she rest in peace but truth is she hooked up with Ron while he was married, their kids hated and disrespected them.
@marcorubio will you start winning alrdy
@marcorubio indeed...sad

@marcorubio this condolences from his heart
@marcorubio keep in the race and spend that donor money, true trickle down economics, Reagan would be proud.
@marcorubio Is NOTHING LIKE RONALD REAGAN! Stop insulting a great president! Marco is a con!
@sharir_b @Junebug1952 @marcorubio Well, the hair color's not that different. That's about it.
@marcorubio Please, everyone,  put your anti-Rubio garbage somewhere other than a thread meant to honor the passing of Nancy Reagan.
@marcorubio well said.  The Reagan's were shining examples of grace, humility, & love.  They were what the first family should aspire to be.
@marcorubio if we could now mourn u getn oit of the race that would b great crooked pussy
