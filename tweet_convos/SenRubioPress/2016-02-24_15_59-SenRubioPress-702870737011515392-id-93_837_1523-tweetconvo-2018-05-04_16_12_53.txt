@marcorubio In 2013 Pres Obama refused to build a Death Star to strengthen US security & create jobs. If elected, will you build one?
@marcorubio Great! You should talk more and call more attention to the Communist dictatorship of brothers Castro. It's a shame what happens.
@marcorubio Surpemo wedge-driving there, douche overlord.
@marcorubio Rubio is the establishment. Look at all the establishment endorsements he's gotten
@marcorubio way to go Bill
@marcorubio Viven y vivir√°n en la lucha del pueblo cubano por la Libertad.
@marcorubio Hope they don't try that with AF1
@marcorubio Amen.
.@marcorubio's poll numbers are soft & flacid. Which is why he needs #BobDole's endorsmt to harden things up & raise his polls.
