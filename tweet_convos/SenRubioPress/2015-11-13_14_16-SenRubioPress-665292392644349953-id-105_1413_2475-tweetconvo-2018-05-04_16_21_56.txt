@marcorubio take the fight to ISIS!
@marcorubio @Norsu2 Too bad our 'government' won't keep these bloodthirsty savages OUT of the USA!
@lany891 @marcorubio @Norsu2 Marco is the 1st candidate to propose no fly zone so these ppl can stay in their own land, culture.
@JSpragens @lany891 @marcorubio @Norsu2 No Fly Zone? Not smart. What happens when Russian plane flies over. Are we going to shoot it down?
@AlyLovesMovies @lany891 @marcorubio @Norsu2 Russians want mess with a Republican president
@Big____Steve @marcorubio Marco is totally 4 securing borders includng air& sea ports & monitorng those here on visas sothey don't overstay.
@marcorubio you're  the most reasonable, respectable GOP candidate.
@marcorubio @Blaze3323 No amnesty Senator Rubio. We need to know who's here. All for legal immigration after intensive vetting.
@marcorubio JUS HRS B4 #ParisAttacks, @POTUS TELLS @GSTEPHANOPOULOS OF @THISWEEKABC THAT "ISIS IS CONTAINED"
@marcorubio Do you think your prayer will thwart/help when that kind of activity happens here bc of you bringing 100,000 to our soil.
@marcorubio Prayers offered you bet.  What would your response be to this if you were currently President?
@marcorubio you republicans permit free and unrestricted gun in our streets. It could be happen here with your help! Don't see it?
@marcorubio @TemiaBrinson I commend the sentiment, but please explain to my children how you will fight enemies when they own our debt?
@marcorubio @Chelygirl77 Marco..and prayers that world leaders grow some balls and wipe out this jihad
@marcorubio We need your huge balls now more than ever to stamp out these killers. If you had your own air force, these guys would pay.
@marcorubio Who remembers Republican's and "Freedom Fries"??  http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/11/sprj.irq.fries/ …
@marcorubio We said NO SYRIAN REFUGEES and you have not listened. You supported Obamas Plan. It's no surprise when it happens here!
@marcorubio Remind Jeb that his brother created thishttp://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/cia-directors-documentary-911-bush-213353
@marcorubio @TemiaBrinson I want to like you mister Rubio, but bankrupt armies are weak armies. Please explain!
@marcorubio @TemiaBrinson please explain to my kids why our military can't fight because it is bankrupt
@marcorubio @TemiaBrinson Please explain to my kids why we can't fight our enemies because you advocated more entitlement spending
@marcorubio be honest, if your elected this is just going to get worse. Your letting it happen now. You don't deserve to be president.
@marcorubio you still want amnesty for illegals ?So all your donors can have cheap labor ?This is immigration in 2015 Rubio!TRUMP WALL NOW!
@marcorubio @Ruach321 then why don't you seal the damn borders!
@marcorubio Committed to seeing you in the White House.  Rubio, White and Blue are the colors !!
@marcorubio @RightForRubio  Hoping you come through as the candidate Marco.  You may be the one.
@marcorubio We are all French now.
.@marcorubio this is what amnesty reaps. #GangOfEight #NeverForget
@marcorubio some of that blood is on your hands
@marcorubio We appreciate your THOUGHTS and the feeling of shared humanity. Please keep your PRAYERS to yourself! #StopPrayForParis
@marcorubio Not like you will ever go to work to benefit America
@marcorubio Those reportedly held hostage are now dead.
@marcorubio you need to rethink your stand on immigration. I have seen Many throw you under the bus, you have to do more than condemn this!
@marcorubio We Want Our Borders Closed NOW!!!
@marcorubio seal our border now no refugees
@marcorubio this is why you're being rejected by the majority of the base. You want more of these islamist to come here. Screw that!
@marcorubio Close the border, what are we waiting for?
@marcorubio Ann Coulter @AnnCoulter Every year, the US imports 100K more Muslims to live here permanently.  Rubio says he wants more.
@marcorubio @slone Seal the Border NOW!!!!
@marcorubio @slone just do your job in the Senate
@marcorubio BUILD a wall!!
@marcorubio @slone Obama declared this morning: ISIS "Contained."
Suspect tells police: "I am ISIS."
@marcorubio Please continue to support our 2nd Amendment rights so we dont have 2 suffer the same fate as the French. #prayers4france
@marcorubio Shut up Rubio! You want open borders and amnesty!
@marcorubio since the current WH resident won't say it, perhaps you can agree this was the work of Radical Islamic Terriosts #Prayers4Paris
@marcorubio Prayers are good. And then what else would you do? Don't love or hate, just eliminate.
@marcorubio @SenTedCruz It will happen here unless we elect someone who is rock-hard and steadfast against illegal immigration, amnesty.....
@okc_larry yes!
@marcorubio stop praying and start doing......stop this madness....
@marcorubio I pray that you are the one to help our country and world.  An incredible task, I know. Be THE ONE.
@marcorubio I have changed my vote from @realDonaldTrump to you!
@marcorubio
@marcorubio we are praying for Paris# God Be with the innocent
@marcorubio seal our fuckin boarders now!!!
@marcorubio and so France is shutting their borders.
@marcorubio what can we do to prevent this from happening here?
@marcorubio you were quoted in an article by @TIME
@marcorubio After 9/11, famous French response: We Are All Americans. Will you stand with our ally and say "Nous Sommes Tous Francais"?
@marcorubio Your 'amnesty to get elected' stances will legitimize islamic illegals, bringing USA more attacks, so you're not viable 4POTUS!
@marcorubio What are they doing, allowing carnage in there to continue?
@marcorubio @RickCanton You better pray for the USA too pal, it will be here soon. #refugees
@marcorubio So sad. Our prayers are with the victims , people held hostage and Paris.
@marcorubio ISIS has infiltrated the west using the so-called refugees like a Trojan horse. America must not accept any Muslim Refugees.
@marcorubio @RickCanton @tedcruz #Cruz2016 #NoAmnesty #SecureTheBorder #DeportillegalAliens 40% visa #StopIranDeal #NoRefugees #BuildTheWall
@marcorubio We need América safe again, no terrorist atacks anymore

@marcorubio Who are you Praying to the Devil!
@marcorubio Thank you sir. You see that the French are not gangsters but they are attacked by thugs
@marcorubio Thank you to pray for the French people attacked from all sides, including by his own government who abandoned the population
@marcorubio @seanhackbarth remember Ft Hood?
@marcorubio @seanhackbarth excuse me, sir: unrestrained illegal immigration did this.  Be warned! It'll happen here: remember Boston?
@marcorubio casualidad cada ves que sucede algo en Venezuela pasa algo grave en el mundo para distraer las noticias....
@marcorubio God help us if u don't do something to stop the refugees from coming here. No coincidence
@marcorubio Wake up people! Vote republican, we must get a republican in office in 2016 or this violence will continue and come to USA.
@marcorubio will this type of horror ever stop?  I fear not. So terribly terribly sad for our world
@marcorubio People in France unable to defend themselves due to strict gun control.This is a wake-up call for many reasons.You have my vote!
@marcorubio you're right Senator- we are under attack and you told us. You warned us. Please enlighten us with your knowledge #weneedtoknow
@marcorubio that is why we should keep our military at high numbers and always ready- no pre WWII levels!
@marcorubio how many people have to die for Obama to act?! Where are his executive orders now?!
@marcorubio is this #terrorist attack ?
@marcorubio  we in the United States need to be in state of alert ? And to reach out to Paris
@marcorubio this should be a reminder why the US still needs a strong military.
@marcorubio @Yemen411 pray also for dead yesterday in lebanin and pfew days back for dead in Latakia. Same al qaeda affiliates made attack
@marcorubio do you pray for the ones who get killed daily in the US?  I don't see prayer tweets for that. #Chicago
