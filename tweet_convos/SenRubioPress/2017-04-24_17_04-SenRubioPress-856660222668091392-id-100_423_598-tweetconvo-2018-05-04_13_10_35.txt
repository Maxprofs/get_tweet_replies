We don't agree on much, but I'm with you here. Thank you for speaking up for the vulnerable. I hope this is the beginning of a trend.
Since when did you become a liberal? I expected you republicans to start applauding at the thought of gay men being killed.
Alltså Marco skulle bli en svinbra president! @nilsson_gabriel Så impad över hans arbete efter valet
Verkligen! JÄVLA NEW HAMPSHIRE
Fan lika impad av Nikki Haley som diplomat. Fan vad rätt vi hade innan valet! De skulle vara ett sjukt nice radarpar
Det hade varit så najs. Nu är hela partiet kört till typ 2024 åtminstone.
Nja, Demokraterna har dåligt med kandidater. Elizabeth Warren, Corey Booker, Michelle Obama och typ Joe Biden. En för vänster och en gamling
I can get behind you on this! Now, investigate #Trumprussia, please. It's urgent. We've been attacked and you know it. Do something!
It's been investigated ad nauseum.  There is no there there.
Benghazi was investigated as nausem. Not this. And there is something there, hence ongoing FBI invest and NY AG investigation also.
#wakeup
Next you're going to tell me the dossier is real. LOL.
Ok, you're either a Russian or just stupid. Flynn, Page, Manafort, Sessions, Trump, Trump, Cohen, all lied, all going down. #Comeyscoming
Any outrage from the left would mean condemnation of islam. They r stuck between their mentally-ill ideology and reality. Reaction: silence.
The hateful rhetoric Christianity, Inc. spews about us here in the US fuels this. Make no mistake: you have blood on your hands.
Rubio was the only candidate during the primaries & debates who took on Trump & to his face.
Russians hacked Rubio in 2016 and currently
Jeb, Walker, etc. all stood up to Trump from day one, all rubio did was hide for months and then he eventually made silly orange dick jokes.
New York City & California is the left-wing liberal democratic fascism and Communist Party are trying to shut down the new station Fox News
We'll fix that too AFTER you fund and build the wall.
Translation..."The Chechen government shouldn't be so avert about their Anti-LGBTQ tactics . They should be secretive like us"
Wow @SenRubioPress  it's taking about this but @DNC is saying  zero  maybe it's time to drop @StonewallDems  and join @LogCabinGOP
Sympathy from the GOP here means little considering how antigay they act here at home. Save your crocodile tears.
ok, what are you going to do about it? You have been anti-lgbtq in your own country. How are you going to fix it?
Thanks for speaking out. However, we need you to support LGBTQ rights at HOME as well. #WeCanDoBoth
I agree with you...no one should be oppressed. So why are the medically most vulnerable being oppressed by healthcare?
you aren't holding #45 responsible and he is conducting a brutal campaign against immigrants. lgbtq up next. stop it now before its too late
It's also the wet dream of VP Pence and AG Sessions. Open your eyes.  We are heading there. Stop it in US before it's too late! Do your job!
Where was this guy when he was running for prez?!
Thank you for speaking up when others are notably silent.
Surprised, but happy to hear him speak out on this topic given that such atrocities achieve the dream of his evangelical constituents.
With all the huge problems facing USA this is where your attention is, Chechnya? GOPe-Uniparty hack. Back Trump. We voted 4 his policies.
Thank you for speaking out about this atrocity!
Can't believe what I have heard from Marco Rubio.
You and your party sold this entire country out. You all are really no better then Chechnya. SEE YA'LL IN 2018.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator!!
Thank you for speaking out Senator! Please keep the world's attention on this!
Saudi,Saudi,Saudi,Saudi,Saudi.....SAUDI ARABIA
Tryin' a run for prez again are you? Won't work. Also will you and rest of Senate, both isles work for our tax dollars instead of reading.
That's for me a real Republican, somebody who respects and protects all human rights, regardless of any social or cultural background 
What about your disappointment to the people of your state. no more refugees no more ilegals no Obama care and support the wall.  Sad
I thought you guys would support Chechnya seeing as that hating gays is a conservative value?
Well done Senator Rubio! Courageous and appropriate to speak out on the atrocities being committed by the Chechen government towards #LGBT.
It's about time that a prominent Republican leader has the balls to stand up and address this issue - well done Senator.
Thank you for this. I'm hopeful that perhaps your mind has been changed on this issue and this isn't just a way to poke at Putin & Trump.

Has he looked stateside lately?
Thank you for speaking out about this
so why aren't we bombing the shit out of them too?
Thank you
Pstly surprised that u are standing up 4 LGBT rights. U have an abysmal record w/us in the past. Is this a new leaf turned over? will tell
RT this. We must make sure this violence stops. Charge those responsible!
Thank you for taking a stand on this issue!  From a Democrat to you, I applaud your effort here.  I hope this is a continuing trend.
All of you people who are so impressed by Senator Rubio's stance -- you'd be even MORE impressed if it were someone with an actual backbone.
Marriage is a holy institution made by God for man and woman. Recognizing this doesn't deny the dignity gay persons deserve. Respect to all
Thank you for speaking out, @SenRubioPress
The Chechen government’s brutal campaign against #LGBT people and others over the last several weeks is horrific. #expressionNOToppression 
Then why bring them here? NWO rules us all. They will not allow us to MAGA.
Stop it. @marcorubio give all the speeches you want sir, your actions in this country cannot be hidden by a speech. We know how you feel.

Credit where credit is due! Thank you for using the senate floor 2 bring attention to the atrocious human rights violations on chechen LGBT
Thank you.
Thank you for speaking truth, Sen. Rubio.
Thanks for raising awareness on this. Not much coverage of this on @CBSNews @ABC @NBCNews @FoxNews
This is a good starting point. What do you suggest happens next, Mr. Rubio?
Also still bitter I didn't get to cast my vote for you last Nov
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you @marcorubio for speaking out while the POTUS stays silent.
Today marks it - Marco's decided to run for president again.
Thank you for standing up here #Leadership
U came to work?
Thank you!
why couldnt this be sent from the senators account?
Shout it sir, let this hideous behavior not go unheard.
Talk is cheap, Senator. Waiting for the day I see you actually step up and DO something,
Thank you Senator Rubio for speaking out against the horrific acts taking place in Chechnya
I'm impressed.  Thank you Senator for condemning these horrible attacks against #LGBT.   Now if only @realDonaldTrump would follow ur lead
Thank you sir for speaking out for the sake of humanity.
Thank you for bringing this matter to the Senate floor and giving it the coverage that it needs.
@caudreywells Red Herring (distraction) from issue of MAGA. Rubio, GOP
WALL WALL WALL
Castrate Obama Care
Castrate Obama Care
The GOP Campaign against LGBTQ citizens here in America is pretty horrific too.
.@USATODAY obtained copy of Republican letter requesting Trump sign executive order scaling back #LGBTQ protections. http://usat.ly/2os5wRc 
Extremely proud to have voted for @marcorubio even more because of this.
Chechnya IS part of Russia, it is not a separate country.

@marcorubio  This is why I love you so much! God said you can recognise my people by there deeds. Thank you for protecting the least of us
What about scheduling a meeting with your constituants? You can even do it one at a time if you're scared of crowds!
Senator, please look into the inhumane treatment of women in USA jails & prisons lacking supplies for basic hygiene needs(used as a control)
And? Are you just going to talk about it or perhaps something of import like a sanctions bill?
#FakeTears
This story has been largely ignored ... thank you for bringing attention to it...
Thanks for this. Wish you'd care about gays here. And it's your President who admires Putin who hates Russian LGBTQ people.
Thank you, Senator @marcorubio for turning the spotlight on those who oppress LGBT community, and for advocating for all human rights!
Why do you not want the wall? Do you believe in a nation of laws that need to be enforced? What we've done hasn't worked. Is this political?
