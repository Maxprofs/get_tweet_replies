so what are you going to do about it?
and the republican president likes it that way
@Evan_McMullin 5 years later, you supported a presidential candidate who is deeply tied to Assad's Russian sponsor.
@Kasparov63 Get Sen Cruz on the list.
Rubio. Yer a coward.
@Evan_McMullin 
Then how can you support a POTUS that admires RUSSIA/Putin?
STAND UP FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY - 
GOP is lost!
@Evan_McMullin Rubio caves after giving great talks. Hope someone can teach him to find backbone.
@Kasparov63 "Hey, you think we're so innocent?" Who was it who said that?
...and @realDonaldTrump #DutchElection
@Evan_McMullin Then @Evan_McMullin armed ISIS . ISIS started killing Christians .
.@SenRubioPress @Evan_McMullin Who forced war upon Syria? It wasn't the Russians, that's for sure.
@Evan_McMullin You voted for Tillerson who personally received Russian order of friendship from Putin.complicit in war crimes
and you keep avoiding your "rude" constituents. Where you going with this?
Yeah, and when your bill to kill the ACA risk path $ passed, you made it cost more for poor ppl. U proud of this?
@Evan_McMullin guess what: the Trump administration is also supporting al Assad.
As do you through your devotion to Twitler. #Trumprussia
@ybbkaren Impeach Trump
@Kasparov63 Marco don't forget U helped get the ball rolling.
You must decouple is from Russia or schoolchildren will read about the 2017 GOP the way they study Nixon today.
y tu sin presionar para saber si existen nexos del presidente con los rusos, etc.
So, senator, are you going to investigate Trump's ties to Russia?
There are none, pay attention, has been investigated.
you forgot #trump
Read #DworkinReport or @Khanoisseur.Trump has been dealing with Russian oligarchs for decades.Putin hackers put him in office
What about the ethnic cleansing and murders perpetrated by your Jihadist pets in Idlib Mr. Rubio?
@Evan_McMullin talk is very cheap these days Marco
You fools are concerned only with aggrandizement.  He who climbs highest has farthest to fall.  You will soon be forgotten.
Can we drop the charade wherein US politicians actually care about people... any people?
Meanwhile USG continues to support ISIS in their butchery towards the ouster of Assad.  Go home, clown.
Well, I don't want to go all Donald Trump on you but the U.S. supports and has supported lots of govts committing war crimes.
Six years later and the US is still arming al Queda and ISIS "rebels" in Syria 
@Evan_McMullin and POTUS keeps supporting Russia...
And Trump administration (with Republicans supporting) conspires with Syria's ally: Russia. What does that make you?
you voted for Putin's friend as secretary of state and now you're complaining?
and you support the idiot that colluded with Russia and LET them infiltrate out govt. way to go party loyalist.
Poor Marco. You were the rising star of Repub Party a short time ago. Now you are a floundering ship
And you support Trump who thinks Putin is a great leader.
and 6+ months later you are a coward too scared to stand up for you beliefs against your own party. #Russia #CyberWar
DO Something Senator!
can't believe your sad ass got reelected blechh
@Evan_McMullin oh. You mean the countries @realDonaldTrump has taken money from? Surprise surprise
wait a minute! You support Trump and immigration ban. You are complacent in the deaths of all banned Syrians. War criminal!
Guess what pendejo,  therefore, so does YOUR president
Yet your buddy Trump wants to be friends with them!  STAND UP RUBIO, BE A MAN.  You have been a tool for 45 #TheResistance
@Evan_McMullin time to do something maybe? Get 45 out, get real leader in, make a plan, execute plan.  You're welcome.
And yet, your party wants to ban those refugees.
6) only explanation about the crap about Assad that comes out of your mouth is that you are a @georgesoros stooge- shut up
4) Catholic Syrian priests have witnesses Rebel Snipers among protests - not peaceful- so its time YOU SHUT UP about ASSAD
2) Syrian rebels used Hilary`s sarin to incriminate Assad/2)Christian Syrian Priests have told USA not to support the rebels
Reminder Mr Ignoramus:Hilary sends email to Saudis to fuel conflict in Syria for security of Israel/Hialry relesaes sarin Lyb
Russia regularly collects humanitarian aid for Syria, while Marco Rubio never gave anything except insults and threats
Marco Rubio would rather die than help (Still less Christian) the victims of the terrorists ;...
Because he would be too afraid to irritate his bosses from Bilderberg group
Your party is pro-Russia these days.
And you still support Trump? @Evan_McMullin
Thank you for this bipartisan effort.
US supports Assad too
and our @POTUS supports Russia.
two months later and Reoublucans and Trumo are in bed with the Russians
What does the Sec of State you helped confirm say about it?
Then why the fuck did you vote for Tillerson Little Marco?
@Evan_McMullin 

So does Trumputin, and, therefore, so do you, Senator.
Finally! Syria and Russia=big deals to be dealt with now; most of the rest=debate over time. Thank you!
So do your job and demand indep. Investigation into Trump/Russia ties! Corrupt coward! #trumprussia
@Evan_McMullin And you want people to work until they die. Sorry Marcoroni. No one listens to you anymore.
@Evan_McMullin 
And of course @realDonaldTrump  you Marco are a disgrace
@Evan_McMullin And what have you done to oppose it?
@Evan_McMullin So does Trump! @realDonaldTrump




@Evan_McMullin And yet your president and your party are getting very cozy with #Russia 

We cannot trust the GOP anymore.
@Evan_McMullin Marco Rubio does a great job acting tough on twitter and in interviews.
#TrumpRussia
Compartmentalize all you like, Sen. Rubio. Voters see everything you say and do, and hold you responsible for all of it.
US needs to use military might to stop this tragedy @NATO
We went into Iraq on a pile of lies, damned if we go into Syria on even greater lies.
@Evan_McMullin 100 days later: Rubio continues to support a madman president.
@Evan_McMullin 7 years later and @GOP puts out garbage Trumpcare bill that will never pass! Russia  Assad both our enemies.
@Evan_McMullin but now Russia is Trumps new BFF
@Kasparov63 You do know's, you support Al Qaeda and IS?
@Evan_McMullin and you sir voted for Tillerson. Ur words ring hollow now.
@Evan_McMullin Yet, you voted for Putin's friend to be the U.S. Secretary of State? That is a weapons-grade hypocrisy, Marco.
@Evan_McMullin it only took 6yrs for @SenRubioPress to do this resolution. I bet Assad, Iran, Russia are scared now
@Kasparov63 coward
What about Intel proof that Russia govt hacked Yahoo, stealing millions of ppl data? Trump hasn't spoke on it! Will you @SenRubioPress? @GOP
be careful with that war crime talk buddy
@Evan_McMullin ...And now the GOP w/ @POTUS
This isn't the time to demonize refugees. This isn't the time to double down on your islamophobia

@SenRubioPress @Evan_McMullin
Last time there was a refugee crisis this large was WWII when the US turned away Jewish refugees out of fear 

@SenRubioPress @Evan_McMullin
Rubio voted 4 all of T***p's admin picks, inc Tillerson.T***p supports Assad&Putin.Rubio shd shut his mouth.
Not sure you can say bad stuff about Russia, @SenRubioPress. Did you check w/President first? @Evan_McMullin
And you support a POTUS that supports Russia. #FOff
Be nice to #Putin  #little Marco or @realDonaldTrump will #RuinYou ~
#SuckUpToTrump
...yet the President sees #Russia as ally in fighting terrorism. I think it is safer to support him than you.
6 years later, Rubio still backing ISIS in this conflict. get bent waterboy
Russia must be excluded from UNSC
and you had dinner with someone who supports #Russia and aspires to be like Putin. @Kasparov63
@Evan_McMullin Thanks for confirming Tillerson. I’m sure he’ll stand up to Putin…lmao.
@Evan_McMullin excuse me? So does your president and his followers, who now pray for Assad!
Bashar, ISIS or al-Qaeda. I'm going with the secular dictator.
@Evan_McMullin Blah.Blah.Blah. All Rubio does is talk.  Investigate #TraitorTrump
@Evan_McMullin Thank you  for that stand. The massacres in Syria need 2 stop, & only a strong western alliance can do it.
No, the west needs to step back and stop funding and arming terrorists. We don't need WW3.
you back a guy with ties to russia so.........
& you are silent on your leaders lies. Don't lecture about corrupt gvmts when U don't acknowledge what's happening here
