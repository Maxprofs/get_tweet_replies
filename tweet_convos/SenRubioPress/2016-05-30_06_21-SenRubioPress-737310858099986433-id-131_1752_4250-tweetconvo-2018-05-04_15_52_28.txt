@NC_Char   And elect a con artist?
I've read about the Clintons and the more I read the less I like them. Ever read?I like Rodger Stone's books.Clintons are scum.
Either be civil or climb back in the gutter.
Just answering your comment.YOUR comment.
Try to keep up. That was a comment  @marcorubio, made about @realDonaldTrump. I  want to know why he would support a con artist?
He's a senator and you're not. If u support Hillary - THAT is even a bigger mystery. Read Stone's & Peter Schweizer books.
No mystery. I am choosing a leader over a racist, misogynist, adulterer. Who is not qualified to govern this great country.
She's counting on people just like you.
defend us from the evil that is Trumillary.We are doomed.Rubio for President!!!!
and you'lfd vote for the guy that represents all the Corporate pigs...ur sum kinda stupid
Trump is the Queen of all corporate pigs.
@BillKristol @marcorubio

Thank you Marco for being a man of integrity. May God bless you and may He continue to bless America through you.
We love you, Senator @marcorubio :) 
Christ is with you, & please know America desperately needs you as the next POTUS! :)  @BillKristol
And then you pivot and piss on veterans every time you cut the budget. RACIST SCUM you and your party are DONE and you know it.
And the maniac you support for President, Drumpf, says McCain is not a hero -- and YOU, Mr. Rubio, support him! NO INTEGRITY
#ProudAmericans Marco, thank u too for the critical work u do in reforming the VA.Our living Vets deserve it.#MemorialDayWeekend
Actually if you were indeed watching, Boobio missed most of the voting to run his campaign

My dream is that one day Marco Rubio will be leading our nation. I will fight for it. Marco, I hope you will as well!
Do you include the gays and atheists in that?
descarao hipocrita.. Eres una verguenza para la comunidad latina
@FirstMate1060 thank you
When I see Sen Rubio, I think President. "Patience is the Key to Joy" ~ Rumi
@magnifier661
Marco would be a good VP - Trump will be elected via peoples distrust and others indifference ... winning ticket
@SenRubioPress when will fit dads be free from the family law industry?
how did #TheRapistsDonald's boots taste?
do you truly want to help the troops? Then do your job and fix the VA and pass better medical benefits for veterans.
I love you again Marco.
, yeah  you honored those that gave their lives, by backing the fool that has never paid a dime in taxes , to support them.
#NeverTrump great respect for you but not Trump
standup and denounce Donald Trump
Watched Unbroken today. And The Great Escape. Heart wrenching. God Bless those who serve and those who have served.
you are so right to rally behind mr. Trump God chose Mr Trump to fix America you will  be exalted for your humility GOD bless U
Trump's VP? would be nice!
the besrt veterans' care is still to not even create them by not going into every senseless war. happy #MemorialDay2016
THANKS FOR DOING RIGHT THING AND ENDORSING TRUMP
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #alwaystrump #NeverHillary #Trump2016 #TrumpTrain
He didn't really....said he wanted to help the party beat Hillary and wants to present HIS ideas at the convention.
Please do not support Trump, Marcoh!!!!
@YoungBLKRepub 
Hows your spine? 
Yellow looks bad on u!
How u gonna spend your 30 pieces of silver?
SINNER!)
#CruzCrewForever
Donald trump whipped your but...he labeled you #a chocker,
We don't need a chocker as president #wanna be

@Norsu2 and may you please not surrender that liberty by propping up a tyrant.
The people who died defending stupid Republican decisions in order to keep corporations happy.
you are just like one of  the Patriots  we are honoring today your humility and forgiving heart is inspired  by God thank you
Amen Mr. Rubio. Let's make America great again!
-thank you - you're a good man who got doublecrossed by the RNC
something tells me those who died did not imagine they died for the likes of Donald trump.
Smart move with Trump. You can run for Governor in FLA and win with him campaigning for you. Or? I'd love to see you as VP!
@YoungBLKRepub im glad you and trump are burying the hatchet time to go win this now
I don't understand these negative tweets, do you all, just sit and wait for for marco to twwet? ?  Get a life!
Too bad that you were not giving the opportunity to wear the military uniform. Or maybe you did not take it ?
i like u until u gave ur delgates to trump, what r u looking for a job
what about the atheists in foxholes ?
God bless you & your family.You are the best America has The American Dream.
Thank you for thoughtful words 2day.#ProudAmerican
Wait - we love those who suffered & died 4 us? But Trump says they're LOSERS.
Thank you Sen. Rubio.  I voted for you, but will now support the candidate Donald Trump. The left is destroying the US of A
Sen Rubio this is just one of many reasons you will always have my vote , and why you are our rightful Commander in Chief
thank you for being a man of your word and supporting the republican party and Trump. May God richly bless you.
Amen
@WinnaWinna2016

You are such a hypocrite. How can you live with yourself or even think Americans respect what you say? You are a joke, Sir!
TY 4 supporting our military! God bless you & for all that you do for them. We need to elect a CIC that supports our military.
May Perpetual Light shine upon them, May they rest in Peace, Amen

Thanks Marco for supporting Trump!
I really wish you were going to be Commander in Chief.

LITTLE MARCO...!!!!
Thank you for serving our country Marco, sacrificing time away from family to run with rats to become POTUS. U did us  proud! 
I was at your rally in Va beach and I adore you. I will support you in all of your future endeavors!!!
They are Missed but Not Forgotten.
@trucelt And their families!
@AlbertoBernalLe invading countries and killing millions of non-Americans. #oorray
Defending our liberty & helping wealthy corporations profit huge on a war in the wrong damn country. Shamefull of our leaders
so Christ wasn't very sacrificial?
and thanks God we can't trust you as well...
very proud if you for supporting Donald Trump, that takes character and show you are a strong man
And the soul of those innocent people they killed.
Amen.
Oh and knock 'em dead with an inspiring speech today commemorating the fallen. Can't wait to hear it.
Thank you Senator for reminding everyone of the true meaning of #MemorialDay2016 #proudamerican
glad u support DT to get together to be in WH in Nov. hope u could be sectary of state in DT adm. together make american great!!
You mention God, quote long passage from Scripture when you suspended campaign, but will support Mammon worshiper Trump? Shame!
Be honest... how bad did you want to spell it "Honer" ? #HonestTree
How can you support this man? He mocked our Vets and Pows. #NeverTrump https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/18/trump-slams-mccain-for-being-captured-in-vietnam/ …
Why would support Trump after what he said about your father.I could NEVER
Are you referring to what Trump said about Ted Cruz's father?
I was wrong  thank u.
thank you Senator today is about the real heroes #ProudAmerican
@marcorubio
Pray for our military as they assist in the retaking of Fallujah
may we also remember families who feel their losses more acutely. Bless the men and women in uniform & their families #heros
Why do you hate our military? @dawinkek @marcorubio
He has been doing a lot to help@Vets My husband is a vet VN
Which is why the response from dawinkek is sickening. @courtchauncey @dawinkek @marcorubio
Marco Rubio is a hypocrite Kohl's Trump dangerous con man and now he endorses Trump.. that says a lot no honor
thank you, Sir. May God bless you as you honor those gave their all!
.@marcorubio God Bless you and more importantly your team of staffers, sir. Keep up the great work! 
Love you Marco!
Have a great day! :)
