Iran needs to also help locate Floridian Robert Levinson. This hostage-taking must stop.
@marcorubio I guess you see no fault in America holding hostages at Gitmo without charges, for years.
@Plantflowes @marcorubio Inmates at GITMO are murderous terrorists. If U feel for them, maybe U should B investigated. THEY CAN ROT THERE!
@RachGreenb @marcorubio You have no idea who is in gitmo. Give me the names. without googling
@Plantflowes @marcorubio U're in a better position 2come up with those names.U're probably their relative.
@marcorubio @PatriotTabby  Where is Levinson? Abandoned by Obama!!!
@marcorubio "prayers answered"?  This happened as a result of #TRUMP putting pressure on Administration. Too bad it's a bad deal.
@Oil_Ranger @marcorubio That is the dumbest respond I have read.  @realDonaldTrump had nothing to do with this.  Keep lying to yourself
@delroy777 and let me guess you think >> @marcorubio did?  hahaha he doesn't even show up to do job he's being paid for.
@Oil_Ranger @marcorubio No not at all Rubio is a sell out hypocrite who would do anything to be POTUS. His mendacity is plain to see
@marcorubio and all it cost us was $150 billion dollars and a future nuke. #obamafail
@duckwhacker @marcorubio lol so misinformed America didn't write a check to them and there is no Nukes. Stop spreading lies
@Dsandz15 @marcorubio You stop the lies. Obama lets Iran and Russia bend him over
@duckwhacker @marcorubio Right, both of there economies are in shambles. But, Obama is bending over.
@Dsandz15 @marcorubio and our economy is awesome! Oh, and you can keep ur doctor too! Putin gives Obama wedgies on the reg
@duckwhacker @marcorubio and I will keep my doctor, I have keep him because he is not out to get money he really wants to help people.
@Dsandz15 @marcorubio bullshit! Obamacare is an epic fail by any measure. And it's sooooo affordable. Lololol.
@marcorubio "another American" you don't even know his name?That's part of your job!
@Oil_Ranger @marcorubio actually it's the White House's job.
@flintcorey418 maybe if @marcorubio would show up for the job he is getting paid to do, he would know the name of "another American"
@marcorubio a god fixed this? Like he/she is fixing violence? I'm going with diplomacy on this one.
@marcorubio Amen. Bless them. Our hearts and prayers are with them & their families & pray they get the time 2 heal God bless America
@marcorubio that's the Republican Party, say prayers and buy mor guns... Pregnant and in front of the stove
@marcorubio if all it took was praying they die in prison
@marcorubio and thanks to our @POTUS and John Kerry for negotiating their releases, right? Or are you that partisan and stubborn?
@marcorubio What are the Iranians getting? Who and how many? How much money? This is BS.
@marcorubio Nice use of passive voice. Reminder: this didn't just happen by divine benevolence. Obama & Kerry made this happen. Give credit!
@leftyjennyc @marcorubio WAKE UP!!!
@marcorubio Prayers didn't bring them back. Careful diplomcy (that you condemned) did
You go home and pray while politicians do their job
@nima_rasekh @neonfeldman @marcorubio I pray. But I also act. Even if I believe in God, I don't think he's Santa Claus.
@dancingbeanbob @neonfeldman @marcorubio
I admire that
But Rubio did not act. He only criticized the deal although it got our people back
@marcorubio it wasn't prayers idiot..it was the results of leadership and diplomacy.
@marcorubio why are you thankful for the release when you criticize the President for the swap? Idiot
@marcorubio It was diplomacy that freed the captives, not bombs. Remember that.
@marcorubio it wasn't thoughts & prayers that freed those ppl, it was diplomacy by @POTUS & @SecKerry.
@marcorubio @duchess1201 were you #Fake Smiling when you said that?
@marcorubio Prayers? Thank your president and his commitment to diplomacy!
@marcorubio ONE BIG THANK YOU to DIPLOMACY.Thank U BARAK OBAMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@marcorubio no thanks to you or your visions
@marcorubio what an awesome God we serve! Prayers have not gone unheard
@marcorubio Thanks 2 Obama and Better Communications With Iran If It Were UP 2 Rubio/GOP they Would NOT have been released
@marcorubio Instead of being happy, you took another opportunity to ridicule Pres Obama. I'm fed up with your terrible, spiteful behavior.
@marcorubio This was @JohnKerry @BarackObama  there were FIVE released - take some time to look up the names it's shameful you don't know.
@marcorubio You can't even be at work to vote - you need to stop talking now. You had nothing to do with this. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/01/16/sit-the-hell-down-and-shut-up-montel-williams-blasts-critics-of-iran-prisoner-swap/?tid=sm_fb …
@marcorubio thanks Obama!
@marcorubio wasn't it a prison swap? Isn't that negotiating with terrorist?
@marcorubio #ThanksObama
@marcorubio prayer had nothing to do with it. Diplomacy had everything to do with it. Diplomacy, something you know nothing about
@marcorubio Another win for diplomacy!
@marcorubio it sure as hell wasn't your prayers that secured their release @GOP
@marcorubio thank you @POTUS!
@marcorubio Rubio has no clues about foreign policy! Too Green!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@marcorubio @GOP @TXGOP @HouseGOP @Senate_GOPs #gop #greta #hannity #irandeal

Not prayers, Diplomacy!
DumbPrettyAss!!!
!
@marcorubio thanks to Obama ! click your high heels to that bub
@marcorubio has made it clear that all he'd do is pray for release; wouldn't actually negotiate to bring them home safely
@marcorubio yep! Thank God Obama is president and you'll never be.
@marcorubio Thank the Obama administration!
@marcorubio Yeah, and done so thanks to Pres. Obama's administration. #ThanksObama
@marcorubio God did absolutely nothing to solve this.
@marcorubio Thank God that Diplomacy has prevailed over bellicosity...
@marcorubio yes Marco, U want a Christian theocracy. That's as bad as Iraq
@marcorubio I have been praying for you and the rest of the GOP to grow a heart and it's not working. Any hints?
@marcorubio Hahaha! Thank your President, Marco! Biden & Obama a real statesmen. Watch em work!
@marcorubio are you really cause I saw you bashing the deal earlier
.@marcorubio i think your president had more to do with it then your god had...
@marcorubio thanks, @POTUS
Prayers didn't bring them home @marcorubio Thankful @POTUS & @JohnKerry r bringing them all home safely
hey @marcorubio how about thankful that @potus and @JohnKerry know how to use diplomacy and bring them home? #truth
@marcorubio … It wasn't "prayers" I got them released, it was skillful negotiating by @POTUS
@marcorubio Agreed. I prayed hard we would elect a president who uses diplomacy instead of war and my prayers were answered. Twice.
@marcorubio Thank YOUR President and his "feckless and failed policies" for bringing them home.
@marcorubio It's a same that these people aren't American enough to actually celebrate this without trying to score politic points.
@marcorubio  U.S. ans U.N. have paid an high price. I do not believe that Iran has met the requirements ...
@marcorubio Prayers are pointless and ineffective. Thank you President Obama for your diplomacy.
@marcorubio Nothing to do with prayers. It was the leadership of our President and Diplomacy of Secty Kerry.
@marcorubio Prisoner swaps old as time and 4 lives saved. But politics comes first. President Rubio would let Americans rot?
@marcorubio   They were in captivity because of the weak policies of Hillary Clinton and Obama.
@marcorubio Shouldn't we thank God for using the president to answer our prayers too?
@marcorubio   Good news.
@marcorubio I guess prayers work after all and aren't just made up bullshit that only idiots believe in
@marcorubio And Thank God for @POTUS &@JohnKerry 4 brokering this deal 2 bring R men home! A simple thank you 2them also will suffice Marco!
@marcorubio You and your prayers had nothing to do with it!!
@marcorubio Would it KILL just one of you to give credit where credit is due?  Be the bigger person just once.
@marcorubio
@marcorubio why not pray for a perfect world if your prayers get answered?
@marcorubio it was diplomacy idiot. Prayers didn't do it
@marcorubio THANK YOU PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY KERRY!!!
@marcorubio While you prayed, Obama got the job done. I am grateful for a great leader, not your useless prayers
@marcorubio did you pray to Obama? He got them out.. Not God!
@marcorubio @ellerich17 Thankful? Parayers? It cost 150 billion + 7 terrorists? Moronic statement.
@marcorubio you can thank @POTUS and @JohnKerry diplomatic negotiations with Iran. Go ahead, I'll wait
@marcorubio :Gracias a dios, que ya estan libres......
@marcorubio Prayers don't do squat. Action does.
@marcorubio You're an embarrassment to the University of Florida.
@marcorubio Prayer didn't bring them home.  Thoughtful, deliberate diplomacy did. Something the warmongering GOP knows nothing of.
@marcorubio Not prayers. Diplomacy. Learn the difference.
@marcorubio So it was just prayers that got them released? Good to know.
@marcorubio Prayers answered in the form of President Obama &  the Democrats wise policies regarding Iran. Diplomacy wins.
@marcorubio How incredible stupid of you, those Iranian American are free only because of President Obama, they didn't WALK  are you insane?
@marcorubio What you MEAN is thank you John Kerry and @POTUS for conducting successful negotiations
@marcorubio Marco will never thank President Blackenstein and Sec. Kerry. That would take being a man.
@marcorubio it's actually more like 50-60 billion, which is their money anyway. We are not writing them a check.
@marcorubio You ridiculous ingrate! shouldn't "god" have prevented the whole f'ing thing to begin with?
@marcorubio I guess 'Nosratollah Khosrawi' was too much for you to tweet. Idiot.
@marcorubio Prayers had nothing to do with it you poser.
@marcorubio @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump @ChrisChristie @JebBush @Thank @POTUS !
@marcorubio wasn't prayers, was actual diplomacy. You should study on that for the next couple of times u ignore your job and run for office
@marcorubio it wasn't prayers to an imaginary God that made this possible, it was Obama's diplomacy. You have much to learn.
@marcorubio yup, amazing what a little diplomacy does. Thanks Obama for being a great president.
@marcorubio really so helpful.  how about give credit to the christian man who actually worked for their release?   diplomacy rocks u stink
@marcorubio  All those prayers did was produce CO2 for trees.
@POTUS President Barack Obama saved those people.
@marcorubio Prayers? Seriously? That is how You are Planing On Conducting Your Foreign Policy? Go Home Rubio! Not Ready 4 Prime Time.Idiot!
.@marcorubio a big Thank You to our amazing President of The United States Barack Obama! @POTUS
@marcorubio   thought you disagreed with the President and  now you r changing your mind again? Your the big O Rubio over stocked sold
@marcorubio
Except that it had nothing to do with prayers but smart diplomacy
@marcorubio Republicans are a joke. Nuff said
@marcorubio bahahaha prayers. try diplomacy jackass.
@marcorubio Can you pray to God to stop global warming? Thanks.
@marcorubio no magical incantations,  including prayers have any effect.  Join the 21st century and move out if the bronze age skippy.
@marcorubio aww.. you were praying for @POTUS diplomatic efforts? What a MArco Rubio is da man! :)
@marcorubio You should thank Obama and John Kerry you idiot. They are the ones that made it happen.
@marcorubio The Lord’s agent, Barak Hussein Obama, did it!
@marcorubio Sorry Marco. God doesn't trump Obama on this one.
@marcorubio Or we could've traded arms like ur God Reagan right? It's called diplomacy if u went to work u might know this clown
@marcorubio Still no MT of US Hostage #RobertLevinson in Iran
#Breaking: on US Hostage Swap. 1 American #RobertLevinson, (Captive: Mar. 9, 2007) was not MT in Release https://twitter.com/NetAdvisor/status/583458133663555585 … #News
@marcorubio You really think it was prayer? Really?? I'm praying you don't become president. Polls think my prayers will be answered.
@marcorubio God told everyone to not listen to you and other Republicans on this.
@marcorubio while you were hard at work praying, actual statesmen were doing actual statesmanship.
@marcorubio nice words here Rubio,why on tv your words about the release weren't so kindly said,u trashed Obama's team 4 taking 2 long,stfu
@marcorubio So you're admitting, little boy, that you didn't know what the HELL you were TALKING ABOUT Thursday?
@marcorubio the prayers failed for 3 years. The negotiators succeeded.
@marcorubio  Yes thank God but, it was because @BarackObama  does this Proverbs 29:11 Proverbs 19:11
@LiberalPaul @SuzyBlueLady @marcorubio Condemns Prisoner Swap for Post Journalist Jason Rezaian because @POTUS http://time.com/4183530/marco-rubio-washington-post-jason-rezaian/ …
@marcorubio Prayers were answered when Obama was re-elected and presided over Iran Deal.
See how that worked?
@marcorubio Prayers didnt free him you turd. Obama's negotiating & diplomacy did. You would have them still captive so u can pray them free
@marcorubio It wasn't prayers that did it. Especially not your obscene prayers for Iran - and its people - to be bombed. What a schmuck
.@marcorubio yeah, thank god we elected @BarackObama twice. Now get back to work, welfare queen.
@412V70 @marcorubio @BarackObama vote for bernie the socialist #everyonedeserveseverythng
@marcorubio 
Fun Fact:
Prayers had nothing to do with it. Diplomacy did. Feel free to join us in the real world, bruh.
@marcorubio nonsense....this Iran prisoner swap just put future Americans at risk of kidnapping by radical Islamic scum!
.@marcorubio If this was an #ActOfGod you must see he was working through #Obama, a better #Christian than all of you. #ActionsNotWords
.@marcorubio If GOD would have been just, #JasonRezaian would've been released on day 1. Thank you- diplomacy Kerry & POTUS #IranDeal
@marcorubio "Onward Christian posers, lusting after war; making mock of Jesus, and all that he stood for." Sing this on Sunday, hypocrite.
@marcorubio If prayers brought them home, why didn't you pray harder earlier? And why did God wait until the nuke deal to act?
@marcorubio for what Marco?  Did you change parties
@marcorubio lucky that Iran was praying to the wrong god
@marcorubio @RedNationRising Prisoners not released unless TRUMP brought conversation to the people.  SHAMEFUL!!
@marcorubio Prayers? you really are a plank! Try calm negotiations by a democrat not sabre rattling GOP tosspots!
@marcorubio praising God!!!
@marcorubio thank god for @POTUS
@marcorubio you are thankful, yet the man from the state and area you represent still in captivity..We wonder what's wrong with country
@marcorubio Sad news for crazy warmongers like yourself, i guess.
@marcorubio you were doing the negotiations this whole time with god? Incompetent state dept talking to the people who were holding them
@marcorubio It wasn't prayers, it was diplomacy.
@marcorubio @RedNationRising Of course there is the fact we had to release 7 nuclear terrorists for them.
@marcorubio LMAO!!! Prayers??? How about diplomacy and hard work to avoid more death and destruction???
.@marcorubio The diplomacy you opposed is what freed them, Your prayers had nothing to do with it. (Frankly doubt you even did that)
.@marcorubio Prayers? bollocks. Your negotiators and diplomats did this, not some invisible friend in the sky.
@marcorubio  be thankful this administration has common sense. You would have escalated the situation, costing the U.S many lives.
@marcorubio I believe in God too but this was diplomacy, not prayers. Stop dividing our country w/rhetoric.
@marcorubio your thoughts and prayers did nothing. President Obama and his team are those who secured their return.
@marcorubio it wasn't prayer that did it, it was work, which you would not know about you absolute PAYASO
.@marcorubio +It was DIPLOMACY, not prayers that allowed for the release of the 5 Americans. Thank God #47Traitors failed. #p2 #tcot #lnyhbt
@marcorubio correct,  prayers were answered,  and a peaceful resolution under President Obama's leadership.
@marcorubio It was @BarackObama & @johnkerry diplomacy. I prayed they ignore ignorant demands from you & GOP clown show for military action.
@marcorubio thanks @POTUS
@marcorubio Prayers had nothing to do with it, DIPLOMACY did. Learn something.
@marcorubio Thanks Obama!
.@marcorubio Thankful for @POTUS & @JohnKerry. It takes courage to speak to our adversaries. Diplomacy works! No more @GOP Pres.  #p2 #tcot
@marcorubio The other TWO Americans are Nosratollah Khosrawi & Matthew Trevithick. Not "and the rest," like the Professor and Mary Ann.
@marcorubio Yes it was a miracle, not the steady hard work of US officials. YOUR prayer made it all possible. Putz.
@marcorubio OBAMA DID THAT!!!
@marcorubio   Praise Obama not your meaningless prayers!
@marcorubio you forgot to thank @POTUS
@marcorubio While you at it, send thanks to President Obama and John Kerry too.
@marcorubio I guess now you GET that this was part of the #IranDeal given the timing, huh?
@marcorubio Prayers brought comfort and hope to loved ones, but it took the diplomatic efforts of the Obama Admin to bring them home. #truth
@marcorubio it's called diplomacy or as you put it surrender
@marcorubio it wasn't prayers that did the work on this
@marcorubio Prayers didn’t work. Diplomacy from POTUS and Sec Kerry is what worked. You should look into this concept. #DiplomacyWorks
@marcorubio thank @JohnKerry & @POTUS
@marcorubio I think you forgot, "Thank you Mr @POTUS !"
.@marcorubio So the negotiations directed by Obama had no impact, but prayers did? Is that how you would lead our country? You're a joke.
@marcorubio Do you wonder why you gain no traction?
@marcorubio God is GOOD! Thank you God! Pray for healing and restoration. This is awesome!!!
@marcorubio you didn't pray for them opportunistic liar. And they are free thanks to hard work of Obama administration
.@Mahogany1992, .@marcorubio <- Is an unprincipled dimwit that's 2-watts brighter than that dimwitted Sarah Palin. He really is childish.
@ranman09 @marcorubio He's Sheldon Adelson's tool & puppet...you see how rehearsed he is...he's never had an original though in his life...
.@Mahogany1992 You are absolutely correct about his lack of originality.  .@marcorubio is a beltway-media-echo-chamber creation.
@ranman09 @marcorubio A total lightweight who is jealous of president Obama...He needs to get over himself...
.@Mahogany1992 Did you know that .@SusanPage of USA today, once claimed this dimwit --> @marcorubio was on par with President Obama @POTUS?
@ranman09 @SusanPage @marcorubio @POTUS That gym shoe is dumb as a box of rocks anyway...her opinion don't count...
.@Mahogany1992 Hahaha ROFL. "That gym shoe", I never heard that phase before. LMAO :D :D :D @SusanPage @marcorubio @POTUS
