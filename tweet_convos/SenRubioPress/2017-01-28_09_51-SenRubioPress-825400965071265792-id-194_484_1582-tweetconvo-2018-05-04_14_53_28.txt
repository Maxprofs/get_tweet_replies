@marcorubio @NASA the teacher in this picture from public school. She gave her life to every American
@marcorubio @NASA  save our kids from private only education Devos does not know Education
كنت في ثانويه عامه
i was in secandry school
@marcorubio @NASA One of those events that people remember where they were and what they were doing when it happened.
your failure to condemn @donald trump #muslimban means you now have the blood of those killed in #Quebec on your hands
This ban is abhorrent, un-American, badly thought out & will be counter-productive. Worst move imaginable, please stand up.
@marcorubio Cat got your tongue? The nation is upholding Constitution with or without you. We won't forget your inaction
.@SenRubioPress @marcorubio A lesson from Columbia: Don't ignore the consensus of scientists. E.g., greenhouse gas and extinction of mankind
You honor them, but your party shuts down there twitter feed?
Still no comment on the Trump immigration and refugee executive orders? Moral clarity?
I thank you, Senator Rubio, for your well thought out response.
@marcorubio I couldn't believe it when you endorsed Trump. Have you no dignity?
I watched in horror that day...I have a crew photo tucked away w/the beautiful words of Pres Reagan taped 2 the back.
Hmm......

Q.  What do you call someone without a spine?

A,  Marco Rubio

@SenRubioPress
#TrumpInaugural 

I solemnly swear  to uphold the laws and NEVER say a negative word against Mother Russia.
…
Surely, a great American tragedy. But not a single word regarding #MuslimBan?
How will you honor the thousands who will die because of Trump's illegal executive order? @SenRubioPress @marcorubio @NASA
Die? where? It's not an illegal executive order.
why are you silent on the crazy actions of DJT?  Stand up - get a spine! I hope to see u out of Florida next election cycle !
Why are you tweeting about this now? STOP THE #MuslimBan
Your constituents are against this travesty!
it's only temporary and it's needed . Not only vetting but also preventing illegal migration.
Hopefully the federal government continues to FUND NASA so they can continue important work!
@marcorubio @NASA i remember watchin the rocket take off. one of the ppl was my teacher in Denver. Barnyford elementary
@TDOnline Senator Rubio, your failure to speak out on @POTUS muslim ban is a profile in cowardice.  Par for the course.
honor them by not confirming Trump nom's who are anti-science climate deniers!
7 Americans embracing diversity! #MuslimBan
.@SenRubioPress .@marcorubio the son of immigrants and you say nothing about the #MuslimBan. Your silence speaks volumes...
There is nothing wrong or illegal about a ban. It's temporary and it's needed until all bases are covered.
Need another seven astronauts
By cutting funds to NASA?
@marcorubio @NASA #ScienceMatters
Let's talk about the lives lost when POS @POTUS OK'd military action w/o sufficient intel, hmmm???
@marcorubio you have no backbone and need to put country over Party!!!
@marcorubio  With all due respect sir, your silence right now is deafening. #MuslimBan
You were all talk on Tillerson. What about our Constitutional crisis?
senator rubio, will you speak out against trump's immigration and refugee ban, which is actually tantamount to a ban on muslims?
Y R U NOT SPEAKING AGAINST THE RACIST AND IGNORANT IDEAS OF TRUMP, u already chicken out on REX
Please oppose Devos, the wall, the travel ban, repealing ACA, and stand up for science.
Trump has silenced NASA on social media. He's a bully dictator. I bet you would be calling for impeachment if he was a Dem!
I urge you to speak out against President Trump's EO of increased scrutiny to American visa holders.
@marcorubio @NASA Which group will be discriminated against next? Cubans, Jews, Blacks, gays, Catholics???? A precedent's set
@marcorubio @NASA As a child of immigrants, you have betrayed your heritage and the American people. Shame on you.
@marcorubio @NASA Coward!!! Your silence speaks volumes...it's only always about you and your interests...DISPICABLE
@marcorubio You're NOT getting my vote! You have NO backbone against the travesty from DJT. Speak up!!!!!
your silence is deafening!
Where ru today Sen Rubio while immigrants LIKE YOUR PARENTS are being banned?Perhaps #Trump was right about you
@marcorubio @NASA ?
@marcorubio I guess you only care when the topic is Israel/Cuba. You haven't said one word on the #Muslimban You're a wuss.
You're my Senator Mr Rubio.Did u know Christa Mcauliffe was 1st Arab-American astronaut?Why r u silent about Trump's EO ban?
@marcorubio Chickenshit!
Where is your statement on the #MuslimBan Being quiet is being guilty.
@marcorubio Not a single word from you Republican Cowards who will not stand up the malignant narcissist sociopath Trump!
@marcorubio @NASA 
How many came from immigrant families
@marcorubio good diversion technique. Anything else going on in last 24 hrs?

#StopPresidentBannon
@marcorubio @NASA Too bad you won't honor their sacrifice by accepting NASA's climate research.

@marcorubio Bannon on the principals committee! Dir of national intell & Joint Chiefs of Staff out! HELP US!
@marcorubio your fam came here as refugees and you don't have the audacity to stand up to Trump's policies
@marcorubio @NASA Grow a backbone Marco. You despise him,  we despise him. DO SOMETHING!
@marcorubio @NASA NASA is a true believer of climate change. They can see the damaged done from space. #TyrantTrump
@marcorubio I voted for you in the primary, but if you plan on capitulating to Trump, you deserve to be called #LittleMarco.
@marcorubio @NASA Are you hiding? What kind of president would you have been when you don't stand up for the Constitution now
@marcorubio still  *crickets* on Trump's UNAMERICAN and UNCONSTITUTIONAL #MuslimBan. As a son of immigrants you should SPEAK.
@marcorubio do not normalize @realDonaldTrump 's incompetence. #impeach
Bannon being added to National Security Council. Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence removed http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-signs-order-to-revamp-national-security-council-1485641329 …
they lost their lives to advance science. Science should not be political.
Your country needs you. You have to find your courage. I know it's there Help your country...stand up for justice.
@marcorubio WE WILL ALL REMEMBER YOUR SILENCE TODAY
I still remember that day when I was teaching high school and we were watching it happen. Upsetting day.
@marcorubio time to start defending our democracy. Your grandparents fled what we now have in the White House.
@marcorubio @NASA Whete are you Marco? Why aren't you speaking out right now? You should be ashamed!
@marcorubio Speak out against the Muslim ban. You represent our diverse state. Stand up!!
@marcorubio marco you have no integrity. You confirmed Tillerson. You are a major failure. Leave office now!
@marcorubio @NASA honor them by standing up against the current administration. They did not die so science can be silenced
Stand up against @Potus's #muslimban! You're representing a state of #immigrants. Stop being spineless!
#GOPFAIL
and while we are remembering you need to focus on what your pres. Is doing to immigrants. Terrible
Prove you believe "all" lives are sacred. Stop Trump now!! Is this the America you want to leave to your kids?
TY for this tweet. It was devastating to watch. We now hold these astronauts, military and civilian, in God's Grace.
@marcorubio @NASA as a Floridian waiting for ur response to Trump's ban on Muslim countries. The hill needs to be our voice
@NASAi was in elementary school, remember watching it on tv. #tragedy...
I remember, as I do my ancestrial immigrant roots. Be vocal in your opposition of this un-American US entry ban.
@marcorubio @NASA
wow. It's been that long.
@marcorubio @NASA what are you going to get out of this you need to be on the right side of History
I respect your tribute to these astronauts but not your acquiescence to Tyrant Trump.  You need to represent democracy.
@marcorubio @NASA I'm upset w/ u for NOT speaking up and remaining FIRM with YOUR president @realDonaldTrump #PartyOverPeople
@cortneynixon82 @NASA    That was a very sad day! 
hard to believe it's that long ago yet fresh as yesterday in my mind.
@marcorubio @NASA 
@marcorubio Silence on the actions of Trump has not gone unnoticed. Stand up for our country or step down.
@marcorubio @NASA 
Ellison Onizuka: son of Japanese immigrants
Judith Resnick: daughter of Ukrainian Jewish refugees
And I know exactly where I was and what I was doing at the time. (I was a 'green' 1st yr machinest apprentice) RIP
@marcorubio @NASA As the Headmaster of a school I allowed teachers show the students live tv in class. What would they do now
I remember that day & witnessed the tragedy. It was heart breaking  May God continue 2 Bless them & their families 
will you stand FOR American values & against the repulsive actions of President Trump? History is watching
@marcorubio @NASA start honoring human beings you milk bread!!!
@marcorubio @NASA anything to distract today?
@marcorubio @NASA if you want to honor them, stand up for one of the basic ideals of our country & oppose #RefugeeBan
say SOMETHING about the Muslim ban!
@marcorubio @NASA ..
Still remember, like it was today, where I was & what I was doing when this tragedy struck.
@marcorubi boy you are trying to build up your name for another run at president. Using these heros and poor souls yesterday
Crickets about Tyrant Trump? How much of democracy must be dismantled before you put politics aside and speak up?
@marcorubio There must be no mirrors in your house today. Shame on you.
Choose morality, ethics, & being a decent human being over political party.  Otherwise we vote you out.
What will be your part in the #Fascist takeover of our beloved republic? Why are you so #Spineless?
@marcorubio @NASA You shame them by not standing up to trump. Your parents were immigrants. Why are u not against this order!
@ssniper1983 @NASA     God bless their souls and their families
@marcorubio @NASA You honor them?   They are scientists.  Remember, your party doesn't believe science.
@marcorubio today we should be honoring our ideals and values
@marcorubio @NASA Man up Rubio. Time to step up and speak out against the clown @realDonaldTrump
Honor them by making sure NASA doesn't get defunded.
I watched it on TV. Honor their legacy by honoring science. space explo needs open, peer-reviewed govt-funded science
What is your position on the immigrants being detained *right now*, @marcorubio???  Your silence today is deafening.
Senator Rubio - Where is YOUR honor? You're voting for Tillerson and you know he is a friend of Putin!
@marcorubio And what are your thoughts on the #muslimban Marco?  Can't get through to ANY of your offices - coincidence?
I remember that day like everyone I guess. I too Honor their sacrifice and admire their bravery.
@marcorubio @NASA There is a memorial in Israel to this that will bring a tear to your eyes .
@marcorubio @NASA What's sadder is Trump & his march 2 a Dictatorship, Marco, Please lead a movement 2 stop the crazy maniac
Let's honor them by insisting that scientists be allowed to inform the public. Stand up to him Marco.
@marcorubio @NASA we need to be reminded of the day and the vision. Apollo 01/26/ be well
Adds some perspective.  Mortality, achievement, courage . . .
Who remembers how this event in History made us all grieve together as One America ? Challenges-Remembering Challenger
@marcorubio @NASA They're rolling in their graves as you deny scientific truths to pander to your base.
.@SenRubioPress .@marcorubio @NASA How about honoring them by upholding American values and allowin Iraqi detainees entry? #NoBanNoWall
I remember that day! My heart goes back in time as daughter was honoring 1st teacher Christa Mcauliffe in CT ceremony.
@marcorubio @NASA thoughts on all these executive orders?
@marcorubio @NASA  But not going to talk about muslim ban? You showed how weak you are with tillerson.
@marcorubio It's also "National Chocolate Cake Day", any support there?  Ok, then how about "Thomas Crapper Day", what, no?
@marcorubio @NASA how can u honor them, when u don't honor your constituents, it's a shame I thought u better than that
.@SenRubioPress @marcorubio @NASA For those too young to remember and others too soon to forget...God bless their heroic sacrifice...
@marcorubio I remember seeing it disintegrate. It felt as shocking as watching Trump destroy our democracy.
@marcorubio @NASA Well Senator, what have you done for the people who elected you? Really, what have you done for us?
@TIMarkham @NASA 
.@SenRubioPress @marcorubio @NASA Honor them by honoring science and denounce the social media gag order issued by DJT. We're watching.
@marcorubio @NASA was home watching it live after having my baby. Such a shocking and tragic day, RIP #nasaremembers
@marcorubio @NASA My God, could you possibly find one more event happening today to "support"??  Do something meaningful.
@marcorubio @NASA Has it really been that long? Wow.

@marcorubio @NASA Agree Mr Rubio!! I will cut you some slack today. #TERMLIMTES
The day millions of young americans like myself got introduced to real life tragedy.

Cute but -I wasn't giving it!

@marcorubio @NASA No we don't. We shame them. Space missions mark the best impulses of humanity: we are showing the worst.
@marcorubio History is watching you. Waiting for you to speak out against POTUS45's UnAmerican actions...
Did you speak out when Bill and Obama deported illegals?
