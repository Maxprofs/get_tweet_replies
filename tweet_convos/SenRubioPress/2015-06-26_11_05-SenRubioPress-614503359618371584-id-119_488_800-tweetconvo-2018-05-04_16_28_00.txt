@ASAPBullwinkle @marcorubio So, you think it would be okay when they force churches (and synagogues and mosques) to perform gay weddings?
@ASAPBullwinkle @marcorubio Bull.  That's exactly where this is headed.  You know it.  I know it.
@ASAPBullwinkle @marcorubio many to close /2
@marcorubio Is it time to stop letting the SCOTUS be a shortcut to enacting the full liberal agenda? It's now the Supreme Legislature...
@dougsmith301 @marcorubio Liberal agenda:
1. Brunch with everyone
2. Clean up
3. Destroy America
@rangerbagel @marcorubio So clever and adorable. Checks & Balances were there for a reason. Maybe someday you'll have reason to miss them.
@dougsmith301 @marcorubio
@rangerbagel @marcorubio One is left to suppose you would likewise not lament a serial killer's hit, so long as it was your pesky neighbor.
@dougsmith301 @marcorubio Gay marriage is like a contract murder? Is that the analogy here?
@rangerbagel @marcorubio no, analogy is to your joy at benefitting from our loss of democratic process. Your flippant response to same.
@dougsmith301 @marcorubio tyranny of the majority is a thing. We cannot abide oppression because a few states have a misled voting body.
@marcorubio why is this an issue that should be delegated to the states?
@3k_ @marcorubio 
Not familiar with the constitution, are you? This isn't Gov't job. Technically "to the states" means "to the people".
@itsmesteph11 ...i's not government's job....to manage the criteria.....for marriage licenses....you sure you thought this one through?
@marcorubio From one Latino to another, this time I agree ;)
@marcorubio Sir you are a very decent man.
Let's not forget smart, the sexiest man alive, and oh yeah, very modest. RT @MarcoRH20Bottle: @marcorubio Sir you are a very decent man.
@marcorubio @BraveLad forget it! liberals have no dignity
@marcorubio Read Benjamin Watson's thoughtful piece on this subject. Please stay resolute in defending traditional values.
@marcorubio you let me down by not standing against that decision !!!!!!
@marcorubio @aaronrobinow This will happen, as soon as we clean out this Obama Socialist Muslim Democrats party.
@marcorubio One side fighting to steal back the rights finally granted to the other side ISN'T respecting their dignity.
@marcorubio and I'm assuming that's what you would want to do..?
@marcorubio what are you going to do about the TPP #Nofasttrack #TPP #NoFastTrack
@marcorubio Why don't you start that trend - be the change you want to see instead of telling people to fight it on a state level
.@marcorubio "The next president and all in public office must strive to protect the First Amendment rights of religious institutions..."
.@marcorubio Doesn't sound like it...
@marcorubio @aaronrobinow never happen as long as the other side is the liberal side.
@marcorubio so that is it? Forever law?  "As in the days of Noah..." You are doomed USA
@marcorubio Folks...your "dignity" is showing. Stop embarrassing yourselves.
@marcorubio Very well stated. Obviously (from responses here) there are many whack jobs who have no interest in the concept of respect.
“@marcorubio: In the years ahead, it is my hope that each side will respect the dignity of the other.”

Oy. If only. 
@marcorubio @jtLOL this hope and expectation of cordiality is why we lose.  Learn to fight.
When one view is enforced by a badge & gun, what respect is afforded the other view? None. @marcorubio
@marcorubio then ban Donald Trump from your party
@marcorubio @RyanMauro Each side? Hopefully it won't be looked at that way eventually. Thanks though for respecting the decision.
@marcorubio yeah, way to take a real stand
@marcorubio @TessaVermilyea Sorry, but I take great pleasure in people who gave money to stop LGBT rights realizing their money is wasted.
@marcorubio If you truly respect the DIGNITY of other people, you would arise for their defense against inequality and oppression. Be honest
“@marcorubio: In the years ahead, it is my hope that each side will respect the dignity of the other.” @CLDoeden #Rubio2016 
@marcorubio Nope. I have no tolerance for your intolerance of homosexuals. If you don't believe in equal rights you can move. Bye!
@marcorubio Won't happen. Activism is a career for some. Next they will go directly after churches. Folks need to take a stand.
@marcorubio they will remain divided according to the plan to make all of America dependant on the govt.
@marcorubio tu no eres de confiar eres un demagogo
@marcorubio And it's the hope of most Americans that someone like you will never be president!
@marcorubio They aren't treating us with dignity now. We are bigots and homophobes. How is that gonna change Senator? @DeborahLovesUSA
One of the most smart, respectful and mature comments made on #SCOTUS decision is made by @marcorubio. #probablynotatrueconservative
@marcorubio Democrats will never respect you unless you jump ship.
@marcorubio Where has the respect for the other side's dignity in wanting marriage equality been from you and your party?! #No2RubioIn2016
@marcorubio hope is what you have in the absence of any control whatsoever
@marcorubio @AmericanPapist was it peter sprigg when he called for the deportations of LGBTs? Or michele "pawns of the enemy" bachmann?
@marcorubio @AmericanPapist yes because the religious extremist right has respected the dignity of LGBTs, when exactly?
@marcorubio YOU MEAN < U.S.A.> AND < CUBA > ? BRAVO!
@marcorubio Amen
@marcorubio @rendcc Everyone deserves dignity and respect no matter what 
@marcorubio as usual you ate a mealy mouthed spineless bloodsucking politician NOT WORTHY of the office you hold.
@marcorubio You sound basically reasonable. Don't let the far right pull you towards hatred and ignorance & you might be president in 2016.
@marcorubio @aaronrobinow Spoken like a true immoral politician who rejects historic family structure & values.Get those gay votes brother.
@marcorubio @JoNosuchinsky The liberals can go fuck themselves.
@marcorubio if they stay out of the first and second amendments that will be np
@JeffSherm Yeah, I'm reading the opinions right now. The dissent is pretty solid.
@marcorubio SO FAR YOU'RE  NOT AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT U SAID IN PAST AGAINST OBAMA. HOPE G.O.P. & TEA LISTEN YOU( VERY <UGLY> SO FAR. )
@marcorubio  YOU MEAN EACH SIDE? < G.O.P. TEA PARTY & U'RE FRIENDS FOX NEWS > HATRE AND VICIOUS ATTACKS AGAINST OBAMA SINCE IN POWER. HELLO!
@marcorubio @josesuarezc Mute
@Melaniatwit @marcorubio el Apocalipsis
@marcorubio Dont put words in our mouths.SSM is an aberration based on abhorent behavior.We love the sinner but we cant stand the behavior.
@marcorubio the right has always respected the dignity of others, it is the intolerant left that gets angry when you disagree
@marcorubio People like you have made respect almost criminal. How you can come back with such a statement irritates me
@marcorubio @TessaVermilyea nope, your superstitions deserve no respect
@marcorubio That is not going to be good enough, Marco.  What will you do to protect religious liberty?
@marcorubio It is my hope that we get rid of "sides." "Bipartisanship" and "across the aisle" remind us daily how unjustly we are divided.
@marcorubio Wishful thinking: the fascist Left will *never* respect the dignity of social conservatives.
@marcorubio this is a Pandora box just remember my words short time ago cake flower shop u think churches won't be attacked think again
@marcorubio In the years ahead, I wish you would be run out of office. You are a liar and stand for the globalists who pay you vote yes #TPP
@endprism love how MR is always referring to New American Century
@pmoII Marco Rubio works for the globalists/heads of corporations who want the New World Order. He is bought and paid for. Clear as day 2C
@marcorubio side you pick sides if by some slim chance u r President which the hell side will you represent
@marcorubio real enemy of marriage in USA is greed & selfishness, when you disagree w/spouse, you work it out, and don't give up #LoveWins
@marcorubio all due respect, hope is not a strategy
@marcorubio by not agreeing with #SCOTUS you disregard the "other side". Then where's your dignity on this issue? #UwillNEVERbePOTUS.
.@marcorubio you first, buddy. You can start by throwing away your obvious coached party line tweets.
@marcorubio You will get that wish based on polls of young folks. T'he notion of "sides" will fade as all recognize discrimination is wrong.
@FOmyronpitts @marcorubio discrimination comes in many forms. From both sides of the isle.
@marcorubio América and the World today is a little better than yesterday with the LGTB rights.
@marcorubio @Matthops82 
In the years ahead, it is my hope that America won't wake up daily to the tyranny that you & others plan to allow.
@ROCKInTheUSSA @marcorubio @Matthops82 
Getting rid of Obama will go a long way in achieving that.
@itsmesteph11 @Matthops82
Never forget - Barry is just a meat puppet. Valerie Jarrett & others are pulling his strings.
#COSproject
.@marcorubio we on the right side of civil rights already respect your right to be a narrow minded bigot.
@marcorubio get real the lefts only mission in life is to destroy us and further there own agenda
@marcorubio problem is, the other side has NO dignity.
@marcorubio el respeto puede romperse y entre los hombres y mujeres es muy fácil. Recuerda que la lengua es el castigo del cuerpo. #LoveWins
@marcorubio like they've respected our.! Fuck that, The first chance you get Marco send that cursed ideology to the gallows
@marcorubio sorry we went over that wall long ago. starts with the parents. forget the schools. They are a cesspool of teaching hate country
@marcorubio @JoNosuchinsky Marco Rubio is DOA!! He voted for ObamaTrade
@marcorubio my hope is that conservatives crush rinos and Democrats and get evil out of our government! 
@marcorubio Amen
@marcorubio that's what we should do, respect each other's beliefs, different needs & views..time to remember we human & not only Americans!
@marcorubio let's think about how we got here; from the day #Obama was elected @GOP set its mission to see him fail. But he keeps winning!!!
@marcorubio good luck...
@marcorubio Christianity should not dictate State or Federal policy. Equal rights and protection for all is most American.
@marcorubio - try to teach that to Hannity, O'Reilly, Cruz, Santorum, and other "family values" supporter...They will not hear you, son.
@marcorubio   There is no dignity in doing what is abominal  in Gods eyes. Another reason why you are down on my list.
@marcorubio SCREW!
@marcorubio it's called people have the right to be happy and not be judged by the intolerant and ignorant today was a great decision
@marcorubio very well said sir!!! Everyone should respect the views of another.
@marcorubio How can you respect someone's dignity while denying their equal rights?? You're full of bologna, pal.
@marcorubio And...Blocked.
@marcorubio just like your doing??
@marcorubio @cmahar3 #libtards have no dignity to respect
@marcorubio Are you referring to the #ConfederateFlag wavers and the ones whining about it?
@marcorubio 
@marcorubio
@marcorubio Obama used that word "hope" once... look where that got us!
