We the people love u Vice Pence!!
Remember when we used to say "Vice Biden?"

#ThisIsABot

Mr. VP, as the head of the Presidential Transition team, can you tell Americans why you allowed Mr. Flynn onto the NSC?   We want an answer!
Looking forward to you gathering cabinet for a 25th Amendment takeover.
25Th amendment doesn't even apply, just because you don't like trump and his tweets means you are the one who has a problem
Of course it applies. Read it. If a senile President can't function properly he needs to be removed.
How bout this picture, if senile you want,
Maybe they can put both of you on a spaceship with no return!

Trump's Make the Universe Great Again program.

Oh @StationCDRKelly  look @twittermoments Scott -CPhann-Mchanamd-AL-3-NA-blindiemeyette  tweeted someone back. Asskisset
But what about the Science??
Cunt
hope you didn't embarrass us by rambling about your book of myths
Trump is a looser POTUS, needs to be fired
Be carful. They do science-y things over there.

You do realize they use science to put a spacecraft into space, don't you?
Aaack! 25th Amemdment
Making American Space Flights great again!
Excellent you can have a conversation with the mayors of Tampa, St Petersburg and Miami about the effects of sea level rise to their cities



: Make sure they start with Moon colonization BEFORE Mars colonization. I give the "Project" my thumbs up.
They've put monkeys into space maybe we could put Trump there too
yes.

 
Great! Maybe we can find a new planet because we all know you and Trump are going to destroy this planet one way or another.
Better it was under 250 co?or pixels black and white . Mr White vs. Mr black justice.

Crook.
@POTUS can't even find his car and he's never heard the term "second lady". He probably doesn't even know what you're talking about Penice.
Just because you egnor me. Doesn't make it right. 
Like 200 yrs ago. The college electorial votes.if any oneasks civil war.

Be careful Mike, you might learn some science.
Trying to get NASA to declare that the earth is flat
You could get a free ride to Mars!

Maybe you and Potus should be the first one they send to Mars.
I think we should send all libtards and their leader obama to Uranus
Libtards aren't going anywhere, but rethugs may.  Now if you interested in talking let me know, more interesting than just hurling insults

Great!  Your on the first rocket to Mars!  What time is liftoff?
Awesome
How do you relaunch a council that has been in effect. So they can say Trump did it?
Ho yeah Mike, you are a real rocket scientist.
Shove him in a capsule and light the fuse.
When I think of space council sometimes I think of Mass Effect lol
Great, but will you actually support increased funding to the NIH, NSF, and other science agencies that help space exploration? im bet no
Why don't you save the money and do a conference call since you don't know anything about NASA anyway?
Russiagate is our priority!
Hopefully NASA will launch you and Trump into the sun. #suntrash
Catholic politicians stops the space exploration
It's pretty obvious this is just a stunt, so that @realDonaldTrump can take a speech potshot at @POTUS44 for not reinstating the Council.
Will Buzz be there with some more amazing facial expressions? 
Oh please!!
Still no director of NASA so they put a creationist in charge.
You believe in Space but not Science? You two dinosaurs are the absolute worst thing that could've happened to the USA. #25thAmendmentNow
Oh, Mike, your constant mentioning of how well @POTUS is doing is just nauseating.

T - minis 5 4 3 2  1 ...... lift off of that old time Religion
Just waiting to see how you amateurs screw up NASA.
You could ask them about #climatechange. Always a good idea to talk to someone who knows things rather than rely on #ConspiracyTheories
#WOWAREYOULIARS
You and science? Oxymoron alert!
Screw you. You're the most anti science politician and this is the most anti science administration to ever be assembled. IS of toddlers
What's in Antarctica that made Obama & Kerry rush there during Presidential campaign in 2016? IT'S the peoples govt,we have a right to know
Best to stay there?

No, you can't pray a rocket into space.
Looking forward to seeing your smug, squinty, lying face being kicked out of the WH!
Veterans daughter who will die without medical. I did not Serve Honorably so my @VP @POTUS  would murder her by pushing for #TrumpCare
So you hype about the Space Council and yet you cut NASA budget by 12%. Talk about getting stabbed in the back
Trumpcare Poltroon Rubio plans to vote to raise average Floridian's premium by 69% for less covrge. Worse for elderly. Can you afford that!?
Awesome!
Instead of being Trump clown set your eyes a project you can devote your time. Woman's health benefits. Children rights. World climate
Really?  You need to first take care of the planet earth that you're destroying, Spaceman.

Keep up gud work.
Maybe you can give @realDonaldTrump a clue what "space" is. It's, you know, space.
#TurkeyHandsOffAfrin
#Save_Afrin_From_turkish_terrorism
Keep campaigning! Someone will buy that you are part of this whole mess.
You and #CzarTrump hate science. I hope they give you a math problem to keep you busy for the next 4 years.
REAL NEWS FLASH! YOU propose cutting NASA funding.
Wow another photo op and no polucies, can't govern!
Going to check on NASA child sex slaves on Mars per AJones?  WWJD???
Yep let's spend billions on space exploration while on Earth were in a cluster and we're not going to have any health care fantastic
Meanwhile, on Planet Earth, Trump-Pence cut NASA budget:

You and POTUS are such a great time. Thank you for all ur work VP Pence.
Maybe they can send you and Trump to Mars and save our planet from nuclear destruction!
@vp six months in, you and POTUS have accomplished nothing. Nice job bringing a divided congress and country together. Zero leadership.
"A new generation is taking the stage in Russia and steadily eroding Putin's regime."

Wish they'd launch you and the whole damn admin. to Mars! You could settle at that colony of kids that have been put there
"1/ Contrary to conventional American wisdom, Putin's interference in the 2016 election DID INFLUENCE the voting. " #DigitalSherlocks
Is there a spaceship big enough to launch all the Trump supporters?
: GM Mr. Vice President. We are honored by your visit today. You are always welcome here! 
Please stay there.
if one of them is gay .. Can you fix them too ..he is a puppet for Satan
We are so thrilled for your visit to see us! God Bless! Hope you get a good tour to see all the history here!

Tick tock Pence!!#ImpeachTrumpNOW. Is near! You will go with Trump when he is ousted!! #ImpeachTrumpPenceNOW#TrumpAdvocatesViolence  #resist
Be sure to ask how old the Earth and universe are. The answers may shock you.
send entire Space Council to #MarsColony! @JeffBezos @elonmusk @richardbranson @jamesncantrell @bmsprague @torybruno @TheRealBuzz @POTUS
Looking forward to your impeachment. Coming soon...
Great stuff. #maga
Mr. VP Pence we are so glad to have you. I want to meet you once in my life time sir. Rev. J Daniel
And don't forget to take @SpeakerRyan
I hear @realDonaldTrump & Pence will volunteer for first human deep(er) space travel.
Science hates you.

What sort of goofy shit does your science denying creationist ass have planned for NASA?
I thought that you didn't believe in science and evolution and also smoking was healthy
Yea, but what about the rest of us left here on earth without health insurance, bad air & water when your done?
Welcome to beautiful Florida!!!


By shutting down global warming research in NASA, NASA space programs now have almost doubled funding
Infinity & Beyond!! Buzz Lightyear not Buzz Aldren. Try to get this straight. Your puppet master missed the joke.
Is there a way that they would be a seat available (ideally 2) to send you and your colleague far from this planet?
Will you ask how old is the Universe?
Also, if we put Man on the Moon w/ science, surely it cannot calculate climate change, right?
Thx, VP!
Buzz Aldrin Looked As Baffled As We Felt During Trump’s Space Talk
DOUCHEBAG #BLOTUS!



Complicit
When you say @POTUS is to relaunch, is this something he can do from inside a space capsule with enouh fuel to get to say MARS, but not back

STOP TRAVELING N GET TO WORK AHOLES!
Will they give you seat in the next flight?
Science/drive to reach & live on Mars will deliver science to save the Earth. Focusing on only 1 priority results in a single point failure.
Your anti-science positions make you dangerously incompatible with this process.  Also, I just found out you're insane. #TheResistance
The only "anti-science" he is, is the non-belief in evolution. Every President ever has been a Christian.
A great idea -- let's send Trump to the moon.
Pushing the envelope into space will drive the innovation needed to solve many of Earth's issues. That's how it always worked historically.

hey lets start looking at deep space Exploration ? maybe mars and beyond , Long as Humans remain on EARTH we are doomed like the last ,,
hopefully they send you on a rocket to deep space.
Wish you'd visit Melbourne while there and discuss Healthcare with your constituents.
The treasonous will play while the president is away.

Funny that you like NASA but ignore / suppress their climate scientists

Your administration obliterates the Science Commission and adds a new space council based on science.  Smells like day old fish! #WeSeeYou
Do not believe China and North korea,they are all the same.
I think the two of you should take a shuttle to Mars
Send him to outer space
NASA is on my bucket list
All the while cutting NASA budget y'all just not right
VP MIA a non factor. A non partner A Fake VP with rumors of a planned coup. Americans will not accept you either.
Make sure you go look at the @NASA_Orion parachutes! 
Will he make sure there's are no scientists on the council?
Vice-president Pence you are helping make America great again!
We love you. 4 more years, after the next 3 1/2,  4 more years, After the next 3 1/2, 4 more after that too.

You are the 2nd best man alive. After POTUS, it's both a Privilege and an Honor to fight for you.

Don't you mean "privledge" and "onner"?
You are the biggest eater of the BUFFOON ever! Give it a rest!
But you hate science.
Will @SecondLady be coming along? You have such a short leash. #SheDoesn'tTrustYouWhyShouldWe?
For a second I thought you said, "launch  @POTUS into space" and I got so excited!
