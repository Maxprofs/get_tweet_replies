Little Marco .. You Seriously Need To Get A Grip On 45th Before U Try To Help Venezuela
Which ones? The same ones that are ignoring Syria?
In case you missed it @marcorubio, we have our own wanna be dictator in America that the @GOP is enabling. DO YOUR JOB! #IMPEACHTRUMP
Celebs are libtards for real and their fans. All family same gene stupid.
Thank u @marcorubio for RT of @DemiDowdy @ThinkFreeLatino article. Sad some fail to acknowledge the dangers of snuffing out human liberty.
Chavez and Maduro call this system Socialism. Penn, Glover & Jamie Foxx applaud it but have no skin in the game. Hypocrites! Thanks Senator
It would destroy their talking point that Socialism is best for us
Venezuela is not socialist.
It is the inevitable result of the concentration of power required by socailism.
Actually it's called dictatorship and there is no socialism there when you have a huge disparity of rich & poor as they do.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Dictatorship and loss of freedom are the inevitable outcomes of too much socialism.
Go back to school. Maybe travel a little as well. Your theory is a little too Fox News for me.
I hear a little elitism - my educated and so well traveled one. 
Why is it the responsibility of actors to deal With Venezuela?
because they received money from Chavez and they support the system that brought misery
Really? I never knew Angela Bassett and Kate Blanchette were involved
Thank you for sharing. Amazing how progressives don't see the pitiful life their philosophy generates. @BillSchultz30 take note
Yes Scandinavia is suffering terribly with progressive thinking isn't it? You obviously have your theories mixed up.
Over run w/ immigrants, can't defend themselves against a Girl Scout troop, but hey everything is free. Keep 10% of ur income not in USA!!!
I thought celebrities shouldn't talk about politics. Wasn't that what your constituents were screaming a few months ago? Hypocrites
It's so ironic that trump supporters don't want celebrities talking about politics, but they elected a reality TV star. @GOP HYPOCRISY

Latino celebrities haven't
Marco, don't you have anything better to do?
Thank you Senator!
Senator Rubio we Venezuelans count on your continue support to recover democracy in Venezuela.
Look, Marco.  We've got an insane crook in the WH marching up to war with No Korea. So let's worry about that first, ok? #resist
I thought celebrities were supposed to stay out of politics?
Trump will invite Maduro to party at WH then go golfing in FL for 4 or 5 days of  vacation soon! I'm sure he loves his leadership style!
Oh look Socialist Results. Take a good look, this is what US Dems represent! Failure! Marco, how's that extra Soros cash to be a Dem?
Marco Rubio, start talking about what you're doing to get our President's mandates done. Don't be a RINO. #BuildThatWall #thewall

RT RT RT ..CALL/ASAP ASK THE FOLLOWING SENATORS THESE 2 THINGS
An #IndependentInvestigation  #BurrMustRecuse-he was on team Trump 
They are too busy eyeing the atrocities and brutality of the @realDonaldTrump regime!  Keep your eyes open in DC you work for Florida!
Since when is it the responsibility of celebrities to conduct foreign diplomacy?Don't we have a state department and Congress for that? You?
When they chime in in our politics and shove socialism down our throats.
I would think that's why you would prefer they stay out of it.
But, socialism is so cool, isn't it?
Gracias @marcorubio @SenRubioPress Dios te la va a compensar

Going to support refugees from there?
if it weren't for MarcoBot's support for Trump's dog whistling hate speech - celebrities wouldn't be needed
Senator Rubio...keep up the pressure...don't stop...world needs to know what's going on in Venezuela...we must expose evil....everywhere!!
If Maduro tried to take away their birth control we'd hear from them.  #VenezuelaCrisis #FascistDems
Pay attention to this article our socialist friends this is what u want.Then the celebs act like they didn't see anything.$$These libs hve$$
You could add Michael Moore to this list.
Stop equating communist dictatorships with socialism. How dangerously manipulative can one lawmaker be?
If they even spent 1/10 the effort they spend to bash @realDonaldTrump . Trump probably wants to help, but his hands full now. Anyone?
How about a little concern about the brutality and ignorance of the Trump regime?
trump's destroying America and you're concerned about venezuela? priorities.
Hey man why not focus on the mess here st home. Your president is a crook who wants to gut healthcare and the environment. Any words?
There are always crackpot celebrities, recall Dennis Rodman going to N Korea. That Sean Penn article was a waste of 15 minutes of my life
Why are you complaining about celebrities? Venezuela deserves our concern, don't the poor and sick in the USA deserve your help? #DoYourJob
#EEUU PLEASE DO NOT MUST OIL TRADE with narco terrorist dictatorship in Venezuela, with that money they murder Venezuelans.
Help!!!!
Little Marco, such a self serving hypocrite
el ejercicio legítimo del derecho a la protesta social no puede terminar en hechos de violencia
que afecten la integridad de ningún ciudadano. El empleo de la violencia como forma de expresión
Celebrities are doing the same thing in Cuba
What are you and your government doing? Don't worry what others are not doing?
Thank you so much Marco! #MyPresident
Will the Crime ring boss, Janet Napolitano please do your job today?
While you and your colleagues are turning a blind eye to trumps antics everyone else has to pick up the slack. Little time for other causes
we have a Russian loving president who does not care about these kids why should I Rebublican party hopes they die so one less poor person
@realDonaldTrump Millions of middle class Americans out of work due to emotional focus on Foreign affairs while neglecting American's needs
Hypocrisy is all the elite left has!
Para que salga este gobierno dictador se nesecita URGENTE una INTERVENCIÓN MILITAR para que maduro salga del poder
Of course celebrities won't acknowledge this, it does nothing to further their agendas
Punish Maduro regime and get Castro leech as well.  2 for 1  Viva Venezuela Libre 
I've been warning everyone about this for the past year.
Guess who is going to exploit this as an opportunity?  The Kremlin. They are already on the ground.
You never warned me! Do not make those claims!
Venezuela will eventually become a satellite state of Russia in the americas
Celebrities are much happier with their bank account full. Don't give a dam about the children of Venezuela and the dictatorship
If you turn evidence on the globalists blackmailing you. The American people will forgive if it saves the lives of millions.
Same as you do with immigrants and black people. By the way, you promote oppression in USA.
Can you give me an example?
Another version of Obama's destructive soft revolution in the Middle East Senator .
Meanwhile you turn a blind eye to the corruption in the WH and the medical needs of your constituents!
Very good news Senator, thank you Sir. Youth unvaluable youth. If "you" can't get it done dark ages for venezuelans to come.
I haven't heard Trump say one word on this or the gay concentration camps in Russia
Where is @seanpenn
Thank you to support us! (Venezuela's real citizens)
Well Marco we're on our way here unless you GOPers start demanding investigations into our narcissistic sociopath.
What has the celebrity Trump said about them???
i thought GOP wants to put #AmericaFirst. you sound like a globalist cuck caring about other humans
But I thought it was America first? I mean that's what Donald told all the white trash that voted for him
Yes and Danny Glover too.
The only crisis is at 1600 penn ave lil marco
