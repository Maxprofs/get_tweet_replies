Wow, that was quick.  Not like there's something really important like a SC vacancy to advise and CONSENT.  Do your job.
@IrieDame @washingtonpost ok little marco
@jaketapper Marco Rubio is actually going to show up and cast a vote ????????
@washingtonpost ...flesh biology. Your unbelief does not change the fact that we are made in the image of God! Look at Jesus !!!
@washingtonpost #Zika funding. Only?proposal faces resistance in Congress, what are the chances are.
will you actually vote for once
@jaketapper @kelsey_snell just actually do something. Three proposals and my guess is none of them will be approved.
@kelsey_snell 
Praying for you today, Senator. Thanks for your tireless work on this critical public #health issue. #Zika

$0 towards this man made virus. The CDC is not to be trusted anymore just like this admin.

hmm zika is bcoming a public enemy
Instead of wasting 100's of millions of $ how about just end the idiotic ban on DDT. Kill the carriers. @Teri_A_Adams
Yes - but another example of Congress dealing with the "hot" issue while ignoring more widespread problems. @marcorubio
Bring Key Haven anti Zika experiment to Pinecrest. #Genius Genetic.Engineered mosquitoes mate w/ Zika infected = dead offspring.
@PMorris153 @kelsey_snell yeah thanks for the update Marco...is @cspan is broke? 
As always, a day late and a dollar short! Counting the days till you're out of office
@washingtonpost Enough to do the Job and not a Penny more.
Thank you for fighting for this Senator Rubio!! This is so important! #ZikaVirus

Why don't you let the market take care of it? The reason why SoAm has the problem is because they are forcing solutions.
boycott Olympics. http://harvardpublichealthreview.org/off-the-podium-why-rios-2016-olympic-games-must-not-proceed/ …
@washingtonpost I hope the proposals pass.
@jaketapper @kelsey_snell Quit spending $ we don't have! That's the problem with the Obama administration
Vote for the mid rate.
no, if there are 3 bills each with different amounts shows you don't care. Vote for the most money. Florida will need it.
Wow!!! Congress and Senate ACTUALLY doing those jobs for once! Finally working for the 6 figures
@jaketapper @kelsey_snell This needs to be funded to the max.
@jaketapper @washingtonpost We need Zika funding for Puerto Rico! #PuertoRicoCrisis #HumanitarianCrisis
@washingtonpost Thank you Senator for taking action on this serious threat. We really appreciate and need your leadership!
Call on the Federal Government selectively
Wasted money.
$$ to protect unborn lives...I don't disagree, but why are Zika-threatened lives more important than abortion-threatened lives?
Why Republicans are opposing President Obama's request for Zika funding http://wpo.st/oVBa1  Oppose it
@kelsey_snell 
Much appreciation for all you are doing to fight #Zika, which is a looming health menace. We are praying for you!
@kelsey_snell A Twitter rant the night before a vote on an issue you're passionate about draws attention. Well done.
@washingtonpost what about the Ziki Fly? That has ravaged us.
PLEASE don't poison us as Brazil did. Fund study to find environmental/man made connection to microcephaly. #ItsNotMosquitos
@washingtonpost now, how about the Senate voting on bill passed by House to harden our vulnerable electrical grid?
@washingtonpost finally
we need to do the most we can as a nation to eradicate this deadly #ZikaVirus
@washingtonpost depends on just how "pro life" you really are. I'm guessing lots of "pro lifers" will be hypocrites AGAIN.
@kelsey_snell So did you do chest or legs?
Can't believe the GOP senate is giving you a hard time on this. Keep up good work
Introduce a bill to set term limits on the senate. You would be a hero to many conservatives if you could get this passed.
The question shouldn't be "how much?", but "how well?". How well will this money be spent?
please don't destry the life on your teenage daughter or she'll keep on destroying yours by spamming on your Tweitter account!
+other stupid things, which're just private! please let her have an abortiion! i also don't wanna read her tweets again, do you?
@kelsey_snell DDT! DDT!
as a citizen, I suggest taking the $770M for rebuilding religious buildings outside the U.S. Come on!! Stop!!
@kelsey_snell finally
will you allow pregnant women infected with #Zika to have an abortion?
@washingtonpost Great job @marcorubio.
@washingtonpost r u working finally?
@PowerPost Well the House thinks like I do and knows we are out of money!!!!  #doubleentryaccountingisoneentrytoomany
@kelsey_snell Wheres all the ebola $???
offsets - maybe outside the constitution agencies
@kelsey_snell glad to see you'll actually be there
Hey Marco, thanks for driving your pick-up all over the country to prevent " the con- artist " from the nomination ! ..weasel !
well said
@kelsey_snell why don't you approve what works. DDT.

@kelsey_snell Dang Marco, I'm surprised your up so early after that late night last night.
making up for not working all these years
@kelsey_snell don't be a liberal and sign off on 50 trillion
@kelsey_snell thank you for fighting #ZikaVirus !
@kelsey_snell The more, spent wisely, the better. The time to heal a heartbreak is before it happens. Congress has that chance.
Who controls the distribution of the funds and who gets the money?
you should consider being a true Cuban
cost $5 but I know a guy, $1.59 real easy.
You should consider running for President someday.
no he must not. He is a rino
