RUBIO CAVES AFTER SAME-SEX MARRIAGE RULING: WE ‘MUST ABIDE BY THE LAW’ @marcorubio @Norsu2 http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/26/rubio-caves-after-same-sex-marriage-ruling-we-must-abide-by-the-law/ …
@marcorubio you do realize marriage is no longer a religious institution. #LoveWins  #RickyRubio2016
@ItsYams @marcorubio This is laughable. The term marriage comes from God and God alone. You speak foolishness.
@SherryLynn5876 @marcorubio then how can two atheist get married by a judge? Do you follow every law of the bible?
@ItsYams @marcorubio Only because they have to to be legally married, its still a religious institution, no matter how you spin it.
@SherryLynn5876 @marcorubio legally by a judge. You are wrong on so many levels.
@ItsYams @marcorubio And you are so wrong it isn't funny, God is everywhere in the Nation, now and forever more. Enough of your ignorance.
@SherryLynn5876 @marcorubio you're responding to my tweets. Enough of your ignorance. This is America. You can believe in God or nothing.
@marcorubio @rightwinglatina Rubio is the best choice and the only Repub candidate that can get the Hispanic vote- Trump is a NERD !
@marcorubio @vickib501 The whole point of the 1st amendment is that EVERYONE has a right to their religion, not just christians.
@marcorubio @vickib501 Or even lack of religion.
.@marcorubio If you're having trouble aligning the bigoted aspects of your faith with modern morality, it is not the role of the ...
@marcorubio All presidents have been doing this so far. Get your facts straight!! #LoveWins
@marcorubio freedom of religion is in the constitution.being against gay marriage is to YOU are a religious belief it's an equal right issue
@marcorubio Marriage Solidarity Sunday; this Sunday,1 Million Couples re-dedication of their Bible Approved Marriage! Retweet nationwide
@marcorubio @dananaby Marco how would U hope 2 do that BY not fighting 2 overturn gay marriage debacle? U SAID U WOULD NOT MOVE AGAINST THEM
@marcorubio First Amendment rights are still well in place, Rubio. Quit pandering to the fringe and move along.
.@MegGerrish I will pander until my last breathe or the poll numbers change. Whichever happens first.
@marcorubio Dear Sir: Please ensure @SenateMajLdr remembers. He seems to have forgotten people of faith also still matter. #1stamendment
@marcorubio @BraveLad and close our borders and PROSECUTE ILLEGAL ALIENS, NOT FIND THEM A PATHWAY TO OUR CITIZENSHIP. YOU FAIL RUBIO.
@marcorubio you're confusing religion with equal rights. And THAT is why 75 % of the country is for same sex marriage AKA Marriage #LoveWins
@marcorubio U r supporting that the 1st amendment should apply to religious Inst. How is it that u support it? Am very disappointed.
@marcorubio this is so hypocritical because if you adhere to the traditions of one religion (Christianity) you take away every one else's
@marcorubio And religious individuals. I love God just like my pastor does. I should have religious freedom, just like he does.
@marcorubio so you want to protect this?
@marcorubio @craeiou @MauricioDuarte5 @Gitzy729
@marcorubio if your religion forbids same-sex marriage, just don't marry anyone of your same sex! Nobody is forcing you to do otherwise!
@marcorubio You won't be that president, so don't worry about it.
@marcorubio Part of religious Freedom is realizing that people are free to choose whomever they want to marry
@marcorubio Are you resorting to the use of Religion to justify bigotry and oppression ?   SHAME ON YOU !
@marcorubio I definitely agree with @Right_All_Wrong because you sir, are false.
@marcorubio Excuse me. First Amendment rights are finally being enforced. The freedom to religion includes any religion or to refuse it.
@marcorubio We need to pass legislation to reform the SCOTUS so that legislation from the bench is a thing of the past!! Now!
@marcorubio How much longer can we tolerate our fundamental values on which our nation was founded, to be treated with such contempt?
@marcorubio the next president cannot be a Chamber of Commerce owned globalist @carlalykins
@marcorubio
@marcorubio @DennyBurk Bullshit, It's not your first amendment right to deny gay people their right of getting married.
@marcorubio Marriage is not a religious institution or is my marriage of 42 years and officiated by a judge not real?
@marcorubio don't worry, Marco, that will be a decision you will never have to make.
@marcorubio yes because that's in the constitution
@marcorubio I bet @shanley_liam doesn't care about that,he prob wants to force his beliefs on people
@jamjobrien @marcorubio who the fuck are you?
@shanley_liam @marcorubio a man who watches Naruto
@jamjobrien I don't know how that applies here but regardless you have no right to hate me for not hating people.
@shanley_liam You think I hate you,lol I don't even know you, and I dont hate the gays either, I just acknowledge states&religious rights
@jamjobrien Can I ask you what made you assume that I force my beliefs on other people if you didn't even know me?
@shanley_liam I was just wondering if you A)agree with the decision2take away states power or B)Think priest should b forced to marry gays
@jamjobrien Yes, I agree with the decision. If states are using religion to be hateful they are using religion wrong.
@marcorubio Yeah...good luck with that.
@marcorubio the SCOTUS and this president could care less. Just political bodies with no common sense
@marcorubio So much for that after today's ruling. 1st Amendment is next target of Left.
@marcorubio Mr. Rubio - will you lead the effort to pass a const amendment that guarantees religious freedom? Now is the time to do that.
@marcorubio I support gay marriage but I'm VERY concerned about the political Left set on power to itself, using gays to attack the church
@marcorubio you don't know the Constitution at all give up!!!
@marcorubio @DennyBurk Republicans have done little to protect religious & free speech freedoms in favor of votes. Why would they start now?
Hi @marcorubio, are you aware this ruling does not mandate that everyone get gay married?
The next president and all in public office must strive to protect the First Amendment rights of religious institutions...
@marcorubio @f77a9c24c7f9451 - And happily, that next president won't be you...#ForgetAboutIt.
@marcorubio I hope the next president leads the charge on a constitutional amendment that reaffirms state rights, and individual liberty.
@marcorubio Well said sir
You can't stop Twittermobs from getting people fired and declared pariahs. @marcorubio You can't help @BrendanEich or the Xtian bakers.
@marcorubio we need to follow the constitution separation of church in
Stste
@marcorubio the ? remains, will churches lose tax exemptions or will clergy give up legal authority to perform civil marriage?
@marcorubio "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."
@marcorubio Yes, all religions are equal and have equal rights.
@jacintheblog @marcorubio Are you being deliberately obtuse?
@Sierra0559 @marcorubio I've been described as acute, even equilateral, but never obtuse.  Are you saying all religions are not equal?
