@NoBama452012 @marcorubio Nah--islam is not a cult. The problem is that you only know the work of their right wing extremists.
@NoBama452012 @SophieInCT @marcorubio Seriously, wtf? Is this a satire account or just plain stupid?
@NoBama452012 @Weatt0 @MarcoRubio_2016 Pssst: it's not 2012 anymore. Obama is not running for anything. You need new material.
@marcorubio Why did you play football and not join the military if you are so tough? Have you worked anywhere? McDonalds? Burger King
@marcorubio Deprive them? You just supported the IMPORT of 100,000 to our soil!
@marcorubio Economy is important but not without Security
@marcorubio NO, We need to get out of the Middle East. Our presence is what has caused this. Thanks #GWBUSH
@marcorubio - No way will you become president. You are all about flooding this nation with illegal foreigner works for your masters.
@marcorubio @tedcruz @LindseyGrahamSC @RandPaul Come down off the stump and do the job you already have! Stop the import of JIHAD!
@marcorubio Resign.
@marcorubio MARCO NO SHOW
@marcorubio @RickCanton  What a unique concept Marco. When do the "immigrations" stop ?
@marcorubio I don't agree with your politics but I am impressed a GOP member hasn't taken unnecessary shot @ the potus.
@marcorubio Son, maybe you want to get a Facebook page.
@marcorubio What about the funding networks--the #Saudi's #Kuwait,#Quatar for 3 years funding #Taliban #ISIS weapons aimed at our troops?
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress and IMPEACH OBAMA- He's an IDIOT - he let 5 out of Gitmo and INVITING REFUGEES that Include ISIS into the USA
@marcorubio so you are describing an invasion? I smell Bush 2.0
@marcorubio @ACTwithLainy Try a UN mandate that every Muslim be deported to the Middle East, their religious origin until they are civil.
@marcorubio Paris is a example that open border don't work, gun control laws in paris didn't work either
@marcorubio u know what? we need strong leadership like @realDonaldTrump.  Not a fraud that used tax payer $$ for fancy $140 haircuts.
@marcorubio If you bankrupt America, the terrorists win! #DontBeAnIdiot
@marcorubio @RickCanton NO REFUGEES!
@marcorubio Oh, but you're all FOR their immigrating here.  You're fooling no one.
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress Why let them in
@marcorubio Who will you destroy the terrorist networks??
@marcorubio We won't make America stronger by throwing money at the problem. We need smart defense spending that doesn't bankrupt USA.
@marcorubio 
If you could show up for work u would know its done, every day, and this Prez is on it.
#delinquent #ignorant #carsonstupid
@marcorubio @tedcruz  Close the F*ing border. If you don't, you will be Obama (R), Marco!!
@marcorubio @RickCanton like funding another $40,000,000 gas station? The military has the funds, it is time to respect the budget.#RandPaul
@marcorubio as #potus what would your response to this, and the refugee incursion be?
@marcorubio @RickCanton Rubio is afraid to loose the Hispanic vote. Well he lost mine already.
@marcorubio and yet you can't be trusted on immigration. Nice rhetoric though.
@marcorubio @RickCanton go to hell rubio you want illegals poring over our boaders
@marcorubio - Your picture is terrible. Not appropriate to have a laughing politician at a sad time as this.
@marcorubio welcome @ewjacksonsr to the stage this afternoon! #DefendReligiousLiberty https://www.tedcruz.org/watch-rally/ 
@marcorubio Can understand giving ur narrative on  ISIS but do u have smear our POTUS w/your opinion on what he's doing in your narrative?
@marcorubio:YES!How would you do it?Exactly easy to say what you would do but,don't know how!Uhave a lot of peopletoconvince ie.Congress!H
@marcorubio @FoxNews Sigh, to use this tragedy to bash President Obama, my god, you really are pathetic. I don't know what's lower 
@marcorubio Lead the charge to shut down the President's plan to allow the invasion of ISSIS terrorist and calling it a humane  act.
@marcorubio really like your resolve about this issue. Keep on going
@marcorubio SHUT UP #NoShowRubio #GangOf8! U are all in for open borders!
@marcorubio We have got to stop the integration of Syrian Refugees into our country. What can we do to stop this?
@marcorubio no Marco, deport them from civilized countries.  They can bomb each other in their 3rd world cesspools instead of Paris.
@marcorubio I'm with you Marco . Marco for President!!!
@marcorubio Build the wall.  Enforce our laws.
@marcorubio How about arming the citizenry...,tht would stop this... Ugh...?/
@marcorubio you're  all talk no action...weak on illegal immigration. .we need strong leader @realDonaldTrump
@marcorubio Will you revoke the citizenship and resident status of Muslims who commit or join Terror groups?
@marcorubio Homey I gave you a few bucks, now tell me "Where's the money for this" before we have to pry the answer out. Rand on yo case!
.@marcorubio
"I’d Be Open To More Syrian Refugees If The Security Is Sound" #ParisAttacks #paris #tcot
@marcorubio Go charge your credit cards...
@marcorubio Biggest lightweight in the race!
@marcorubio Biggest puppet in the race!
@marcorubio Total lightweight and pro amnesty. Total puppet!
@marcorubio total puppet of corrupt donors!
@marcorubio total lightweight
@marcorubio in the meantime Rubio is for amnesty for people who hate this country. Total lightweight. Go Trump!
@marcorubio You are referring to Islamist terrorists who worship a false & satanic god, correct??
@marcorubio Then let them in the US for free everything, right?
@marcorubio time to unite the world..ITS WORLD WAR 3 TIME ! the world against ISIS..i think we can win ! Marco u have to lead..take the ball
@marcorubio #Rubio2016
@marcorubio our next presidente Marco Rubio
@marcorubio how about just allowing free people to not have their right to keep and bear arms infringed upon?
@marcorubio "deprive them of the space" like kicking them out of Paris/the West you mean?
@marcorubio I agree Marco. In addition, the long term plan on how to manage terrorists needs to be reevaluated.
@marcorubio I hope you will now slightly change your point of view : it's not Vladimir Putin who massacred the French in Paris !
@marcorubio You wanted to take in some refugees remember. You are clueless. We need @realDonaldTrump
@marcorubio uh don't you support brining in Syrian referees.
@marcorubio @TemiaBrinson @marcorubio if you're about letting everyone in this country then you have no business running for pres.
@marcorubio So much for ISIS being a JV team. We cannot afford a leader who will lie and just blame it on a video.
@marcorubio how terrorist view Rubio-
@marcorubio immigration matters. Don’t want to get political, but you are weak here. How does status quo re illegals benefit us here?
@marcorubio 
These gangs are supported by your best friends Mr Rubio. Trained in Turkey, paid by Saudi and Israel.
@marcorubio You can tell a lot about candidates when these things happen. You sir, are not a rational person. The answer to hate is NOT war
@marcorubio Under Obama, he has increased Muslim immigration 10 fold and you sit there talking about solutions? Only 1 buddy-NO MORE MUSLIMS
@marcorubio How about starting with a moratorium on Muslim immigration. Why would anyone welcome refugees knowing amongst them ARE ISIS
@marcorubio  the world is a much more dangerous under Obama's presidency! USA must lead
@marcorubio @eddiecarl4468 Mr Rubio, you know you WON'T. You are their PUPPET.
@marcorubio You have barely called Trump out on anything it's pathetic already to Cuban Americans that you are not engaging this Idiot.
@marcorubio Trymp is making false promises to this nation that he cannot full fill without others backing him and you shy away and talk
@marcorubio politics ? WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR POLITICS JUST BLAST THIS IDIOT FOR A WHILE CLIMB IN THE POLES MY MAN. THEN COMEBACK
@marcorubio is talking shit and you can't come after him and prove that his promises cannot be full filled with others approval ?
@marcorubio My man, step up your game and go after Trump already and show this country what a Cuban is about. Blast this guy, the guy is
@marcorubio You know Marco I don't get you man. You see that the party is not about typical politics anymore but you keep on this track ?
@marcorubio Well aren't you strategically brilliant, no one would ever think of that. Sarcasm.
@marcorubio seal the borders now!
@marcorubio you're too naive to be POTUS.
@marcorubio you were quoted by @NPR
@marcorubio JUS HRS B4 #ParisAttacks, @POTUS TELLS @GSTEPHANOPOULOS OF @THISWEEKABC THAT "ISIS IS CONTAINED"
@marcorubio Should'ave stopped tweet with 2/6  Way to politicize when all our greatest ally needs is our prayer #POLITITROLL #Prayers4Paris
@marcorubio no refugees enter this country.
@marcorubio by having an open border with no laws. Your a joke
@marcorubio #ISIS is an ideology.Hitler was a person & thus could be defeated.ISIS is faceless w/out a leader.Rushing into war=fools errand.
@marcorubio It is writen the plans of the righteous will prosper,but the plans of the wicket and the sinners will perish and God needs us.
@marcorubio That is it champ, with love, with passion with wisdom with loyalty, with everything you got. Show what you got my good man.
@marcorubio You don't really know social media works,  do you?
@marcorubio @ConservMemes We need to know if you are against bringing in refugees. Need the answer
@marcorubio @RightForRubio uh weren't you for amnesty?
@marcorubio way to soon!
@marcorubio @blackrepublican blah, blah, blah! Talk's cheap! Sponsor some legislation. DO SOMETHING! Don't just make statements.
@marcorubio @blackrepublican so you are saying you are not sure of the root cause of these attacks?
@marcorubio @blackrepublican Could you be more vague? 'Stop terror! World peace!' See, I can say that, too.
@marcorubio @JonaPilz
@marcorubio @blackrepublican Like Trumps plan better
@marcorubio @blackrepublican Marco. You wanted to give them AMNESTY not that long ago. Give it a rest.
@marcorubio We need to kill them.  It is that simple.  Kill ISIS.  All of them.  No other solution.
@marcorubio @RightForRubio Close our borders, Screen and scrutinize who comes in?
@marcorubio why don't we find their money and anybody who does business with them bank etc and take all the money from them.
@marcorubio @LyleKlich Deport all illegals, let them back in after thorough vetting.
@marcorubio Daaaa
@marcorubio Yeah! Let's keep killing the networks of families and children linked to terrorists and blow up their homes too! Good stuff.
@marcorubio Obama's ignorance: ISIS & Islam terrorists are murdering innocent people. They are NOT JV nor CONTAINED! NO SYRIAN REFUGEES HERE
@marcorubio DonaldTrump was elected President today
@marcorubio What will NATO's response be?
@marcorubio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMUgNg7aD8M …
@marcorubio what would your response be Senator Rubio?
@marcorubio full of accomplishments in speeches only, similar to your senate career asshat
@marcorubio you better get real and build a wall on our border. Weak immigration policies lead to threats and risks to peace in our nation.
@jasonrapert @marcorubio come on...a wall?!
@marcorubio This is what happens when liberals weaken a country. There is no coexistence with violent people.
@marcorubio @Youxia88 Rubio you're not going to do anything!! You want open borders and amnesty!! Noooooo to Rubio!!!! #NoRubio
@marcorubio Senator...close our boarders....protect our follow citizens....Americans in the United States!
@marcorubio thanks for the lecture....now please close our borders
@marcorubio Amen.  and need screen our borders. and all refugees coming in from syria
@marcorubio and to all the haters, this was way more sensitive than what the pitchman of the US had to say.
@marcorubio  do something,hunt them down and exterminate  - no breaks from me - no vote without dramatic action
@marcorubio thank you for the heartfelt statement.
@marcorubio the world needs an American president leading the way in the destruction of these evil bastards.
@marcorubio 2/2 blaming an entire religion is wrong. With a strong military & countries United is how we win. Not ignorance.
@marcorubio YES! Well said without scaring us, being racist and hateful. I'm a DEM but I really like you. We must destroy their space. 1/2
@marcorubio ANYTHING TO SCORE SOME POLITICAL POINTS...Pathetic!!!
@marcorubio is true, please help Colombia,,  here terrorist will have total impunity,, is a fake peace
@marcorubio thank you for speaking courageously tonight. #PrayForParis #Godhavemercy
@marcorubio Good for you! Running for POTUS means we need to hear your thoughts as things unfold.
@marcorubio we will all have to lose alot of our rights in order to destroy these maniacs!
@marcorubio This is all on the War Hungry GOP & Bush lies about WMD in Iraq starting all of this so keep your dirty GOP Mouth Shut!
@marcorubio Agree and Just Do It. The World Cannot wait any longer.
@marcorubio AND NO REFUGEES
@marcorubio AgreeBO has allowed terrorism to grow fester time comes no one wants but you do what must be done to defend US freedom worldwide
@marcorubio Perhaps it's as they always say....a holy war?
.@marcorubio Good. But "bring them to justice" is meaningless.  Savages who slaughter the innocent do not deserve justice. #ParisAttacks
.@marcorubio hey Marco its kind of hard to read those words with that avi of your face on there grinning like you just won lotto just saying
@marcorubio So...... why do you want to let them into our country so freely?????
@marcorubio you tool. One tweet expressing support for the victims of this tragedy and then 6 trying to explain your foreign policy. Stop
@marcorubio Marco, you better your position about bringing Muslims to this country.
@marcorubio Talk is cheap when you don't have to put on the uniform and carry a gun!
@marcorubio time for a leader not a community organizer.. 7 years of backwards movement
@marcorubio No more refugees....set up camps close to their homes and help them defend
@marcorubio denying them easy access to the country would be a good start, don't ya think?
@marcorubio how about closing border and stopping all Muslim immigrants till we get OUR house in order.  We are next and we are not ready
@marcorubio @VladDavidiuk Easy to say not so easy to do. Talk big from your QB chair.
@marcorubio your immigration plan, your open borders ideology will make us more vulnerable!
@marcorubio Keep the jihadists in Gitmo. We're going to need Gitmo in the future. Don't transfer jihadists to U.S. (7/7)
@marcorubio and if you're President, you must convey the same message if it happens again. Do not change your attitude once in office.
@marcorubio go Marco!
@marcorubio Couldn't have waited a day?
@npomalley @marcorubio because tomorrow nobody will remember?
@marcorubio and to stop them from coming into our country, and get those that are here out!
@marcorubio technology to defend attacks is less important than political solutions. we must include everyone in society in meaningful ways.
@marcorubio and you sir want to open our borders. I will NOT be voting for you.
@marcorubio Islam is a vile religion it must b purged
@marcorubio we know who, Marco. We need to send the fighting age migrants back to their countries to fight. Those that don't are terrorists.
@marcorubio starting to sound like Donald Trump...
@marcorubio How about banning anymore Muslims from entry to the USA and weeding out Muslims in our country. Our leaders are idiots.
@marcorubio stop already.  This isn't #ModelUN.
@marcorubio @conens46 FIRST close the US borders!! Build a fence, guard it, no refugees. Period!!
@marcorubio it will happen here! Will you rally the world to lead the fight and destroy this plague? I'm with you if you will.
@marcorubio Thank you Marco.Goes to show we should do something when enemy crosses the red line.That goes for Hollande and his loser allies
@marcorubio ugh. Go away with your political talk during this
@lillian @marcorubio Go Marco...Borders pleez  thank God for the 2nd amendment!!!  Pray for France
@marcorubio and ladies and gentlemen this is what a #President and Leader sound like TY @marcorubio
@marcorubio I can't believe you're on your stump speech trying to get attention from a massacre
@marcorubio congress needs to close the borders tomorrow and find every single one already in the country. Who did we smoke? It's here next
@marcorubio don't use these attacks to support you campaign! #TooSoon
@marcorubio What r u doing to immediately stop #SyrianRefugees ?
#WakeAUpAmerica #ParisAttacks #ThisIsIslam #tcot
