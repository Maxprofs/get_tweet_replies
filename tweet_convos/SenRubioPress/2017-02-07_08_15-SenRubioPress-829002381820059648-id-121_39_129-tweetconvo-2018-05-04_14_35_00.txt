So, @mattgaetz, what's the trick to getting a meeting with @marcorubio? We've been trying in Orlando for nearly three straight weeks!  98k?
Offer him lots of $$$. Or pretend you're an oil company.

Marco Rubio took almost $100,000 from Betsy Devos' family before confirming her today.
@pennyparker0523 @mattgaetz @marcorubio @MiamiNewTimes No conflicts there!
Yeah another set of bought & paid politicians we have to fight!
maybe you should follow Sen Nelson to guide you to introduce useful legislation!  #S338 #SaveEPA
Since everyone's hating on you two in here, I thought I'd just say you're working well for this Floridian.
These comments are disturbing. I'm a Rubio fan. Shouldn't you defend yourself Marco?  Please?
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio he doesn't give a shit about Florida, or anyone else. DeVos? Tillerson? Etc... bye bye Senator!
really? we can't reach him on the phone. Marco cares about Marco (&football) Ignoring realities of this scary admin.
Name one thing you have done that benefits ordinary Floridians over rich CEOs.
...I liked him as a candidate. Should I have not American? He waited 2 late 2 go after Trump.
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio both of you will be voted OUT!
When the peninsula sinks you and Marco can sail off into the sunset together. If there is a sunset. #DestroyEPA.
don't you dare dismantle EPA
...hmmm mayb I don't know enough about him living in Atlanta. I liked him as a candidate.
By voting FOR DeVos he showed his true colors, shame on you #nobackbonemarco
Too bad he will be fired by us as soon as possible
Saw you co-sponsored the moronic call to end the Dept of Ed. Does he also care about depriving kids of an education?
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio pendejos, the both of you!
Marco is a hypocrite & a coward. Our country is now in the hands of madmen. I weep for our future.

Marco Rubio sold out FL KIDS for $$! And why would we trust your judgement when you drink and drive? BAD POLITICIANS
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio except for education. He said fuck public education. All it cost is $100k what did he charge you?
who bought and paid for you? Birds of a feather stick together! #resist #impeach #WhereDoYouStand?
Both of you can start packing your political bags now. You are headed out of office next election. See ya!  #resist
FYI, Rubio is on DeVos' payroll.  GAETZ needs a sugar daddy for his EPA ban-Hope you don't drink Escambia water.
you both are a joke. But no one is laughing.
Hey @mattgaetz @marcorubio doesn't answer letters sent by his constituents, speaking from personal experience, hope you're gonna do better.
He won't.
I am certain your conversation about ignoring the Constitution and the will of the majority of Americans went well.
You both seem to miss the need for the EPA and regulations to help limit global warming.
Oh so Northwest FL. will benefit from the newly confirmed SecEd?
Are you talking about Mr. Go Along To Get Along Rubio?
Y R joking right? Y R talking about a man who just voted in favor of flushing the education system down the toliet
Hey guys, if you actually care about the future of FL its time to put environment ahead of $$ from dirty oil!
great butt kissing, thank you for sharing it with the world #ImpeachTrump
@SenRubioPress considering the he voted for DeVos I do not think @marcorubio cares or understands anything but $$$
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio Not the children in public schools. He just sold them out
you mr. Rubio are a sellout. Tell me do you actually sleep at night?
that literally explains EVERYTHING!  Hey Marco? What's this all about?
floridians have pledged to do everything in our power to see you both immoral degenerates out of the office.
NO he does not represent real Americans. He accepts money in exchange for votes. $100.000. 00!! SHAME ON YOU!
CORRUPT!! Serve the people you're elected to represent, not rich donors and special interests!
Gaetz supports rich donors from Miami more than he represents NW FL
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio He doesn't care about Floridians. He serves the oligarchs and corporations who bought him.
You guys are working to destroy the environment & educational system
Makes me ashamed to be a Floridian
Disgraceful!
was that before/after u found out @marcorubio soldout our education system for $92k campaign fund? I take my vote back! #Betsy
Little Marco is clueless.
Did he suck your dick for $100k. Cause he will.
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio His political career is over because of DeVos and Tillerson.
he cares about taking money from Cabinet nominees and then ignores his constituents and votes to confirm.
You both are part of the swamp Trump promised to drain.  Too bad he is just as faithless as you two. Ick.
Yeah. Lining his own pockets. What a guy.
Ummmmmm.... Today, @marcorubio proved that he does NOT care about our education! FL will remember he votes $ not the people.
So sad that I have a senator like Rubio. Money (DeVos) talks louder than caring for quality leaders in education.
omg comments here aren't good. Wow
Matt, you're not doing well right out the gate.
or should I say, right out the Gaetz!
Maybe, but you don't - considering that you are trying to destroy the #EPA.
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio  What drugs are you on?!? Rubio is nothing but another of Trump's pawns and could care less about us
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio He just doesn't care about the education of our children, the civil rights act, climate change...
Unfortunately, Sen Rubio did not vote in the best interest of our teachers and students this morning.
He clearly does not care about the future of education. Disappointed.  I thought he cared about more than Betsy's $$.
are really working for Florida education environment the people who vote
You clowns "Clearly" no nothing about your constituents in NW FL! Grow a pair and #Resist this "con artist" in DC!
Sell *
really?He voted yes for a woman that didn't know what IDEA was. A middle finger to disabled kids' needs.
#StopDeVos
No, @marcorubio doesn't care about you or the children of America because he voted to confirm #devos #Spineless #Shameful
funny he won't talk to or meet with any of us in #nassau or #duval - unless we've fattened his pockets. #corrupt
Rubio cares about lining his pockets w/$$$$ and voting for unqualified nominees. $100k from DeVos?? Disgusting.
He clearly cares about the $98K that DeVos bought his spine for.
Cuz we know neither of them have any Balls for sale! #Spineless
taking a bribe isn't helping NE Florida. You just picked the wrong partner Matt. I will not vote GOP again! Shameful!
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio All Americans should feel blessed to have statesmen of his caliber.
Obviously cares nothing about the education of american children
I look forward to voting against you in two years.
the last thing he cares is about any Floridian! We need to get him out of office!!
I'm glad he cares about something because he obviously doesn't care about education. What a sell out
HOPE YOU REALIZE WHAT A BLOW DEVOS IS TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM ! NOW WE WILL BE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY
Dismantling the EPA is only in the best interests of Corporate profits and those who pimp for them.
I would have to dispute that fact as he voted yes on DeVos. he has failed not only all of Fl, but the whole country.
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio How could you? You should be ashamed for voting for DeVos. #nodevos
Your frmr boss is a spineless jerk. Talks big but is just "little whimpy" Marco.
Too bad he doesn't care about our children. We won't forget come reelection time!
Former boss? It all makes sense now. Both party over country. #ShameOnYouBoth
enjoy the $101,000 Mr Rubio.
been told by staff opposion opnion dont matter at all and screw off by staffers
really he does understand he wont anwser phone so people of fla can express their opnion a
Maybe you two can link up and avoid showing up for work. Your first bill makes us only hope you start playing hooky.
You're both horrible people. You couldn't give a shit about FL's tourism, environment, people,healthcare. All about $
he doesn't seem to be doing much to improve Florida
Did you speak to him about your trying to repeal the EPA? Why are you trying to get rid of the EPA?
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio did you by any chance ask the Sen what he did with $98,300 he received from DEVOS?..
we have to vote both of these scums out of the government, they don't represent our interests, typical egomaniacs
since he doesn't seem to care about many of his constituents
No wonder @mattgaetz has insane policy ideas…
Just met w @marcorubio. He clearly cares about and understands the needs of Northwest Florida. It's an honor to serve w my fmr boss
no no. He cares about Marco.
Does northwest Florida NEED industrial pollutants in their drinking water? Do you two agree on that?
Destroying our main source of income and our educational system so we are stuck here forever?
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio Does hat include voting down Ames Devos as an unqualified candidate for Education Secretary???!!
But you guys probably don't read these because you're a bunch of cowards not willing to talk to those you work for
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio if  he understands the need he will vote NO on Betsy Devos
Our environment is more important than your money. Get your shit together.
like destroying the EPA? How is that bill you introduced good for anyone but big business?
Did you mention you're condoning violent threats against your constituents or nah?
i'm so glad you guys are in DC taking care of business.
