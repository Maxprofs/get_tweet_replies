.@SenRubioPress Then we need to stand up to Trump and his hate.
oh, that's right he loves all that kiss his ring.  If you oppose, he doesn't seem to say nice things.
.@SenRubioPress @marcorubio Not only that, but have you called Trump out for attacking Rep John Lewis?
He did and that's why I'm glad DJT won! LEWIS has no respect. What has he done for last 3decades.
.@jamusndit @SenRubioPress @marcorubio What are you going to do when he is impeached?  Might I add, by his own party?
He won't be. Oh, you are one of those. Moving on.
.@jamusndit @SenRubioPress @marcorubio yep!  Anti-treason! Anti-corruption! Anti-Golden Shower! Anti-Scumbag Billionaires!  Anti-Nazi!
The KKK openly celebrated Trumps victory and Trump refused to denounce David Duke
I never said I was a Dem and could never stomach http://Byrd.TODAY  the KKK praises Trump.
as u were citing Byrd history-RNC apologized to NAACP for Southern Strategy as a start,states rights strtgy,Atwater N word
Trump's Travel Ban and no NEUTRAL fact checking I can find supports argument this is parallel of Obama's orders.
You don't deserve to use those words now that you have become the lap dog of the POTUS!
Sure, you said those things on MLK Day but disrespected his widow's letter yesterday.
@SenRubioPress @marcorubio
Agreed!!  Please protect Americans from alt right leadership in white house now.
He also warned us not to become that "which we hate the most"
MLKtaught this, yet no one seems to adopt these principles. Will someone in the WH adopt integrity & equality?
@marcorubio you should be President!
@marcorubio If you believe this, we could use your voice in support of theHRO,now before JaxCityCouncil, 3rd time in 4 years!
@marcorubio / why don't you preach that to your hateful President
@marcorubio I see this tweet and hope you mean it #ImpeachTrump #resist
Ya, Marco, they said the "Hammer" would soon "come down" What u think that means? Pray for Chicago.
@marcorubio The Republican Party has just woken a sleeping giant that is going to crush them.
@marcorubio Senator pleas stand by your words. Fight POTUS and stand up for immigrants. Your family and mine are immigrants.
We will make Florida blue if you don't support the repeal of this order.

@marcorubio If you believe this why do you support the wall? #hypocrisy #NoWall
@marcorubio Then vote like it! STOP Trump racism.
GOP today resembles nothing of the first&original republican President, Lincoln-Anti-worker GOP suppressing unions for Corps
@marcorubio is that why u r supporting Trumps hate policies?
love it when Republicans try to look inclusive.  But what about Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan?
@marcorubio like Democrats have shown us for the last 8 yrs?? It's a great sentiment they're not exactly sharing.
Forgiveness on my part must be accompanied by repentance on the forgiven's part. I don't see any repentance yet
For u to bring back memory of a REAL HERO is cringe worthy.SHAME ON U senator SHAME ON U...
@marcorubio scapegoating and baiting. This tweet is so disingenuous it's frightening. You say one thing but do another.
@marcorubio
Please don't invoke the name of this great man - he stands for something
@marcorubio yes but @SenJeffSessions would move this back in years!
@marcorubio where did you learn how to be a spineless coward senator? In Israel?
Really? Trump’s White House Site Erased Civil Rights But Added Melania’s Jewelry Line.
@marcorubio Dr King would weep if he saw who got elected. He is surely in a better place. GOP sold its soul 2 Trump. Shame!
#DrMartinLutherKingwouldquestionyourhonestyandintegrity
Cuck
@marcorubio Right, as you, the GOP and the Donald destroy America and everything MLK stood for.
I dont think MLK could have ever envisioned the vitriol that #MSM spews abt our #POTUS45 & #AmericaFirst #Florida
MLK rolling in grave. You should be embarrassed/ashamed for mentioning his name in this context. #pandering
@POTUS @VP @Franklin_Graham CAN WE PLEASE ALL TRY & DO THIS!?!
If only all republicans supported inclusiveness, people of color, the LGBT community, etc. WWJD?
You did not learn from Dr. King. You supported a insecure, incompetent white supremacist for president. Stop it!
I think that this was what President Obama wanted to do with Cuba
@marcorubio congratulations for saying NO against Rex
Support John Lewis. Boycott inauguration
you teach this yet you turned on trump and went for evil
I believe Dr. King wld be first voice to encourage Donald Trump's @realDonaldTrump presidency & cabinet nominees
AND OBAMA SHOWED US HOW TO USE THAT TO TURN THE HATRED RIGHT BACK AROUND TO WHITES.  GOOD RIDDANCE
Thank you for attending John Lewis's speech in Miami.
apparently the main requirement for Republican favor is white pigment & relation to "their" country's ancestors
it's all about equality which unfortunately MANY of your fellow party members disbelieve in & disagree with
And do something about that person or thing.  This is your chance.  If you vote SOS and guy today re healthcare
You are just showing how weak you are.
I'm gonna be watching your votes.  Have the guts the MLK had.  When u see something/someone not right - stand up.
Platitudes. Do you think Dr. King would align with you politically?  Vote for you? Unlikely.
Rubio says "Let me say this BS then me and Paul Ryan can continue 2 take voting rights away from minorities"
Sorry Rubio won't forgive you 4 voting for Trump,a sexual assaulter and Putin a dictator
@marcorubio MLK was great republican hero, trump also has unique vision, Rubio U should not criticize trump as We need unity
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Was not a Republican. Tell everyone you know. We must work to put an end to this flagrant lie.
Your hatred for the health of women, families, and veterans is incomprehensible. SHAME!
@marcorubio Pls read+THINK+lead movmt against normalizing this man.URfuture at play! Stand up as MLK
please vote No for confirming Tom Price for HHS ok? from 32920
@marcorubio - thank you for sharing this, Senator
@marcorubio hoping you will learn from this and show true Christianity by keeping the ACA intact
@marcorubio toremove sanctions,probably the 2011 sanctions which kept the 500 billion dollar EXXON Mobil deal from going thro
@marcorubio  Vote NO on Tillerson. Can't call Putin the murderer he is. Received award of friendship from Putin. Trump want
Stand up against hate anywere you find it - Do not be afraid to resist it - Unite us Marco.

@marcorubio 
These stats of your country we do not need you
http://ln.is/www.cdc.gov/wCmrO …… https://twitter.com/i/web/status/821646616096624640 …
@marcorubio that message has been forgotten by the democrats and liberals .
Rly, you're going to quote MLK? Your actions speak louder, such as how you behaved under a black president's terms in office
@marcorubio then why are you so dead set to undo so may good things and cause grief, death, emotional duress, #SaveACA
Do the right thing Rubio. Humanity should rise above money. Be the change.
@marcorubio Wake up. Defending sell out @repjohnlewis over @realDonaldTrump? Uncool lil Marco. Never go against the family!
Not so fast! Stand up against Trump!
@marcorubio Demonstrate you are a leader of all people. Block Trump's nominees. Next POTUS could be you if you stand up now.
@marcorubio Show Americans you value equality. Don't support Trump's nominees. Do what's right. You could be next POTUS.
@marcorubio I would like to know more about your history . impressed with the fact that you still seem to be your own person.
@marcorubio Thank you for reminding us all what Dr Martin Luther King wanted for all of us!
@marcorubio you really need to get your priorities straight. We the people have no kings and your job is to serve or get out.
@marcorubio How dare you say Mr Lewis earned a pass on anything he says. In America not even a president is above reproach.
Honor your words above.  Vote no on Senator Sessions nomination.

@marcorubio Dr. King was a great man. John Lewis is a racist disgruntled nasty man who attacked President Donald J Trump.
@marcorubio then follow his example and support our new president and the people instead of uourself
Perhaps you should use this thought when you think of Trump and Tillerman. We need your vote, Marco.
@marcorubio could you get your nose any further up John Lewis s ass?
True American hero. Not promoting hatred and division like PEOTUS.
@marcorubio existing today https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=dB1Xl5OGiJM …
@marcorubio Yes! Continue to be your own man in spite of Trump's disrespect of Rep. John Lewis #CivilRightsLeader
#TRUMP is like NIXON. He'll be gone in a year. @SenRubioPress must vote NO for Tillerson to become the #GOP Leader to be Next President.
@marcorubio keep standing for what is right, not just right wing agenda and if u run for pres you'll have Nevada.
Please stand up 2 Trump. He is causing instability in American politics & internationally. Power will make him worse. #NPD
Dr. King tried to teach us all that message however people like John Lewis failed to learn that lesson.
You're the only republican I find inspiring. #bravo #thankyou
which means he loves you because you are a fraud, libs love any GOP that jumps ship...
@marcorubio Many people are rooting for you to be moral & measured these next 4 years in spite of Trump's example/leadership.
@marcorubio Don't be a dork about Lewis. He is way out of line. Ur establishment roots are showing.
Con q cara crítica a Obama por quitar la ley pies secos si usted quería hacer peor quitando la de ajuste cubano, q ipocresia.
.  You're pitiful.

Then follow Dr KIng's teachings & get over your hatred for Trump & instead help him succeed.
John Lewis has transformed into a political hack of the Democrat party.  Sorrowful wasted legacy but power is the game.
@marcorubio So now he see the light and he going to give the Cuban a chance to get help in Cuba
@marcorubio stop Trump from being inaugurated.
@marcorubio we have a traitor in presidency who wants to add an accessory to the crime-tillerson, no! @marcorubio
@marcorubio please reject tillerson.
Thank you Senator Rubio for sharing the message from one of my fav. Heroes. Happy MLK Day to ALL!
Never vote for you again traitor
@marcorubio Marco please stop defending left wing congressman Lewis. Please!
@marcorubio Please stop telling Trump what he can and cannot do. He's doing it. Americans are behind him.
so true.....
Even the kind conservatives receive from Democrats and RINOs? 

.@SenRubioPress @Tazmanian5
I was a big supporter of yours but lately you have disappointed me with your actions and recent comments.
@marcorubioreitbart just wrote an article about you...
@marcorubio Lewis is behaving like a child Sitting on the floor like a child is not being a leader IF HE SUCH A LEADER SHOWIT
@marcorubio So what's your point little marco Blasting the new administration is that love GET OVER TRUMP WON U LOST PPLVOTED
@marcorubio stop playingyouwanttobewithbothHewas disrespectfultoourpresandthepeoplewhomadethispossiblegetoverit@repjohnlewis
@marcorubio
Joh Lewis insulted Trump and is owed an apology , not an insult from you.
@marcorubio we could, but it requires a catalyst. not just idealistic rhetoric. I voted for you Rubio. but i'm wondering why
@marcorubio I wish it were true. Won't happen until Trump changes his methods.
@marcorubio Does that mean you will be the spearhead for Trump in the Senate?
@marcorubio it's not enough to say the words. Actions speak louder.
@marcorubio Yes but we have to stand together and support one another opposite of how you treated Donald Trump...
@SenJohnMcCain Think about whether you want to approve of this fascist traitor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjo4u88no7U&sns=tw … via @youtube
He is fine with Aleppo. He supports Syria and Russia. Going to the inauguration is accepting this.
@marcorubio Thank you Senator Rubio, He was a great man 
yep he uses trump to get re elected he knows Lewis would have called him illegitimate too if he had won
@marcorubio thank you for standing against Tillerson!
@marcorubio please stop gutting ACA and show that you also care about people and have some personal courage!!!
Is there any truth to these allegations? (not that there's anything wrong with it)
@marcorubio thank you Sen Rubio.   Don't stop standing for beliefs over politics!
@marcorubio if only everyone had been listening!
@marcorubio  Don't blame Trump... he did nothing wrong!
@marcorubio John Lewis owes an apology to President Trump! He started this mess! Last I saw, John Lewis doesn't walk on water
And Senator Rubio taught us that even some of the most painful political embarassments don't lead to forgiveness.
@marcorubio Start showing some support to your party before the people find you irrelevant.
MLK would welcome the Trump Admin's reaching out to really help the black community.
@marcorubio You were my choice for president. Time to set aside bad feelings & support our new president. Disappointed so far
@marcorubio NO vote for Tillerson. Stop Putin. Ask ur Cuban community about Russia. U will have to explain ur pick for life
@marcorubio Yet your party still supports the likes of Sessions. What's up with that?
@marcorubio Hypocrite.  Impose on yourself and your family  the same health insurance you impose on Americans.
@marcorubio Senator, many of us loved you! Don't turn your back bashing the new Administration! Work with us, not against us!
You comment on situation w/Lewis & Trump, yet do nothing to help. Get behind your POTUS & show more love for your country, make a difference
@marcorubio Dr. King was nothing like these thugs that are leading insurrection they are disgraceful to our divided country
a boy tortured for HOURS in Chicago for being white. This is Obama's true Legacy. One of HATE.
@marcorubio I did not vote for you in November. We know the real you. Secrets. Hope you fail. #traitor. #gangofeight
become a real problem and when whites try to cry out about it they are called racists and bigots. The latest was
@marcorubio Where's the peace and love from the Democrats for our PEOTUS? SHAMEFUL!!
Lewis is trampling on what MLK stood for.  You gave him a free pass for being a sore loser.
Exactly! "Spot on" Pat. Shame on Rubio and all of the Dems not attending @repjohnlewis Despicable!
was done to them by people long dead. In Obama's years of Racist hate mongering black on white crime has
Sadly because of Obama many blacks today do exactly the opposite & now do to innocent whites what long ago was
@marcorubio John Lewis is out of line. Get u r shit together
@marcorubio we the ppl will NEVER VOTE FOR YOU AGAIN. #traitor to the ppl. Fight against Rubio
@marcorubio My gratitude goes to you Sen. Marco Rubio, for having a backbone of steel, and not caving on your ethics & morals
Rubio if Tillerson gets in a free country will be over & Flynn is just a Russian con man 2 keep Trump in line
It was a hard-fought primary,but Cruz is now working alongside Trump. Don't foolishly side with our hateful enemies
@marcorubio 
Shut up, Marco. You have no career outside FL.
Yes Sen. Rubio - but the left, who want complee control of our lives-hears MLK, but does not listen or understand
@marcorubio So don't say you are for the people and do something different. He gave his life and his fa5 is still proud of it
@marcorubio you have a chance to rise to greatness. Hold Trump accountable. Be strong, do whats right for the ppl. Please
@marcorubio Dr. King knew that harm was coming to him. He just didn't know when and how it would come.
@marcorubio As Dr. King always said a man is judge by what he do for others even if it cause deaf to him.
@marcorubio yes, and he also taught us to never back down no matter how powerful the forces
@marcorubio And thank you for your kind words about Dr. King. Do like he did preach the word and follow up with action.
I guess Lewis wasn't listening on that day
@marcorubio This is why we are calling on you to be the man you are and vote no to Rex Tillerson confirmation hearing. Thanks
@marcorubio so you want us to forgive and love u 4 voting to repeal ACA and deny coverage to millions?
@marcorubio Beautiful! When is the #GOP going to show us they learned these lessons by stopping known bigot @SenatorSessions
@marcorubio Please show Rex a little love with your support!
@marcorubio he would not have liked you
@marcorubio LIBERALS must read
