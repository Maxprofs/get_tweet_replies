@marcorubio Also, since you care so much about unborn fetuses, are you going to pass legislation to provide for the unborn fetuses?
@aitorlorda85 @marcorubio So according to your logic we should kill anything that there is no government funding for.  Are you on Gov Assist
@mendskyz @marcorubio no, my logic is that pro-lifers only care for the fetus before birth. I'm not on gov't assistance.
@aitorlorda85 @mendskyz @marcorubio see that's the problem, there's no justification for killing unwanted babies.  Ever.
@aitorlorda85 @TheBaldRetard @marcorubio Out of ~3,700 per day, 150 are possible considerations.  Don't know how many rapes are actual rapes
@mendskyz @aitorlorda85 @marcorubio maybe it's just me but i'll never understand the left's rationale for this.
@TheBaldRetard @mendskyz @marcorubio The rationale is simple: we are for women's rights. We are pro-choice & pro-life.
@marcorubio I mean, you guys are all about the children, right? Since you want to force women to give birth, who will care for them?
@aitorlorda85 @marcorubio planned parenthood should be about preventing unwanted pregnancies, not aborting babies.
@FlanaganSiobhan @destiny_113 @contrarian11 @marcorubio but they don't sell baby parts.
@aitorlorda85 @FlanaganSiobhan @contrarian11 @marcorubio well, social media says otherwise. :-)
@destiny_113 @FlanaganSiobhan @contrarian11 @marcorubio and that those anti-choice groups are known for heavily editing videos
@FlanaganSiobhan @destiny_113 @contrarian11 @marcorubio http://www.factcheck.org/2015/07/unspinning-the-planned-parenthood-video/ … Read this please
@marcorubio A dentist paid $55,000 to hunt an animal down for sport. Trust me, that is more cruel.
@marcorubio I am not outraged about aborted fetuses because women have the choice to have abortions for specific health reasons.
@marcorubio @stableford Anyone who excuses PP's baby butchering & resale, yet loses their shit over ONE LION, is a soulless inhuman D-bag.
@rlaurich @marcorubio @stablefordh  Oh, is such verbal abuse coming from a loving christian?
@ladyhypnotist21 @marcorubio @StablefordH (1/2) 'You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires.'
@ladyhypnotist21 @marcorubio @StablefordH (2/2) -Jesus (John 8:44) Is that verbally abusive? Mean words bad, Butchering babies good. Got it!
@rlaurich @ladyhypnotist21 @marcorubio @StablefordH oh he is one of them religious extremists, that explains all his foolish comments
.@Vegan4Animal @ladyhypnotist21 @marcorubio @StablefordH What's it like knowing you can't out debate a "religious extremist" you moron? Lol
@rlaurich @Vegan4Animal @ladyhypnotist21 @marcorubio @StablefordH Dear Religious Extremist. Where does god say it's ok to call people morons
@Patrick_M_Egan @Vegan4Animal @ladyhypnotist21 @marcorubio @StablefordH Another one with the "religious extremist"! You people are adorable!
@marcorubio you do realize walking into a planned parenthood office is done on your own accord, right?
.@marcorubio The story about Planned Parenthood is false. The lion story is true. That's why. Duh. #StandwithPP
@le_blah @marcorubio  it is on video you idiot! It isn't false.
.@justin1206 @marcorubio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwSvVmMATvA … so is this #StandwithPP
@le_blah @marcorubio you are in the minority fool
.@justin1206 @marcorubio Here on earth we call my position, "The Majority" #StandwithPP
@marcorubio you're a selfish, pandering ass clown who will NEVER be @POTUS
@marcorubio
@marcorubio You're an embarrassment to Florida. AND THAT IS HARD TO DO.
@harrisonmarkey
Appalled > @marcorubio <- Should be ashamed for encouraging - #PPShooting
@RoseFromPhila @marcorubio Yes he shld! Bt will he b? Nope!
@marcorubio you really need better advisors. And social media person. Oh, and integrity.
@marcorubio Planned Parenthood also saves lives. But... Who cares about facts?
@marcorubio you'll never ever be president lol
@marcorubio You sir, are no lion.
@jonahkeri @marcorubio side with the baby choppers Jonah. Good for you.
@MikeEllisCope thanks buddy
@jonahkeri you betcha :)
.@TANSTAAFL23 Or, in other words, ONCE AGAIN proving Fox Noise lies. .@quikjl .@MikeEllisCope .@jonahkeri
@chuckykype @jonahkeri @quikjl @tanstaafl23 not even @ppact is selling that edited bullshit any longer you ghoul.
.@marcorubio If u will buy this line of tripe, you will buy anything
@marcorubio The Left would argue that abortion is a legitimate "choice," but I maintain the hunter was exercising HIS choice, as well. 
@MEschRadtke @marcorubio what he did was against the law. Abortion is against your moral code/religion, which not everyone shares.
@The_Low_End @MEschRadtke @marcorubio Marco is referring to PP selling baby parts not abortion as a whole.If you think that's moral then idk
@ChrisCamps76 @MEschRadtke @marcorubio it's not my fault you don't know how to read a twitter thread. It's really not that hard.
@ChrisCamps76 @MEschRadtke @marcorubio but I thought it wasn't about abortion.
@The_Low_End @MEschRadtke @marcorubio The arguments on this thread are about abortions. Marcos tweet is about #PPSellsBabyParts.
@ChrisCamps76 @MEschRadtke @marcorubio OK...and my original was a response to another person, not Rubio...
@marcorubio <<<<SHAMEFUL FOR YOUR TWEET!!  It helped infer fury in #PPShooter
@marcorubio Planned Parenthood is not the same as killing endangered animals for sport. Chulo.
@marcorubio When Rubio is president Americas can smile wider!
@marcorubio please call me when PP is luring babies out of the womb to shoot them with fancy bow and arrows
@marcorubio you are basically one of the old lame people in Dirty Dancing
.@treeverb Old lame person in Dirty Dancing paid for an abortion. Your argument is invalid.
@redsteeze @treeverb I just love these parody accounts of lame hipsters. Wait, what?
@marcorubio @MzDivah67 Marco Rubio,Planed Parenthood much more than what you portray!  Stop rambling, speak the truth. Let God Judge not you
@marcorubio You're good but can do better and together with Trump,you both can "Make America Great Again"
@marcorubio I'm an immigrant myself since 1970 and been a political observer and I can tell when a person such yourself ,have good quality.
@marcorubio Hi. Is this going to be one of your policy positions?
@marcorubio Trying to stay in the top ten, are we?  Conservative animal-lovers resent rich guys hanging endangered species to their walls.
@marcorubio seriously? you compare the two? U were wrong about PP just admit it. Cecil was loved by the Country
@marcorubio Planned parenthood is a death monster machine. Rubio will take that monster on too:)
@marcorubio "where is all the outrage over the planned parenthood dead babies." 

Happy now?
@marcorubio Rubio loses in another Drudge post-debate poll
@marcorubio So please have it in your heart and help "Make America Great Again" and show voters that you can be humble.
@marcorubio Make love to me Marco
@marcorubio CHICKENS + EGG most ABUSED ANIMALS on EARTH=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdx-EqEbjHg … (Most Eat 20 birds/yr, BILLIONS, 1000's tortured by U Marc)
@marcorubio You just need more well verse experience but you are young and be the next president after Trump /Rubio administration.
@marcorubio @BAKKOOONN Marco  you are a tool of the elite.
.@marcorubio Senator, you are absolutely 100% right. It's moral insanity.
@Nikk1066 @marcorubio Says the person who also fell for the right-wing Benghazi bullshit machine...
@SodasCat @Nikk1066 @marcorubio Apparently you think confused reports in the fog of war is a giant conspiracy that would have no purpose.
@SodasCat @Nikk1066 @marcorubio I've been wondering that about Bush/Cheney's 20 MILLION deleted emails too...
@SodasCat @Nikk1066 @marcorubio What even is the "scandal" in Benghazi? Not the tragedy of the dead, but what is the supposed conspiracy?
@marcorubio Please forgive and forget about the dirty exchanges during the debates and call Mr. Trump and be a partner Trump- Rubio.
@marcorubio @BAKKOOONN lol
@marcorubio --
You are no doctor like Carson or Paul, but even a school child knows the wording is "fetus" unless there has been a birth.
And where is the outrage over the dead Iraqi babies, murdered by the US for no reason?
@marcorubio I wish the morons who keep referring to thumbnail-sized blobs of brainless tissue would stop calling them "babies".
@marcorubio bump
@marcorubio stop doing lines of coke marco.i would like ur kids to drink flint water ur a disgrace u Cuban pos.ur out if work 1/17.bye bye
remember: “@marcorubio: Look at all this outrage over a dead lion, but where is all the outrage over the planned parenthood dead babies.”
@marcorubio I realize you are not pro-choice, but when you tell a woman she has no power over her own body-- how do you then defend guns?
@marcorubio @RearAdBsBlog all I know is you and Cecil the lion have the same chance of becoming President.
@marcorubio @mattdpearce You dumb fucking stupid asshole.
@cfahooligan @marcorubio @mattdpearce Another tolerant liberal!
@asrbear_patriot @marcorubio @mattdpearce Damn right I am intolerant of stupid. And I am pregnant so funk off!
@cfahooligan @marcorubio @mattdpearce
@marcorubio can you be Pro-life but Murder Animals as u and most Republicans? = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLt32KZdlZs …  (HYPOCRITES) trashing other causes
.@marcorubio delete your account
@oldmanweldon @marcorubio d-bag trying to boost his cause AGAIN at the expense other causes, ALL the 10000's of Poached-Endangered Animals!
.@marcorubio If you're suggesting Planned Parenthood kills babies, I'm suggesting you didn't pay attention during biology classes.
@marcorubio Embryos and previable fetuses aren't ”babies.”  Shouldn't a Senator know some basic biology?
@marcorubio sad what an opportunist u r anything game for ur political platform, thought u were better than that just lost my vote RIP Cecil
@marcorubio Now, DO NOT bow to pressure and apologize. 
Cecil would not apologize for killing one of us.
@marcorubio pitiful comparison.  planned parenthood is refuge to beleaguered women.saw Cecil/Wild Africa. murdered noble  animal 4 photo op.
@marcorubio you idiot!!
@marcorubio Where can I express my outrage over your poor grammar?  #GOPFail #LearnEnglish
@marcorubio   ⚁             
@marcorubio for people like you,  the wildlife is dissappearing, there're enough humans to bring more to suffer in this shit world
@marcorubio you mean from that fake video?
@marcorubio I will never vote for someone who is against a woman's right to choose what is right for her. #noneofyourbusiness @PPact
@marcorubio where's your outrage over the millions of children living under the poverty line in this great country?
@marcorubio also, it's not a contest to see who should be more angry over the other. That's fucked up.
@marcorubio no dead babies.. you idiot.  Women exercisin their right to control their bodies. Apples and the Constitution & SCOTUS. NOT SAME
@marcorubio Since when are you only allowed to be outraged by one thing?
@marcorubio 97% of Planned Parenthood's services have nothing to do with abortion.
@marcorubio I'm outraged brain dead politicians keep using our valuable oxygen.
@marcorubio EDUCATE YOURSELF.
@marcorubio Lo felicito. Así se habla. Esta es la verdad. No les importan los bebes, pero un León causa indignación!!! Que mundo loco!!!
@marcorubio If you got elected the whole world would laugh, you are a joke!
@marcorubio you care about babies...until they're born.
@marcorubio So what’s your opinion about Cecil? No big deal?
@marcorubio oh true babies are going extinct good point. I'm glad as a child birthing man you have an opinion on this topic!!
@marcorubio
@marcorubio where is the outrage over min wage workers who can't buy health ins or save for retirement?
@marcorubio do you ever think before you tweet? Typical, take lies, and run with it remember lying is part of the ten commandments as well
@marcorubio asshole
@marcorubio stfu!
@marcorubio and murdered black men and women?
@marcorubio You're an idiot.
@marcorubio @rushlimbaugh WHERES ALL THE RAGE FROM THE LEFT? Aborted babies don't have rights? The mother certainly wasn't given rights.....
@marcorubio You need a question mark at the end of this sentence. Your grammar is à propos for your disingenuous tweet.
@marcorubio just shut up... everyone knows that the planned parenthood video was taken out of context but you can't admit it so just grow up
@marcorubio where's the outrage over people shooting other people?
@marcorubio ... that's because most of the public can discern the difference between reality and made up bullshit.
@marcorubio please tell me this a joke... I so badly want it to be one.
@marcorubio #Reply:  In my opinion, we would need a leader who makes a more sensible analogy than this, which is a bit on the bizarre side.
@marcorubio 
The difference Mr. Rubio is that, the lions of Africa are an endangered species. Humans, are not endangered.
@marcorubio @hannjibo Why can't we be pissed at both?
@marcorubio shut up you thin haired piece of shit. It's funny you actually think you'd have a chance at presidency. #toobaduwerentaborted
@Paris5503 @marcorubio Paris I love you more. That hashtag tho hahaha :*
@marcorubio http://mediamattersforamerica.tumblr.com/post/125199635368/this-is-just-the-latest-conservative-attack-on-an … marco the tape is heavily edited
@marcorubio you're an embarrassment
@marcorubio your party claimed all the outrage, there none left for us.
@marcorubio Perhaps the public knows it was donations and storage fees,Nothing more. Therefore the lion is more important. Have some water
“@marcorubio: Look at all this outrage over a dead lion, but where is all the outrage over the planned parenthood dead babies.” ..........ok
@RealDwneastDiva @marcorubio @GarySpagnuolo Oh, if only #DickCheney couldn't get a new, young #heart! Which many #GOP in #Congress need!
@RealDwneastDiva @denisemourges
“@marcorubio: All this outrage over a dead lion but where is all the outrage over the planned parenthood dead babies”
@marcorubio And when humans are on the verge of extinction due to poaching THEN you MIGHT have a point.
@marcorubio That's ridiculous! PP doesn't kill the born Republicans do with war!
@marcorubio Senator, you have regained a large amount of respect from me that had been lost. Thank you for exposing the obvious.
@marcorubio You care about babies in the womb but once they are born you can give two shits less. Take a seat and GTFOH!
@marcorubio Yes, because there are only 20,000 humans left on the planet. Nice troll attempt though.
@marcorubio GO TO HELL RUBIO....
@marcorubio Without Planned Parenthood's women's health programs, how many women would be dead?  Would you mourn them?
@marcorubio No staff to research "right outraged over planned parenthood" for you? #googlethatchet  Over 9 million results. Just sayin...
@marcorubio The majority of Americans and Independent Voters are outraged by both! God is the creator of Life & All creatures great & small!
@marcorubio lol no vote for u
@marcorubio HAHAHAHHAHHAHAHA
@marcorubio Planned Parenthood is Not Selling Baby Parts, You Fucking Idiots http://fb.me/3SB0TltmY 
@marcorubio Human babies aren't an endangered species or on the verge of extinction.  Learn how to use analogies properly.
@marcorubio & another thing - if peanut oil comes from peanuts&olive oil comes from olives WHERE DOES BABY OIL COME FROM?
@marcorubio BRAVO!!!
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress Rev: 18:11 and God said, "I will destroy those ruining my Earth" This is why Christians are OUTRAGED.
@marcorubio @tjemery1 There IS outrage over PP! We have fought for years to have you - the lawmakers - change the law!
@marcorubio How many unplanned babies have you adopted?
@marcorubio Eres en #PENDEJO!!! 
@marcorubio but you have no problem killing Iraqi, Syrian or Iranian babies
@marcorubio #cecilthelion was more than just a dead lion & for you to make such a crass comment again shows how soulless the GOP has become.
@marcorubio Be outraged by both! Don't alienate those who are mad about the lion. Dont compare the two. Tweet outrage over both.
@marcorubio Don't conflate the two issues, keep them separate Vice Presidential candidate Rubio.
@TheRealTD1 @marcorubio ^^
@marcorubio #icanteven
@marcorubio Praying for you! Cheering for you! Best day is ahead! #MoveForwardandUpward
@marcorubio So divisive. There's a better way to broach that sensitive issue without immediately alienating a majority of would-be voters.
@marcorubio @LVNancy Lions don't donate to the DNC. PP does, thus the media gives them cover with distraction. #PPSellsBabyParts
@marcorubio stand strong, my friend.
@marcorubio Do u believe in the slogan 'Black Lives Matter?' Would u say that publicly?
@marcorubio I've heard of clinic bombing, murder, the unauthorized release of people's personal data, public shaming...that outrage?
@marcorubio and under developed babies in wombs have absolutely none of that. Besides a bunch of people already whine about abortions
@marcorubio you are continually showing your behind.
“@marcorubio: Look at all this outrage over a dead lion, but where is all the outrage over the planned parenthood dead babies.” Oh dear…
@marcorubio Where is all the outrage over the fact that your dumbass has a voice
@marcorubio because ppl care about animals more than they care about people
“@marcorubio: Look at all this outrage over a dead lion, but where is all the outrage over the planned parenthood dead babies.” 
@marcorubio - Your dad should have pulled out.....
@marcorubio can I poop in your mouth?
@marcorubio @NewSonsLiberty That's what I said
@marcorubio both are completely barbaric, but, unbelievably, only the lion's killing was illegal.
@marcorubio crawl back under your stone. you make Bush sound intelligent.
@marcorubio Great job Marco. Tu estas nuestro presidente.
@marcorubio *shut the fuck up
@marcorubio the lion was real thing, but unborn babies are just that - non-existent ideas. If we multiply like rabbits, we *are* animals.
Look at all the outrage of u being POTUS @marcorubio  oh wait, there is none bcs it will never happen
.@marcorubio Ladies and gentlemen, Marco "is this my ass or a hole in the ground" Rubio
@marcorubio The mind is capable of being outraged at many things at the same time. I am outraged that Trump is humiliating you, for example
@marcorubio you should not be allowed to speak
@marcorubio Thank you for pointing out what is not heard in the news. The hypocrisy of those not outraged is so sad.
@marcorubio people who care about animals care the most about humans too. They are more sensitive to any cruelty! Don't go against them!
@marcorubio fetuses aren't alive, lions are...
@marcorubio Are U brain dead? Did your kids have polio and measles vaccines? If so, they benefited from fetal tissue research—and so did U
@marcorubio The dummies DON'T CARE. 40 years of exterminating pre-born kids and @PPact @NARAL @DNCWomen  propaganda. What do U xpect?
@marcorubio  this guy is running for president . Okay .
@marcorubio where is the outrage about the Iran Nuclear Deal?
@marcorubio 
Yeah! Let's get back to focusing on revoking women's rights, since our tiny female brains can't decide for ourselves. Ass
@marcorubio kill endangered animals. Advance human overpopulation. Right
@marcorubio Felt like an idiot, smelled like an idiot, sounded like an idiot and sure enough you proved that's what you are.  1 in 5 use PPH
@marcorubio its seems blacks have to start wearing animal costumes so they can be treated as humans when cops kills them #Cecil The Lion
@marcorubio so you're saying #CecilTheLion had an abortion?
@marcorubio you know what's awesome? Not voting for you? Get some facts straight or lose some votes. Just putting that out there...
@marcorubio You are as sharp as a bag of hair.
@marcorubio What about fetuses thrown away after IVF procedures?
1.7 million embryos created 4 IVF have been discarded. Do U care about them
@marcorubio On behalf of all intelligent life on Earth, shut up Rubio.
@marcorubio stfu..
@marcorubio so awesome!
@marcorubio Any chance you just had was flushed down Trumps toilet. See you in hell Marco :^)
@marcorubio keep lying you freak
@marcorubio @gailtalk Both are out there. But the MSM not reporting on the crimes of Planned Parenthood
