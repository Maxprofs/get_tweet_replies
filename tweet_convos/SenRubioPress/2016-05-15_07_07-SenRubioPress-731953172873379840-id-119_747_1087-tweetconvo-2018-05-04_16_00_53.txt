Thank you Marco! Always fighting for Human Rights and never forgetting Venezuelan people struggle.
Human rights?? He is for the NC bathroom bill and wants to deny even rape victims to have an abortion!
nobody is stopping people from going to the bathroom....so I don't get how that has to do with Human Rights? More w/ protecting kids
do you really want transgender women (even fully operated ones without a penis) to use the men's bathroom?
The signs of that country's demise were everywhere for years. Criticism of @NicolasMaduro now is hollow.
@thoughtflblonde Well, no. That was Chavez' & his regime's work. Maduro just drove an apocalyptic Venezuela into total oblivion.
yeah, I'm sure @marcorubio knows that. Just doesn't translate well into Twitter's few characters.
yet you will be voting for an incompetent corrupt Trump thats hypocritical #NeverTrump #TrumpThePedophile
loser
you should talk !?!
that sounds just like a Trump tweet! Effective huh?
@cbricenoi @NicolasMaduro No se equivoque el destructor de la democracia en Venezuela fué el Presidente Chavez, dejó la inercia.
It's good of you to keep your eyes on international matters. Right now keep your head down and focus on the goal
What reason is this for resigning?
IDIOT COMMENT
Thank you for not allowing these things to be swept under the rug.
RESIGN? Obama never did.  They don't CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE. Thanks Marco, for caring!
@Alextheproducer @NicolasMaduro Go To Work  Build supervisabill propaWork  fer deh43 years of supervision of that work,Superplan
7 yrs ago, I was & have been concerned that our Pres. would end-up & call a state of emergency and marshal law.
Words of wisdom from a twerp who couldn't even beat a reality show clown in the primaries. Why don't YOU resign?
& ur saying that our America needs reality show clown as POTUS? u r reason we r getting just that! Idiot!
@AndresGaviriaC @NicolasMaduro meanwhile, Obama refuses to put him in jail.
You're starting to sound like big daddy with tweets like those. Let's get you a coat and a job in the white house.
@GusDuque1 @NicolasMaduro
Senator, The USA shouldn't accept how chavists buy lots of properties in America with dirty money whereas people are suffering.
@Libertar_Latino @NicolasMaduro well, but i'm poud of the brave people, who are courageous enough, to protest against him!
let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that nicolas maduro doesn't know what he's doing.

America was once prosperous & look at us now. Don't see it getting any better with current leadership/candidates
well, Hugo had a hand in that chaos too.
miss you.. Please keep up until 2020. Four years goes by fast
Marco, quit ginning up a fight with Venezuela.
@YoungBLKRepub @NicolasMaduro Chavez started this and is just as responsible. They are the Lenin & Stalin of Venezuela.
@YoungBLKRepub @NicolasMaduro This is a product of PURE #greed the #world is feeling! 62 cannot control the world's wealth!

We should probably focus on our own nations problems.
our politicians care more about their corrupt political parties then our nation. Ttump only cares about his ego
Trump will do the same thing to our nation. Rome fell apart when everyone started hating anyone not like them!!
You should Shut up
Little Marco, why don't you start over. See if your cartel connections can get you elected to Miami city council.
Oh what tangled webs we weave (maduro) when first we practice to deceive!
If ur not interested in the VP position, which u should be, is there another run in 2020?
@SenRubioPress @NicolasMaduro praying #Venezuela gets rid of that #Castro discipline soon and forever
@danielggarza @NicolasMaduro Feel the bern.
This predictable economic collapse induced by #Socialist/#BigGovt policies also referred to as the #AfterBern
sounds like so many #Republican governors, take @govsambrownback @BobbyJindal @FLGovScott
shame on lil Marco #nevermarco come to Mia and tell Venezuelans you want them mass deported hypocrite
rich coming from Rubio who bites all hand that feed him including mass deportation of his own constituency insane
Thank you Senator Rubio for taking a stand on this.  So sad...
lets take care of our country before we start barking at others. There is enough mess here to fix.
so strange when people hired to a job can't do the job and blame everyone! Like here in U.S.
SO GLAD TO SEE SOMEONE TWEET ABOUT THIS TERRIBLE SITUATION, IT IS GETTING ALMOST NO PRESS IN USA. #Venezuela #CNERevocatorioYA
So howzabout worrying about USA and stop worrying about everyone else. So many judges to confirm #DoYourJob
One of those "advanced" nations @BarackObama wants to emulate...
Little Marco, calling the kettle black.
Just as you would do as President. Thanks for being a #LOSER
well it's been in bad shape since the previous dictator  (because he wasn't a president)
@TedJoy71 Just like you, Maduro is incompetent, but the one that actually driven Venzezuala down the toilet was Hugo Chavez.
Marco , we can't forget all the good Obama's buddy Hugo Chavez did for them .
little Marco YOU should resign. Oh wait, you have to actually work to resign. -Sad
Libtards on parade, one again, sink their own ship. Expecting different results doing same thing. Asinine thought
No es justo que EEUU acoge a corruptos y violadores de DDHH. Un pueblo muere de hambre y falta de medicinas por sus delitos
YES
Sen Rubio is so presidential. He knows what he's talking about. A true leader. Keep up the great work Senator.
pensé que los EEUU era el único país en el mundo que se respeta la Ley y se solidariza con los pueblos q son reprimidos.
Senador como pueden ex funcionarios chavistas estar en EEUU con grandes fortunas derivadas de corrupción y hambre de un pueblo?
Get em Marco we must promote capitalism and let it be known that we are a free market with limited gov
Venezuela has not beeen prosperous in several decades, has been on slippery slope downward in marxist idiocy.
Get it bae! #AlwaysMarco @NicolasMaduro
We can not lose Marco as POTUS Only one to take seriously the danger we are in! Countries falling apart around us
.gracias @marcorubio por su preocupacion por los venezolanos
Marco taking a break from campaigning against the GOP candidate. Guess he forgot his debate oath.  #slime
like Trump will do to USA if given the chance
little marco
you signed a pledge, raised your right hand. Your word means nothing.
you should mind your business and worry about our country this is why you lost primary's
creo que la caída de Venezuela empezó con Chávez.
#CommunistsMustGo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolás_Maduro#Ideological_orientation …
A stronger leader would condemn the cult-of-personality candidate in America.
thank you for fighting communism and dictatorship.
I lived thru this and it is not good.
@BettinaVLA @NicolasMaduro 
Hey just like little Marco...incompetent as hell
#SocialismNeverWorks CC @BernieSanders
The Cubans are backing him. Socialism is a disaster and a scourge against humanity.
The inevitable result of socialism is misery. R u listening @SenSanders ?
Glad to see you've finished your book and can now do the job you're being paid to do 
How but you worry about your future and leave Venezuela alone.
yeah, like Venezuela is doing so well.No Food,no electricity,no toilet paper & no freedom!!
Better than the rule of oligarchy any day.
dictators don't resign! Maduro needs to be taken out by force!  people from Venezuela are suffering! F Maduro!!
You are mistaken to blame #Maduro who is a pawn in a very big game. ALL blame for chaos in Venezuela lies with HUGO CHAVEZ
I think some blame needs to go to Castro regime who is behind the scenes of fascist regime
Tyranical regime is modelled & guided by Castros but Chavez was the cause who allowed/wanted it in #Venezuela
He may have wanted it but Castro Cuban  officials are flooded in all aspects of society incl. Fort Tiuna
Trump reminds of caudillos like Chavez and Maduro.
Once you "elect" to govern by Socialism be prepared for the consequence! This election we have 3 socialist
We should let our young Sanders supporters look at what free everything and socialist views do. History teaches!!
pot calling the kettle black?
thanks Sen. Rubio. My wife's family is from Venezuela. They are greatly concerned over the country's  declined.
####SOCIALISM at it's best. Should be removed.
I worked as a physician for over a year in Maracaibo and I saw the government literally breaking the country.
AGREE
I'm really missing the foam parties!
Venezuela is another SA nation ripe for the picking by Marxist Russia.
Lordy, lordy what ever happened to the US education system. Russia Marxist surely you jest.
he -> @marcorubio is a liar and neocon failed project. Leave S. America alone @NicolasMaduro
you leave it alone
#MarcoRubio you negative tweets didn't work with #LyingTrump #the #UnelectableTedCruz. Find another way
SOCIALISM=ultimate OLIGARCHY put into power by a DUMBED DOWN ELECTORATE hence SOCIALISTS 1st take over EDUCATION!
@marcorubio @NicolasMaduro
Marco you're really the only 1 that was not intimidated by Trump & took him on…that's what's up
just like when you stepped out of the race?? Oh! You only #suspended
rubio take care of urself. rubiks cuba has been solved and there is nothing more to see. go home
He blames AMERICA for what is happening there. It's been in shambles for over 20 years.  Venezuelans don't want a DICTATOR.
His right to blame America.  The US just wants to replace real democracy with greedy Oligarchs. Whole world knows it
THE PEOPLE of VENEZUELA will DECIDE THIS. Not AMERICA, NOT CHINA and NOT ANYONE ELSE!
Nonsense. US is behind this.
If you believe a BARACK OBAMA Administration is behind what's happening in Venezuela you must know something we don't!
Yep. I know reality when I see it. CIA written all over it.
You have your right 2 believe that. But the majority of Americans want AMERICA FIRST & INFRASTRUCTURE. Good day 2u sir
I wish your government felt the same way. People around the world would stop living in fear of US. Good day
missing you on the campaign trail! #Marco2020
I consider him a criminal. Thank you for sharing this.
but you are so great?
socialism will never work
Rubio, Go back to Cuba!
