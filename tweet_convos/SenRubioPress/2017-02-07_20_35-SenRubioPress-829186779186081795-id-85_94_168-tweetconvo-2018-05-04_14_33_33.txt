Marco Rubio how can YOU stand behind Trumps crazy cabinet nominees.. you are stronger than this!! PLEASE !
Why did you accept ~$100,00 from @BetsyDeVos & then vote for her, against wishes of constituents?
Should DeVos donate 2 Democratic politicians who disagree with her policies?
She shouldn't be Sec. of Ed. She has no qualifications besides her billions of $$
My question is this:  why IS Coretta Scott King's 30 year old letter still powerful?  @SenWarren
Thank you Senator Rubio! People need to work together to get things done in our country. Keep being the "Great Encourager!"
I support @SenWarren in her dignified effort to read the letter of Coretta Scott King's letter regarding Senator Sessions.
Rule 19 did not need to be invoked.  Your own LECTURE appeared to be self-serving Sen. Rubio; I had to verify whether you supported Rule 19.
Authoritarianism will not be tolerated.  Rule 19 was invoked only when things came to fisticuffs in the 1800's.
you get no respect. VOted for DeVos after you receive a nice chunk of change. Your vote was bought!   Shameful.
Please VOTE NO on Sen. Sessions. Voting rights matter. #Florida #AG #CIVILITY
Marco please don't sell your soul... make decisions for ALL Americans! We are looking at your voting record!
Rubio this is an amazing insite into our Country today.
first time in a while that I completely agree with your argument...well said, more of that is needed...thanks!
nothing was inaccurate or uncivil in King's statement; what was uncivil was silencing a fellow Senator for political theater
Sen. Warren was speaking the words of the late Coretta Scott King. And you silenced her. #LetCorettaBeHeard  @SenRubioPress
shame on you shutting down Elizabeth Warren!
the fact that there is so much hate directed at you for speaking out for civility shows how dire the circumstances.
Little Marco DeVos. You are shameless. As always. http://m.dailykos.com/stories/2017/2/7/1631178/-Mitch-McConnell-tries-to-silence-Elizabeth-Warren-Coretta-Scott-King-on-Sessions-nomination?_=2017-02-07T18%3A13%3A59.128-08%3A00 …
I will be actively making sure you are not re elected in the 33534 Tampa area #LetLizTalk
@jjs92285 @YouTube Then he voted to kick her out
Thank you Senator Rubio. You're a wonderful leader and I pray one day you'll lead our great nation.
pure, political posturing. Rubio only cares about $$$$$$$.
Bought and paid for...
@marcorubio Yet you were silent then...have you no shame?
You argue this only when it works for the #GOP, sir.  This is why you all have lost cred in the eyes of protestors.
thanks for being a professional!
r
I am outraged u would vote to silence @SenWarren This is not how democracies work! 
Did DEVOS BUY UR VOTE PAY2PLAY?
Hilarious coming from GOP. Where were you past 8 years? Benefiting from incivility
your party needs to step up to the plate and work with the dems.
how about he takes 100k and gives direct vote for it. POS
#LetLizTalk  U 2 are in Bannon's back pocket.  Shameful.  Sen. Warren should be allowed to speak.
oh, back off.  You have no spine or morals.  If you really cared about civility, you would have voted to allow her
#LetLizSpeak Saw this last night. Sessions is a nominee who should be vetted. Reading Coretta S. Kings words was appropriate.
#letlizspeak Vote no on Sessions!! @SenWarren
The AG is responsible to all in this Country and when he has marginalized some in the past, it is disqualifying.2/2
it is not a lack of civility to point out that a nominee for AG has a past clouded with racist tendencies 1/2
you care about decorum when a liberal reads a poignant and true letter you don't when Repubs yell liar and worse #LetLizTalk
senator join no Labels bipartisan problem solving. Want you to get to work
-  Did you take Soros money?
you got yours now everybody shut up!..pitiful
it would be nice to hear @marcorubio say just one thing that proves he's listening to his voters. What's his price 4 access?
No one is watching me grandstand, so let's post on YT.Meanwhile, I will continue to sell out & vote straight down party lines
You talk the talk so very well. And then, you voted to silence EW. That's when you lose my support. 33304
show civility? Or take $100,000 to vote in an incompetent person to lead our education system!?
Why did you vote for DeVos? Did you think she was qualified?
Your institution has failed us. And you share culpability for that. Oh and your body hasn't worked in 8 years..
You disappoint me....
Lovely speech but you did not address Republican behavior that shut down the government due to refusal to negotiate.
I guess 100 G's can motivate someone to say anything
WHY DeVoss?
You deserve an Oscar for that speech after ignoring your constituents and selling out our childrens education for $
My entire family is saving money so we can co tribute to your next opponent. You are a self serving  disgrace.
PLEASE VOTE NO ON SESSIONS, he is not fit for the job of AG!!!!!
yes, that would be nice! Please vote NO ON SESSIONS,
you voted against her, shame. We ladies know McConnell practices misogny, didn't know u did. That locked vote said wonders.
@marcorubio U stated in floor speech that u advocated for the people you represent. Don't see that w/your votes. No Sessions.
@marcorubio how about holding a local town hall & no more smearing your constituents as "extremists"?
Well done
You have no right to lecture others, right or left, when you accept bribe money.
then don't vote party line and grow a spine. Also, why are Reps abolishing oversight?
@MattTJohnsonGH @YouTube I love him
A house divided cannot stand.
it's not civil to shut down your phones and not allow constituents to go to your local office.
Yes, America was watching you. Well said.
you should work on putting the country before your party and $$ #purchasedpolitician
But you voted to shutdown a Senator as act of civility-thanks for the lesson-expect in 2 yrs same courtesy #letlizspeak

You could be an electable #potus if your actions matched your words. Disappointed in Rex vote. Be braver. We need it
Well said
@marcorubio thank you for being the voice of reason. Keep fighting for us 
Civility yes, let's include integrity, and principle instead of Ego and $$ for confirmations!
thanks. Sen Warren has lost reality.
so, reading a letter that is relevant to what you are debating is uncivil?
I wish I could RT this 1000 times, and I hope many others do.  @GOP @TheDemocrats  please pay attention!
This is why we are proud you serve in our U.S. Senate.
he's a sell out..are you proud of the money he got from Devos?
@foxnews @POTUS @loudobbs
Would that b th same type of "civility" that U showd POTUS Trump during th campaign?
“She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,” = make me a sandwich
