I love that Corey
Will you run in 2020?
.@CoryBooker Too many of our Dem leaders are falling in line with Trump. Please don't disappoint everyone in NJ who has believed in you.
.@CoryBooker We need you to be strong and resist the coming abuses. Please don't cave to the autocracy. I'm begging you.
I think he understands that we voted for him because he ISN'T a pathetic worm, so he'll have no intentions of backing down.
Here's hoping.
There'll be others willing to stand up and run, anyway. But we hope he sticks with its decent humans.
us decent humans
Ya darn tootin' Off the couch, into the streets, we will not be quiet
@SenBookerOffice. @realDonaldTrump  MLK would be very disappointed with the hate and division of the modern day Democrats!
thank you!! We will!
@CoryBooker
.@CoryBooker You had me, more or less, until "collaboration" with a regime that wants me dead. Please don't do this. We need resistance.

Love you & need you more than ever 
@coppycup
I have said it again and again since first saw you on @billmaher .  You and Elizabeth Warren must run in 2020.  #StartPrepNow @TheDemocrats
throw Gavin newsom in there somewhere and you've got something
Have you spoken out against the hate crimes happening now? Is there a video to share?
@Wary12 Peeps, sign if you haven't already:
TRUMP - Mental Health "Libtards" Family Women & POPULAR VOTE=
We need our NJ senators and representatives in our schools reassuring our kids. Urban and suburban districts.
for President in 2020
You should run in 2020
By being defeated, we became much stronger at fighting for our rights, our equality, our justice...
thank you for the MLK quote. It is comforting at this tough time.
Senator Booker, I am so sad. I think Mr. Trump's words have been reprehensible and he should begin by apologizing.
Cory get a grip, go on vacation and beg the Lord for forgiveness. he will probably pass on the forgiveness  you were cautioned
that's what republicans have been saying for 8 years. Let us have our turn lol
Warren/Booker 2020 Vision. Just let us know how we can help.
Need a solution to Trump voter's valid concerns. Helping them helps us.  We can do that and everything else.
...on all other issues, there's unanimous agreement from all sides with everything gov't does. Only you are unhappy.
I needed to gather from MLK's hope right now
who can I contact in your office to find out how to help in this dire time. Help me find a positive way out of this despair
No more corporatist Dems. Learn the lesson or lose more seats and general elections.
POTUS46 , A soldier just said to me, "We survived 400 yrs of slavery, for sure we will survive 4 years " #NeverMyPresident
We need you to lead us.
I have to believe this or I will go mad....thanks
#WeShallOvercome
please run in 2020!! We need you
Did you just announce 2020?
stop whining
democrats are getting run over by Bush league tactics like not appointing SCJ. Going high isn't working.
Hopefully some day you will seek higher office. I think you can get it done
what do u tell ur kids when a mean spirited person wins? Pls help the Dems rise pls.
We are in shock with Trump winning, get ready for 2020... we're serious, you will get out ALL the vote..
Booker 2020! 
ty for reminding us that this is temporary and we will rise again. You inspire me to want to do better. #WeWillRise #MyHero
Booker for president 2020 . He has the vision for a better us. ( you can keep that on the house, you got my vote) 
I  and respect you Cory but pls tell me how can we find common ground with ppl filled with so much hate and why should we?
Start now so Senator Booker will be a household name. You know the minorities will vote to somebody they have seen. You the one
please start putting together a presidential exploratory committee.
That's an incredible and appropriate quote.
Please run for President in 2020....
we need you now more than ever!
MLK was a democrat.
A Republican would have said "lIfe Hopes is dependant on "I", disappointin yoU is my finite reality"
we need you as leader in the days to come.
#WhenHeReturns
Election INVALID! Remember?  Giuliani/ GOP illegally conspired w/ FBI and violated Hatch Act ., Hillary would have won !
If you truly want to help your people get behind our new president. Still think you would be a good Republican and help your PPL
Thank you, sir. In whatever endeavor you choose next, if it is a national race, you have my support.
Thank you for finding the words I couldn't. Hope this will help our kids who were raised to love and not judge. @its_en_not_on
Please run in 2020.

There is always hope! We get knocked down but always need to get back up #values

Indeed. Thank you. I thought you'd appreciate this piece -- No, I'm Not Leaving This Country. http://www.colleenpatrickgoudreau.com/im-not-leaving-this-country … xo
Oh, you are surprisingly unkind in general. Makes sense now.
nothing to be disappointed about the process works it's up to leaders like you to give us a good government. That's your duty
@TheNightsHero I hope you rise and run in 2020. We kinda need you.

I hope he considers it.
You and @HillaryClinton in 2020! I'm thinking of running for something local.

We need you to run for POTUS in 2020.

Yes we will. But we must never forget the lesson delivered by this evil racist. We must find away to work harder next election.
healing, hurt and more than that the fear has to be eased out of people, hope is what we need to look forward
Senator.... you got to get people to the polls to vote... let them "rise" out of bed and VOTE. Too much old school registration
#Booker2020 rise my friend rise!
I'm from Texas. My Senators don't represent my interests. Can you adopt me as a constituent? Need to know you have my back.
we have hope. We need leadership like yours to help unify this country and keep moving forward.
2020
Please run in 2020 #LoveStillTrumpsHate
#Booker2020
McConnell and Republicans just says they were handed the power and he was giddy. Giddy unchecked republicans is open season
in women and minorities Rise Up and protect yourselves.
I am encouraging every minority I know to protect themselves. It looks like open season in minorities. Tired of being nice.
so very true. If only we you as our president. 2020!!
maybe if you supporter a #progressive candidate we wouldn't have to play catch up or rise up. #Shill #Disappointed
thank you. I talked a lot about you yesterday. Our future. My middle name is 2018.
This is what we need in the White House not someone who divides us but someone who brings is together regardless of party!
please run for President in 2020
got little hope this morning, bro. Trying...trying.
Yes we have to accept it, pick ourselves up, dust off, then fight it!  #NotMyPresident
thank you for instilling hope & calm in this turbulent time. Helps to know you will be looking out for ALL of us.
Amen!
I have hope!  But how do we open people's hearts to look inside & find empathy and understanding?
Fire it up! Ready to go!
GM, thank u 4 this tweet as I commute 2 work in DC 4 the 1st time since the election. I'm still dazed but this too shall pass.
#notmypresident. Heartbroken, shocked, horrified. Who are we?
I'm not just disappointed but frightened for my country right now. You give me hope. Thank you 4 standing strong for all of us.
please save us. Do everything you can in the senate, and in four years run and beat the buffoon. America needs you.
Please run in 2020. I beg of you. I sincerely beg of you.
The only consolation that I have come up with is that instead of Booker2024 maybe we can work for Booker 2020. I am ready to work.
yes but when?  this is too much!
King was a Republican
Possible?   https://petitions.whitehouse.gov//petition/employ-electoral-college-avoid-donald-trump-presidency …
Possible? http://nyp.st/2fnb1bq 
Your optimism and outlook makes getting through each day easier. Thank you Cory.
2020

Good Morning. Day 2. #WeWillRise
Maybe spend more time in the Rust Belt and not at a Lady Gaga concert as part of your campaign strategy
what's done is done! #hesnotmypresident
"Still I Rise" Maya Angelou.
RUN 2020
Yes!!!!
how do you always know when & how to say the perfect thing?
Whats hilarious is King fought against the system that you and Hillary want to perpetuate.
And then when you post this, i remember that you represent all of us - Dems and Reps.  Well said, Mr. Senator.
I hope you can lead our Democratic party. We need you.
you got a lot of work to do in the Senate.
