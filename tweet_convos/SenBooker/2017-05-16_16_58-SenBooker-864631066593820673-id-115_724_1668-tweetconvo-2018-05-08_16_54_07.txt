Exclusive: Donald Trump asked James Comey to end the Michael Flynn inquiry in February, Comey wrote in a memo then http://nyti.ms/2pROmsW 
This must be a wake-up call for congressional Republicans to begin holding Trump accountable, to put country first.
We must act immediately in a bipartisan fashion to get to the bottom of this.
Pack uh braindead ganjaheaded tweekers best move to mexico before we build our friggin wall .. #Libtardssuck  
All the bickering in Washington does is open the door for other countries to destroy us. A house united will stand a house divided will fall
I've got more confidence in Comey & he has more credibility than DT. A shameful mess for our country. It will destroy the republican Party.
Your stunning disclosure shows you are a partisan loon who has no interest in anything but destroying the President. Loon.
You take care of Bengazie disaster first then let's talk about comet and Trump
Yes I agree it's waste of time and money. Need to get to work on things that make America great again. Stop the witch hunt
How is this man still president???Are republicans that desperate to hold onto power that they have lost all sense of what's right and wrong?
Enough's enough! So-called president is intellectually&morally incapable of carrying out his role. He can't preserve or protect constitution
Possibility?  You know that is exactly what he did.  And he has sycophants covering his ass on all his illegalities.
Let's get to the bottom of Hillary/Russian collusion, Obama/Iran collusion, Lynch/Hillary collusion, Holder/Obama collusion...
Wishful thinking democrat cover up!!
Not just the possibility, but the likelihood.
Oh Cory, you really are a fool!
Donald Trump
Chaffetz wants to destroy evidence.
These stunning disclosures point to the possibility that @realdonaldtrump personally engaged in obstruction of justice in the Oval Office.
Yeah people keep saying that but what's being done nothing
Like obama administration wasn't corrupt
Please do all you can, Senator Booker, to see that an independent investigation & prosecutor are appointed ASAP.
Comey was fired for doing his job, and for disagreeing w/@POTUS's personal request & not granting it-Comey tried!
And what about obama
what's the deal w/trump? Why doesn't he LEARN from his mistakes? Only listens to family. "Bright Minds and Dark Attitudes" explains all...
IMPEACH NOW !!!
Is there anything he has done a crime? Presidents can do anything? Not treason to give away secrets & the ally? Come on. Ridiculous.
Did something happen at 9 west coast time?
Keep on drinking that Koolaide!
It's time to impeach him! Clinton was impeached for lying about a blow job!!! These things 45 does r much more serious. Can't b trusted.
The Republican Congressional silence in the face of treason and rampant abuse of power will be their bloody legacy #DemocracyDiesInDarkness
Ya think?  We need a. Modification of the statutes regarding high treason to require death by firing squad or hanging .
Asking somene a question isn't obstruction. Ordering them is...
@MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump If Trump does not have the dignity to resign on Wednesday it will be time to impeach him.
@PoLilTinkTink72 Possibility?! Try "certainty".
Really Cory? If he obstructed Y did Comey wait until now 2 produce the memo? Sounds 2 me like DNC, elected Dems and big media are colluding
#impeachment NOW
Impeach him already
Obstruction. Of. Justice.
They also suggest he committed espionage
This is why the Mafia needs to be ejected out of the WH and on to jail
...and yet again, Cory Booker for President!

There is a dictionary definition of 'obstruction of justice': https://www.merriam-webster.com/legal/obstruction%20of%20justice â€¦
Well, good Senator Booker, you and others within Congress have the ultimate power to do something. We are relying on all of you.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @nytmike NOTHING will happen. 45=teflon
Does whatever and no one cares.
I will only be shocked if he didn't. Time for action, Congress can not continue to sit on the side line, not what you were elected to do.
Please use Senate procedural tools to delay and block Trump agenda. Object to unanimous consent requests and initiate filibusters.
Now is the time for all good men come to the aid of their country.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump These stunning disclosures are like a cliff hanger to watch the next season. #ComeyMemo
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Does @realDonaldTrump understand how politicians lie like @NancyPelosi @HillaryClinton?
Why are our lawmakers dragging their feet on @POTUS? No matter what laws he breaks, he's allowed to freely walk away. The People say ENOUGH!
Just like holding Obama accountable for ALL his corruption that he is guilty of.Instead of a witch hunt for @realDonaldTrump.
Wasn't it Trump that said he'd bring back water-boarding because it was a great interrogation technique? BUCKET ANYONE? #ComeyMemo #RESIST
not to end,   get it right.
Possibility? What is wrong with you? Have a backbone. He DID engage in obstruction of justice. DO MORE THAN TWEET.
This whole administration needs to go and 45 should not be allowed to appoint anyone else.
Don't forget the $ he's having paid to all his resorts by Secret Service, etc. Those golfcart rental charges! Get our $ back sir
at this point, I think we're beyond  the notion that it's a "possibility".
Yes. Make it happen. It's time.
This brought me a level of satisfaction I had not previously known.
Cory, run.
And Comey sat by and allowed this... hmmmm??
Trouble right here in DC. Storm clouds on the horizon!
Get the impeachment moving forward
Maybe but no one in Washington does anything more than give lip service to anything he does and people are angry.
Duh!! Now get those #GOP idiots to stop debating if it's fake new and actually stand up for our democracy and impeach @realDonaldTrump
IMPEACH him already! Americans will not forgive nor forget complacency on BOTH sides.
Point? Possibility? It's waving a huge red flag surrounded by a brass band shooting of fireworks  exposing what we all know will get worse
And sniffing like a crack head. You do mean trump right?
Cory baby...do you have the memo? No? Then why are you "booking" this yet to be substantiated story?
More like probability Sen. Booker.
Buckle your belts.
If that be so 1) Comey would have said no..we don't do that 2)would have reported it..but instead the hearings stated there was no impedence
#NoPrinciples @gop "leaders" @speakerryan & @SenateMajLdr stand by with their thumbs up their asses #TheResistance
@nmbound9 @realDonaldTrump @nytimes time to drain the swamp of the criminals Cory!!
Possibility? His presidency has been one long obstruction of justice.
@SenateDems Yes, Trump did. Probably not the first time since he has no integrity. Question is, when will the GOP deal w/it
Ever the diplomat. "Possibility" is too kind.
All fools who are causing harm to our country! We support our POTUS!
You gonna visit him at gitmo, douche?
So take action tomorrow!
Then DO SOMETHING FOR HEAVENS SAKE!
See ya Trumplethinskin  ! The gig is up !
#ImpeachTrump already.
Ya Think, Senator?
Cory, we are talking about 100% probability here.
Don't you all talk to your Republican counterparts? I can't believe the articles of impeachment haven't been filed yet.
It certainly looks that way, doesn't it?  Thanks for pressing the issue. Our country needs politicians who have the courage to demand truth.
Point to it?
possibility? he admitted to obstruction of justice on national TV last week!
'Stunning" is that in the Democrat book of buzzwords???
The news is always right..

Reminder! Also don't forget to watch how your candidates voted on bills you are interested in at https://www.govtrack.us/  
#bullshit #FakeNews
You don't get involved when a disgruntled employee is fired. What is wrong with you.
Nixon is starting to look like Mother Theresa. Just kidding.
