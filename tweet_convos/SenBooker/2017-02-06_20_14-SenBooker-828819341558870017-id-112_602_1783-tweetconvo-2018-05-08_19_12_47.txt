Senator @CoryBooker on #BetsyDeVos nomination â€“ LIVE on C-SPAN2,@cspanradio & online here: http://cs.pn/2lfh83G  
turned on, been following Cory since before being in senate, he is someone who clearly works for every American.
He doesn't speak for me.He doesn't work for me and could careless about me.
George, I am not your Sen but may both u & I care about all people. In a world where 2 many couldn't care less, may we care more.
Hopefully it changes soon.We will see.Good luck.
We can expect #DeVos not to uphold civil rights. #Republicans had better pay to clean up after protests they caused.
@cspan @cspanradio Thank you for continuing to #holdthefloor #saynotodevos
Thank you Sen Cory Booker for standing for our children and the future. You have been noticed. ;)
@SenatorBurr SHAME on You Sentator Burr....History will remember your Betrayal.
thank you for protecting our children!
bla bla bla u askholes are getting sadder every day wait till the midterms when you'll pay dearly for ur shenanigans
#NoOnDeVos
@cspan @cspanradio butu aligned urself w/ DeVos in Newark. Guess it's not in ur interest now
The Dems are all about preserving the damn teachers union. It should be abt doing away with Com Core & school choice
@cspan @cspanradio 
#schoolchoice is a civil rights issue.  Democrats want to deny that right to children.
There will be no good answer that she could give. Democrats are just being obstructionists.
@cspan @cspanradio
Democrats in DC are protesting overnight to show just how much they oppose giving poor kids the same educational opportunities as rich kids.
Well said Cory ""TALKS""  one day this counterfeit advocate  will learn that you ""SPEAK"" WITH  Not Talk to people
Corey Is a Asshat.. and Now Career moving Forward.. Look at His Cities.. h3 has Done Nothing.. Records don't Lie..

@cspan @cspanradio vote NO Senator Booker. #TheResistance
Cory Booker doesn't like choice. That's why he voted against getting medicine from Canada - to appease his Big Pharma donors.
@cspan @cspanradio Dems still playing divisional politics.  Can you hear that sucking sound as people flee the party
Another fruitcake heard from...
We Need One Republican Senator to Flip. CALL YOUR REPUBLICAN SENATORS NOW!!
why waste our $ and time complaining?  what results have you contributed this month?  Complaining x reinvent!!!
@cspan @cspanradio begin by focussing on ways to fix our schools so our kids stay and get the education they deserve
Shouldn't that be your jobs? She's not up for The Secretary of Civil Rights. As usual, bait & switch issues.
Can Muslims practice Sharia Law in America?
Hypocrites, all of you. If you care about labor, what about automation? What should be done about co.s like Amazon?
Use nuclear option, I'm getting tired of the nitpicking. When did the comic and Tears learn what teachers are about
@cspan @cspanradio Looks as if Americans Vivil Rights need to be addressed! All black colleges Immigrant scholarship
thank you for standing up for our children and their future in education
@cspan @cspanradio Cory Booker has shown that he is just a tool of the Sen Dems,one would think he'd know better
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker Thank you Sen Booker!  Keep the fight going. No to DeVos!
#holdthefloor Newark NJ has faith u know our school system and what we need if u hold the floor we will hold YOU
we are with y'all stand strong 
is an Obama butt kisser. And ever since his theatrics with Sessions, he's more than that, he's a bottom feeder
if your education system so great what are you afraid of? Give the parents the choice stop trying to control us!
school choice is needed to help our children get a better ed. Union teachers only care about getting paid
Thank you for standing up for our public schools! Please find a third Republican to block DeVos!
@cspan @cspanradio awesome job, Dems!  #holdthefloor
thank you too!
In spite of  dedicated teachers, tax $, public schools are failing our kids.  New perspective needed.
Thank you, Senator Booker for your dedication, and your words.
We have you backs senate dems! Keep it coming!
Dems are the DOMESTIC ENEMY in the presidential oath.
The  @CoryBooker who was an ally with DeVos & school choice?
let's not! How about we flipping work this hard at saving money for taxpayers or maybe getting jobs for us? 
you mean left wing anarchists shutting down free speech with violence?
Still mad at you @CoryBooker about the Canadian meds. DeVos would be a tragedy. Thank God you're right on this one.
Come Booker your not Obama and the Dem party is finished unless you get the radicals like @SenWarren out!
The only civil rights are those of our Constitution, not those of false religions, who do not believe in freedom.
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @cspan @cspanradio No DeVos  Our kids come first Cory hold the floor, y don't let her in!
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @cspan @cspanradio #noDevos Save our kids from this unqualified person, she can mess up all kids!
Having the Federal Government provide the curricula for Civil Rights allows false narratives to be included by Dems!
Civil Rights courses in every curriculum . But should include Demonicrat's lack of support for it in history.
Please continue to stand strong in opposition to Betsy DeVos!Our kids deserve better and so does our entire country!
how can such despicable nominees be accepted into such positions? 95% of them R clueless, racist, anti the position
these nominees act like they know they'll be confirmed no matter what. Have the republicans been bought? Blackmailed
@cspan @cspanradio Betsy knows NOTHING about CIVIL RIGHT or PUBLIC SCHOOL   RICH WHITE WOMAN buy whatever she wants
thank you! Keep fighting 4 what's right!  @CoryBooker
Thank you, Senator!
Our children's future is your hands, don't let them down.
Amazing and historic speech. Thank you Senator Booker.
