@realDonaldTrump @DavidKoechner After 7 days enough is enough already. Who has the bill for IMPEACHMENT ready?  We cu.
NO. He has already done so much more...$$$ from foreign govts is enuff 4 me.
@CoryBooker Agreed. What legal action have you and @SenateDems taken in response to the #Muslimban EO?
When you deny access to America based on religious beliefs you deny one of the reasons our country was founded on.
True but this is based on country of origin not religion.
Trump said that the goal is to screen out “radical Islamic terrorists” and that priorty
"Islamic" appears nowhere in the EO. #BeFactual
then why "test" them for "Christianity" beliefs? Hypocrisy at its worst. Their visa's were approved.
false premise, they are not being tested for Christianity. Again, have u read the EO?
This requires drastic action on the part of Democrats. You should all already be assembled in Washington to meet and demand time on TV.
this should involve GOP 2! This should involve anyone who believes in freedom of religion
Only because Trump does business there. Research
@CoryBooker perhaps the only time you'll agree with CATO.

I went to America once. I was hugely disappointed. @Monie625
The full expression is "good riddance to bad rubbish". But I wouldn't expect you to know that. @SenBookerOffice @Monie625
can't agree more! Vetting immigrants by religion and banning Muslims goes against our countries founding principles! 
By Law were Banned and not allowed to enter in 1952. In 2011Obama Stop entry for 6 months! Unvettables blocked
@nanner63 @NoTrumpNWay @SenBookerOffice was new background checks, not a ban. apples to oranges.
Lets show Americans that final Americans are being placed first. Keep on Democrats America is watching #2018
Sir you are a disgrace to your office There's people who are waiting to enter this wonderful country in the proper way
@CoryBooker this is not American this reminds us the Hitler's time
please tell this to trump because he said P. Obama brought all the refugees without background check
Where is Congress on the immigration ban? This is so awful & we need an engaged Congress to fix this now.

. What is your action plan?
@CoryBooker why dont you pay all these refugees with your money not our tax money? Our tax money should first help american
So what are you going to DO about it? Taking to Twitter is not the answer.
The Past Six Presidents Have All Used The Executive Power To Block Certain Classes Of Immigrants
perfect example of #FakeNews. Which President blocked which ethnicity or religion before #Trump #MuslimBan ??
@debjensen0  Sorry, when I enter another country, I have to follow their govt. rules. Good for one, good for all.Go Trump
And you Melinda-are entitled to your opinion-we don't have to agree!!
That's right Deb. Agree to disagree and still be Outlander Friends!
AlwaysI don't disagree w/the statement you made in your tweet-But to me--there's much more involved-n this ban
please do not tag me in your tweets TY
not sure how sincere you are since you vote against the interest of the American people
@CoryBooker If Congress doesn't declare this man unfit then we the people will!!
Is there a way to bring up charges re:Bannon for his Un-Constitutional comments in NYTimes against the press? He swore oath
But!Totally O.K. Mien Kampf Trump brought illegals in 4 modeling &workers on his towers!Double standards!
@CoryBooker thank you for your support in this. I commend your efforts & will be following as closely as I can 
@CoryBooker How can our President straighten up our country, if people  won't co-operate with him.
@NazrMohammed Cory Booker is a grandstanding, attention-seeking buffoon.
@CoryBooker  Our families were all immigrants at one time.  Please stop the ignorant sociopath!
Not JUST refugees... people coming home, students, professionals, all of them!
That's great, finally the TSA operating with structure for America 
Instead of us Americans treated like slum in our airports. It's a disgrace traveling if you haven't noticed
please continue to stand up to these actions of our president
should protest loudly and hard against this Nazi 45' showing aren't afraid to call him for what he 7 his support team are
Not anymore thanks to @ACLU.
@fbgchase how to "show" trump. What can we do step up we need a leader
Thank you. I hope you will do all you can to fight the #RefugeeBan - particularly for Syrians.
@atrumptastrophe don't believe a word this scumbag Booker says. He's for highest bidder

https://www.google.com/amp/s/sethfrantzman.com/2017/01/28/obamas-administration-made-the-muslim-ban-possible-and-the-media-wont-tell-you/amp/ …
Trump not only blocking refugees, he's blocking Green Card holders too. They're folks who've worked & lived in US for yrs.
.@SenBookerOffice I hope you are at either #Dulles or #JFK right now. Please show up, for the millions of us who can't be there. #MuslimBan
please help fight this ban,  I am behind you.
.@SenBookerOffice GOOD it's about time 
@roens we expect you to do quite a lot more than "show," Senator.
Please intervene, Sen. Booker, & thx for your strong msg condemning the Exec Order.
stop impeding Senator!
.@SenBookerOffice go to Newark Airport. Join the protestors.
What happens if airport leaders/workers across the U.S. decide to defy the order in tandem with each other?
@CoryBooker other countries has a strict policy on people coming into their country, why shouldn't we?
a simplified statement from a simple man
good. Hope he ships you out too you criminal
Let's show #trump the doors (WH Exit and prison Enter)
They need to go to a country that speaks their language and enjoys the same customs, How about Saudi Arabia
UMMM NO, they can stay in there own country, its time for them to fight for their own country and not run away
Yes I Fully Agree!! Next Trump's Version of The Berlin Wall....The Mexico Wall! Pres. Reagan: Tear down the Wal
You all need to denounce this en masse. Loudly. Publicly. On the steps of the Capitol. Something!
we must #resist #flipcongressnov62018
@NazrMohammed Melinda is right. We have laws for a reason. Has nothing to do with religion or race but that's w Dems preach
Don't just say something or tweet something..DO SOMETHING! We are sick of platitudes.
@CoryBooker What can you and your colleagues do in the senate to resist this madness? What do you need from us in support?
your words have very little meaning anymore.
Something has to be done. He's too stupid to run a country. Begin impeachment.
you and your liberals made this country suffer several Muslim attacks to our citizen resulting in how many deaths?
@CoryBooker why don't you accept that culture wants to kill americans? Safety 1st. We're not being selfish or indecent.
@CoryBooker refugees from where? Valid Visa's? Are they on the terror watch list? Who said they were refugees?MORE INFO!!!
@CoryBooker https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-talks-world-leaders-amid-alarm-over-policy-161050467.html …
@CoryBooker Dems should be in the steps of the. Capital as a group, on TV denouncing this.
Yes he did the right thing...Mr. Booker...send them all home...that's why we voted him in!!!!
Bwahahah !  Let's send them home NOW! 

#RefugeesMyAss
If you don't protect your borders & preserve freedom, you no longer have a country, which is what Booker wants!
They are not welcome until we can check their backgrounds
@CoryBooker Make America Hate Again!
this guy is looking for a home Booker, would you lead us by example? I dare you!
Whats your plan Senator? And I'd like to hear something besides the party line. Ideas are power...
Good thing they didn't come looking fo affordable medicine...

#LongMemory
#ReelectionSeasonGunnaSuckForYou
I dont have a problem with this as long as they do what they said. Vet to make sure there are no ties to extreamist groups
where are the democrats! What Donald trump is doing is INSANE! HE IS ACTING LIKE HITLER, OMG!!
Senatorbooker I  believe we put you and your peers in office to control these things, do your job!
@GregAmbrosius you sir are the biggest hypocrite going.
@CoryBooker I'd also have to ask if you are happy creating hysteria for constituents who may not understand?
@CoryBooker I'm sure it's being taken care of as you tweet. Stop hyping this for your political gain.
@CoryBooker please go to JFK to add your voice/presence!
@JimTrotter_NFL Nope. I'll pass
@CoryBooker Not cool! We don't pick and choose! Remember God sees everything Jersey Shore
#OccupyAirports
sorry I don't know who's coming in I'd rather know I'm safe then take a chance
@CoryBooker Amen, Cory Booker!
#FakePresident is putting us at REAL risk! Please fight for us and our values! #preserveprogress #AmericaDoesNotBan #RefugeesWelcome
"because of Donald Trump"?  Cynical distortion. It's because of a perceived threat to security. Can you debate that point?
Show America how much kickback you got from the Pharma Co. you failed to lower their drugs, $380,000 since 2011?
@CoryBooker     @TheDemocrats the DNC needs to be blamed for putting an unelectable candidate against Dumpf..."just saying"
.  Democrats better get some leadership and gets seats back in 2018 to stop this madman.
You forgot flip side...tell that to ones killed around world..ounce prevent = pound cure!
@CoryBooker Enough Tweeting / Talking! What RU in the @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats doing 2 stop lunatic @realDonaldTrump ?
@CoryBooker you really need to shut up
Legal are welcome.. You gonna pay for millions& millions or are you just posturing 4 votes!!
@CoryBooker can a rational governor use the national guard to escort unconstitutionally barred people into our country?
@CoryBooker please get Trump a copy of the Constitution
@CoryBooker so you have a problem with getting a handle on keeping Americans safe. That makes you a bench warmer.
@CoryBooker  where you outraged in 2011 when the refugees from Iraq were stopped for six months.   #Refugeeswelcome
you are way off base but by all means keep it up so to can be dethroned come next election
Your English seems.... very.... how do you say???
Russian??
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Trumpmakes another moronic executive order! Thinks he's a dictator!
What exactly are you doing? People have called, emailed, marched. What more can we do?
Your words mean nothing!  DO something!
, Because of PRESIDENT Trump! It's comments like this is why 1042 democrat seats lost in 2016. Keep up the rhetoric- 2018!!
But we need more than tweets. What are the Dems going to do?
The 9/11 hijackers were not from any country on the list. Educate yourself.
@CoryBooker ACTION, PLEASE. Unclear what "show" means. Please detail actionable items. Thanks for all your efforts..
Call the WH, State Dept, Ryan and McConnells offices.
@CoryBooker Trump's so incompetent, he's embarrassing. Thank you for all you do. Run for president! !
Let's show Americans that POTUS can and is protecting us. Booker is wrong.
@CoryBooker What are you and the other DEMS doing about King Trump? Just bowing down. America need your help. DO SOMETHING!
@CoryBooker This is unconstitutional! He is banning a religion!!
@CoryBooker What do you suggest we do??? Begging here.....
@CoryBooker  @POTUS trumpenfuhrer you STOLE OBAMA's handle - this 1 belongs 2 OBAMA. Get your own. Cheaters NEVER prosper.
@CoryBooker vote no on every one of his nominees please.
@CoryBooker check out live feed of protesters from JFK airport
@CoryBooker Words are great, but waiting for ALL @SenateDems to take ACTION against Trump! The pushback must start NOW!
@CoryBooker please #stopsessions
@CoryBooker it's AMERICA 1st if you can't support that then you need to leave office IT'S AMERICA 1ST PLAIN AN SIMPLE
@CoryBooker eeeping for my country
U know this is about terrorism. You should help people to see that & work harder on an alternative plan to fight terrorism
More worried about refugees than then the prescription medication needs of your own citizens.
@CoryBooker please keep fighting and leading. We need you and will support you.
@CoryBooker #RefugeesDetained
@realDonaldTrump you are making a big mistake, you are discriminating , you are penalising people cause of there religion
@CoryBooker awesome his policies are already working
Identification documents from countries like Syria are extremely unreliable; blocking refugees isn't entirely about religion
@CoryBooker please keep fighting and leading. We desperately need you and will support you.
@CoryBooker Amen #RefugeesWelcome
@CoryBooker Trump makes this now "not our America" and we are far from great!
@CoryBooker does this mean that Canada's Minister of Immigration, Ahmed Hussen, is no longer welcome in the US?
@CoryBooker  what can be done? This is illegal isn't it? I'm counting on you
Do you really represent America?
@JeanSanPach 3 WORDS Senator Booker: STATUE OF LIBERTY  #WithYouCory Thank You for being born. #BuildAWallAroundBLOTUS
@CoryBooker Republicans will never be elected again. Only 1/3 of registered voters voted for Trump. Trump lost popular vote
Hey! You are just another uneducated TROLL. BLOCK
@CoryBooker
@CoryBooker how can we show DT that if he refuses to see?? We need the legislative branch to fight the executive branch.
@CoryBooker how about the Dems stop approving his appointments and introduce impeachment proceedings
@CoryBooker what specific actions(s) would you suggest we take? Tweeting seems inadequate.
@CoryBooker not attacked us in any manner. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan are two of the worst from 9-11 attacks. Educate !
@CoryBooker We're gonna need more from you than a graphic.
We need Congress to find its voice, lead us from the brink and end this blatant racism/ bigotry. We are Muslim!
@CoryBooker Americans are more fearful because of Trumps xenophobic rhetoric. He banned immigrants from countries who Have
I am appalled right now. The hate that has hijacked our country must be stopped. DT & his clan, including the gop, must go!
It is a dark day when America allows its president to blatantly discriminate on the basis of race and religion
@CoryBooker I agree. The more we alienate, and discriminate, the more we potentially give cause hate us.
alt prez DT is a reflection of the GOP. They R using him 2 do their dirty work & plan on him taking the blame.
@CoryBooker @SenatorBaldwin you are our elected officials.  Stop tweeting and find a way to stop this madman!
@CoryBooker Can we get some immigration attorneys to EWR? Law students? These people need our outreach.
Thank you, Senator! Just left message at your office.
Show him what? Tweet trends?
@CoryBooker IMPEACH HIM!
@CoryBooker When Obama stopped immigration for 6mo in 2011, you had no issue...
the DNC needs to be blamed for putting an unelectable candidate against Dumpf..."just saying"
@CoryBooker this is appalling. #resist
What the hell is the matter with Drumpf ? He is acting Demented
@CoryBooker - Please keep speaking and fighting. We need your voice to maintain hope in these dark times.
Pls check into rpts green card holders were handcuffed and questioned abt their views on trump!!!
Yes, but how?  What ACTION can we take?
stop tweeting, get w/ ur cohorts & do something. YOUve voted 4alot of his appointees who enforce his policies. Shut up
@DraftBernie Refugees&prescript'nDrugsFromCanada.UrVoiceIsMute. #OverturnCitizensUnited #ConflictOfInterest #OverturnTheBan
Is anything the Democratic Caucus can do here to stop this execuive order? This is so incredibly horrifying.
95M out of the labour force.50M poverty/8M more than when BO took office.13M more on food stamps when BO took office

#MuslimBan
@fbgchase

@DavidKoechner Im equally concerned about Booker voting against affordable prescription drugs. Lose corp/pharma donations.
Read the room dude.
This horrific President has made us a nation of hate that abandons those in need & our allies. WE MUST STOP HIM
needs to dig deeper into his "Elite Quotes for Dummies" Book.
can't you/senators do something?
@janattheocean Senator Booker, lead a walkout in the Senate. Stand united against this repugnant anti-American decree.
TTR Reply:
@SenBookerOffice @bannerite At least someone is standing up for our country's principles! #DumpTrump #MuslimBan #TheResistence
we need to do more to stop this insanity where is our congress
@bannerite don't you guys need to approve Executive Orders?
@bannerite Thank you Cory Booker!  We need more in Congress to put Country first. You, sir, are a patriot.
Oh, if only the people that caused this showed just a touch of "human decency" it wouldn't be necessary. Sadly, they don't.
@KamalaHarris fed employees shouldn't interpret & act on EOs on own. How to implement should be from dept heads only.
Please keep fighting this, Senator.
No thanks, these people have no documentation. We can't just let anyone into our country
not true. Some are students with green cards. Some refugees have gone through the vetting process already.
Let's show terrorists we will properly VET refugees so terrorists do not slip in with them, as ISIS said they would do.
Bonk, please research refugee vetting procedures already in place.  And, consider who they detained today.

@nadinevdVelde you show him too!
Thank you, Sen. Booker. Are there detainees at Newark? Will you go there?

No offense Senator, but Trump has to go. #impeachTrumpnow
