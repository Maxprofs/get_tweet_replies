but yet you voted against lowering the cost of life saving medications.
U are wrong. I didn't vote against legislation that would have lowered costs. I'm working on legislation however that would
did the fact that you accepted $270K in contributions from pharmaceutical companies influence your vote? #liar
@KathrynKlauer @CoryBooker you're a phony! Big pharm owns you!!

@BernieSanders


I'd like to add...#noBan and #no Bannon!!
you are in the minority sir. More Americans support common sense immigration precautions. What's your agenda?
why do you vote for his nominees? https://oblogdeeoblogda.me/2017/01/29/dear-democratic-party-senators/ …
I wish it was that simple
Il potere del popolo è maggiore anche quando si elegge un presidente???
"Amen"
Republicans need to put this vicious dog on a leash, or a cage better yet euthanize him
please run for 2020
I'd like to support you, but as a NJ resident who has voted for you, after your recent sell-out to the pharma industry, I'm done with you.
you, and all your corporate Dems are the reason we have President Trump. Real Progressives are coming for you.
if purist voters had voted for the good of the country rather than their selfish "conscience," we wouldn't have Trump.
hahaha, oh the "blame the voters" game. If the Elitist hadn't forced the wrong candidate, we wouldn't have Trump.
if you didn't vote for Clinton, you didn't stand up for POC & immigrants when it mattered.
#RestoreTheVRA & address gerrymandering, register Dems & GOTV, local & 50-state strategy, address disinformation & messaging
Good to see all these people can leave their jobs on a Monday morning to attack the President and the US
Sen Booker you are right,
As one of only 100, you have incredible POWER. Use your VOTE to reflect your VALUES at ALL times. 0 exceptions. @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker
He's in Philly today & I was VERY disappointed to hear him say we can't make this about Dems v GOP as I love him. @CoryBooker
this is our problem. And Sherrod brown and Liz Warren voting FOR Ben Carson. WTF!!
Great to see our reps out in the streets with us. Whose streets? Our streets! #elizabethnj #nobannowall
why do you think reposting memes containing no facts ckng means anything?
Fancy feel good words to work up the sheeple. Your just another race-hustler Booker!
I get why the costs for medications is expensive. There are a whole host of issues here.
I was with you Senator, and will continue to be with you.  Make the call for action and I will respond.

Thank you for standing up for our nation's and its ideals!
Help is on the way with President Trump and VP Pence
And yet you have not opposed many nominees.
Protest all you want. Thank God for Donald Trump who is unafraid to stand up for America. @realDonaldTrump
#midterms2018
Yep! That's why Trump won.

Yes and we the people proved that on Election Day. We  @POTUS and we will always win  Suck it up.
Sir, I keep asking all the Senators and Congresspeople who are on here opposing the EO #MuslimBan. What do you propose 2 do about it?

Making a political capital or being well paid for speeches? Likely, both. #MAGA
@teacher_amyrose @CoryBooker Begs the question which people? Which fifty percent makes the calls?

Let's not forget his support of Bain - you aren't going to co-opt out movement corporatist

Now you are starting to understand why Hillary wasn't elected President.
Again, everywhere but New Jersey..!!

Stop taking checks from BigPharma, Cory.  You had so much potential.  Don't sell your soul for a few bucks.
If only

@joanwalsh @CoryBooker until the national guard and military come out.. Protesters brace yourselves. :0( #StopSteveBannon
: Is it Senator? In this Administration? How so? Armed militia?  ...Massive destruction until we can vote out?
Violating constitution,  Fed laws,  Geneva Convention = Impeach Trump and Pence now!
That's true, & that is why @POTUS was elected.  However, the ballot box is always preferred over the streets.
your right,  that's why the PRESIDENT IS DONALD J. TRUMP!!!!!
Yes, and the people chose Trump!! Get over it!
where were the people when voting was on,  didn't he promised this and was voted in???.
want Trump out?  Tell the GOP!

#VoteGOPOut2018
Err, the People elected Trump because they want him in power, not a Dem. You D's got slaughtered nationwide.
