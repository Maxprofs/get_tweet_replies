It cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans and shifts more costs onto working families.
All while allowing insurance companies to charge older Americans much higher premiums & dismantling Medicaid as we know it
As well as ending federal funding for basic preventative health services offered by Planned Parenthood & other reproductive health providers
This proposal would damage our economy and jeopardize the health & financial well-being of millions of Americans.
It’s a betrayal of @POTUS’s promise of ‘great healthcare for much less money’ and 'no cuts' to Medicaid.
I will oppose this legislation every step of the way.
Where's trump's "health care for everybody"?
it is anti-people #MakeAmericaSickAgain
These Republicans have no soul, they are evil!
@CoryBooker stop them
@CoryBooker Stop Lying Senator! I know it's hard for you!
a necessity besides a roof over your head food, clothing and shoes to wear on your feet and a coat to wear when
@CoryBooker Red States don't want healthcare. So Blue States can form a healthcare co-op for Blue States.
My plan on obamacare costs double and covers less! Stop Ryan-Rhino care and go with Trump's plan please.
throw in the towel and let someone that well equipped take over.
long time coming.  It you do not have the Skills and CAPABILITIES of running a COUNTRY it just may be best to
it's cold.  So why keep trying to continue breaking something that eventually will fix itself which was a long
introduce a bill requiring congress to use this plan. No more "entitlements" to premium health ins on tax payers $
@CoryBooker damn Core Y and I thought you could be the hope of the Democratic party. Get with governing .
@CoryBooker because others will get rich. They could care less. We need to b able to prevent their health coverage
Why is it that they are so hell-bent on try to interfere with health coverage one of the most important things
where do I find a copy of the new healthcare bill?
I am older American- how will I be able to pay for my medical insurance- my medicine. Congress needs pay 4 their insurance
@1099rock Let's repeal the repeal bill.
Was this bill written by Paul Ryan and the healthcare companies that paid the GOP Leadership?
@CoryBooker maybe if we we're allowed to read Obama care before it was forced down our throats, we wouldn't be here now.
please fight for better healthcare for all Americans.
That seems clear, very concerned about the Medicare portion, for me but other concerns for all.
@CoryBooker Chaffetz mocked the poor today.  Since when do employees deserve better benefits than their bosses?
how can they keep getting away with this?
@moon15116 just what the people have been asking for
Why don't you actually get behind the president instead of bashing him at every turn...do something useful for once
is it true that the new bill DOESN'T get rid of the mandate? So you still get fined if you don't have insurance?
@CoryBooker stupid lie again by the radical democrats who love to lie to the American people for there own advancement!!!
@CoryBooker . Now your an expert on healt care even before it has been scored. Your talking points are just that.
I am convinced that @GOP wants a Healthcare genocide here in America.. this is the Death Squads many feared before
thank you, Senator. We must fight!
@CoryBooker Sir, that description is as accurate as it is disturbing.
@CoryBooker Actually nothing is worse than Obama Care but when does truth ever matter with the left.
@CoryBooker If only it would happen to those who fell for the con job.
@CoryBooker But Insurance Executives get paid more!
@CoryBooker NJ resident who hated the year we were on Obamacare. It must be replaced. Talk about the cost pitiful.
@CoryBooker wrong! Obamacare benefited 2% of the population at the expense of the rest.  Sunk buninesses, cost families.
@CoryBooker Love the passion...Fight the good fight Sen. Booker..No one's fooled by the GOP!
@CoryBooker if they manage to pass this, can we get a bluestate singlepayer?
@CoryBooker you mean the way the ACA drove up the cost of my family's insurance by 50% over 2 yrs?
@CoryBooker Don't debate this on twitter. Get to the floor & come up with a resolution that serves us better than Obamacare
And do come up with something better than Pelosi's Affordable Affordable Affordable plan. That was a lie!
How many aides did it take to write this thread? Why did you vote against lower drug prices? Why are you silent on #Vault7?
@CoryBooker Atlantic we get to review before approval unlike Obamacare.
@CoryBooker  #TrumpDontCare health plan
@CoryBooker You think the Trumpsters mighty regret their votes finally? #SaveObamacare
All but KKK(Nazis&legally retarded)that would be a HUGE yes Vincent!!
@CoryBooker not a democrat but I agree this bill is a mess
@Woo_Debunker with no indiv mandate and no pre-ex excl, dont buy, wait till sick, pay 30% more for year. System collapses.
@rmasher2 @realDonaldTrump Don the Con is brilliant. His supporters want to pay more and get less. The billionaires love it
I challenge anyone to list how this is better for middle and lower class. Coverage, deductibles, subsidies?
Take it DOWN, Cory! PLEASE!!!
So, how does the average trump voter feel about it? Do they realise what a disaster it is?
@dannalynette Great, President Obama finally got this Country back together and now this President is going to fuck it up !
COMPLETELY
#Trumpcare is an economic disaster..something that will concern GOP conservatives. https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-leaders-brace-for-the-task-ahead-selling-obamacare-lite/2017/03/07/ab2f721e-02e5-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html?utm_term=.9482d9a6eb8e …
for those of us who will be left without insurance what do you recommend?
But it does allow the CEOs of the health insurance companies to keep their $$,$$$,$$$ salaries so that is more important.
2018 is right around the corner we need to use our votes to take back our congress and our democracy it's under siege
SAVE US President Booker!
keep ACA please this is another #TrumpLies
@thegaf just listening to the lies this Secretary is spouting......
Thank you!!!
we need special prosecutor 4 #trumprussia & #notrumpcare shut down gov until we get this. Please
I pay more money for worse insurance now- you mean it'll be worse than what I have now
FIGHT THEM LIKE HELL @SenBookerOffice!!! When their solution to Healthcare is "don't buy an iPhone"...Democrats must fight tooth and nail!!
That's the republican way - screw the lower/middle class, children, seniors & the sick - and make themselves richer!
I'm already getting screwed since ACA took effect, not sure I can take much more
are you in the ACA? I'm trying to figure out how some people "got screwed"
NO but those who aren't have to pay for those that are so my premiums & deductibles went up
my only choice for my family(state ins)before the ACA I was uninsurable. Now I can pay my own way.
great but I can't afford care, so it helped some, it hurt some,has to be common ground somewhere
but other than that, its "amazing."
Is it means-tested at all? Or just younger pay less, older pay more across the board, irrespective of income?
Yup. It sucks. It is a lie. The Ryan Plan has been online for a while and was an obvious lie. We are going back to the 80s
I have an idea,how about you take away ALL Senate's healthcare until EVERY DAMN AMERICAN is covered with YOUR golden plan?
.@SenBookerOffice thanks for speaking out! Please don't let the .@GOP do this!
It's as if these people(GOP) don't have ethics, morals, or families. I don't understand.
we must stop this. Shut down gov.
.@SenBookerOffice You mean pay the normal price for what a bronze plan would be? So shocked over here, not.
