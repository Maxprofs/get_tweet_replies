While the world is still watching, why not reach out to @AprilDRyan  & let her get back to the WH w/ a date?
prob bc it's not her responsibility to set it up. She is not paid to do that.
Of course that's not her job! No way am I implying that. But she has the power to
she actually doesn't. His camp controls the meetings he will take/get denied.
And ALL will witness if a WH reporter goes out of her way, sets it up, & he refuses
I think the point is, she shouldn't have to, he should be speaking to them
not sure she could if she wanted, as she is a journalist and not a member of CBC or his majesty's staff.
You're probably right, but we need more than hope these days. It's so discouraging.
That  wasn't a letter that  was a list of grievances which is all you know how to do - cry POOR US
I doubt that you read the well written letter. Your IQ and ignorance doesn't allow it
i have more brains in my little toe than your entire family tree
you're still negating all facts. I don't know why I lead myself to believe I would have logical debates with drumfsters
. First you  attack my intelligence and now call me names yet you want dialogue ? okay.
well I assumed you didn't because of your aforementioned statement about a well written letter
.  It was a well written letter for sure just a bunch of grievances as usual
one that definitely stood out was the fact trump donated thousands to put innocent minority teens behind bars
@zarahzohlman @realDonaldTrump He doesn't read, so he asked that polite black lady to set up the meeting. Gotta be her fault.
too many words, too few maps.
no bullet points
I love your profile pic.
Its your fault @OfficialCBC that @realDonaldTrump didn't answer you, he can't read that many words.
Bam!
why a letter? Pick up the damn phone like u have some common sense and set up a date to talk to the man
He clearly said your rep in Washington, Cummings stalling meeting for fear of political reprisals!
@womensmarch @realDonaldTrump TRUMP - YOU ARE A LIAR & ASSOCIATE/HIRE KNOWN NAZIS. YOU DONT DESERVE TO BE 45. YOU SHOULD QUIT!!
A letter? I hope it wasn't through US Mail
The CBC seems to be out of touch with the general American black population.
Elbert Guillory: "Why I Am a Republican"
AD SAd Sad bunch of anti Black, anti America, cesspool of idiots ! JOBS for Black America is what's Needed
.@OfficialCBC @realDonaldTrump http://bit.ly/2kD6FhQ  #waiting #BHM
The call for charter schools by the CBC drowns out the need 4 the masses of Black children who desperately need public schools.
.@OfficialCBC That's a 5 page letter, you can't expect him to have already had time to read the whole thing. @realDonaldTrump
Televised hearings on abuses/exploit'ns+predatory practices/patterns impact AAs+poorWhites @PBS  @MSNBC  @CNN  @newsonenow @BET
@HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump CBC call that reporter and have her set up a meeting.  Apparently that's how it's done#resist!
there's your problem. Too many pages. Needs less words. More graphs and maps.
Terrible, terrible presentation. They need a marcom person.
he called did you guys not hear what he said he has called a number of times no return calls.
Maybe the letter could have been written better?
but he met with various black congressmen over the time.
I'd like to know as a black citizen WTH #CBC agenda is for me and mine. Will

How many Black votes will b lost due to Ellison's loss as DNC Chair; this smacks of the same marginalization of Maynard Jackson
For a sec I thought the Canadian Broadcast Corp wrote Trump. NOW I'm stuck thinking about the Friendly Giant
So-call potus didn't even kno who the CBC was, April quickly bailed him out
AND DIDN'T HIS LYING ASS MOUTH JUST SAY YOU GUYS WOULDN'T RETURN HIS CALLS? HE MAKE ME SO VERY CRAZY!
what do you say now? Maybe you need @foxandfriends to read the letter to you?
this is just too wonderful!
you think he has time to respond to every letter he gets, he's probably swamped with work
so quit trying to stir up something with this tweet, and letting the snoflakes have a field day
all you're doing is allowing the Mainstream Media produce more fake news of him ignoring people
when in fact he probably has way more important things to-do then responding to every letter he gets
Trump's work is to meet with Congressional Reps. That's how it works in USA. What country are you from? Does it begin w an R?
Did Trump ever meet with you? I'm just curious.
I wonder if the “@potus” wants the fake news media to set a meeting with the @OfficialCBC? @realDonaldTrump
Hi, @realDonaldTrump. We’re the CBC. We sent you a letter on January 19, but you never wrote us back. Sad! Letter: http://bit.ly/2kD6FhQ 
Is there a Congressional White Caucus?
he does not read
you expect @realDonaldTrump to be able to read that many words? Without pictures?
can't write back~ran out of pens signing bigly executive orders. Can't find office supplies SAD
think he had to prioritize some things...wait your turn

Because you put yourself on in with the Crazy Clintons .  You are now irrelevant.
.@OfficialCBC .@realDonaldTrump good effort. But you know he cant read....
what you want is to cause problems for the Prez because hes white,thats all its been with the CBC, ur Racists
Orange reply: TL;DR.
@almostjingo @realDonaldTrump he's only been in office for a few weeks; it might take him a minute to reply.
it also isn't an invite to meet, says to work with Thompson and homeland security.
President only a few blocks away! Get off Your ass & go there! He invited U !
@potus Letter too long for you to read so have your assistant read it to you a couple of times
maybe it should have been a picture book with colors instead of a letter. Smh......
Yet Maxine Waters just said she won't meet with the president, so stop whining.
The Prez never answered because the letter is too long! 5 pages? With no pictures, charts or cartoons?
The CBC's letter sent 2 President Trump, citing charter schools as their 1st issue is strange; public schools teach more Blacks
.@OfficialCBC So, where you at @POTUS  (btw: this is a GIF of Michael Jackson, not Frederick Douglass or Martin Luther King, Jr.)

It took Obama a full year to meet w/ Congressional Black Caucus after his inauguration.

Maybe give Trump the same courtesy you gave Obama? …
"my sincre hope that u will accpt
this invitation 2 engage n an earnest effort 2 wrk 2gether on these issues"
He ignored the letter from President’s Advisory Commission on Asian American Pacific Islanders too.
Is this a real thing? How is this man for all Americans?!? #WhereIsMyCountry
Umm If he's a man for all Americans, he should ignore these racist special interest groups, duh.  Are you people really this stupid?
CBC....decades of your expertise as you ask Trump to tap into is the reason Black communities r where they r

It's been over a week. Any word from @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ?
Some times the CBC says the same thing again and again,never the 90% of robberies by 12 % of the nations blacks population.

How about working a crime solution instead of blaming whites for once...
Where did you send it? The White house? He wasn't @POTUS then! Talk about SAD! More FAKW NEWS!!
because potus thinks you're a racist joke like most Americans.
I think I'm laughing but I might be crying. Let me check on that and get back to you.
I've been asking myself if I'm laughing or crying for months now
.@OfficialCBC @realDonaldTrump You sent him a policy paper and asked to work together. He said he asked for a meeting w/Cummings. Did he?
it's called correspondence...
probably tossed it because it didn't have any pictures. "Sad!"
Trump was not president on the 19th. Obama trying to undermine Trump again?
Perhaps @realDonaldTrump doesn't think Congress should divide itself along racial lines. @MiaBLove @SheriffClarke
Watch + Study Part 2 of the Hon. Min. @LouisFarrakhan's Saviours' Day address! 
https://youtu.be/XSaMd-0uUhw 
That's not a letter. That's a dissertation. Why not put a cover letter with the proposed agenda for meeting.
instead of joining the mob against the president for illogical reasons, help him help those u represent.
Seriously?  #inaug2017 was January 20. Did you seriously think YOUR meeting would trump cabinet appointments? #getoveryourself
Hey! No wonder! It's more than 140 characters.
douchenozzle thought it was from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
perhaps you can join him this weekend at the Winter Whitehouse
You should hire competent advisors to cover your ignorance & incompetence Mr. President.
--in all fairness to the so-called prez, omarosa is his black experience and he has no idea what a caucus is.
If this man has an open mouth and not AT the time dead, he's lying about something.
fortunately, @realDonaldTrump invited you for the world to see. Dry your eyes,you got your ball back& its is in your court
just know that @realDonaldTrump won't be prepared for your meeting because your letter is too long to hold his attention.
can you please provide proof that the letter was sent? I have people telling me this is fake news. Do you have a receipt?
I bet he didn't read it because there were too many words. You should have sent one page with a few bullets.
*slow clap* Well played, y'all, well played!
No wonder Trump didn't reply there are no pictures! Far too many words! One or two syllable words only please
He didn't know who you were.
You know he wasn't president yet, right? He was sworn in on Jan 20th, not the 19th. JS
Your mistake was making it too long. He has no attention span. 1 double spaced paragraph would be appreciated.
y'all need to be doing something about Chicago that's what y'all need to worry about.
Pretty sure that was way too many words. Should have been no more than six bullet points, double spaced.
Pretty sure you will hear back now that you have used Twitter instead of snail mail. Great to work together!!
Trump reached out. CBC insulted him. With AfrAmer reps like this AfrAmer's are doomed.
.@OfficialCBC @realDonaldTrump that's because it's sitting on President Bannon's desk.  #itmfa #RESISTANCE
But there were so many big words! Gotta follow the "See Donald Ignore. Ignore, Donald, Ignore" format.
was it addressed to Bannon? That would explain a lot
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump lies. Should have wrote it in crayon, single page.
Try writing it in crayon and with BIG letters, Trump is a special little boy.
you all know good and well the president likes bullet points.
Y'all said y'all not going to meet with him, and now y'all want him to write y'all back. Smh y'all in the back of the line now
Maybe you should dumb it down to a level he can understand: use pictures instead.
5 pages and hardly any illustrations. Tsk tsk.
Donald, you know all black people dont know each other, right? #resist #ImpeachTrump
1) We don't know it was sent 2) You weren't willing to attend the inauguration 3) You've made no effort 2 meet
Your mistake was thinking he's capable of reading all those words.
This tweet was in response to Trump's press conference. It really gave me a good laugh!
I think we found the next teaching moment for Donald: there are black representatives in Congress. #resist
@NaniLinda01 @realDonaldTrump are you sure you affixed the proper postage to your letter?
Sorry, that letter is more than one page and is single spaced. And contains no maps.
thank goodness that reporter was able to get you in touch with @realDonaldTrump - whew.
If all your experience is so great why does it just keep getting worse?
@UncleRUSH @realDonaldTrump He can barely read. That's why today, he didn't even know what the CBC was. Sad!
Maybe he's waiting for an AA journalist to explain the letter to him. He seems to have trouble with that.
As a biracial from the hood you don't speak for me. You've NEVER been where I've been. You are the epitome of #privilegedBlacks
probably should have tweeted it
@BigGhostLtd @realDonaldTrump the fonts to small and no hand drawn pictures no wonder he didn't respond.
@amjoyshow @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should have picked up the phone. Quicker that way.
such a loser.
Apologies, you were too eloquent in your letter. Smaller words next time may help or sticking to Twitter type short bursts.
so, it's not the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/CBC @CBCNews 
who knew you guys shared so many letters?
Well now I don't feel so bad for signing a petition to impeach his assfor life of America !
big league
Unfortunately, the letter had too many words and not enough pictures and graphs. He never read it. Sad
I am sure he has more important things to do.
Yes, and he asked for a meeting .
Well, are you going to meet with POTUS or- keep stalling ?
I'd re-write it on Breitbart letterhead, condense it to 5 bullet points and try not to use such bigly words.
Should have addressed it to Fred Douglass? I heard that this month he is getting more and more.  Not sure what
...with crime and poor education. Yet you want to continue with the same policies? And, of course, anybody...
And did he say "your people." He is clueless. And he didn't know what CBC stood for.
if you're looking for a response from the big orange here try using less words and more colors, maybe crayons
Thank you for your representation, eloquence & integrity in organization! A lesson to be learned @realDonaldTrump SAD!
you should have made this letter into a commercial and ran it on Fox & Friends
I guess he needed a black person to make the introductions. Because all black People know each other, right?
So your mistake was sending an entire letter. This president can only read 140 characters at a time. #Sad
a letter?! Hi, it's 2017, try an e-mail! Or next time pony express...lmao.
well he did talk to kanye.  That had to count for something right?
@robreiner @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately I doubt he could pay attention long enough to read the letter.
.@OfficialCBC Perhaps Omarosa can set up that meeting...after you finish bowing down, of course.
We had black president for 8 years,DID HE GET A LETTER?Give me a break!Get in line, Obama left country a mess!
if ANY CBC member who is against mtg w/POTUS should leave their seat! ur not repping ur district..
Maybe you could turn it 
into a song and have @MormonTabChoir sing it as it's clear @realDonaldTrump cant read. #notmypresident
if you read the letter it sounds like the 2 parties values align
drumpf doesn't do letters. Only tweets.  Sorry. Attention span too short.
You should've sent the Crib Notes . You know he can't read that long ass letter.
to respond he'd have to be an actual President, and not just a Treasonous Agent Orange Imposter in chief #Sad
Why respond to a bunch of babies boycotting his inauguration.........for NO REASON
DJT

Just think how much these folks could help you!
Chalk up another untruth from the president.
You can't expect a president with a 5th grade reading level to understand your letter.But perfect twitter post
That letter is asking for a book size response and I didn't see a face to face meeting request.
I am surprised we havent been " told" that this CBC document is not real that this is Fake CBC Agenda.

Looks more like a list of demands than an invitation to work together. Refused to attend inauguration!! Rude
