Why did Dems push Obamacare when 10 million lost their insurance plan & doctors? I'm still waiting for my $2500 in savings.
you are right! I've got an idea...move to Russia
@SenBookerOffice @BrookingsInst Don't back off! If u need America to march...to yell...to resist...we will!!
Hmmmm only amounts to half of the people here illegally .
Stop Lying! Why won't you say Brooking is a Left Winh Think Tank with Bill Clinton best friend? You Lie and should resign
I'm not wealthy and it looks like I'll get a tax break!
if you ACTUALLY cared about the health of Americans, you would stand up to big pharma! #BEREALORBEGONE
Why aren't u & the others working w/ them 2 find a solution 4 all. It's what we pay you for.. Not obstruction
says the guy who takes money from big pharma and blocks people from cheap Canada prescriptions.
@meggalynx @BrookingsInst Trumpcare is the GOP's  "final solution" for the poor & elderly. #resist
Obama was like a thief stealing from the wealthy to pay for insurance of the poor. Redistribution is antiamerican
the Kaiser Fdn Report puts it in even starker terms: the bill wages war on the very ppl who supported Trump
hey Booker. Question. Of those 15M Americans, exactly what estimate was made of how many will lose coverage wen ACA collapses?
Then let's talk about and fix the issues in Obamacare. I'm tired of the fighting, we need solutions
please help. I have no clue what you are trying to say.
Thank you for the insult, as compared to respectful statement ei "it was meant as sarcasm." Very kind of you.*sardonic*
Ah. All I need to know. Thank you.
At least 15M. THOUSANDS will annually.  But give a tax break to the rich - that's all that matters to the @GOP
Your not someone who should talk Cory.
You voted against a bill that would have given us cheaper prescriptions.
Wouldn't have been so bad 'cept you personally made sure families couldn't get their meds cheaper from  F U!
& to prove their conservative pos that govt involvement in supporting health care is a path to failure (even if it's not).
Because they're for the wealthy! He went into these rural areas w) promises &  these people are going to lose HC!
#Trump is a Con artist. He sold his supporters a dream & they will TOO, get burnt in the end...just as the rest of us #SMH @realDonaldTrump
A dream indeed!its terrible what he's doing inside the US & abroad!
no worse than that useless Obama did
Exactly. ACA was Obamas greatest accomplishment. If you call horrible healthcare an accomplishment
- you mean the taxes not in place until Obamacare and still added $10 TRILLION to debt.  Well done Democrats !!
boohoo rich people this rich people that. GOP is pushing it because ACA is horrible. Duh
15 million people who didn't want insurance in the first place
@RetiredCo857 @BrookingsInst a Washington think tank and a pharmaceutical enabler lying about health care to scare poor people.
DJT keeps all busy w bills, R's don't notice he is playing them by giving in2 their agenda 2 keep his agenda @bay
Repeal the healthcare congress receives & replace it with the plan the Repubs are trying to force on Americans!!
That's what they do. It seems to be the basis of every policy they have.
tax cuts to the wealthy causes recession NOT jobs.  Get money out of Washington to get fair laws for all.
if you Dems would have stood up when ACA was written we wouldn't have been in this mess
so let's create plan for blue states to adopt red states. - I'm in Cory's district - let's adopt West Virginia.
Excellent point, good sir.
When you have Sec. Price on the morning shows saying CBO analysis means squat, that's why.
#ACA saved my eyes and I did not go bancrupt.
and if Obama care was that good why did they have to make a law that you had to have it
Free healthcare isn't really free Stop all govt subsidies on health insurance
Just proves that the GOP doesn't care!
#TrumpCareLess
They have coverage but can't use it. Obamacare is useless. Paying $20k before it kicks in isn't helpful. Nocare !
No to Ryans!
so they can put out something slightly less shity than this and his base will feel like they've been given a gift
Yes, because his followers are a bunch of idiots.
Booker what have you done for New Jersey's health care nothing you just running your mouth on trumps healthcare
we all know you're showboating for a run in 2020 booker. Save it dude. No chance in hell you'll be pres.Fakenews
fake news booker get with the program
Stop pretending you really care about the every day citizen. You voted against Bernie's bill to lower RX orices b/ of your pharma donors.
@littlestduck68 @BrookingsInst Government has no business being involved in healthcare. Govt ruins just about everything.
#BECAUSE REPUBLICANS LIE AND ONLY CARE ABOUT THE RICH
Hence the reason 4 attaching "nightmares&disaster" 2 Obamacare 2fool their minions they R  Ing out 4 them. Disgraceful @VP
Call it Republicare. When this fails, the GOP will blame Trump. This is on ALL of the GOP.
The GOP answer to wealth inequality is to make it worse.
Why are Trumpsters not learning about the harm and how do u get the word out? Ur gonna have to do Fox news!
tell me why did OBAMA push a lot of laws directives to 2017 so he would be gone
Sen. Isakson lying about tax consequences of repeal. Audio on website 3/9 town hall 3 min mark
Obamacare &Trumpcare are insurance schemes. Can we just have universal health care, like everyone else?!
why are you not working together on healthcare for the people it is not a R or D issue
all you Democrats talk about people that are gonna be losing your health care you don't know this false talk
@SallyAlbright @BrookingsInst the Ryan plan would also substantially raise rates for the most needy.
If this bill is passed, the Democrats will barely have to spend a dime to defeat GOP in 2018/20
@EuphoricEuler @BrookingsInst also, Ryan, Mercer & more  have millions invested in HC.
@GeriBAnderson @BrookingsInst Let's start demonizing the corporate welfare kings the way they demonize the little guy.
That's when things will change.
We the people can't fight when Democrats  like you are part of the problem.
thank you again for your support for the ACA. Vigilance!
@Cie2011 @BrookingsInst Cory, why are so many republicans ignoring the blatant criminal acts of the trump admin?
because they have put Party over Country so they are traitors too. IMHO
My daughter & I are under Medicaid Expansion & husband on Medicare. We are afraid to lose insurance! 
why don't they replace it with the same tax payer funded insurance they enjoy it's good enough for them
GOP isn't considering the potential bankruptcy of our medical system nationwide.
fake news
follow the money. Always.
insurance? You mean government handout that the middle class pays for. #entitlement
And the HR 1313 employers would have the right to demand DNA testing? On what Planet is that OKAY?
We too want Universal Health care. Get those Campaign contributions ELSEWHERE
This bill is Genocide (strong word) to the elderly and the poor. We are an Industrialized nation
Asbestos poisoning? Sex harassment? Workplace injury? Too bad, says Republicans.
Please Revisit Universal Health Care. Health care is not a place for unbridled capitalism.
we need a registry to keep track of deaths by the GOP.  Just tracking insurance issue and that they passed away.
I can't sleep again tonight I am so worried about losing my health care...barely surviving #ptsdsurvivor #saveACA
I wonder if it's because the people losing insurance can't afford to buy enough lawmakers?
Call it #GOPCare or #Republicare. Make the @GOP own it.
@SenBookerOffice @BrookingsInst GOP law makers are doing a good job of proving government is the problem, not the answer.
MAKE THE RICH RICHER AND TO HELL WITH REAL AMERICANS, THE ONES WHO MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT.
The GOP hate the taxpaying citizens of the US. But if we die, who will pay your salaries?  Think 2018!
@bravenak @BrookingsInst they are evil.
Yes keep calling it Trumpcare.....except he doesn't.
because it gives money to the people who give them money……
the government isn't a game, the people aren't "fans" stop the lies and do your job!!! Obama care was awful!!!
Help Us!
@almost_jane @BrookingsInst Don't let the news cycle pass trumps "proof of wire tap" keep asking for proof.Don wants it togoaway
@almost_jane @BrookingsInst please keep up the question to trump re: any proof of the wiretaps!Trumps waiting out this storm ASK
the GOB only cares about the top .01%. A bunch of sociopaths
@SenBookerOffice @BrookingsInst I have written to my NJ congressman McCarthy, and he doesn't give a rats ass!He is a trump sheep
:(
1. Lobbyists
2. Padded pockets
3. Kick backs
4. If they support trump, they r traitors like him
@SenBookerOffice @BrookingsInst also when can we work with Canada to lower medication costs?
And ACA is falling apart... What's your DETAILED plan Senator... I am a constituant...
I guess the GOP will say but the have access.
the truth is that republicans don't believe the government should provide health care.
exactly they wer fine with poor people not having health care & insured people going bankrupt over health bills
My question to republican voters is why they voted for them? Republican do nothing for these forgotten people.
@SenBookerOffice @BrookingsInst  end tax related health insurance mandate Folks paying tax cant afford fraudsters REAL ID Comply
@SenBookerOffice @BrookingsInst because they dont care. I pay into it but its an entitlement?
So you have the inside track? Last I heard CBO wasn't due until Monday.
@SenBookerOffice @BrookingsInst because no one can stop them 
I like you Mr Booker, but let's just wait for the actual report. No need to stoop to Trumps level
@DemsTalk @BrookingsInst how do they sleep at night! Most corrupt gov't of all time!
. Trump are is a misnomer. It should be called Drumpf no are.
. No care.
. @CoryBooker @BrookingsInst Healthcare is everyone's right. Repealing ACA all to lower taxes for the rich would be unconscionable.
those estimates have zero basis. 1/3 of the act is written so far. That is a 100% lie
This scares me.
GOP morally corrupt.   By colluding with Bannon/Trump they will destroy this country.
Brookings is a liberal organization. Move along.
they are selfish and just don't care and yet they have supporters.  I don't understand.
we should call it the #DespicableCareAct. It's disgraceful!
Disgusting! GOP doesn't care about the majority of those that voted for Trump...only the wealthiest Americans.@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst
bc many more LOST their health coverage w/Obamacare. This mess is on your hands
What's the Democrats plan to block this and to get the truth out to Americans? The US needs effective opposition
He does not care.  I am sure you get than Senator.
always have & always will help out their friends & self. No1 else matters 2 them except when they need your vote!
Honorable Senator Booker: Jared Kushner is de facto Deputy Secretary of State absent Tillerson. 5 USC 3110.
That ship has sailed.
What actionable #ValueProposition can the @DNC put forth for 2018 & 2020? 
No allowed
via a horrible method it might mean 15mil newly invigorated voters who will be more careful with their vote next election cycle
Yes..great point!!
It's always about the money with the GOP.
they are capitalist at  they don't care about ppl, they care about making $$$
anything that helps the Least of us, they sabotage. MEDICAD, MEDICARE,ACA,UNIONS, Etc
welfare, hesdstart, they take away tax credits that help MC, I can go on and on
@aheffne how do we communicate this data in a way that is meaningful to those it is going to affect: Trump Supporters. #TownHall
Good question.  Some still wouldn't get it no matter the method of delivery. Some are just THAT far gone.
What hurts is you're trying to make it so.  Keep talking neg to people and they'll react that way.  Be Pos.
ryan said wealthy tax cuts in plan not big deal.  Really????
...or 100% pay higher perscriptions because you are taking money from big pharma  #hypocrite
why r seeing something different then everyone else ?
This is a real slap to the face of American peoplr
Why is the GOP pushing Trumpcare? Because "if you like your plan, you can keep your plan". Liar.
playbook reply. Tell half the story. Scare people. Top 1%. You used to be original
Can we talk Big Pharma while we're at it?
This is where you drive me nuts. U seem like such an honest politician sometimes. Then this - catch phrases & bs
just attack it on issues & offer ways to improve. Not lies like "tax cuts on the rich". You're better than that.
what about tillerson and his lack of transparency. What can be done? @StateDept
@Hesiod2k11 @BrookingsInst GOP pushing healthcare. Why pure hate of PBO. Not caring about  American ppl. Just hurry & repeal
HOW MANY JOBS WILL BE LOST DUE TO RETAILERS CLOSING OR GOING OUT OF BUSINESS
just trying to make wealthy wealthier and line the pockets of insurance companies!
Please call it what it is #swampcare
. @CoryBooker please keep calling out @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr as they try to steal from healthcare from poor!!
And? Even that is only 1% of entire population. Completely speculated #'s. Plan is still being negotiated.
why are you in office. Same question applies
They dont know that for a fact. Even if it were to happen, its less catastrophic than when OC implodes!
Didn't a large number of folks loose their coverage with Obama care? I know my daughter who was a student.
#Trumpcare
middle class won't have to pay for them 15 million now.let them buy their own ins.
C'mon Cory, you're in the know. The GOP doesn't care one bit about the middle class or below. It's a rich boy club #notmychoice
cory cory be quiet
I agree that it is better to crash & burn on its own. Then we will know who to blame.
Yes why are you supporting this? @USRepRodney
Trump and his alternative facts minions are flooding the airways. We need more aggressive messaging pls!
Trump doesn't care! He's here to help his wealthy comrades! All we need is one brave soul to step up!
ABOUND!! DISGUSTING
We need persistent messaging on healthcare, especially before Trumpcare dies. Show specific GOP's assaults on ACA
.@CoryBooker Thank you for your efforts in fighting the Trumpcare bill.
Me thinks corey didn't do his research lol
Uhoh again
Thank you for fighting against this, Cory!
stop your silly partisan games. Put forth your own proposal that works, ACA doesn't. #partisangames
it's all Medicaid. Unsustainable anyway.
7 MILLION LOST IT WITH OBAMACARE
Cory, you're one of my representative and you work with others from NJ, please oppose this!!
Oops corrupt brookings maybe booker should use someone else.
nice to see S/O 4 @elizabethforma & know @BrookingsInst for 100yrs is still trying to help society like liberals!
CBO Schmee BO. Silly numbers.
GOP strategy under Trump is clearly to lie whenever it suits their goal.
You nailed it.
#Trumpcare?  More like #TrumpDoesntCare
Call it what it is... #Trumpocide - the genocide of the American people
Maybe if u used a non biased company instead of one who focus on global inst of National oh wait brookings sup Quatar the home of taliban
DEMs have over-taxed Americans forever. Not raising citizen's taxes/costs/fees in fixing ACA is the ONLY option.
.@CoryBooker .@BrookingsInst what would .@SenateDems propose to repair ACA? Go on the offensive!  That's why y'all lost! Let's win!
@Jdgbert @BrookingsInst @ACLU @AFLCIO @shannoncoulter Trump/Ryan: Care-to-Die?
No one cared when we lost our coverage under Obama Care.
Too bad for @SpeakerRyan this came out before he could get it railroaded thru Congress.
Wait for CBO estimates, you could be wrong. Talking points.
those trump voters are gonna be pissed, but they deserve it  #trumpdontcare #insurancefraud
same with Democrats,who you think is paying for the poor, working middle class
