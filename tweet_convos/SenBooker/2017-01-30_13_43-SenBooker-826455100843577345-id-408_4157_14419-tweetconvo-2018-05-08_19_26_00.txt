The law is clear. The #MuslimBan is illegal. I will introduce a bill this week to immediately overturn this dangerous, hateful order.
keep resisting. you guys are on the front lines for the rest of us and we are counting on you.
Cory Booker voted for Rex Tillerson! He is a neoliberal funded by Wall Street not a progressive!
Oh Cory! say it aint so. Did you sell us out?
he also voted against Bernie's healthcare bill http://tinyurl.com/jxyadqz  follow Booker's money
GASP! This is what happens with the new POTUS is such a disaster. I can only follow so much
friends on FB touting him and he's actually terrible. DNC needs to clean up. Not ok. Xx
hey "not-so-brights", it's NOT a Muslim ban, it's simply a pause until we can vet better. Muslims still welcome.
Thank you, @CoryBooker @ChrisMurphyCT for your fearless leadership.
Thank you!
Waste of time and money. Taxpayer money. Nothing illegal about it. And it's not a ban. Temp freeze to improve vetting procedures.
How to improve an existing 18 month vetting system? 0 refugee terrorist attacks so far.
so far. Let's keep it that way. And it was 109 people out of 325000 or something.
Agreed to keep it as it already was. 1 is too many. 20 hours with no food for kids?
The more I hear you talk ,the sicker I get. Do your history, Americans do. Your disappointing to your office.
you're
@SenBookerOffice @ChrisMurphyCT Cory please run for president
Thank you, both, for upholding true American values!
thank you!! #NoBanNoWall
not so....where does Isis come from??
u r ridiculous not a Muslim ban sick of bullsh*t politics as usual How about standing up to protect All Americans
My daughter's friend was denied a visa 2day in Amman to visit us with a JORDANIAN psprt. 7 countries? #muslimban
Do not waver, Senators!
thank you! Keep up the good work!
Thank you both for standing up
Funny(weird), you both supported Obama's Iraqi ban? Is being two-faced a requirement for a Demonicrat Senator?
the liars of America keep trying!!
And we are PROUD of you !
can we get this ball rolling?
your Bill will be dead before it reaches POTUS- why waste tax dollars for your own political gain
#dreamteam #RESISTANCE
thank you for fighting for us 
Hmm... Booker/Murphy 2020??  Make America Care again!!
or Murphy/Booker  Both are a huge step forward from where we are now!
The muslims have got to go. I'm sick of them contaminating America!!
Thank you!
Thank you is too weak of a response. You have given me  hope that we may get our USA back for all the people.
thank you both.
@lynn812 @ChrisMurphyCT Eu will be with y !
How is it a ban when Muslim's are still coming in the country ??
Too bad you lost most of us, Cory, by downvoting Bernies Pharma Price Regulations like a damn Republican.
yes
We need the support & information of the Muslim communities in the US. Ban destroys trust, separates families.SAD
this is all political grandstanding because you got your busts kicked.and if you keep it up it will happen again.
thank you for your response to this issue.
A total self-serving looser.
thank you
@SenBookerOffice @ChrisMurphyCT I can't thank you both enough we are proud to have you as our voice #NoBanNoWall #Donttrusttrump
@SenBookerOffice @ChrisMurphyCT Did u confront Pres. Obama? It was his admin that identif these countries as regions of terror?
Thank you!
we are with you keep pushing back
Cory and Chris, u need to live over there with them and see how well u do against the radicals
Thanks for the effort, even though I'm sure you know the bill is DoA at least in the House.
good for you. We must stop the #SteveBannonPresidency and Impeach Putin's sleeper.
Will be looking for you on the 2020 presidential ballot!! #BookerforPresident
You voted for it under Obama.
Thank you!  Also start filibustering future bills!  No justice, no bills!
we the people demand that you stand and fight this insanity, do not roll over and take this. We need YOU.
you two need to rally the people in congress to oppose this outrageous bullshit happening right now. Stand up.
great to the BoBs
it is not a Muslim ban.  If it was India would be on the list
I listen to you on C-Span last night you make absolutely no you make absolutely no sense
please tell me exactly how the ban is unconstitutional, in detail
I'm a Connecticut resident from the New Haven area. proud to have @ChrisMurphyCT in the Senate fighting the good fight.
what is the bill number?
both of you must be on drugs. This is not a Muslim ban. #getonboard. Tell the truth
What about Bannon? What can you do to protect us from Bannon? And fast, please!
ARE U DENSE? What Moslem ban? The ban is directed at nations under terrorist turmoil. DON'T U WANT to protect us?
You are an A+ Cory Booker.  You have my vote in 2020.
Your judgement is surpassed only by your math skills.
You know, there are other Muslim countries which there isn't a ban.
and while your at it maybe cosponsor a bill with sanders to import cheaper and safer Canadian prescription drugs
thank you both!!
It does not break the law. Read US Code 1182 and get informed!
GODSPEED & GOOD HUNTING
Thank you Cory we need to be a pain in their side on every turn they make.
.  Mr. Booker keep up the good work.Don't let T exhaust American ppl with chaos.
Thank you from Oz.
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio 
@SenFeinstein
No longer Ds vs Rs. We have a Republic if we can keep it
both of you are Libiots
@WYVeteran @ChrisMurphyCT then impeach him.
do it! Band together and raise your voices. We need strong dems fighting for us. Now!
@thepoliticalcat @ChrisMurphyCT Now how about Trump's impeachment?
@WYVeteran @ChrisMurphyCT So proud of Cory Booker & Senator Murphy Booker 2020
Citizens can peacefully protest, march, write letters and call-we need leaders to be heroes now. We won't forget
too bad you voted against amendment to allow importing cheaper prescriptions from Canada You could have been a POTUS contender
GO back to school. Not illegal (8 USC 1182(f)
how about supporting a bill that allows cheaper drugs into the country Cory. Fuck you're such a hypocrite
it's not a Muslim Ban Booker you are lying to you gullible constituents. Know you history young man!!
how about introducing a bill to impeach DJT? He's sky unfit to serve.
Funny how division grows in USA over MidEast countries which don't give a damn about each other, hate rules there
I think Murphy dhould go back to law school and study Constitutional law. Maybe, he'll learn something this time.
@Basterds_Fight @ChrisMurphyCT Thank you Senators.  Start drafting articles of impeachment while you're at it. Fire at will.
not hateful, not dangerous. Just doing what we elected him to do. Be proactive....
thank you, gentleman!  #WeStandTogether
Two clowns who think they have a chance at a run in 2020!
if the law is clear why do you need another bill?
@ddemaiosmith @ChrisMurphyCT Is that the same Cory Booker who gets $$$ from big pharma and sold us down the river?
ignorance like this is what got Trump elected.  Try to please for votes it won't work
WTG @CoryBooker and @ChrisMurphyCT !
Is this different than Feinstein bill? https://twitter.com/davidmillerj/status/826205285912023041 â€¦
don't stop here! #impeach
can we start a new hashtag? How about #MoreThanaPhotoOp. Thank you both for working tirelessly to #KeepAmericaGr8
Sooner is best!!
thank you for supporting my Senator @ChrisMurphyCT ...you guys are like the new Obama & Biden
Apparently you Dirty Dems don't read 4 comprehension. There is no mention of Muslim Ban. Get UR shit together!
need to slow or vote no on his cabinet picks
Impeach Trump and Pence 4 Violating 1st Amendment,  Fed Laws,  Fed Judges orders NOW!
was that done 8 urs ago
@terrysuesweeten @ChrisMurphyCT now start impeachment proceedings #MrBooker. Or is the @GOP too compromised?
What a waste of time! The 90 day Moratorium re FAILED states & it's legal. Obama had a 6 month Iraqi ban.
We cant let this distract from investigating Trump working with Russia hacking the election #PuppetPresident #IllegitimateTrump
totally admire you, Sen. Booker. I'm from Louisiana, and I can't reach our Senators. Thank you.
1492 TERRORISTS LANDED ,ROBBED PEOPLE OF THEIR LANDS. YOU ARE NOT FROM THIS COUNTRY,LEAVE. WE SUPPORT THE BAN.
how about sponsoring a bill that helps Americans
Excellent. No one is above the law. No one.   Thank you for leading the cause!
Thank you, Senators!
Thank you Senator Booker. You are making us proud in NJ!
Your speech on C-SPAN was off the wall. Did you tell Obama to stop when he placed a ban on ? NO,you r a racist !
#withholdconsent !!
Thank you. More members of Congress, especially from the GOP, need to stand up!
wonderful; enough people have been hurt by this.
please:  the sooner the better and let's get our 241 year old democracy back on track.
Go get 'em! We need you more than ever.
. Why dont u two progressive jackasses realize your agenda was voted down. POTUS is doing what the  ppl voted for!
thank you for standing up for #AMERICANvalues
Thank you Senators Murphy and Booker.
please keep fighting for us. We support you. We believe in you.
U should live in one of their Countries before u give our Country away
@moonalli @ChrisMurphyCT great progress. What about Russian interference in our election? Guess what we're NOT talking about now
If POTUS is so concerned about making America safe, he should work on gun control, not this stupid charade!
You boys and @SenWarren are keeping my faith in America this week! #resist
THANK YOU!!
@dark_dude86 @ChrisMurphyCT while you're at it could you legislatively block Mr. Bannon's new role on NSC?
thank you!!!!!!
My former and current Senators. Proud.
And thank you Congressman Booker !!
@nickyintheburgh love it
thank you and keep up the fight on all fronts!
Sir I am an uninvolved Doctor. For sake of decency and Fairplay please introduce this Bill 
Thank you!!!!!!!
2020 guys. Flip a coin for spot on ticket.
let's get weed legalized next (if you're serious about ending discrimination).
Thank you both. Proud to call you my Senator, Senator Murphy. #Resist
Ryan breaks with Trump on Muslim immigrant ban 'Muslims are our partners,' the speaker declares.06/14/16 politico
"Muslim Ban"? "You keep using that word. I do not think you know what that means."...inconceivable...
@GovPenceIN Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.8 Dec 2015
you both make me believe there is good left out there!  Keep up the fight
thank you #leadership #EmotionalIntelligence
yep. Campaign on issues you just lost an election on. Your colleagues that lose Senate seats in '18 thank you
refugees are not dangerous and neither are medications manufactured in Canada! Be a champion for the people Cory!
Wethepeople are NOT going 2 allow you to change the rules & laws just because your "party" is no longer in charge
There is no Muslim ban!  Get it right or your nose will start growing.
With all due respect, two D's introducing a bill to rein in Trump is going to accomplish nothing but grandstanding. Time for real action.
does that mean we will be allowed to sue Obama & members of Congress for allowing it to happen under POTUS Obama?
Booker Murphy 2020
It's DISHONEST of you to imply this is about muslims!
43 muslim nations had NO change!

Isn't it only the 7 OBAMA identified??
#UnstoppableTOGETHER
This is NOT illegal. You are all just obstructionists.
#Resistance wants you to sponsor a bill to IMPEACH Dictator Trump and Steve Bannon!
And thank you Senator Booker - you made us all proud this weekend!
There is no #MuslimBan that's actually #FakeNews made up by @TheDemocrats and #Refugees do not have the right to immigrate to America
DONT TAKE YOUR EYE OFF OF RUSSIA!!! THE EVIDENCE IS OUT THERE!!!! PLEASE GET IT!!!!!
keep at it Sen Booker! I'm a Jersey girl, living in MD now but watching closely to see who's in the fight.
.@CoryBooker @ChrisMurphyCT thank you. All of you. Fight on. We are with you
Hope you fail.
I don't understand why you need a bill to overturn an order that's already against the law
You're going to be busy until you can impeach him. We need you to be the voice of the majority of Americans.
I am glad to see you 2 taking action to stop this atrocity.  No more talk!  The people want action!
thank you 
the word Muslim was never used in the order. Get the facts straight
good luck Cory!!!!!
Thank you.... And all those in positions of power, that think with ur mind & heart. To say this is WRONG & SAD
will you stop taking money from big phama cory?
SENATOR I CAN ONLY WISH YOU would create a bill to over turn Bill Clinton crime bill. MASS INCARCERATION
