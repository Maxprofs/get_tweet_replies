Cry.Cry Cry.
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker shame on you
A$$
nothing like a little rascal tension when there's nothing else to complain about
Booker 7mins up ding, ding over, lots of wind... Sessions will be AG!
Unfortunately he will. B confirmed  God help all minorities in the US.
that's my hopes.
voting rights for all Americans will be harder under Sessions. Voting should be made easier not harder Sessions needs 2 learn
What a liar! No one I know believes you or ANY liberal!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXKnDh-D6Mw â€¦
right on Cory. Session's voting record doesn't lie. He's "hostile" towards many groups-because his Bible tells him 2!
and his fake friends were just aghast!!!  Oh the outrage, the injustice!!!  #DogWhistle
just more lies by the left how's that been working for ya
Cory Booker has shown himself to be a racist, political hack.
pathetic Cory honored him in 16
@CoryBookerStop grandstanding,u should b ashamed of yourself. Preparing for 2020 is in vain,believeme I live in NJ 8 yrs of BO ugh
This man is a liar ,he reads what someone else prepared for him he doesn't know Sessions he's looking ahead to 2020
Cory can read Sessions' records. Have you? Nope just want to denigrate a black man
yet Booker said he was honored to work with him. So he is honored to work with someone hostile towards civil rights?
Yep. Sessios as a Senstor has only one vote ; as AG he has more power which can affect horror on those he's against like bulks
This video makes Cory look an idiot even more than his fake friend .
you mean hostility to blacks
my fav part was when he paused and gave a heartfelt expression. Must have been in his notes "pause here for effect".
and 5 other Afro American men said he did great work for civil rights, along with religious leaders!!!!!!!!!!
Yet dribble from more fake News.
I believe what Booker and the rest of the CBC are trying to say is that nominating a white man is racist.
Booker wants the WH but he is to big a racist worst then Obama and will never get the votes
If I had that face I would have an attitude as well
Grow up u liberal POS
So has Al Sharpton!

@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker
"I feel blessed & honored to have partnered w/ Senator Sessions in being the senate sponsors in this important award."
Senator Cory Booker 
He's gettin better. Somebody stole both of his Klan outfits and he's taking pills -trying to think and his head hurts.
no sessions has shown contempt for people who distort facts and lie
@CoryBooker gave no specifics in his rude Sessions rant. So obviously seeking his 15 minutes of fame.  Sickening but predictable.
you show hostility to your people by being the definition of an Uncle Tom . Sell out ....
Yo Corey try that BS in Cape May
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker - You show disrespect and hostility towards everyone.
Truly unbelievable that there are Republicans defending Sessions. Everyone should see that he's evil and unfit.
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker - How low can you go?
Just a year ago he said he was "honored and blessed" to work with Session on civil rights.  This guy's a clown.
Another lying Dem.
Booker less polished intelligent version of obama if BARRY & Al sharpton had a love child it would've @CoryBooker
. Cory just because someone says something derogatory does not mean they are a racist.? Jesus teaches forgiveness.
is on team global new world (dis) order.  
imo...just saying.
Just yell racist three times, then repeat everyday, right?  Pathetic and dishonest.
booger accepted a civil rights award with Sessions. Lauded him as a great man.  Booger has sold his soul
done nothing but prove he is has a political agenda! I feel he made a bad decision!
how? By upholding current law on the books?
Cory is ambitious.  Flamed out first Presidential run, but he's obviously going to try again.  Moving left.
racist bigot screams about Sessions/civil rights. Says nothing when 4 black thugs torture white law abiding citizen.
#CoryBOOKER is a #Racist Liar & #RACE Baiter ... here is the TRUTH about #JeffSessions
totally correct. There still fighting the civil war
Which tribal chief sold your ancestor? In pursuit of equity, who owes you WHAT?
@realDonaldTrump @politico And yet @CoryBooker "publicly" praised him on #CivilRights just 3 years ago!  Child please; sit back down! Lol
Just ask Booker's imaginary friend T-Bone.
& Cory shows contempt for truth!!!

he n his buddies got schooled my Smith today. Cory do the right thing not playing politics.
Where is the coverage of those witnesses, black btw, totally rebuked Booker, Lewis, etal.
what they do in the dark will come into the http://light.Talk  about it!Kudos Cory!
Booker does not know this great American. Booker sold his soul for political aspirations. Very disappointed in him who I liked
Yo Ben. Ever read Sessios' voting records in Senate and State of Alabama. Try it
That was a joke.  Why didnt you insist on having Mr Lewis speak first?  This day was an embarrassment to the caucus.
Playing the race card. Turn & spin everything into racist issue!
He has praised Sessions in the past but now has his eye on the Presidency . Two-faced
Booker sucks
race wars mr Booker?

You detected it 'JUST' because you are a Black. OR you detected it 'JUST' because of a mysterious hunch?
---> @CoryBooker <--- LIAR!!
pathetic
Cory, you are barking on a wrong tree, grow up&you passed every awful bill Obama asked of you.Iran, Syria&etc
I hope @CoryBooker considers a run in #2020 . I think he may have a shot
i hope so - so the Republicans can get 8 years
All of a sudden, Jeff Sessions has become a "liberal!"  Nothing could b further from the truth!  Sessions is a danger.
go away!
cory booker is the racist @thishearing!
where is the evidence all I heard was a lot of rhetoric?
