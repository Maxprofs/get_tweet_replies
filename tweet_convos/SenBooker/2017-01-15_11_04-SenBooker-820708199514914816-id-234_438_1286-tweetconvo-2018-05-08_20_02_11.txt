@CoryBooker  but not help bring the cost of meds down?
@CoryBooker I believe you are an honorable man. But I am profoundly disappointed at your vote for big Pharma. #stayintouch
SOMEDAY ONE OF U FUCKERS THAT VOTED DOWN THIS LAW WILL HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER, MAYBE
A WIFE FOR EXAMPLE WILL HAVE THEIR FACE?
IN CASE U DON'T KNOW WHAT 

? 

MEANT! 

A WIFE's FACE BLOWN FUCKIN OFF RIGHT IN FRONT OF ONE OF YOU's BASTARDS!

@CoryBooker if the GOP wrecks the ACA, is NJ doing anything to keep us covered like NY is? #birthcontrol #preexisting etc
Then why vote against cheaper meds made by the same fuckin companies???? Thanks for nothing.
By the donations and your vote, you're in Big Pharma's pocket. Et tu, Booker?
@CoryBooker Do you think killing people with #cancer is being pro-life?#ProtectOurCare #ACA #polls
@CoryBooker  $400/k Booker ? Ur ruined. Resign. Sell out.
I think #FixACA is a better hashtag. It's what people want and the GOP can get behind it
So why did you vote against importing cheaper drugs from Canada? It can't be safety since most are same as US.
.@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker lol, remember when you voted with Senate Republicans to keep medicine more expensive like two days ago?
ACA SUCKS! Is TAX on Poor, who can't afford it. You can keep kid on plan for additional 1500mo.
@CoryBooker fighting to keep Obamacare while fighting for Big Pharma’s right to GOUGE the American people…great for Corps…
@CoryBooker smh.. And because of that one vote, your political career will end! That was a stupid move. #FollowSandersLead
@CoryBooker Encourage voters to call, write, email or tweet their reps to voice concerns about repealing ACA legislation.
@CoryBooker What about protecting us from exorbitant drug prices? You put big pharma money where your mouth is.
@CoryBooker - Please explain your position to not permit life saving meds from Canada. My daughter's insulin costs $800/mo
because he's a repugnant POS who thinks the American people are to be taken advantage of.
Protect care?You refused importing cheaper drugs,you don't believe in care yourself.As time passes I'm starting to see the Republican in you
You support the #ACA but not affordable medicine? Corrupt Dems and Reps have to go
@CoryBooker the hypocrisy! You've contributed to #GOPGenocide when you rejected cheaper CA drugs.
@CoryBooker @odeedee
So many replies from ppl just now starting to get it: Unless you've got $ to donate, est dems/reps are NOT your friends.
You represent NJ- we had/have  "Charity care" for all your Marthas. Start pushing to get rid of Obama care.
Shame on you @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker for your vote against @SenSanders drug bill, citing 'safety concerns' as your reasoning.
thought you might be interested in this article
@CoryBooker liar!
@CoryBooker let's support @UCSheriffCryan
Cory Booker big pharmacies Mr corporate Hooker! people don't trust a damn thing this liar says!
@CoryBooker
the reason we have the ACA and not medicare 4 all is because of Pharma shills like Booker.  We need to reform!
@CoryBooker then why vote against cheaper meds? Show me the dead Canadians. Thought you'd be different but it's always $$$
@CoryBooker Jezebel reported that Booker received $267,338 from pharmaceutical companies this money explained his vote.
@CoryBooker but let's keep those prescription drugs prohibitively expensive #emptybookerplatitudes
That's fuckin' rich when you voted against Sanders medication bill you corporate swine
@CoryBooker  Thank You!
@CoryBooker sorry it's over for you dude, the progrssive movement will NEVER forget your sick nay vote againts cheaper meds
@CoryBooker is the ACA helping T Bone?
@CoryBooker obama care and the lack of action by you & the rest of your swamp buddies or maybe you blame trump & russia?
@CoryBooker The Clowns of Congress who voted for ACA before reading it did 30 Million Americans wrong #Irresponsible
Sir, I'm a fan, but SO disappointed w/your vote on pharma. Inconsistent with your brand to support greed.
@CoryBooker what did you do to improve Newark NJ? That's right; nothing.
@CoryBooker if you are that concerned about our health, you wouldn't have voted against prescription proposal!
@CoryBooker Cory u a fake.  And you did this knowing ACA was disappearing
How's that amendment to lower prescription drug prices coming along? I'm sure you're working hard on that, right?
@CoryBooker There are 30M people counting on your success Cory. If Trump & GOP don't want ACA, take it from them only!
So much for 2020. Progressives won't forget the $300K you've received from Big Pharma + your vote on Sanders' amendment.
@CoryBooker Like you identify with people like Martha. You use people like Martha for your own personal gain. Opportunist
@CoryBooker You know what? You don't get to grandstand about helping people when you voted to screw people who take meds
@CoryBooker SELL OUT

Bull. Shit.

@CoryBooker bull shit on excuses for voting against drugs from Canada!  Shame on you!!!
Those same people probably wanted cheaper drug prices too. Oh yeah, you voted AGAINST that. Big Pharma tool!
@CoryBooker #bully
How about them meds? Oh wait, u don't care in cutting costs of meds. Ultimately u are a snake in the grass. GTFOH!
@CoryBooker pls no more self-aggrandizing videos for virality.. pls deal w the actual viruses.. u underestimate the left..
I just affordable cared in my mouth.
What about the families of people that wanted cheap Canadian meds? Can people sink lower than you?
It's too late, your true colour have been shown Cory, now its clear to everyone that you're a no-good neoliberal sellout
@CoryBooker and you will look stupid again when the GOP puts out a better plan. Don't go along so we can laugh at you again
@CoryBooker  I don't trust you!!
#BigPharmDems Please stop calling yourself a #Progressive. #OurFirstStand
#NeverBooker #NinaTurner2020 https://interc.pt/2ilz8ry  @ZaidJilani @ddayen
@CoryBooker You are nothing but a sold-out senator. Shame on you!!!
@CoryBooker Cory you don't represent one person,all the people,NJ,knock it off!Jersey Shore,you wrong on this!Talk to us
@CoryBooker why vote against Sanders-Klobuchar amendment enabling Americans to purchase pres drugs in Canada?Big Pharma$$??
lol dude who are you kidding, we know you that big pharma bought you.
I hope Martha's outcome is the opposite of your career.  #FilthyTraitor #NotARealDem
@CoryBooker u are a fraud. U voted against lowering prescription drug costs? Trash bag fraud. Just like Warren.
@CoryBooker ya but you sold your soul to pharmaceutical companies.  The voters are watching!
@CoryBooker Big Pharma Cartel controls Congress- Stop this madness! Cheaper drug prices from Canada n Mex via NAFTA
Corporate shill.
@CoryBooker senator, stop ur Big Pharma, this control Congress.  health right n affordable medicine r civil rights. Stand
Why arent you as morally spotless when it comes to your daddy, big pharma? Quit patting yourself on the back.
Yet you vote against lower drug prices you sellout corrupt hack.  We will remember in 2020.
@CoryBooker lol you fight to protect your donations, you are the worse kind of politician
But you voted AGAINST importing cheaper drugs from Canada. You aren't for the people. You are for the profit!
@CoryBooker then why are you taking $267k from big pharmacy and voting against rational RX costs? Pick a side. #weseeyou
CORPORATE STOOGE. DOWN WITH PRIVATE HEALTHCARE
Unless that means needing affordable medications, right, Senator? Then you sell out? Oh, we get it loud & clear...
@CoryBooker TRAITOR
Return the $$$ you've taken from #BigPharma, unequivocally throw support behind single-payer option & quit grandstanding.
@CoryBooker Boycott Martin Luficer King Day !!! Join me I'll working!! Unlike these Slakers!!!!
@CoryBooker you are in the pharmaceutical's pocket. You care nothing for people. You are helping americas quest for greed.
could of sworn I saw Senator Booker in Newark today unless my eyes were deceived me!!!
@CoryBooker you sold out American lives for pharmaceutics company donations. Sell out!
@CoryBooker #ProtectOurCare #SaveACA So by all means vote against @BernieSanders' amendment to procure cheaper medicine
@CoryBooker walk the progressive path and put up a fight in 2020. Our children deserve it.
@CoryBooker i dont understand you. How can you claim support for the ACA and defeat an attempt to lower drugs prices? Notok
@CoryBooker and what about the economical drugs from Canada. Prove to us the Pharmaceutical industry doesn't own you.
Say what you will, actions speak louder than words. Like your vote against @SenSanders prescription drug amendment.
@CoryBooker you failed, lol. Oh the joy in this! Erase Obama, no legacy!
If they plan on repealing #Obamacare where is the replacement? No healthcare is worse
@CoryBooker so why did you vote against Senator Sanders amendment to lower drug costs??
Still not OK that you sided with GOP on pharma, your explanation so base - OK for Canadians not Americans?!
brah.  Dem Canadian drugs tho
@CoryBooker Don't even call yourself a Democrat anymore. Voting against purchasin drugs from Canada is bad. Repub at heart
@CoryBooker  and then turn around with only 12 other Senators and vote against the Parhma bill. A snake in the grass.
@CoryBooker And you're protecting Martha by making sure big Pharm keeps price gouging her??!! We're on to you now Booker.
we are waiting to see if you follow through.  We need inexpensive medicine
Cory is nothing but a Pentecostal Thumping and Screaming phony politician. I had high hope for him, he is but a let down. Not candid at all
Cory is nothing but a Pentecostal Thumping and Screaming phony politician. I had high hope for him, he is but a let down. Not candid at all
@CoryBooker You need to do a much better job. Ur vote on Bernie's pharma bill left us losing trust in u. Follow the money!
Interesting info regarding Canadian Prescription Drug costs. New Zealand is tackling high costs. http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2016-2017/the-high-cost-of-phamaceuticals-canadas-drug-problem …
the American people are counting on you to have our backs we elected you to be our voice
@CoryBooker you and 12 other @TheDemocrats cost us cheaper and safer drugs from Canada! This is why I am @GreenPartyUS.
@CoryBooker you do know that Canada has safer drugs than we do. That makes your excuses pointless, you sold out!
Better yet would be to expand medicare for everyone. Please introduce this; cheaper and more efficient.
@CoryBooker but you don't want us to have lower perception costs? #twofaced #bigpharma #shame
@CoryBooker tweet as to why you voted no on pharma legislation. Too many donations from them?
@CoryBooker quit pandering and fix this broken system. That means reach out and work together with GOP instead of bickering
@CoryBooker why did you take money from big pharma, why didn't you vote with Bernie ????????answer, please.#bummedatthis
I'm trying to take this seriously considering your recent vote against lowering costs for prescription drugs.
Forgets who he works for
@CoryBooker #BigPharma 
Who takes more pharma $$$than you?
@CoryBooker Sen. Booker, my daughter just has health insurance under her dad while she builds a life. Is that so wrong?
@CoryBooker why? Why did vote against Bernie's bill? Why do take big pharma $? Why don't you just represent the people?
4 days ago @CoryBooker sold out the American people to Big Pharm. How long will it take him to right this wrong?
-NJ Voter
@CoryBooker And once again this is how I want to be represented when a Sen speaks like he has a job #listen #potusworks4us
@CoryBooker how are we going to save the ACA when you won't vote to allow us to buy cheaper drugs from Canada
@CoryBooker Your vote against importing drugs from Canada was so disheartening. We thought you were better.
Pharm. gives u money, u voted down lower prices for us the Americans, kind looks bad, not gonna lie.
U should b ashamed of urself! Only looking 4 'camera time', not helping poor, working class, or disenfranchised w/policy!
please return the big pharma money. I know you got rich but don't do it at the expense of regular folk
thank u cory! i see YOU being president some day.
@CoryBooker oh yeah? After that vote on prescription drug prices to remain high, this is the best PR work you got?
@CoryBooker U chose $$ over life making U a deplorable! U r NOT the future of the party~U r a neolib & we're done w/YOU!
I would like to know how it can remain solvent the way it stands today?  You aren't helping a serious issue only politicize
@CoryBooker While u r a GOP target this week, it's hard to believe u really care anymore. Please show us otherwise.
.  if you don't take of your body where are you going to live?  equal access to health care=equal rights.
@CoryBooker As long as you don't threaten your big Pharma donors. Hypocrite!
@CoryBooker yes but why vote with big pharma. We need meds that are affordable.
@CoryBooker you sold us out to the pharmaceutical companies!
I'm a democrat, excited about you as a politician. Finding out you are in bed with #BigPharma changed my mind!!
@CoryBooker I used to think YOU were one of the good guys.  Thanks to your vote on the drug bill, i now know different!!!
@CoryBooker fighting for Martha and her family also means reduces astronomical pharmaceutical costs to American families!
@CoryBooker who do you represent ???? The people or Pharma? #phonybooker
@CoryBooker and yet YOU won't vote to give us cheaper drug prices. Shame on you Cory Booker !!!
@CoryBooker
 And hopefully you vote against Sec of state nominee!
@CoryBooker
A bit hypocritical don't you think..? You just voted against making prescription drugs cheaper for us.. Even @tedcruz voted for that bill..
You
Suck
You 
Are
A 
Liar

@CoryBooker but don't let people have cheaper medicines right?
@CoryBooker so about that imported prescription drug vote.......i'm expecting your version any day now.
@CoryBooker Yet you voted AGAINST the American people n FOR PHARMA to keep higher cost of Drugs #NEVERBooker #NO2Booker2020
@CoryBooker are you staying home 1/20?
@CoryBooker but having lower prescription medications wasn't worth the fight? #NeverForget #FollowTheMoney
@CoryBooker y did u vote against lower pharma??
@CoryBooker You say one thing, and then when the moment of truth comes, you betray us with this big pharma vote.  Shame.
@CoryBooker you're a fraud Booker and people are waking up to it.
@CoryBooker you had me until I found out that pharma has bought you. SO disappointed 
I'm old enough to remember when you had integrity. That vote man, SMH.
#moneytalks
@CoryBooker You lost me Cory. Never get my vote after showing you might be bought and paid for.
@CoryBooker Do you #StandWithJohnLewis and boycott inauguration? @RonWyden #AmericaFirst #LadyLiberty
@CoryBooker Keep fighting to save ACA - it's critical for so many
Good luck saving ACA..Team with senate Republicans to keep good & trash bad..stop all hate!!
@CoryBooker HYPOCRITE. #coryhooker, Big Pharma's working girl.
@CoryBooker 
America is tired of paying the tab for the failing #affordablecareact. #MAGA
@CoryBooker you didn't stand up to big pharm. as a long time supporter, I feel let down by you sir.
he's bought & paid for folks. Received more pharma $ than any other D in congress. #BigPharmaBooker
@CoryBooker the NJ democrat  version of Chris Christie a blatant opportunist. Go vote against cheaper drugs again.
but why did you voted against affordable prescriptions? We are watching.
@CoryBooker But you let pharmaceutical companies kill people. Youre embarassing to our party Cory Booker.
If you want to play a prominent role in this, Senator, you'll have to make some tough choices. Every vote gets noticed.
@CoryBooker I, once again, for the eighth time am asking to have a discussion with you about your nay vote on the RX bill.
I feel as if my voice is not being heard as an American citizen.
Would you be willing to have a public discussion on this forum? I will be civil.
@CoryBooker except when u support big pharma!
then why your vote to ban sale of affordable canadian drugs to US consumers? bigpharma campaign contributions? #voteclean
#SelloutBooker
@drdoodlie1994 -Don't give up this fight pls-U gotta build a dam somewhere along the path to ACA repeal.
