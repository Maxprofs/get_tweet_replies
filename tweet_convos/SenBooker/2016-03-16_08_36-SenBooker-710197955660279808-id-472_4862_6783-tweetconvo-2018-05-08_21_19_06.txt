@carrot22221111 @SCOTUSnom @POTUS @WhiteHouse You Ronald, should quit drinking the kool-aid and watchimg Faux News. Your bigotry is showing!
@carrot22221111 @SCOTUSnom @POTUS @WhiteHouse Very proud of my country and MY President, ashamed of the lies and obstruction!
@carrot22221111 @SCOTUSnom @POTUS @WhiteHouse is all the President did! Check your facts before spewing more hate!
@carrot22221111 @SCOTUSnom @POTUS @WhiteHouse the obstructionists in Congress. 3.) Abortion is none of yours or any other persons business.
.@SCOTUSnom @WhiteHouse So glad for congressional deferral of Supreme Court hearing.
@rotkapchen @SCOTUSnom @WhiteHouse no such term as "deferral".Try "refusing to do their job".
@RandyWestfahl Well that surely is a phrase I'd apply to the past 8 years for this administration. #SoMuchForChange
@rotkapchen Are you completely insane? This president has accomplished more with less help than any  I've seen. You are delusional.
@RandyWestfahl Our economy and our culture has degraded and will continue to do so if we stay on the current course. Retirement funds dead.
@rotkapchen You are barking at the moon. You have nothing but imagination.
@RandyWestfahl Odd that you think so highly of yourself that you dismiss the real lives of real people. Heartless
@rotkapchen by the way "Paula", 48.6 thousand tweets generated from your fake account. Pretty obvious.
@SCOTUSnom @POTUS

@POTUS @WhiteHouse If the media asserts that the general election is "too close to call",& the Court splits down the middle-what?
Citizens are alarmed at what is perceived as blatant election fraud w/ the media's participation.Can you help?
Would it help if citizens began making arrests IOT deliver the participants to the F.B.I.-with good evidence?
@boandsunny Why is GOP blocking him so a racist Trump can make the appointment?
