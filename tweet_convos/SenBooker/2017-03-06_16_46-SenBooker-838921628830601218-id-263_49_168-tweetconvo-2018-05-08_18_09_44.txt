@KellyannePolls These 2 R tied for absurdity from now  #SCARAKELLY ALL DAY LONG.
They must be paying Scaramucci a lot to defend him and then he insulted your viewers
. @allinwithchris @chrislhayes @costareports @MichaelSteele @neeratanden I didn't hear-was "BS degree" included in @Scaramucci's intro?
Is Anthony the new Kellyanne?
how about #scarakelly
Is this what a Harvard education does? LMAO
Hayes got his ass handed to him! What a wimp!!
Can't waitfan
Scaramucci is male version of Kellyann Conway.   It's a rerun!
Anthony @Scaramucci came across as a two bit double talking car salesman. @allinwithchris
My thoughts exactly. @allinwithchris
Pointless interview, then you add insult to injury by saying you will bring him back!  Waste of viewers' time.
eewwww Chris, I felt the need to take a bath in disinfectant after just listening to this dude.
Trump has opposite of good instincts-bad & even evil ones. Many examples have & will land him in lots of trouble.
.@allinwithchris don't have @Scaramucci on again. Can't answer a question and add to the conversation
Seriously!
@chrishayes no more @Scaramucci please
understand having Scarab guy on. Hard to watch but helps understand what we are dealing with.
terrible interview with Trump lap dog. If MSNBC don't know how to handle them,don't have them on. Switchd chnls
we are using a suddenswitch of channels to protest lies @weatherchannel while we watch ONDEMAND
If @realDonaldTrump's "instincts" are great, @Scaramucci, why'd he pick Flynn/Sessions who lied about Russia? @chrislhayes
4 the love of God, @chrislhayes, 4 us who luv ur show, pls don't torture us again, by having @Scaramucci on. #1 DEPLORABLE
I love your interviews, but this time you let Scaramucci drag you through the mud of obfuscation.
Great show. Nice 2 see @MichaelSteele turn the phrase=tRump produces info & then uses it to justify decisions.
Also, don't say "alternate facts"! LIES ... just speak the truth ... LIES. Easy to say. Try it out!
Anthony, you are smooth. @Potus needs to present evidence for indictment. Hearsay isn't evidence.
Trumps Instincts? like Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump Steaks, Trump Ice
Trump Univ
sorry but if u cant put anthony in place ur a fool. EVERY WORD WAS BULL! & u took it
I'm very disappointed that you would have @Scaramucci on your show. This was nothing but padding his resume. @chrislhayes
love you Chris but why so giggly-love-struck with @Scaramucci ? You let him dodge each question. Weird.
You didn't do yourself (or us) any favor by having Scaramucci on.
Chris, Chris , Chris, don't have Scaramucci on again. He handles you like a little boy. End your bromance.
some other things Trump has had "good instincts" on:
Rude & insulting 2 viewers...will not B watching @Scaramucci 's next appearance
Let this coward ans your ques he's not the host this is not his show don't let him change the topic
Trumpsters are masters at holding the floor and not answering. I learn nothing.
Unhinged @chrislhayes @costareports @MichaelSteele @Scaramucci @neeratanden @CoryBooker @rickperlstein @michelleinbklyn
Good show, but really Chris @Scaramucci  Ugh a real nothingburger.euweee Twice this week on MSNBC
Another LIAR, defending the INDEFENSIBLE.
you've got to have @Scaramucci on more often. Guy is hilarious.
Sure Trump is a buffoon, "but he's got great instincts!"
This guy UNBELIEVABLE.Answers NO Q's.Defends #tRump w ZERO #FACTS . He & #kellyanne #karlroveU SAD
I just finished watching that. The handshake, gross. That made you look like a knuckle dragger.
Seriously do not have this insult @Scaramucci on again. Unwatchable. #FAIL
What a brazen sell out. Only the bottom of the barrel support this clown.
#LIAR trying 2 #DEFENDaLIAR Disrespectful #scaramucci JOKE
Anthony, the sleaze dripping off you as you try to defend the indefensible is like noxious gas.
This argument is at best infantile at worst Mr.Scaramucci is insulting every person watching your show right now
Well. That was 12 minutes I'll never get back.  Forget the original point boys? He played ya Chris
Trump is a modern day Susan Smith, let's blame the Black Man!  Stop blaming @POTUS44 for your failings!  Man up and own your failings!
why do all the ppl that work or woked for Trump all have a hard time with direct question?
Trump keeps saying a "Black Man" did it.  He constantly blames @POTUS44 for all of his failings!  Obama wiretapped me, Obama DID IT! Man up!
Scaramucci played you Chris - please don't make me skip your show by having him on ever again.
ditto
just saw "interview" w/ @Scaramucci & I'm APPALLED. "Instincts" is not proof of a very serious accusation.
Hayes needed to shut him up. "Instincts"=Lies in Trumpworld.
The Trump surrogate technique of talking over everyone is ridiculously ineffective.
what was that all about? Scaramucci forgot his pom poms during that cheer fest. Empty words, indefensible
Thank U Cory!
that was so hard to watch Anthony.  You were eviscerated....probably cuz you were wrong
do not bring @Scaramucci on again, he is of no use to anyone but himself, clearly.
another master deflector #inners
Love your show but I will never watch it again if you bring @Scaramucci back.  Enough is enough.
that interview with @Scaramucci was painful to watch. Great effort against a broken record
How you get through a segment without smacking mealy-mouthed @Scaramucci perplexes me.
I sure won't be watching again if you have Anthony back.  You gave perfect ex of 45 not having good instints
The first travel ban was not struck down by the courts.  Temporary stay until hearing on the merits.
Robber barons had great instincts too; #djt is doing "president" on the backs of others
he mentioned birtherism because it shows a pattern of slanderous behavior the president engages in
accusing Pres. Obama of an unproven felony is NOT "good instincts" especially given its source!
And don't blame the media or the audience for talking about this stuff, your president is talking about this stuff.  But you know that.
love your show Chris, but Scaramucci is smarmy and not credible.
scaramucci reminds  me of a used car salesman- double speak & sleeze. I need a shower...
funny, sounds like you are divesting to work for a president that won't
why bother interviewing trump apologist @Scaramucci- one of those guys who if trump shot someone on 5th ave, would accept it
"I'm gonna have you back again.."  Don't bother. He's complete waste of breath. A kellyanne clone.
Your interview was hard to watch.  He has good instincts?  His later twitter rant was based on good instincts?
I wish you would not let your 'guests' talk over you with nothing but talking point.to burn up the interview time
seriously it's degrading and insulting the viewers
Great @Scaramucci The lunatic in the WH is conning his Twits & confirming his psychosis #unfit 
Tax cuts 4 the rich have never created JOBS
That's a trickle down ZOMBIE LIE
$$$$$ trickles UP
YOU POS
Trump's instincts about wiretaps are based on his instinct to tap guests at Mar-a-lago
Actually good for us to see these corrupt weasels that Trump is collecting to represent "the working class". LOL
boy did you let Scaramucci obfuscate on a myriad of issues.
who cares????
Ugh, don't waste our time with sketchy Scaramucci
Scaramucci was a deluded waste.Stick with Steele for GOP POV, he is rational.
What a slime ball Scaramucci is. Guess it's a-ok with him to accuse former POTUS without proof! #Resist
Stock market up 15% because top 1% & corporations
Will get huge tax cuts. If he wanted to help workers
JOBS
is everything ppl hate about New Yorker #inners
Thanks for having the male version of Kellyanne Conway on your show tonight. Not!!!
OMG How does @Scaramucci sleep at night. It doesn't matter if Trump lies as long as stock market&CEOs do well?Damn the rest
#resisttyranny
Stooge alert!
dude, not sure you should've advertised thus after that performance. Sad
Who the hell is @Scaramucci  He's as uninformed as Spicey or Kellyan: all talk, no know. #PresidentBannon trying new faces?
hey @Scaramucci the wheels on your Trump train are falling off! Save yourself!
anyone bring up China trademark deal?
Don't bother having Scaramucci on again. He is Kellyanne in a suit...worthless flying monkey
tweeting a claim of felony by a President is not credible which makes everything else said a joke
I hope President Obama sues his ass for his libelous claim w no evidence. IMPEACH TRUMP
is being a little jokey joke with NotMyPresident's propaganda bots. Can we toughen up a bit!
Agreed! @chrislhayes might as well have tousled his hair . . .
Oh man Chris watching Tony Trump Toy was painful.  Good instincts:  to get us friggin killed!  God help us 
Good instincts? The only good instinct that DT has is the ability to lie and get away with it.
I wouldn't buy a used car from that Scaramucci!  He's so slick, you could wring oil from him just by shaking his hand!
Scaramucci, Instincts for self enrichment&
Aggrandizement. That's it
Trump could care less re working/mid class
This is less interview, more commercial. Condescending to viewers, over-talking host.
Ind voter
OMG! That guy was irritating...us viewers know you're just like the #liarinchief. #POS
is A.Scaramucci trying new material for one of those ubiquitous NYC backroom comedy clubs?
Holy f**k Tony, I'd love to call you insane, but evil like yours knows exactly what it's doing.
Scaramucci is obnoxious but smart. Love to see him one on one with Hayes for 30-60 min
Watched @allinwithchris - what alternate reality does Anthony Scaramucci live in?? Un-effing-believable.  @Scaramucci @chrislhayes
Why are you chewing up time with @Scaramucci (Trump propagandist), Chris? You might as well talk to pigeons in the park.
WHY !!!  @chrislhayes  promote this gross #SlimeyScaramucci it was like a mobster ! We learned Zero. Your show is loosing us
You lost that round Chris.  Scary moochie talked circles around you.
U sounded ridiculous trying to defend DT. U made no sense & appeared desperate to get back on team @allinwithchris @chrislhayes
OMG. Another con artist. Terrible speaker! Says nothing. Will be a potus puppet
First Cone, now @Scaramucci.  Tough questions again! Keep it up #journalismmatters.
Seriously, what the hell was that? Who is Scrotumucci? How did you resist the impulse to punch him in the face?
someone with 'good instincts' does not say what DJT tweets. DJT is not a leader. He's weak.
he's unstable. doesn't have focus. doesn't know what POTUS does. He's not familiar w/gov process
. @Scaramucci You have sold your soull for a prestigious job. Lies are still lies. @allinwithchris
Can you KenAnne Conway off of my TV screen, please! Ugh!
. OMG! Scaramucci could possibly win the Trump deflection, Sycophant (plus affected JERK!) Award!
Trump instincts? Russian tampering, lies &skullduggery got him elected. Hates common people
#failure
Good boy @Scaramucci Trump will give you your treat now. What a sorry excuse for an interview. Lol.
is this @KellyannePolls brother? #bs #misleading lies #BREAKING #resist #Trumprussia
Hey Scaramucci, Don't get excited,  BLOTUS won't be Prez much longer!
Why did you have that Mafia guy on? Sickening.
why do you even bother having someone like Scaramucci on your show? He's a liar just like Trump.
Scaramucci just walked all over u! What !?
get MEAN, you let him derail you!! Want u to wrench truth from these bulls#it-filled surrogates!!
exactly it's talking down to those of us with a brain.
The SCOTUS' speech Tuesday was certainly unbelievable, just not in the way you think it was.
did his best to get  @Scaramucci to admit @realDonaldTrump is cray-cray; but shiny objects won out.  #Trump
smooch-- I guess the Minister of Propaganda is taking a break so Tony is filling in.
please do not give scum like Scaramucci a platform on your show..
didn't answer a question. But u went to law school,not Chris. Deflection/intimidation,Trump way. #inners
Do us all a favor Chris. Do not bring this gentleman back.
ew... smarmy, slithery snake
you have the patience of a saint dealing with @Scaramucci oh my universe that was worse than @KellyannePolls
is a total BSer. Divert/deflect ASAP. No need to torture your viewers with him again. 
@SenBookerOffice @chrislhayes @costareports @MichaelSteele @Scaramucci Scaramucci =frightening! Trump has good instincts ha!
Poor America with Americans like this @MSNBC guy & The Left
Why are Maddow and Reid the only reporters on your network with actual balls?
laughing at the presidents tweets, watching the world blow up. Shame on you
Omg Chris, Scaramucci was like listening to kellyann
Annoying & full of shit
world leaders are watching. WTH must they think?  How can they have any faith in this man?No trust
seriously? Watch ..A.S Blowing Trump on the air w/Chris.  He's manipulating DJT on the TV.
@always floors me when I hear "u guys always take him literally"! WHAT?? Because he literally said IT!!!
This is Your show! Not Trumpov's!Won't watch u if u do this again orAny Trumpsplaining Liars On!
#NoToLiars
You r so full of S-HT. it's just WRONG 
What trump said re taps....He LIES CONSTANTLY
& you know it. PHONY
Please do not have scaramucci on anymore; he is just like the person he is "defending", e.g. a DEFLECTOR!
Just more bullshit & lies from a Trumputin supporter !!
What's the point of having brainless suck-up like Scaramucci on? He can't answer a single question
Wow, @Scaramucci is a gigantic . He'll fit right in.
Congrats to @Scaramucci an apologist clown  with less credibility than Scott Baio
Anthony? What will it take for u surrogates to call Trump out. Tired of the pandering. Trump digs his own grave.
Somebody needs to take Anthony on. I'd like to see him on @amjoyshow
You Sucked!
Hey Anthony! How does Trumps Ass taste? Cause u were right up there 
brown noser
changes the topic and does not answer the question
Talks in circles. Says nothing.
Don't care about Trump's "instincts". More concerned with his inability to tell the truth. Ever.
.@allinwithchris @Scaramucci @chrislhayes u'd better hld on 2 ur business unless u want to go down w/ a sinking ship.Economy by @BarackObama
Chris this guy is determined to piss on your head and then try to convince you it's raining!
wow Anthony you have a lot of Trump's little wee wee in your mouth.
If you had an ounce of street smarts you could have destroyed the Mooch.
Anthony - "your guy" Trump is NOT doing a "great" job, no matter how much you try to defend him.
Don't have him on your show.
Scarmucci is a real piece of work.  Into alternative reality like the rest of Admin
he definitely went to the Kellyanne Conway School of Pivot
and charm school
Anthony is 0% fun as a guest unless triggered, It's not that hard. You gotta go Tucker on him if you want good TV.
