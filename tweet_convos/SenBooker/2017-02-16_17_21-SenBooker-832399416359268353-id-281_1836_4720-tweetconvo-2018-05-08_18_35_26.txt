we did, it didn't work
@SenSchumer @EPA your a two face schmuck!! Are you with Obamas OFA too??
@senschumer @HILLARY History will remember those who stood for America for which it stands. Thank you
#truth
you wouldn't know anything about
Leading. Voting against lower drug prices with your lameass excuses....

Take a seat.
@SenSchumer @EPA Unfortunately, my Senators are James Inhofe and James Lankford. I did send emails, so I tried. SMDH!
Be vocal about healthcare vouchers.  It's another scam.  But the GOP's position needs to be rebutted.
@kaelaishere @EPA I am not anti-religion, on the contrary I am as Catholic as you get.  My God loves the earth He  created.
I'm a godless heathen. And yet, still somehow care about other people. I'm wacky that way.
I stand w/ you. trying to reach 2 Catholics who hide behind stewardship as a reason 2 b anti-enviro
I never meant any disrespect.
@SenSchumer @EPA 
#didtheydidn'tlisten
@SenSchumer @EPA  Ease a established politician - Booker
@SenSchumer @EPA You Democrats are a Big joke.
@SenSchumer @EPA he will be fine. Stop looking for the bad in people and join the country.
#CORYBOOKER - Sen. Booker -the majority agree "We don't want to hear from a sellout". You are hurting Dems
@SenSchumer @EPA no the hell its not; trump could have put your slack ass in there- that would suck more!
@SenSchumer @EPA / Coming from a phony POTUS wannabe like Booker. ..
and yet again - the Dems stand helpless
Bahahahaha
Another jerk-no one is going to vote for you next time around
democraps, vote DEms out, sick of them
@Cafeaulait4u @EPA I did. Unfortunately my Senator's are Lankford and Inhofe. They could care less
they love the Oklahoma earthquakes!
#democratdogwhistles #fetch
Exc 2 ofUof course clearly worse Poor chuck sucking up to BO+WJC for yrs+no Scotus nomination @SenBookerOffice @SenSchumer  @seanhannity
@sharonstone Nicee
I have and would but, to no avail. Rubio is my senator. 
It does me no good to tell @SenToomey I don't want something, he just does whatever he feels like doing.
@SenSchumer @EPA Hey; can we Get Hillary; ain't she outa work now days??
@SenSchumer @EPA Bahahahaha CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX!  Demos have been waiting our money! NO MORE!
Can you make Senate postpone vote until Pruitt's fossil-fuel communications are released next week in OK?
Bahahahaha
@SenSchumer @EPA But it's definitely not possible to come up with a worse POTUS.
Bahahahaha, we could have had crooked Hillary, she lets r men get killed!
@tmbrown327 @EPA - WV and ND Dem Senators could not--black gold
sigh. I know. I can count on @SenBobCasey, but  @sentoomey only votes with Trump & doesn't care about our wellbeing.
doesn't do any good to tell Oklahoma senators.  They're apparently bought and paid for
so lucky my senator is @KamalaHarris thank you kamala #california #Resistance
@SenSchumer @EPA you as senator
@timkaine @MarkWarner stand with Sen. Booker!!!!
we've been telling our Senator no about every pick. It just doesn't matter.
@SenSchumer @EPA Peer Reviewed. Impact of Current Climate Proposals. Stop enslaving posterity http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12295/full â€¦
he will clean house
yeah..he will probably contaminate a river or something..oh wait, Never mind.
trump has picked the worst possible person for each job. Only his moron voters don't see that.
Well yur wrong...there's U!
IDIOTS
Now what? This man should be indicted for what he did to Oklahoma.
I tried. My Senators apparently don't care. Thanks Flake and McCain!
we did. They refuse to hear us.
If you're against him it tells me I am for him! Looking forward to taking our nation back from globalist agenda!
wait, what? #holdthefloor  didn't work again? You gotta come up with a new strategy @SenateDems
@SenSchumer @EPA I'd tell him that, but I believe @senschumer is already on that page with us.
They did. I know why I live in CA now.
@SenSchumer @EPA unfortunately my senator is from Oklahoma and sales this state out at every turn
Thank you for trying.
too late! The #gop hates the environment! That all suck. #2018
It's unfortunate that 2 DEM Senators voted YES (Manchin and Heitkamp). Sad
Google Flint,MI-St.Joseph,LA...to see how great @EPA is at doing their job! Water not fit to bathe in-decades!
hell you had two Democrats voting yes :)
Seems like MY senator already is. 
They did - YOU - Senator Booker #altleft #alinskyite #wannabe
when you are EVERYTHING America isnt.... how do you think you can say what someone else is or isnt! YOUR NOT AMERICA
My senators ARE voting no - you all need to pile on the Republicans and get them to say no too!
You are my senator (TG!)--what ELSE can we do? Happy to do it.
@susaneisenberg1 @EPA No...we could do worse. Lex anyone?
Let's be honest it would be hard to come up w/anyone worse for their jobs than any of these noms.. @SenBookerOffice @EPA
I will, but is it having any effect at all? Serious question. You're on the inside, are we making an impact?
From my understanding they want to eliminate the EPA.  If this is true should we also be calling about that?
TRAITORS to USA: @SenatorHeitkamp AND @Sen_JoeManchin -moral degenerates for saying they will vote for crooked Pruitt
VOTE NO
vote no
@SenSchumer @EPA OH YOU OPPOSE EVERYTHING. YOUR CREDIT IS REALLY GETTING LOW..
vote NO! Thank you from the water utility industry. #pollutingPruitt
OK. @CoryBooker vote no on Pruitt. Thank you for your time and service.
@SenSchumer @EPA does it make sense to tell you to vote no if we know you're voting no?
Unless you are smart.
@SenSchumer @EPA so true! A total embarrassment!
I did, so many times.  Unfortunately, my 2 live only for their party, as evidenced by lack of care for their people...
My senators @SenTomCotton and @JohnBoozman are bought and paid for by special interests. What can I do?
@SenSchumer @EPA 

"What difference does it make? "
.@SenBookerOffice @EPA Just your dislike means he's the right man
It's actually hard to come up with someone worse than Scott Pruitt to lead @EPA on clean water & air. Tell your senator to vote NO.
ashamed to be from Jersey after all your antics. You're a political hack. Vote yes on Pruitt.
Please vote no on Scott Pruitt. He's an awful choice.
I have never seen a stronger voice then when we were against BD. They're not going to listen. I give up
agreed. I'm glad you are my Senator
lucky to have senators that care about environment @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand. If you live in WV call @Sen_JoeManchin
@SenSchumer either of you would be worse
@SenSchumer @EPA more Dems obstructionist
@SenSchumer @EPA. Do your job. Stop the obstruction. The president needs his cabinet. We are not paying you to delay
You're only in the senate for your own gain. What did you do for Newark,NJ - not much.
@nawlinsred2010 @EPA With whatever he's been obstructing, I'm sure a withdrawal is soon to come.
@SenSchumer @EPA - sucks to be you guys.. Pruitt is going to lead EPA.
This guy is even a better choice, if you can believe it!
Glad you and @SenatorMenendez will be voting NO to #pollutingPruitt
but you are looking out for special interest, not the American people.
@SenSchumer @EPA it is like Lehman Bros for the Federal Reserve
You've got my back, right? From Southern NJ. Thank You!
@SenSchumer @EPA no.
My senators don't care what we say in SC. Always choose party over people. @SenatorTimScott @LindseyGrahamSC
what about DeVos for education or Sessions for AG. More corruption than 1920s and you're not helping. Disappointed.
we must stop the fracking  king
@SenSchumer @EPA He can't b as bad as you or Schumer as senators!
@SenSchumer @EPA @sendavidperdue @SenatorIsakson NO.
don't tempt them.  They will find someone.
try to delay hearing as judge has finally ordered Pruitt to release 3,000 emails.
Pruitt's record in Oklahoma is proof he is for cutting wasteful spending & will put common sense in EPA
@NancyLeeGrahn @EPA  Luckily YOU are my senator so THANK YOU!
Can a delay be had b/c of the OK judge ruling on the emails?
#Pruitt is #TheWorst
@SenSchumer @EPA I'm lucky I don't have to because your my senator
@SenSchumer @EPA 
Do what Chuck says
@SierraClub @EPA grateful for my @SenatorCantwell and her opposition to @AGScottPruitt. Future generations rely on this!
@SenSchumer @EPA I'll name two: Gina McCarthy, Lisa Jackson. Want more? Any other nut-job that you support. #whyyoulost
Thank heavens *you're* my senator! Go, Cory, go!
thank god he is not my senator, democrats do nothing for the people only themselves.
@SenSchumer @EPA thank God my senators will! @SenDuckworth @SenatorDurbin
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump U r both disgraceful & should b banished. How about 2 Iran or Chicago?
my senator doesn't answer his phone and isn't a big fan of the EPA. Thankfully he's old as dirt and on his last term.
@SenSchumer @EPA My senators are already at ur side! Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin.
are you aligned with the No vote @SenToomey
@Laurasenio @EPA @CoryBooker you're my senator so I don't have to tell you, you already know #Pruitt is terrible!
@SenSchumer @EPA   One of the main things that needs to be cleaned up and detoxed is.... THE EPA!!!!
Little Marco is too deep in the oil company's pockets to do anything
I can. How about Oscar the Grouch? At least he would be more entertaining. 
@SenSchumer @EPA Called 12 Sens 2today.2 humans 9 VM's...1had 3 min of music(WhenJohnnyComesMarchingHomeAgain) b4 VM p/u 
@SenSchumer @EPA I have tried many different ways with nominees. It seems to be all about the $$$ given to Republican party
Michiganders are lucky to have @SenStabenow and @SenGaryPeters, who will both vote no on #pollutingPruitt
Oh, I think Regina McCarthy fit that bill to a tee....
@SenSchumer @EPA really? Cause Flint MI was what an oopsy?
@SenSchumer @EPA I bet you'd say that to any republican that Trump selected.
Ask NOOA about climate warming...FAKE SCIENCE just like you are all FAKE servants of the people!
@SenSchumer @EPA Now think about this the left is saying Pruitt will destroy clean  &  look how insane the Left is
@SenSchumer @EPA I hope for MT's sake @SteveDaines will not vote for @ScottPruittOK -that would be salt to the DeVos wound
@SenSchumer @EPA don't u feel guilty taking a salary from the hard working tax payers to line ur own pockets w/o working
@SenSchumer @EPA My Senators are corrupt. Schumer & Gillibrand; I'm sure they will vote no. But it won't matter. Hahahaha!!
@SenSchumer @EPA Please vote NO to Scott Pruitt for EPA . Please vote no any one the President nominees.
@SenSchumer @EPA I have tried @robportman doesn't care what his constituents want. We continue to call and he doesn't care.
@kaelaishere @EPA come on.  You know it is futile.  #gop doesn't care about us - for some b/c the Bible tells them so.
the democrats lie, cheat and steal, party for politicians.
@DeborahSine @EPA just called Inhoff, left conversation pretty sure O got through to him, gonna mark him down as a 98% no.
Excuse me? Aren't you the former mayor of Newark, N.J.?
But now you're a spokesman for pristine environments?
@SenSchumer @EPA you gonna vote with the Democrats this time?
Senator Booker, you do know that our Republican Reps are not answering phones or responding to emails?They are hiding.
@SenSchumer @EPA unfortunately it does no good to ask my senator to vote for America - @robportman only votes republican
I'd rather tell your constituents to vote NO on YOU!  

@SenSchumer @EPA I live in Kansas..now what? @SenPatRoberts , 
When @POTUS selected #pollutingPruitt, that's when I knew he literally wants to annihilate our gov't.
& @Menendez4NJ please vote no. Side note: Thanks for representing NJ so hororably.
@SenSchumer @EPA I hear manchin is a yes vote. Why is he a dem?
Cancels out McCain who is not a Rep
@SenSchumer @EPA too many terrible issues w Pruitt @SenatorCollins vote no & tell colleagues as well - US deserves better
.@senbookeroffice @epa @senschumer This may come as a shock to you but We The People do our homework and will make up our minds.

"I did not have sexual intercourse with that woman." Technically true too.  Well, as far as I know.
@SierraClub With the money @SenMikeLee and @SenOrrinHatch have accepted from big energy, I know how they're voting. Sold!!
@SenSchumer @EPA tell your senator to vote YES
How can we get a list of who is voting for Pruitt so far?
@SierraClub @EPA Agreed.
@SenSchumer @EPA   So happy my Senators are @CoryBooker and @SenatorMenendez
@SenSchumer @EPA Fix Newark you failure. You, Schrumer, and Cummings all fail your states.
Wrong you back stabber.  Happy to encourage GOP to vote YES, tyvm
as Christian, how can you be OK with destroying God's creations?
@SenSchumer @EPA I will, but one of my Senators is @SenToomey, so guess how that will go. At least we have @SenBobCasey
