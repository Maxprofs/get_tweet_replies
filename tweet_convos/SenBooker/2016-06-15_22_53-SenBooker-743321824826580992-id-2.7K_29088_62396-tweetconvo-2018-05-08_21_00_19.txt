Congrats! Neither will become law, and all of this will cost you votes and further polarize the issue. Well done.
So, we should just do nothing then?
Compromise on this issue is only possible if the gun control side genuinely recognizes and respects concept of gun rights.
I can tell you that is not the case. We are for responsible ownership& background checks. Also for ban on semi/automatic weapons.
Murphy is among them. This makes enacting sensible compromise impossible, b/c it makes slippery slope argument valid.
You will always have the extreme voices.  Murphy is understandable given Sandy Hook.  He is not the majority.
I agree. But loud voices like his (and @AugustLady241 and @Brianrrs37) will prevent any progress.
Thank you. Thank you so much for your persistence. #filibuster
What the media never tells you,it's not a meme @Rambobiggs @JaredWyand @A_M_Perez
How lame is this?  LOLOLOL
Lol isnt an appropriate reply but proves UR apathy or ignorance
The propaganda you're pushing is absurb. CONSPIRACY THEORY MUCH?
DHS refugee concerns isn't a CONSPIRACY
Plainly a right wing rag - please provide credible sources
Homeland http://security.gov 
Lets do back ground checks on Americans as we ship in refugees without background checks=morons
Luckily, that's not what happens. Do some research.  http://time.com/4116619/syrian-refugees-screening-process/ … @ChrisMurphyCT
I most definitely will do research using non propaganda resources
Then why are you citing propaganda. #you're confused@ChrisMurphyCT
Do yourself a favor and research CIA propaganda on American citizens & in media.I know it's easier for to put labels on issues
I stand with you! Law Enforcement Stands with You!!!!  #NYPD
Most LE do not stand with unlawful revocation of rights. You think gun control works? Chicago, DC. Wrong.

Well done, @ChrisMurphyCT! Way to hang in there and demand a vote!
@CoryBooker @SenateDems @elizabethforma thanks for your courage & giving us a voice today #filibuster #HoldTheFloor #Enough
thanks now we need to work on mental health issues
@NaphiSoc And Cory booker should be cc'd on all of these thanks!

@TheDemocrats Thanks for the filibuster. Not voting for Republicans who are bankrolled by gun lobby.
way to go! Now @NancyPelosi  needs to get it this going in the house
Thank you sir. It's a #HappyFathersDay. #EnoughIsEnough
This is what true leadership looks like! Thank you for your strength and courage! #filibuster #Enough #HoldTheFloor

Thank you @ChrisMurphyCT for leading this important effort and for giving us back the hope that indeed the Senate will act on gun control.

Good work, @ChrisMurphyCT 
Thank you, your persistence on this common sense issue will save lives. You're a true American hero.
@wxdam We need to reinstate the assault weapons ban. NO citizen has a need for a military-grade assult rifle...for ANY reason
thank you!!!  As a mother I applaud your efforts.  #DisarmHate @MomsDemand
How about making them commit to a vote to ban assault weapons.
Don't forget to tell them to ban bombs in Istanbul too!! Gotta stop the madness!!
YES!
Thank you
Thank you for standing up for a just and reasonable cause. Please keep fighting for us.
Thank you so much and for you and your colleagues doing the work of the people. #filibuster
Thank you, @ChrisMurphyCT
Amazing! Thank you and hopefully they will let you go to the bathroom soon! :D
thank you for doing this and for bringing accountability to legislature.
@SUPGVNetwork BRAVO & tons of thanks, from Oregon!  So grateful for your courage & leadership on this. Must stop terror HERE!
@TheSciBabe how very democratic of you. Except I didn't vote on this...
God bless
Thank you!  Next up, banning assault weapons!
.@ChrisMurphyCT THANK YOU so much for your leadership and your backbone, Senator. Millions support you! #enough #orlando #holdthefloor
Thank you for what you did tonight. It was one of the most inspiring things I’ve seen happen in politics in a long time.
thank you for all you have done! 
SO PROUD! #DemFilibuster #holdthefloor
There are already background checks or did yall not know this. Have you ever bought a gun? #filibuster good job on terror gap
Not for those purchasing through online sales and gun shows
yes there are.  if you buy a gun online you must declare a licensed gun store to pick it up and check is done
plus only federally licensed sellers are required to do checks, and not all sellers are required to be licensed
Wrong.  @Trelios @ChrisMurphyCT
Well done. It's a start, but only scratching the surface.
Perhaps when the sky doesn't fall, can do more.
Look to Australia.
@PFischler oh ok
@ElenaWCLatin4BO Excellent Filibuster!! Proud of you #Senator #SiSePuede
Thank you We need you and your colleagues to advocate...#OrlandoUnited #gunviolence 
Thank you for what you did today, sir.

#Newtown #Orlando

Its amazing how @MSNBC @cnnbrk @CarmineZozzora keep on fooling the American people
Thank you, Senator Murphy!
You are my hero!  You did an amazing thing to force the votes.  Let everyone know what senators do not want to limit guns.

Gun violence happens due to brainwashing not an inanimate object,FBI knew Mateen
Well done! So sad that it took more lives to get this done, but am heartily applauding your monumental effort & success here!

cool, but this wouldn't have prevented any of the recent headline mass shootings, right?
 Tell us how we can help/donate/support you
God bless you. Thank you for your courage.
Enjoy it until the next Islamic butcher strikes.
Thank You for your service!!!!!!
Unfortunately this will not ban the gun used in the shooting since the AR 15 is not an assault rifle.
Thank you!
I agree with the proposed measures, but let's be honest here, none of these measures would of prevented the Orlando shootings
@CoryBooker so happy & so proud to be a democrat today. THANK YOU for all your hard work in the #filibuster
Thank you for standing up to the @GOP & the @NRA #enough #filibuster #gunsense
Thank you.
will you run for president ?
Thank you!
Does this mean that all law enforcement agencies and medical will share their information? If not, we fall short...
medical agencies cannot due to privacy laws- I guess u want to give those up
thank you.
@rezaaslan Thank you Senator Murphy!

Great first step, but if they don't pass, nothing changes. Will you try again if they don't pass?
