.@CoryBooker @SenSanders @SenBobCasey statement on CBO score of Affordable & Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act: https://buff.ly/2u8b5ai  
Sorry Cory Booker but you are paid off by Big Pharma! You were one of the 13 Dem that voted with the Rep & voted against lowering drug cost
You have no credibility when it comes to your big pharma corporate sponsors.
really? an actual bill and NO credibility? Grow up.
If you are so worried about drug safety then why did you vote for the 21st Century Cures Act! I love what the Dems do but this is not cool!
Watch this get passed and pharmaceutical companies swoop in to acquire marijuana businesses and make the price of marijuana skyrocket.
Actually what would happen is they'd compete and it would lower costs just like every other market like the phone you're tweeting from
You should be ashamed of yourself voting to keep funding Palestinian pay outs for terrorists. You sir are a sad little man.
Like the ACA saved $2,500 per family? You couldn't even make that marker.
I wish Dems would occasionally compromise like Reps do. They block everything from Reps but always ask for 'bipartisanship' on their agenda.
You should have joined us last time Cory.  Very disappointed.
The problem with bills formed by the demo. party is that they always want to fold in all of their hidden agendas against personal freedoms!
It's an abomination that so many,especially seniors, must choose beteeen buying food vs medicines!

Love seeing positive joint statements from incredible politicians @CoryBooker @SenSanders @SenBobCasey  ... hope the GOP gets onboard 
These policies are aweful and have no place in the USA. We left socialist Europe and people migrate here for a reason
You join them first.
Why have health insurance if we can't afford to use it?  Useless labs, tests & not taking back bad medication is hurting SSI recipients.
U will never be president
Don't say never!

@SenSanders @USCBO U all set around and get high that is why u want legalize it and u work for gov bet none of u do drug test
Long overdue! As a fairly healthy, affluent senior my monthly med bill & what Medicare & ins pay make me worry about others w less pls hurry
@SenBookerOffice @SenSanders @SenBobCasey hey Senator.  What was the scoring on ACA when it first came out from CBO? Oops
Medicare & Social Security is for ppl that have worked all their Lives & Companies took $ out of their wkly Paychecks for Retirement..
IF You Give ALL PPL MEDICARE, the People that Worked & PAID for Medicare & Social Security WILL HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO RETIRE ON.
Miller & Trump say bring in educated immigrants. Black youth w/o education can do the field work migrants do. Why not focus on education.
You may be right. After all, it's in their nature, right?
Senator, something you and many other American need to be informed about. Visit: …http://dealingfromthebottomofthedeck.blogspot.com 

Thank You!

Thank You Sir.
Sensible
This is great thanks!!!
Now you're cool with this Cory?
What about Pharma kickbacks?
Noticed you have good stuff lately - next you will want to get us out of the Middle East and spend a trillion on solar - right? Hope so
And why would you expect senate reps to join you? What have you "joined" them on?? You ppl are a damn joke. God help you ALL!
You eant to bankruot america for votes
MORE LIES JUST LIKE YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CURRENT HEALTH PLAN,KEEP YOUR Dr. PREMIUMS WILL GO DOWN $2500   DEDUCTIBLES CUT IN HALF  MORE DEM LIES
Now when I stop it's legal lol, however, the job market doesn't honor legality, federals back off
Most are like a fish out of water they just flip flop flip flop
Creditability is in the eye on the beholder...
YES!!!!!!!
great step in the right direction but I'm not forgetting how you voted against this the first time. No more corporatism
but why did you accept money from Big Pharma?
#MedicareForAll Cory!
No Half Measures!
No More #DNC Bullshit!
#NeverBooker

A shame Obamacare was pushed when Dems were in control & not single payer. Then they turned over the surveillance state to Trump. Good job.
What lobbyists are you taking money from?
Please support!every one please

Cory - We want single-payer, Nothing less. Maybe Senate Dems should join us.
You didn't help Republicans with skyrocketing Health Insurance cost. Didn't even vote for Single payer amendment. How hippocritical. IDOITS
It's really hard to listen to anyone who backs Obamacare talk about skyrocketing drug costs
Why did he vote against Sanders bill to import drugs at a fair price?
Stop trump with congress override bills
You're missing that Canada has cheap drugs because ours cost a lot. Once we try to import, everyone's costs will go up.
Thanks!
@SenSanders @USCBO @SenBookerOffice @SenBobCasey still not voting for you in 2020 nice try.
Cory Booker buying votes for his run at 2020 President with Drug votes. He is selling our youth to drugs.  #EvilManHatesKids
#medicareForAll
The US CBO has been proven wrong with Obamacare. As premiums are increasing and insurance companies pulling out of states
I am single With no kids Seeking for true Love partner I hope I will see and if you want too know more about me text me (909) 274-9216
Some republicans did vote for it last time when you voted no.
#TRMS @CoryBooker on common sense & social justice benefits of nationwide legalized pot | @JoyAnnReid in for @Maddow
Our present system is broken and needs to be fixed. Marijuana should be legalized at the federal level and states can decide their needs.
I'm glad the pressure from the last time you voted against similar legislation worked. Keep it that way.
You say republicans should join you, but your not willing to cross the isle. Same old garbage from you.
*You're
Thank you Senator for all that you do to put Americans first!
You did nothing to help New Jersey. Your worst than Governor
I'd rather not be able to pay for medication than food.
Who could have seen #Venezuela coming? Me a highschool dropout that looked up socialism with my friends.
#FreeKekistan.
Will you be voting 'yes' this time around?
Then why did you vote against lowering drug costs last time after a big bribe from big pharma?

@SenSanders @USCBO @SenBookerOffice @SenBobCasey Full of Shit! Look at the attached picture! You voted NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
that image was found to be "FALSE" by Politifact months ago:

Where was your wanting to help the last 8 years. Just more of the same. Lies lies lies and more lies. Never stops lies lies
Your another HRC we will never vote for you for potus so stick to saving cats shoveling snow and taking money donations from TRUMPS
*You're
its shame republicans won't get behind anything that help the ACA
No one believes anything u say cory! U take $ from everyone
Democrats voted down every gop amendment to reduce drug costs during the obamacare debates. Dems took pharmas 80 billion and now it's gone.
Good first step & GOP should get on board IF THEY ARE CONFRONTED. ASK YOUR SENATOR, "DO YOU REPRESENT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR PHARMA? CHOOSE"
Stop sending money to the Apartheid state of Israel, u will be saving billions too.
LEGALIZE!!!!!!!!
You could have done this earlier, you shill. You're only doing it because #BigPharma's going to co-opt pot sales.
booker did already...he introduced the 1st-ever marijuana bill in the Senate called the CARERS Act couple years ago:
@SenBobCasey thank you for your leadership on this issue!
@SenBookerOffice @SenSanders @SenBobCasey Subway want to pass the bill to get more money at a pharmaceutical more money
Thanks
Hey that's what that used car guy Obama said,
Does it come w whitewalls?
Anything that you can do to help us from the crushing increases of health insurance and prescriptions is much appreciated! Thanks,  Cory. 
How about making people get jobs with insurance instead of handouts. Now my private insurance is taking away things they use to pay for ty
My congressman is Steven Palzzo from Ms. Since its a long trip and ur already there would you mind walking over and slapping him stupid..er?
Fk you snowflake dems your losers
WADR, ALL U.S. FAMILIES NEED & WANT & DESERVE #UniversalHealthcare NOW! @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov WORK! HELP U.S. MAKE THEM WORK 4 ALLOfUS!
Thanks for keeping up the good trouble!
After 30 years Sanders is sponsoring a bill? He must want to ride Cory's coat tails
Thank you!!!!!
You seem to have an unhealthy urge to be involved with drugs; make it easier for kids to get stoned on drugs, phony TBone, drug criminals...
LOL... Are you high??? Judging by your twitter feed intelligence isn't an attribute you appear to possess...
@CoryBooker You are on fire, sir! Keep the bills comin'!
I have better idea for every highly educated immigrant a company or govt agency hires-must furnish a scholarship for a talented American.
We don't need highly educated immigrants we need to educate talented Americans who are priced out of an education.
I hope the dems are stockpiling all the lies trump is giving us for ads that will target moderate voters in 2018 mids  #fightfirewithfire
Glad your attempting to push a bill through however, I'd be surprised if the WE will pass it allowing you to take the credit.
Booker wrote the bill....like literally wrote it. In other words, this is his bill. So he'll probably take credit. Just wanted to clarify.
Thanks for clarifying, In a world where all people will choose love b4 violence & respect b4 racism you would be correct. 
Thanks for jumping on this.....eventually.
It's not just drug costs. There needs to be a high level analysis of profit margins in healthcare. The profit motive corrupts our "system."
Welcome to America. Government has no right telling private companies how much profit it "too much". You're more than free to make your own.
Hope it works.  I could see pharma state lost revenue due to foreign drugs led to more increases
It's hard for them to join when they are stuffing pharma $$ in their pociets @GOP @housebudgetGOP
