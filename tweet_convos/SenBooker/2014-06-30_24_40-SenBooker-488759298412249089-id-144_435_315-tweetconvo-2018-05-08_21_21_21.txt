@PattyMurray @Dorian_Sage then he shouldn't pay for them!
True, @PattyMurray. & they rn't my GOVERNMENT'S business, either. Thanks 2 U & #ACA, can no longer 2 choose dr they want. @RedNationRising
@arbitrage789 @RedNationRising @PattyMurray No - does that make me a racist? Sure as hell don't want @PattyMurray there; must be anti- 2.
@PattyMurray @GKMTNtwits When Democrats sit idle and let POTUS' enemies run govt, THIS IS WHAT YOU GET! Every setback is Democrat failure.
@angelwryter @PattyMurray I certainly agree that Democrats failed in 2010 & frankly, I'm not sure if they will in November or not. Sad.
@GKMTNtwits @PattyMurray I think November will be better than expected. Democrats have NO cohesion skills. They can't corral constituents.
@GKMTNtwits @PattyMurray Issues are not being communicated like GOP does with lies. Folks believe 1st story they hear. GOP only ones talking
@angelwryter Agree.
@PattyMurray Does it bother u in the LEAST that u'r a such a straight-up liar?  have as many BC options 2day as they did b4 SCOTUS decision
I believe it; @PattyMurray's going 2 keep working 2 ensure everything we do & think is under GOV'T control. #Facist #tcot #tpfa
@PattyMurray  But you want him to pay for them anyway. Yep, you're stupid and a communist.
@PattyMurray If an employee doesn't like their employers insurance plan, then they can purchase a plan individually.  How stupid are you???
@PattyMurray
@PattyMurray what decision was taken away?  How on earth do people like you get elected, you are mind numbingly stupid or lying, both bad.
@PattyMurray This really isn't true, workers do not need to have their bosses permission to take birth control.  Why do you say it?
@PattyMurray So why is the government making decisions about my Healthcare? The Government is not my boss either! This is insane!
@PattyMurray You don't speak for #YesAllWomen. Liberals are brain washing lunatics with no other intentions than votes.
@PattyMurray Really trying 2 overturn a Supreme Court decision with a bill in Congress? Willing to run over the Religious freedoms of ppl?
@PattyMurray It sure isn't. Nor is paying for it the boss's business.
@PattyMurray If it's not my boss's business, then it's NOT their responsibility either...unless I am sleeping with him or her. PERIOD~
@PattyMurray sorry u pathetic bitch if the "boss" is paying 4 it they have a right!  U as a lowlife POS have no say!
@PattyMurray You are absolutely right, no boss has that right.  That also goes for you, and the polictical demons, DEMS STFU. Socialist
@PattyMurray Exactly. He/she shouldn't have to even think about your birth control. Get it at Walmart for $6.94 --> http://www.walmart.com/ip/11046873?wmlspartner=wlpa&adid=22222222227000047851&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=42208071550&wl4=&wl5=pla&wl6=34821987070&veh=sem …
@PattyMurray Businesses arent stopping women from doing these things, they are practicing their religious freedom to not pay for it.
@PattyMurray You're not embarassed by this ridiculous hashtag & why is it lib women r not capability of making own decisions-too dependent?
@PattyMurray Agreed that its #NotMyBossBusiness, therefore the Boss shouldn't pay for it #Scotus #HobbyLobby #tcot
@PattyMurray So you & #Democrats R giving the finger to the #FirstAmendment? #Tyrant #Lawless #NotMyBossBusiness #SCOTUS #HobbyLobby
@PattyMurray Absurd. Your "base" doesn't believe it either, they just echo it back for your approval. WA Voters WAY smarter than you think.
@PattyMurray I'M CONVINCED!. Suppose A boss has 600 employees,60% women & CANCELLS Corp plan,and pays fine.What do YOU say to women? #TCOT
@PattyMurray @RepDianaDeGette My healthcare is no ones business but my doctor... so #CONGRESS If you are excempt so are the people #UNLAWFUL
@PattyMurray You're such a #hypocrite! You are not for choice! You are for bullying people to get your way. Shameful excuse for a Senator.
@PattyMurray They still do, and you'd know that if you'd read the decision. http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf …   Pgs 9-10.
@PattyMurray Is it Common Core math that makes you think 16/20 = 4/5 = 0?
@PattyMurray But your promiscuity is. ?? #WTF?
@PattyMurray Hobby Lobby DOES pay for 16 out of 20 forms of birth control, IDIOT!
@PattyMurray THANK YOU!
@PattyMurray Isaiah 5:20 Woe to those who call evil good and good evil
@PattyMurray Their not the Governments decision either. Get out of MY life. Americans for Liberty
@PattyMurray Holly Lobby offers SIXTEEN methods of birth control. When do women take responsibility? Just stop the whining.
@PattyMurray Why are you lying about this and promoting a false narrative?
@PattyMurray  As a WA state woman, I'm disturbed at your infringement of my freedoms. How about instead #notmygovernmentsbusiness
@PattyMurray IT IS THE BOSS'S BUSINESS WHEN THE BOSS IS PAYING THE PRICE FOR IT.
@PattyMurray My health care decisions are NOT obama's business -- PERIOD. Wait ...what? #obamacare #obamacarelies
Thx @MarkUdall & > MT @PattyMurray Your health care decisions are not your boss's business -- period.  via @SkreetGil
@PattyMurray DUMB ASS, THE BOSS PAYS THE BILLS, QUIT IF YOU DONT LIKE IT. GO WORK FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD THEY HIRE SLUTS IM SURE
@PattyMurray My boss doesn't own his own business? It's not his business? What an idiotic name for a bill. Of course YOU came up with it.
@PattyMurray thank you!
@PattyMurray Tons and tons of thanks from NJ, Senator!
@JohnFosterWay @PattyMurray Patty Murray, still a joke
@PattyMurray U R being deceptive about the courts decision.They disallowed abortion inducing drugs. U R pandering to low information voters.
@PattyMurray Congrats on the political stunt and for continuing to promote anti-small business laws.  #notmysenatorsbusiness
@PattyMurray Nor should are our healthcare decisions be made by the Government Patty!!!!
@PattyMurray Ur grasp of the SCOTUS Hobby Lobby decision is ignorant & partisan. Start a false narrative if U don't get ur way. LIBERAL LIES
@PattyMurray Sen. Murray, what can I do to help?! What can WE in the grassroots do to help?! I want your bill to pass SO terribly bad!
@PattyMurray #NotMyBossBusiness but #MyBossBetterPonyUp
@PattyMurray Not the boss's business but oh BTW the boss has to pay for what is not their business. Do u not get the insanity of that?
@PattyMurray You're right.  So stop making businesses pay for your health care decisions!!!  Novel idea ...
@PattyMurray then why do  you want him to pay for it?
@PattyMurray @PPact nor are they your boss's financial responsibility.
@PattyMurray @MarkUdall Our #healthcare decisions are not the government's business. You're not the boss of us! #SCOTUS #HobbyLobby
@PattyMurray @PPact Not the govt's decision either, Patty
@PattyMurray @PPact  Abortion chemicals cause birth defects & bleeding for 30 days.TOXIC Safety & effectiveness still being monitored by FDA
@PattyMurray @PPact 5-8% of women will need Emergency Care 
when taking the abortion pill.   Dangerous & NOT healthcare!
@PattyMurray @PPact Yeah, they kind of are if you're asking your boss to pay for your birth-control or abortion drugs.
@PattyMurray Congrats on your 250★ tweet! http://favstar.fm/t/483696687673008128 …
@PattyMurray @PPact This is why we need a female president.While Obama understands, no one will fight 4 our rights as much as a woman.
@PattyMurray  We stand with you!
@PattyMurray Oh, I'm sure it will pass tha House, right? This Bill is DOA!!
@PattyMurray REALLY? Then why do you while insist that  bosses pay for those decisions?
@PattyMurray   You mean to murder their unborn kids and have someone else pay for the murder!  Nothing more than Murder for Hire!
@PattyMurray It'll never pass. You wasted OUR time and taxpayer money writing this bill.
@PattyMurray They are when YOU force them to pay for them, you dolt!
@PattyMurray When you make the boss pay for it, you bet it is his/her business. How dumb and dim are you?
@PattyMurray You all did that by tying health insurance to the work place & by making BC unavailable OTC, dummies. You all are the problem.
.@PattyMurray .@govinslee Pls help this mother & her children #CPS needs #oversight #injustice #stopabuse #ProBono
@PattyMurray The sin of omission is as bad as the sin of commission. In lying to followers U made Hobby Lobby look like they gave no BC.
.@PattyMurray @JohnFosterWay 
 ... 
@PattyMurray They are if they pay for it! Otherwise, pay for your own damn abortion drugs/IUD's! #HobbyLobby
Thank you Senator! MT @PattyMurray Your health care decisions are not your boss's business. #NotMyBossBusiness
@PPVotesNW @PattyMurray No, its just the Governments decision...Ignorant lemming. #cspanchat #tcot #ImpeachObama
@PattyMurray we give planned parenthood $500 million a year …let them go there for free abortions.
@PattyMurray they are when your boss PAYS for them, you ignorant clown.
@PattyMurray Women can still make their own decisions. They just can't have their hand in the bosses wallet when they do. #HobbyLobby
Completely appalled by the RW SCOTUS decision, this is just the beginning with them! GOPers own this, need to answer!  @PattyMurray @mkaee
@PattyMurray @LindaCollins11 Many VETS do not even have the option for health care;plez sign the petition now http://bit.ly/vasurgepetition 
@PattyMurray The corrupt NOT-SCt has turned itself into a law MAKING entity. Unconstitutional.  See Art 3 Sec 1.  FIRE THEM. Bad behavior.
@PattyMurray As always, the key question--what are you going to do about it?  Don't give vague statements like you did yesterday.
. @PattyMurray Au contraire, when you force the boss to pay for it, I think it becomes his/her business. #NotMyBossBusiness
@PattyMurray: Which is precisely why bosses shouldn't have to pay for it. Why not a bill that cuts out employers from providing insurance?
@PattyMurray thank you!
@PattyMurray @Nupe117 period. 
You on your period? That's why you cranky huh? Hormones.
“@PattyMurray: Your health care decisions are not your boss's business #SCOTUS #HobbyLobby ”

Pay your own bills, lib.
@PattyMurray @WendyBarranco it's not your boss's business? Ok. Why are you also demanding they pay for it too? #LogicalContradiction
@WarMed_117 @PattyMurray @WendyBarranco Amen.
Why would you address a situation that is NOT in play? You are appealing to any in your base that does not have the facts! @PattyMurray
Okay,@PattyMurray but don't make any more compromises* with #PaulRyan @DeSotoDem
Feel free to make your own decision. Just don't expect to force someone else to pay for it. @PattyMurray
@Kelebration @PattyMurray - Clearly anti-woman since no other group would request these services! How this passed the sniff test is amazing!
@PattyMurray Not to worry the have been bleeding WOMEN VOTERS for some time now, EVEN WHITE WOMEN leaving #GOP Women outraged WILL VOTE #DEM
@Wary12 @PattyMurray Wow...Ignorance is stunning. Believe the parade of horribles from the misleading DemRats if you dont like freedom
@PattyMurray @citizensrock You got 0 GOP votes for ACA, could've passed #SinglePayer, @SenateDems. THAT's what was best for women & kids.
@PattyMurray thank u
@PattyMurray then don't ask them to pay for it
@PattyMurray SCOTUS agrees. Why should someone pay for someone elses business? #freeatlast
@PattyMurray that's great as long as my tax dollars don't pay for it! #tcot
@PattyMurray they are our government's though?
@PattyMurray Your health care privileges are not your boss's expense over their religious freedom. Out to change the constitution then?
@PattyMurray Nothing changed about your rights to abortion. If you believe in it, it's still your choice.
@PattyMurray hense my first comment IS SUMED AS SUCH YOU CARE MORE ABOUT KILLING BABIES THAN YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE.
@PattyMurray categorized incorrectly this ruling was about abortion the morning after pill is not contraception.
@PattyMurray and you have never read one word in the bible, this isnt about contraception its about the morning after pill being
@PattyMurray were you a NAZI before you were a public school teacher or after because its obvious you weren't an economics major
@PattyMurray NO F ING WAY WIKIPEDIA HAS YOU AS A ROMAN CATHOLIC!
@PattyMurray Sadly you among the majority of @HouseDemocrats and @SenateDems took everyone's right to make such decisions with Obamacare
@PattyMurray If it's not your boss's business, he or she should not have to pay for it.  Get an abortion, just pay for it yourself.
@PattyMurray Funny that YOUR boss @BarackObama made it HIS business.
@PattyMurray I thought THE ACA would be scraped if any part of the law wasn't inacted? SO TAKE YOUR SOCIALISTIC VIEWS AND RESIGN, NAZI!
@PattyMurray awesome I agree Patty.  Then quit having bosses pay for them
@PattyMurray Senator your completely right their own decisions to buy it themselves. Not the bosses to buy it for them. Be responsible.
@PattyMurray our health care decisions should not be the governments either SMH
@PattyMurray Really Senator, what a waste. Women can still make their own decisions about their own health care. @smg1054
@PattyMurray you care more about the morning after pill than the IRS, BENGHAZI, ARMS TO OUR ENEMY AL QAEDA, VA, AP and the list goes on.
@PattyMurray So what's your plan?  How will you accomplish this?  Legislation?  Fundraising?  Tweeting?
@PattyMurray You realize women can still make their own decisions on bc... are you people retarded?
@PattyMurray This is so bad Senator. So, so bad! I cannot believe that these rulings keep happening. To cite WebMd is just shameful. @NARAL
@johngio48 Oh John...so dramatic! Don't have time for RWNJ'S! Buh-bye...#BLOCKED! cc: @PattyMurray @NARAL
@PattyMurray You should also pay the price for your law based on lies and deception, SCOTUS should throw the law out after seeing these lies
@PattyMurray How does the SCOTUS decision take that away from Women?  HL provided 16 of 20 methods from Ocare. Seems like partisan hysterics
@CRTinyDuffy @PattyMurray Yep...and the other 4 must still be provided at no cost sharing. Zero impact. Pg.10 http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf …
@PattyMurray Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That's all I am going to say.  And does your husband need one bag or two when boning you?
@skzdalimit What a scumbag you are! #REPORTED and #BLOCKED!             cc to: @PattyMurray
@mushroomfeet 1st Amendment.  Blow me.
@PattyMurray So, you plan to build consensus and develop an amendment or do you plan to circumvent the Judicial Branch aka Pres. Jackson?
@PattyMurray EXACTLY, I pay for FEHB insurance from my retirement.
@PattyMurray I voted for you ma'am & counting on you & all Democrats to VOTE for what the people need & want.
.@murraycampaign must be really mad at @PattyMurray for supporting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
@PattyMurray women can make their own decisions only difference is now THEY will be responsible for paying for those decisions not others.
@MariaACooper @PattyMurray Or perhaps their partners should pay. However, I've yet to see much of that in 24 years of OB/GYN care.
