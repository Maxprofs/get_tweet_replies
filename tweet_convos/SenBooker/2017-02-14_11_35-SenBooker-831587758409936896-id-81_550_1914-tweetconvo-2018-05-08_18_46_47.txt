the bucket is filling with doubt n ques fight for us all for the answer like u always did in newark u r always for the ppl
Questions like "Is Flynn going to plead the 5th"? "Will Trump be first president in history to pardon himself"?
please start process to strip Flynn's rank & benefits. No way we should pay for his comfort in retirement when he sold US.
@JackieFarnham It also is telling how administration is trying to sweep it under rug. What is being hidden?
@CoryBooker 

I'm a supporter of yours, but talk is easy. What YOU plan to do about it. It's time for LEADERSHIP. Show it.
Jimbo, if you haven't seen the work, Cory's been doing maybe start paying more attention. @Jimbo_zimbo
You don't know me, but one thing I do is pay attention. Obviously, my tweet struck too close to home for you. Sorry.
Yeah, I take it personally when one of the guys actually doing something gets crap from randos on Twitter. @Jimbo_zimbo
I understand your hurt feelings but my asking him what he plans to do is not giving him crap, nor does it make me a rando.
@whitewatercrew tells me John McCain using @katiecouric connection to get revenge on #Flynn. He stood up 2 Obama! #Patriot
WH leaks - #draintheswamp of every Obama hire NOW! We won't stop fighting to take USA back !
Why do you not care about being ruled by a dictator who is so inept?
It would be nice to see flynn roll over on trump
would be yes. Major investigation into possible treason on many in campaign have to go push representatives
Not under Trump it was under that POS barack... Flynn lied to VP and to President Trump!
@FreddyRoo2 Follow the money.  I laid out a possible case here.
So have an investigation. But don't accuse without any proof. If your right I'll be the first to back you.
@CoryBooker this is so scary. The whole Trump administration is like a bad nightmare. Time for Trump and his team 2 b gone!
@kenkircher1 Absolutely will H.R. 530 SECURE Our Democracy Act, help? & if so #passtheSODA
@SWFLBeachBabe That's rich coming from a liberal!!! The party that lies for BO, Hillary, Holder, Pelosi etc.
Honored to be followed by Sen Booker. Thank you 4 your great speech ftom the Senate floor the night Sen Warren was silenced
@CoryBooker Trump has a cabinet of criminals and those that are "yessir boss" type of idiots, he's surrounded by idiots!!!!
@CoryBooker Trump has gotten away with Treason several times, he's a Traitor, has committed espionage on his own country!!!
@CoryBooker should b stipulations n the COTUS 2 get rid of entire ADMN & the Pres when something like this occur. #impeach
@CoryBooker very divisive Cory. Need to start working together.
@CoryBooker Rather than look for ties shouldn't you attempt to write legislature to help Americans?
I am very concerned that #tRump's issue is that the issue went public, not that Flynn could be blackmailed.
Yes! As Sen. Corker appeared to even suggest today, full investigation, without it the US is stuck in place
, that is actually not news. The Russians have done that for decades as have we. The ship is in international waters.
We the People need to find out the truth.
What kind of an new Administration is this? #Resist Trump
We're relying on you to find out!
saw your video talking about how hard you work into the nite that's what we expect public servants to do #notimpressed
@CoryBooker. Press on Sen. Booker. See how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Could we ask the United Nations to investigate Trump's ties to Russia if the Republican Party refuses?
@CoryBooker Hooray for you Sen. Booker.  You are a man of character and a Patriot.
Biggest question is: How soon can we trace trail back to Trump, bring him to & stop him from ruining US more?
@CoryBooker no... Just Flynn's communications
Questions far beyond "communications". My money on barely an innocent in WH, while @GOP pretends 'Flynn gone, Problem gone'
@CoryBooker What about all the officials who resigned during the Obama administration? Which includes Flynn!!!! #MAGA
Flynn was told to resign or he would lose some stars and/or possible retirement
Then PLEASE find a way to investigate. 
If this happened during #44, they'd already have at least 3 special commissions.
Totally Agree...and what about all the BS about arresting Hilary...Really?? #IMPEACH
Thank you!!!
@whitewatercrew Book, it's time to open or call for a multi-faceted investigation. WE NEED TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING NOW.
@MoniquePressley There were concerns about @realDonaldTrump, but they were not addressed previously?
@CoryBooker Citizens have right to know the WHOLE TRUTH. Please continue to fight for us and we will #PERSIST to #RESIST
@CoryBooker Yes, it does..please keep fighting & #Persist ing 4 us all ... TY #WeThePeople #LoveArmy
@CoryBooker I want special prosecutor for Flynn, along with another for Clinton. I want answers and accountability.
@CoryBooker go after him Senator. We need you to be strong, we are with you.
@CoryBooker The republicans would have rebuked President Obama immediately, but only continue to enable 45.
dead horse? Do something that addresses real problems
Yes, it does. Please pursue this--I don't feel safe as citizen or country with an admin that behaves this way
@CoryBooker it's your job to get the answers now!
@CoryBooker what about Obama Homeland security using private and unsecure servers any red flags there for you
too bad @SpeakerRyan is so corrupt, he refuses to "allow" an investigation.  He needs to stack the deck first.
@CoryBooker thank you for speaking up for your constituents and the rest of us who feel we matter less every day.
@CoryBooker use the IG
@CoryBooker   he's seen the intel let and who else has seen it and knows it's a matter of when it trickles
@CoryBooker start asking!
please push to get the answers we need on Russia. Putin Trump and Flint!!!
@CoryBooker Trumps whole cabinet needs to be investagated
@CoryBooker AND we the people require answers.
Correct!  #russianhacking #comey need to be investigated.
Happy Valentine's, Senator!
I wouldn't want @TheDemocrats to waste an opportunity to delay and throw more mud.
really what now? How many questions? Are any worth really spending time and money on? Is this just more political BS?
ADMISSION OF GUILT!!!
Make them #DoTheirJob
the theory of secret communications will be revealed cats out the bag now
Keep asking questions of your colleagues across the aisle until you get the right answers.
please do not consider any Supreme Court nominees until Constitutional issues about POTUS are resolved.
drain the #peeparty
we need an independent investigation immediately. Leaks are what's saving us now let's get to the bottom of this.
@CoryBooker thank u for ur strong statement! Pls #withholdconsent #filibuster until Ind Committee investigates Russia-Trump
Yes it sure does. Please #PressOn and #StandUpToTrump. We need strong leaders, since most of the @GOP lacks integrity.
@realDonaldTrump Cory now jumps on the bandwagon of Garbage tweets. In the end this issue is over, and never important
Looking forward to a thorough, independent, and transparent investigation of all matters related to such communications.
In that other dimension/reality we didn't get.
Now this is something Congress SHOULD investigate and Manafort and Trump's tax returns and on and on and on and on and on..
we need an independent investigation into Russia ties. This is a dire security crisis and a threat to our democracy.
I am more concerned about the leaks.
