Oh you're of the #TheResistance GROUPIES, What did you resist in the last 8 years of Obama? 7 illegal wars? Wall street?
- gosh Wade, you got ugly quick.
serious ?, since the ACA started falling a part 2yrs ago, what plans do DEMS have to fix it and why has the public not seen it
It could have been fixed but GOP hell bent on OBSTRUCTION Now its your turn
obstruction would have been to repeal it already, that has not happened. U need to GOP to fix a law DEMS created/pushed?
Watch us BLUE staters move forward WHILE you red staters stay stuck in the mud JOBS follow PROGRESS not Regress
blue states are dying out like ACA
If you've have a terminal illness you wouldn't say that when OC has actually helped my life.
your mind is made and obviously it's fogged by hate so your opinion is shit
LOL Bullshit? Just leave
Typical to Trump. Focus on money rather than humanity
Your vote on medications disgusts me. You are as hypocritical and corrupt as they come. In the pockets of #BigPharma. Shame on U
looking forward to eagerly oppose this sell outs presidential bid in whatever capacity I can. #NeverForget
There is a plan! Did you read it or do you just like hearing yourself whine! Give it a chance man. Keep an open mind!
you are such a powerful and influential person. Keep pressing forward on the issues for people!
@TrumpResist  Go Cory Go!
I'm legally blind. **High prescription costs** force me to stay on disability. I want to produce; the environment discriminates.
how about one prescription away from a negative balance?
then why did you vote against the @BernieSanders bill to reduce prescription drug prices? Hmmmm?
Keep up the fight, Senator Booker. We have your back.
blah blah blah… That sounds real good, but you keep having to look down and read the script you wrote because it's DINO BS!
why did you vote against lowering drug costs?
If Dems want to lose even more devastatingly in 2020 rally around this pharma/wall street tool who values $ over human health
Hey hypocrite, why did you oppose drug importation?

This guy is a CON MAN, he voted AGAINST Bernie's bill 4 cheaper medicine & WITH BIG PHARMA last night. 12 Republicans supported it. #Sellout https://twitter.com/corybooker/status/818131757883129856 …
as you know @RandPaul has submitted a replacement plan. I appreciate your  for the people.
@alllibertynews @CoryBooker @RandPaul really?  We'd love to see that...
http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/01/05/how-sen-rand-paul-would-replace-obamacare.html … I believe these senators care about what is happening to healthcare.
Keeping major parts of ACA is not "repeal & replace". It is repair & enhance, like HRC was proposing.
i hear you. I think healthcare became really screwed up. My wife is an RN and has experienced the effects.
@deathbytang what are your reason for voting against lowering pharmacy prices? #profitsoverpeople
testifying against a fellow senator without a clue or actual fact is not the truth, it's partisan rhetoric. #maga
Cory Booker... just another sell-out establishment HACK!!! We see you Cory -- YOU ARE THE PROBLEM #DemExit
Then why did u help put the last nail in the coffin of every poor person in this country who was relying on ACA. Shame on you!!
Single payer for everyone with Cannabis access. You are not the one you are too tied to the lobby interests stand down

#AskChuck 
How about we as Tax Payers Demand Congress Loses it's Healthcare Coverage On Jan 20th with no replacement 
You're a sellout and everybody knows it.
you hypocrite voting to keep cheap generic drugs from you constituents. We don't forget
But voting against lower drug prices will be a big help to everyone, right?
They are going to replace with what is better. Keep the few things that are good and you sir are lying about this!
why did u not vote w @SenSanders on his new healthcare plan? U taking money from big pharma u fraud?? #sellout
repeal the employer mandate
shame on you for voting against @SenSanders amendment to help people not big pharm. #disgraceful
All the good will you generated by taking on Tillerson, you squandered. Sold out.
Same corporate Democrats, pretending to advocate for the common man while doing the will of corporations. I'm ashamed to be a Democrat today
Sen Booker, I'm sure you'll be happy to personally go to Canada everytime we need to replace my daughter's epipens???? #Booker2020 No Way.
why did you vote with republicans against Bernie's Pharma bill?
needs to quit n get a job handing out samples at Costco w @donnabrazile
#Sellout
if you're so concerned about people being able to get healthcare, why'd you vote against @SenSanders healthcare bill LAST NIGHT?
Just stop already. We know you voted against Americans.
//@CoryBooker 

one illness from bankrupsy
#npr
ha, like people have money
yet you're ok with voting no on affordable prescriptions you're nothing but a con man
.@CoryBooker Why did you vote against lowering drug costs?
.@CoryBooker Cory Booker voted against lowering drug costs because he's bought by the pharmaceutical mafia
oh, THAT...
can you stop coning the people of New Jersey and be a true progressive. If not get out the way...we don't need you.
you're still a sellout.
maybe it had something to with that close to $300,000 you took from the drug lobby...please someone run against him...
Thanks for making it hurt more by voting against the Rx bill.  Expected performance level, or will Big Pharma give u a bonus?
and can someone run against him?...please????
you just voted down sanders bill for more affordable drugs...why???
You voted against cheaper medicine last night in favor of big pharma and with 11 republicans! #Sellout
12 republicans supported it!
Voting AGAINST lower drug prices and allowing access to drugs from Canada are equally crippling to citizens! #BigPharma owns you
Quit Grandstanding Corey!
@WillSeattle time to move beyond message. Learn procedural moves. Figure out how to affect timing of law. Stop this.
This 1000% please.
neato, so why did you vote "nay" on the Sanders amendment to import affordable drugs from Canada?
and yet you voted against a bill to help the people who need them have greater access to lifesaving drugs. kudos.
big pharma pays big $$$$$$$ for votes. Cha ching.
can you propose an amendment to first cancel the healthcare plans of #house & #senate members? Maybe this could #SaveTheACA
maybe they'll have a healthcare plan and ask us to "vote on its approval" then read it afterwards....oh, wait....Dems did that.
butt hurt
thank you for #StandingTall 4 American #values We cannot afford to lose even more eg http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/01/11/509310734/6-obamacare-provisions-that-could-evaporate?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20170111 … #ACA #health #HiAP
Class stratification. We need you for 2020, because you're one of the few that see's clearly
