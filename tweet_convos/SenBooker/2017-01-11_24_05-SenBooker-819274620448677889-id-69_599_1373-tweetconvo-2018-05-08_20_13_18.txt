Thank you Corey Booker for standing up and speaking out against the nomination of Jeff Sessions for Attorney General.
Sometimes you have to stand up when you're a man. A lesson we all need to learn to get through the next 4 years.
Yes, thank God that someone is in the Oval Office that will be standing up for America.
Well, bless your 'lil heart. And please don't blame God, He sat this one out. Happy New Year!
God must of sat the last 2 elections and the last 8 yrs out too.
Sad attempt to launch a presidential bid. You should be ashamed.
