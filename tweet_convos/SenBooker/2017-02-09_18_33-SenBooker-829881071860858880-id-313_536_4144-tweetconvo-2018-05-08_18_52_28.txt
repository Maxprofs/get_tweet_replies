tired of being portrayed as the bad guy when all I want is you and black people and the media to tell the fucking truth
I'll say it like it is Booker. You're nothing but a black racist like Elija Cummings posing as Congressmen
obstruct, obstruct, obstruct. It's why a once great party is now just the lunatic fringe.
What? Didn't you take money from  big Pharma, too?
how did that work out Cory go away
. Your a sheep with a big mouth.
.77 blacks killed by whites per 100000 9.83 whites killed by blacks / per 100,000
Cory Booker you just go ahead and ignore me too that's what everybody else does but I'll make sure you motherfuckers remember me
with or without your help that lie is going to die black victimization the biggest lie in human history
until you address the straight up facts you're nothing more than a race-baiting huckster and I hope we have the Civil War
mr. Booker you really should talk about black on white crime and hell out of proportion it is and has been in America for ever
your wasting your time!
sad I remember when you were bipartisan and you brought unity now you only divide
he should not be supporting someone who wants to completely get rid of healthcare availability for ALL. Think.
what part of Obama care doesn't work don't you  get  getting rid of healthcare lol smh
I'm sorry I honestly don't understand what you wrote.
black men are 7% of the country and they account for 40% of all murder
I know because I've been called a honky and a Cracker by all of them in the last five years
and that they have been lying about some type of victimization for more than half a God damn century  let's have a public debate
every year as a century we've had more black on white murder than we've had white on black murder look at the pop. disparity
dylann roof in my eyes is a patriot he is a God damned American Hero only because black people won't  address their crime rate
Any one this nut is against is probably a shoe in
@SenateDems behavior by the left is appalling and unacceptable.
if you believe it isn't then let's have a debate in a public forum most civil rights leaders are scared to back up their words
.77 blacks killed by whites per 100,000 9.83 whites killed by blacks per 100,000
having to bring black people up to speed with a math lesson before a debate is aggravating as hell they truly don't get it
could you educate Black America on the concept of per capita population disparity and weighted averages please
countless elderly white people beaten to death by black trash in home invasions. Where are the white on elderly black victims?
liberalisum is a brain disease caused by VD.
thanks for getting our backs and protecting your constituents from the tangerine nightmare and his band of lunatics
@GailBrehm explain this divide you speak of?
Please speak out against Scott Pruitt, the worst polluter and hater of the environment. Him in charge of EPA? So ironic and sick
Booker is a nut case, also racist just listen.
@sharonstone 
Funny how you did the same thing to AG Sessions! Backstabbing is a big trait in yourself isn't.  Remember that Karma is a bitch!
- thank you and vote NO to Price!

Exactly why President Trump won. Tired of division/ liberals calling everyone racist/ bigots. Wake up Americans no longer fooled

Better bring some water,  Cory, In case you get thirsty. Don't you own your own water supply in Newark?
I am embarrassed to be a part of The medical community with Tom price. He absolutely is anti-medicine and this is repulsive
your done Booker. We won't forget you voted against Bernies prescription drug legislation. Your a fraud
GOOD LUCK.  PLEASE save us from this lunacy.
You're a Big Pharma SELLOUT
you may have committed career suicide when you testified against a colleague who helped you #back biter

The Democrats are SORE LOSERS

They have protested against every person that Donald Trump have nominated for his cabinet
that's right! It's a cesspool of billionaires who go against the very department they will be in charge of!
Thank you, Cory. His so-called replacement plan is a disaster and very dangerous.
Thank you. Say no to #UnqualifiedCabinet members. No to #TrumpSwamp, #SwampMonsters
please run in #2020
thanks for continuing to speak out
why don't the Dems stop obstructing and start working.  We deserve to have a government that can work together on issues.
Good luck with that! Aren't you tired of losing yet?
stop obstructing and work together respect the president as we respected all the others prior to this one.
go get'em
the NEW party of NO. Sad isn't it. Schumer leadership tarnishing the party even more. What did they offer you?
God Bless Senator Booker for fighting for all of us.

@SenateDems why are you wasting your time - not good for your image
Cory, keep fighting, stay in front of all the cameras you can find, we are watching and following your leadership.
Thank you Senator We stand beside you
a proud moment for Booker to whine with fake sincerity before he gets voted down again by @SenateGOP .... sad.
beautiful...poignant...especially the visual of Price's statement about Medicare being an "intrusion" 
Of course you are.
thank u for standing up 4 the people! When u decide to run for Pres, I will be 1st in line in SC to work to get you elected!
fight the good fight!
Your energy & determination to stand for what is right is truly an inspiration to keep #TheResistance strong. Thank you.
@SenateDems I wish I could believe your words but you voting down the drug importation from Canada has removed your credibility
@SenateDems but of course you are
thank you for doing that but all of the previous horrible choices still got confirmed.
You are nothing but a carpetbagger.  Another Black politician lining his/her own pocket at the expense of all Blacks
Keep up the good fight!
