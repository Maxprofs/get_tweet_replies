Like you opposed the bill to buy medicine in Canada at a cheaper price because you're funded by Big Pharma?
It wasn't a bill, it wasn't an amendment, and how abut you read the whole story before going after Booker

When you post a source that's unbiased I'll read it. Until then I'll stick to the facts - all of them
Observer?
The headline alone shows inherent bias.
Your veracious use of the phrase "Bernie worship" shows inherent bias
So are you not a Bernie fan, then?
Thank you, @CoryBooker
Great! Please oppose DeVos, too!
He announced he would vote against her.

After he supported her organization. Hes a total hack.

@lhfang So you can't give him credit for that?
Give him credit for what? Pretending he cares about us? Pretending he opposes 'school choice'?
I have a question? Can we agree we dislike Trump.
we can, but we need to clear out all these other assholes ruining our party
Cory- I think this is a mistake.. Tillerson (@ Haley) are Trumps 2 good choices... #StopDeVos
why would he vote against her?

Maybe He realizes DeVos has no knowledge of (or experience in) "Public Education" #StopDeVos
AGAIN...

It says "School Privatization" .. Cory also works 2 support "Public Education" (Unlike DeVos)
Thank you Jesus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I appreciate your integrity sir!!! Booker 2020!
this guy isn't jesus, and jesus probably didn't exist
yeah, I kinda know Booker isn't jesus. who knows if jesus existed, don't care.
Thank you for your integrity, @CoryBooker.
sorry. I don't trust the friend of #BigPharma   He's no Obama.
NOW let's get the rest of the members of Foreign Affairs to oppose Tillerson!  CALL!  #DemForce #TheResistance
Thank you for opposing the swamp cabinet! We can do better.
I hope you also oppose DeVos' nomination. She is grossly unfit to serve our children
why would he?

Thank You. If only we (citizens) could help
we can. Have you had your head under a rock?

can we expect anything positive from you
probably not. We have lost our party
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you for  opposing Tillerson.  He is not the right choice for America!
@KgKathryn @CoryBooker  I'm calling on @TammyforIL and @SenatorDurbin to please do the same and vote NO #Tillerson
Boycott the Inauguration and stand with the @HouseDemocrats who are doing what is right.
Thank you!
Good to know!
Tillerson is one of several billionaires that don't belong in government. Stand for us Cory, we need your help!
you are a disappointment. Take a Stand with your  55 brothers and sisters.Take a Stand for us not for yourself
@sherrilee7 @CoryBooker Thank you Cory!!!!
@sherrilee7 @CoryBooker Please block them all they are all disgusting, unqualified and atrocious!!
Better check with your Donors.
@PalmerReport @CoryBooker Rex Tillerson, wants Russian sanctions lifted so he can Drill his oil
Please,  you've got to stop, at least,  the worst ones,  DeVos, Sessions, Tillerson, Price. They aren't fit!
Fight and Fight Hard. We have been and will be behind you 100% now and in 2020 Please!

Thank you, sir. Keep hammering the nominees. Vote no esp. to DeVos - do better than you did for ed. in Newark.
@PalmerReport @CoryBooker thank you Senator. Disingenuous answers 2 Exxon sanction lobbying is enough of a red flag for me.
You are correct.
