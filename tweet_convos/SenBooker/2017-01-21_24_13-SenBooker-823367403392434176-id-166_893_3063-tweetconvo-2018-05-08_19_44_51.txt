@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @BrookeBCNN @CNN will you be at the pro life march this weekend
Corey Booker is lost, this isn't a Wall Street fundraiser
@CoryBooker with your hypocrisy, you are the reason why most Americans will rather stay at home than going to the polls. #SA178  @BrookeBCNN
Was supposed to be a Hillary party - turned into a march about unknown objectives
very appropriate, youre going down in flames. got more fake quotes in that uneducated little mind?
@BrookeBCN FILTHY, VULGAR LANGUAGE, THREATS AGAINST THE WH, SANITARY NAPKINS ON PARK BENCHES, BRAS HANGING ON TREES
-incorrect #Obamacare made insurance companies even more powerful! It took "medicine" out of the Doctor's hands.

Shame on Cory Booker for voting against bill allowing Americans to import cheaper drugs for Canada
We demand more than pretty words, Senator. Get off Big Pharma / Wall St teet and be the leader we need!
Cory! Why is your heart heavy?
Glad you covered this, but please stop with the horse race questions - they aren't the story, are part of problem.

FUCK Corey!!
@IronGreg73  Me too!  We need to come together and stand up!!  Marches were wonderful. Happy people.
Tell me what exactly were you standing up for? No focus, left to much garbage behind.
Trump is a lying,racist, misogynist, national security risk and national embarrassment narcissist!!
My GOD Jennie, you really need to turn off CNN. It's rotting your brain.
I felt the same way. There was so much love and positive energy. I'm ready!
already promoting @CoryBooker for the next cycle. ridiculous.
Did big pharmas most recent check clear? Booker=Hack
- Nice try. You have no future & you're legacy will be what you did for your community. Nothing.
Too bad they won't be able to afford medication after you voted down Senator Sanders' bill, Pharma-boy.
Now all marchers should tweet their reps #uwork4me & #ipledgetovote. THEN VOTE IN EVERY ELECTION
because trump called you guys out. We voted for Trump to keep you guys in check.
