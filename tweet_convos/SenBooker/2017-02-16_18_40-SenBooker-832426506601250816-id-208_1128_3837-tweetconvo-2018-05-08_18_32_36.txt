Absolutely..Cory protect our environment!
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes The EPA should have ever existed EPA go away EPA go away !!!
Doesn't take a cleaver to cut out a heart. A scalpel does just fine. This is a horrible outcome.

He will be ASS!!!!! @CoryBooker you are part of the problem as well!
what about T Bone
Hope he eviscerates this burdensome agency!!
You shouldn't be an elected official at all.
the EPA should be concerned with Americans, not crazy environment groups as it now. We need focus. Finally!
what do you mean by 'OURS' cory? Yup just keep up the division.
And You shouldn't be anywhere near the Oval Office.
What can be done now before the EPA is no longer an Environmental Protection Agency . @POTUS admin plan?
First it made me want to weep. Now it pisses me off and makes me more determined to get rid of these terrible, awful people
@SenBookerOffice @EPA @nytimes keep fighting Cory!!

and you Sir should be nowhere near Washington.
The EPA should be no near the American people.
You "cory" shouldn't be anywhere near Washington. Racist man living on the coattails of the American people! #MAGA
Cory Booker is a racist idiot. He should resign and go home.
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes "Your" EPA?? Surely you mean USA's EPA unless you think you rule the world??
.@CoryBooker @didigruenwald @EPA @nytimes Empty suit Cory, spewing words, but taking lobbyists' money. You are a sham!!

Too Much Noise Out Here In The Public.....Can't Hear Individual Politicians Anymore!
#DialDownDaHate

Why on earth would he damage the environment when he will only expose you and every other politicians corruption? #scam
Screw-it-Pruitt is going to decimate the EPA!!!
Like the courts found that NC used a scalpel to suppress minority voters
our entire Earth is in danger! The fools are rising to the top. Gag!
It only takes a scalpel to slit the throat of the agency.
It's disgusting what @SenateMajLdr & @SenateGOP are doing.When it fails they shouldB jailed 4abusive neglect of country
#ImpeachThemAll   #VoteThemOut2018
.@CoryBooker @EPA #AnimasRiver #FlintWaterCrisis #OrovilleDam... if only there was an Agency for the Protection of the Environment.
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes your hate is contagious. Please just stop. People see where the #hate is coming from. #ShameOnYou #Lie
Cory lost another, Pruitt will be EPA chief???
ppl who love to FISH.That's a lot of ppl. Think what not having clean water! DEADFISH,in other words limited fish
. How do we stop this from happening?!?
thank you for opposing Scott Pruitt! Thank you for defending the environment!
True. The bigger problem is Trump. #Impeachtrump
vote no on Pruitt.
That's where we should be investing money and education and training for those currently employed with dirty fossil fuels.
What can be done to change the perception abt oil? Scientists know that green energy is the future.
you sound ridiculous all will be dead for years before that technology will happen. make America great again
, you are a special kind of stupid.
@SenSchumer Can we delay this vote until his emails are released?
Can't wait for him to reign in EPA overreach
he should not be allowed to breathe the the same air he wants to pollute!!
why is trump choosing these idiots what is he trying to do to our country? What does it take to impeach a fool?
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes hack away at useless over reaching unelected zealots. Authority without responsibility must end
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes hope he gut's the epa
one has to remember we have a President who does not believe in Global Warning and everything is just "The Weather".
#endtheEPA
Dems should remember there will be a Dem president in the future and the Reps will greet their nominees the same
vote no
GET THEM CORY!!! We know you can do it!!! We got your back
Sadly, @realDonaldTrump seems capable of destroying the environment in his own.
totally agree! Thanks for your support Cory!
- @EPA should be cut 90%. Its employees are feckless bureaucrats who do nothing but add onerous regulations & hurt economy
Actually, the EPA has overstepped it's authority so far it should be cut in half, or worse.
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker @EPA neither should you
agreed.  None of @realDonaldTrump associates are fit to serve at any level within the US government.
Wrong Cory. We need Pruitt to clean up the mess you and Obama made in the last eight years.
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes also, did you see @maddow last night re: death penalty debacle on his watch?
Should be cut with a chainsaw.
you Alt Left politicians should be no where near our government,just obstructionist not caring about your base
What really sucks is if Cory Booker runs in 20 he'll win the nomination & Trump wins the general.
I agree. Thank you for standing up and speaking out.
The circus is looking for more clowns. I sent the your resume. They said you fit in perfectly. Stand by for a phone call.
Oklahoma. #fracking #manmadeearthquakes as alarming as his record of lying and breaking disclosure laws.
Thank for fighting,they will have to own what they are doing, people will remember @ next election.
my father worked at EPA. This makes me so sad.
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes Obstructionists on the prowl again! Cory making a move for 2020?#retirechuck #MAGA
#delaythevote #readtheemails
 #StopPruitt

Too bad Cory!
Preach!! 
book 'em Cory!
yes we want Scott Pruitt!
don't u have grandchildren? What kind of world will Pruitt leave them.
even death people believe climate change this guy is a puppet of the fossil fuel companies
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes EPA is unconstitutional! Violates people's contract with the federal government. (Called Constitution)
The EPA has over reached. The EPA should not be anywhere near the EPA! Time now for some common sense AND L&O!
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes vote no
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes Schumer is losing his mind!! No one is paying attention or listening to anything he says. Loser!
Then ask for a delay in the vote in order to read the 3000 pages a judge ordered P to turnover to media.
Well he will be. So get over it. Guess Dems will have to find another way to line your pockets. -Environmentalists
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes When you oppose everybody you oppose no one.
Agreed, but what the hell can be done?!? Pruitt is as poisonous as SCROTUS
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes two liberal buffoons and their ilk the ny times laughable
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes oh come on boys
I agree! Keep up the #resistance, we need you on the front lines! Thanks! Vote No on #Pruitt #resist #midterms2018
if you only knew how silly everybody looks from the outside in. like a bunch of children.
if you don't like what one man can do in the administration, maybe don't support bloated government.
Sen Booker you need to keep quiet and do your job. The way you voted on Bernie's med bill!  #shamefull #dino
Tell that to 80,000 coal miners who lost their jobs by a #globalwarming cult.
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes Schumer tell you to say that

@BadASSSery @EPA @nytimes by Tuesday...
@BadASSSery @EPA @nytimes confirmation of this fool should wait. He was withholding foia requests. Judge ordered release of docs
Maddow is on it
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes Give it up Cory. After back stabbing Sessions you have ZERO credibility. If u dislike he's great!
Tell your buddy @SteveDaines that. He looks up to you, but never listens to his constituents. Maybe you'll have better luck
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes yes! Was going to call you to ask you to vote no - but knew you already had our backs!
@SenSchumer @nytimes while this guy is awful, don't let the narrative shift from Russia. This is how we get the fool canned.
if you divide your efforts, you're attacking smoke and mirrors. There's blood in the water w/ - go for it
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes IT IS TIME TO TAKE YOUR BOOT OFF ALL OUR NECKS . SCOTT PRUITT IS THE RIGHT CHOICE .
Thank you Senator Booker.
@SenSchumer @EPA @nytimes He can be near my EPA.
EPA should be MIA.
@CoralMDavenport I hope ur all stalling on this one until those 3000 emails r produced to the OK judge.

Pruitt must not be allowed to pick apart the EPA! Senator Booker pls take lead & block the vote! #ClimateChange #sciencematters

Scalpel? Cleaver? Try axe.
Because we only have one !!  We must do everything to save it!  We don't get a second chance on this one!
I couldn't agree more! Bad for people environment & economy. Hope @SenToomey joins you #StopPruitt
vote no to Pruitt

Do you think you can get Ryan and McConnell to come into the light?
Those of us who live in Oklahoma are acutely aware of just how right you are.

yes..he should. OVER REGULATED, OVER REACHING EPA
EPA, GONE, dismantled, Never to rise again..... no that will be a good day.
After what you did to UR friend the new AG, you clearly show you are a racist.  You know he's not racist, but screwed him.
Amen!!  Unethical- Over Line AG of OK and Much More!  #nopruitt
@SenBookerOffice @EPA @nytimes How can you responsibly head a department you believe has no value?
Thank you Senator!
I know you'll fight the good fight for us, Sen Booker!
he also has a judge ordering him to release communications between his office and energy companies delay vote
I'm with you! @AGScottPruitt is proven liar & lawbreaker.
what will it take to get the drift to the republicans that our Environment needs help..40 days & 40 nights of straight rain
if only these 2 @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorHeitkamp had your dedication to our environment sadly it's self over party#TheResistance
vote no to Pruitt
How many times has he sued the EPA?
"Our EPA"
if DeVos got in, this guy's a lock. Thank Hillary and BHO
plus he's got OKlahoma issues where judge is requesting files by Tuesday. Vote needs to be delayed. #voteno
R Maddow's story 2 nite disclosed host of reasons to reject him. On Tues he's ordered 2 produce 3 thous docs in OK
But you can't do a thing about it but whine like you're doing now
he has no business in any cabinet position, sued the EPA 19 times, still has pending lawsuits against the EPA
@SpeakerRyan NO VOTE should take place until his 3000 papers are released in 4 days!  Say NO to Pruitt.
vote no to Pruitt
YayCory!
this vote needs to be delayed until those docs are released
Yeah. Some of the worst psychopaths murder their victims with a scalpel.
It's NOT your EPA!!!

Thank you Senator. Please do all you can to stop this monster.

Please don't allow his confirmation, Senator Booker.
NOPE he should not.  Get Russian Spies out of WH - NOW
Def AGREED!

the EPA is a joke and needs to be taken out of our country and global warming is a joke
thank you Cory! Now is when we need resistance!

because among other things... #Fracking
@CoralMDavenport Please keep him out of the EPA!
I know you're up against next to impossible odds. Thank you for fighting for us, Senator Booker.
It says something when you can compare a presidential administration to a meat cleaver.
