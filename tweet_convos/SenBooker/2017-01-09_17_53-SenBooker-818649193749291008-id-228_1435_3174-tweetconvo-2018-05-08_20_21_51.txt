I could not be more proud to be your constituent, Senator Booker!
Were you proud of him when he praised senator sessions on his civil rights work a few years back? Corey is two faced like them all
considering the only sources of that are from conservative fake news sites...go pound sand!
I know what happened, Russia must have hacked Corey Bookers mind and forced him to say all those great thing about Jeff Sessions
Kind of like how they did that with Hillary and made her call half the country deplorable and forced her to not campaign in Wisconsin and MI
really like Cory Booker. He has the people interest at heart.Thank you Mr. Booker
I love the video of Corey praising Jeff sessions years ago. Proof how two-faced he is. But let me guess, fake news? Libs love hypocrisy
Let it go. Pick your battles. Don't spread so thin
Ur party is thin. BO comes in w/ complete control, loses it all, now DT has complete control. Where's the Time cover calling it a meltdown?
May you be free from your suffering.
Lmao suffering? Call me crazy but isn't your Twitter feed the one that is filled with endless complaining about Trump? More hypocrisy.
Thank you, Senator Booker, the majority of Americans did not vote for this.
Didn't win his home state and lost the popular vote
good thing NY and CA can't hand pick presidents the
travesty that education and economic performance doesn't count, but Mississippi does
vote against their self-interest at every pass because someday trickle down will work.Ha
you're so much better than people from the south. Can't believe they don't agree with your opinions..
and Donald Trump and his Cabinet choices are con artists- they want to help themselves, not the rest
My analysis of the Presidential Election:
no where near
A #SorosAgenda paid hack. A selllout. Disgusting.
Of course "MSLSD" won't play footage of Booker praising Sessions in the past!
Thank you, Senator Booker, for standing against #JeffSessions
yeah, but he was silent for 4 years, so this is all a selfie show by booker
#Stopsessions "These are extraordinary times calling for extraordinary measures" Cory the courageous!God bless U
WOW!  Looking at these two girlymen side by side. WOW!
Great job Cory! Do your thing and block the racist bigot!
What do you mean, he loves him, or hes a liar

https://youtu.be/chkAASced_0 
Senator Sessions is a bigot PERIOD!
@4030lisa @CoryBooker @SenatorSessions @MSNBC Cory Booker is the Only  Member of This Pathetic Party that STANDS UP & FIGHTS
right on!!


proud of Cory for standing up & doing this to say no to corruption & unethical behavior
You know he praised Jeff sessions for his civil rights work in the past? America is done with 2 faced politicians like Booker.
and you have actual proof of this?
Video proof. Do you know how to work the Internet? It's out there if you want to see the political act Booker put on today. Played his part.
No, @corybooker is just an extraordinary opportunist - 2020 in his sights, but he lost my vote.
so which is it??

thanks for keeping hate alive and doing the devil's work. it's not racist when you do it
Liberal tactic of screaming Bigot Racist Misogynist is old-tired and ineffective. try solutions
Corey you are a bigger jerk than most people are saying.
trying to be relevant taking advantage when the cameras are rolling
Don't forget Obama friend late Democrat Sen. Robert Byrd KKK Grand Klagen
Extraordinary times that require extraordinary courage & leadership. Thank you, Senator.
Senator Sessions will be confirmed ...Booker is just trying to promote himself ..another Obama.
Watch Booker praise Senator Sessions ...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chkAASced_0 …
disgraceful times stop this insanity we're trying to save the republic
Is he bringing T-Bone?

That takes a lot of balls.
We owe a HUGE debt of gratitude to the black population of this country.
Cory has become pawn of the Democrats
