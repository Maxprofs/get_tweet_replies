@ledmondson39 @EPA that's the @GOP for ya. Why are they STILL being votes in? They choose ppl like this to ruin ppl.
@alexrstone @EPA Bc there's no $ for him in helping innocent people. All he cares about are dollar signs
Haven't we begged for protection long enough in NC?Our water can cause cancer & we keep asking who is protecting us?
again, why should this man be confirmed??? #WeThePeople
.@SenBookerOffice Thank you for standing up for our future! #persistandresist
@DemResistance @EPA Thank you as an asthma sufferer in Oklahoma my concern is for ALL OF US! #nopruitt
@ledmondson39 @EPA AMD yes, I know Pruitt Kant voted in by us, but our reps have to cast that vote. They represent us.
While you may never see this, I think you are what our Democratic party needs in 2020. A strong liberal that can unite(1/2)
moderates and progressives alike. If you were to run you surely got a volunteer in me. #Booker2020? (2/2)
True......Definite FACTS!! Oklahoma has 1 of the Highest in Juvenile Asthma. I have seen this firsthand. #NotaLie
.@SenBookerOffice .@EPA 
That's exactly Trump nominated him to head EPA. Another built-in yes-man dismantler. I feel bad for his grandkids
Pruitt's appointment is the moral equivalent of putting a pedophile in charge of a nursery school. Trump is sick.
@samswey @EPA this man should never have been confirmed. He hates the EPA.. He will pollute the entire country
.@SenBookerOffice @didigruenwald @EPA You are a Democrat, on the losing side of 2016 elections. Get used to not getting your way.
And he was still voted in...Law makers are shamful.
yet he still was confirmed. 
#ILove @SenBookerOffice
what is going on with these folk?
Republicans proved they  $$$ more than children w/ DeVos. Now, again $$$$ over clean air & clean water. Disgraceful!
God bless you man. You're such a fighter.
HOW??? HOW are we letting this happen?!?!?!?!  DeVos. Now this? #savetheEPA #savemysanity
#AnimasRiver pollution was created by poorly #regulated industry. #EPA stepped on a bomb!!...not their fault.
#Pruitt
@SenateDems @EPA As Oklahoma shakes under the fracking industry. Oklahoma will be unlivable soon. Earthquakes, bad water,
I hate that we have a situation where we must remind other humans about humanity. We must regulate bcause corps won't
@SenateDems @EPA the EPA has overreached....ask a farmer
vote NO on Pruitt. His record as AG is dismal. Save our environment @SierraClub
I live in OK. If the asthma doesn't get us the earthquakes from the fracking will
@SenateDems @EPA How often do you take a flight and what kind of limo do you drive?
Where is your science degree from again? The University of DNC - a BS in Talking Points?
he doesn't care about "his" state. Or anyone else's. PLEASE everyone vote NO on #Pruitt
Pruitt will clean up the EPA after eight years of climate change lies & corruption by the Obama admin.
thank you for being awesome.
thank you for your efforts in trying to find us a competent leader for the @EPA

Thank you Senator for this. I have asthma and I like breathing. #pollutingPruitt

@SenateDems @EPA So #45 wants to make America with contaminated waterways, poisoned livestock and food, uneducated children
Dim-ocrats have been in charge of Flint Mi. for LONG time...so save your phony arguments on clean water.

she failed to do her job as California Atty General to protect residents against pollutants
