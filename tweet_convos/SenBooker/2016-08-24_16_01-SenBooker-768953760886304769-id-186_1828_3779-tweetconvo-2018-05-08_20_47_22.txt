Thank you, @POTUS ! My children are thrilled to have these places to play and explore! #parkchat #findyourpark #nps100
Yet he allows overhead #Geoengineering 2 continue manipulating the weather dropping poison on us & CREATING #DROUGHT FACT
Yes he did......for Syrian terrorist disguised as refugees. God I hate Obama.....
people R so miserable they come on a thread about Parks 2 bitch about the POTUS. Get a damn life!!
thank you for bringing some truth to this conversation! #FreeSpeech
It's disgusting for the The White House account to do puffery for the current president.Totally inappropriate.
If Trump wins, @WhiteHouse will be doing ads for The Apprentice and Trump Tower and Trump Steak.
and spent more US tax dollars on vacations
ignorant . They pay 4 vacations with the salary from being President.  Do U think he works 4 free? Plus he works 24/7.
Works. He hasn't done anything except screw people over, lie, and play golf. That is Obama in one sentence.
my life is better under Obama than Bush. Its fact he takes less vacation since Reagan so go golf. It's 24/7
Is it really? You have experienced so much economic problems.
#TEAR DOWN THE DAMS!!!!!!!!!!!!! #RELEASE THE SNAKE RIVER SALMON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Generations from now folks will say, "Way back when, @POTUS Obama made sure it would stay like this." Thank you Mr President.
#NoDAPL
Thank you!
But created the least jobs and put more people on welfare handouts
@jsavite @POTUS whoot! Whoot! Merci bien!
great  job Mr. President
#ThankYou for your work on behalf of future generations of people, plants, & animals.
it amazes me that people have nothing better 2 do w/their lives than to troll a thread about parks & spread ignorance
señor presidente B.Obama podria parar la inflacion en Denver Colorado mucha gente se esta moviendo a este estado y nos
cool
@ThreeTwins @POTUS did he stop bathing?
you know THIS is in bad taste after golfing during Louisiana floods?  Right?  You're not that dumb?
Thank you so much for your national park work! Please stand with natives for #NoDAPL!! Continue to work for our planet!!
but he hasn't done anything else. He has caused racial divide that was not smart. That was dumb
has also let in more terrorists & people who want to kill Americans than any other president!
you mean take it
thank u. As a wildlife rehabber it is so important!
Translation, More land grabs than any other president in history. 1/20/17
Darn I am impressed
but when will he make 1800flowers stop their shenanigans?
Ha, pay2play. want  land back? Just look at @HillaryClinton s Tax plan. That is actually the list of cost to play! Ssh
yes it's called stealing land from the states and giving it to the UN. #NPS100
yeah, heard something about selling off our national parks to foreigners,2..... how sad & Unamerican is that? look it up
He's also played more GOLF than any other president!
He did this by purchasing every golf course he played on.
Please give voice to plight of Legal immigrants. http://bit.ly/2bDrrdD 
CALLING #BULLSHIT!
when all you do is take vacations that's pretty easy to accomplish!
If you  your country, realize that federal land grabs & resource control represents COMMUNISM not FREEDOM.
l
Mahalo a nui loa!
Don't be fooled by the spin!
States r sovereign & gave NO Constitutional power 2 Fed gov't to own land. This is Tyranny
But can he handle a selfie-stick like Allan Weitz of #BHPhotoPodcast Celebr8 Natl Parks #NPS100
#ThanksObama
Thank You
but for the wrong reasons/ govt control/ & @ huge cost to economy & jobs.  Better off w/o him. owning not conserving!

Oh man, I was just going to build 20,000 townhouses there. (Love you @POTUS !)
Dont make me sick. Obama is the worst president ever. Treasonous bleep. Trump for president
Thank You President Obama for preserving what's important for the soul & beauty of this nation.  #NPS100
He is @BarackObama the best President we have ever had sure we will miss @BarackObama ready for #Hillary
When activists asked the U.N. to get involved they said it was up Obama. He could care less if he ruins a rain forest.
thanks!!
The Olympic National Forest is devestated by these war games and it is a U.N. protected Heritage Site. Shame on Obama.
Obama has allowed the U.S Navy to conduct military war games in the Olympic National Forrest. Last rainforest in NAmerica
Yeah but he auctioned off 12 million acres of public lands to BIG OIL

what to tell him? Do you #StandWithStandingRock ? or are u the voice of corporations? #NoDAPL
how many jobs were created, and how much did it effect the GMP.

Thank you! #FindYourPark  #NPS100

@Debra_McGill @POTUS You are awesome!!
@Debra_McGill @POTUS

That's a cool note.

The president needs to get out on the campaign trail
And the Earth will Whisper the name "Obama" for millions of years via MightyPamela...Yessss
What am admirable legacy.
at what cost?!
لاأمان للثعلب وإن لبس جلد خروف  
أوباما مجرم حرب ننتظر اليوم الذي يطرد من البيت الأبيض
by selling off our national parks?? How exactly does that work?
Thank you Mr. President. Hopefully generations to come will appreciate your tremendous efforts.
ㅋ 오바마
How? By playing golf every other day for 8 years? Failing in his foreign policy? Creating the OBAMACARE DISASTER?
yeah, he needs more golf courses!
good thing because he sure screwed up everything else
Thank YOU I Love Nature OutDoors | It's The Only Time I Feel At Home
please consider exec order to breach the snake to save chinook and  #SRKW
meanwhile, the rest of the world burns. But that okay because it's not in Obama's backyard.
Great, but Average Weeks Unemployed (http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS13008275&from_year=1948 …)
is higher now than under any previous @POTUS @WhiteHouse.
- has given Isis more land and oil than any other president
Looks very inviting, like our Lake District without all the tourists!
Now if you would stop supporting fracking then we would be making real progress.
grateful for an environmental president
Pozdrowienia przesyłam z Polski..Powodzenia życzę.
what did he do give it our enemies.  I mean he didn't go out and perform any environmental work.  He has a pen
Land Grabs and Killing Ranchers.............?
POTUS has been Pressured more than any other President - big woop
Got some water that Standing Rock uses that could use some protection right now.
Also has signed more Drilling and Fracking Permits.
The Preez savin' the beez
be were  He's  Sneaky all of about 
even  in The  Water  is  did  pollution.
And still there is rampant poverty and homelessness in America!
unfortunately he's endangered the rest of the country. @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@MiaFarrow @POTUS Besides coming into the worst economy since the 1930,s Mia(&averting a depression)he has done a lot of good!
@robmalley44 @CFR_org

@Avashin:"clashes between YPG and Turkish
backed Al Qaeda groups north of Minbij"
That's space for lots of golf courses!
Somewhere, there's a die hard neocon saying "Thanks OBAMA!" with all the vitriol he can muster.
But what about the flooding in Illinois?
I needed a good laugh today!  Thanks
HRC should keep this up! If Trump wins he will sell it!
Its too bad that the PEOPLE ON IT are having a hard time.
@GeoffPyatt @POTUS
What's about shallowing in Nevada ?
Clowns!
Keep up placing lands in monuments and parks. It's a legacy that keeps on giving.
Only to end up giving much of that land and water away to big business with having the TPP passed. Keep spewing that BS.

AND, he's increased national debt more than any other, vacationed more, created more Mideast havoc, increased health care
Hey guys, how about a RT for the locals who want to show off our (read: everyone's) new monument?
.@WhiteHouse @POTUS Iraq wrecked. Syria wrecked. Yemen wrecked. Libya wrecked. Ukraine wrecked. Needs a dictionary does he.
His greatest accomplishment, conserving water. Like all that water PepsiCo sells out from under Californians.
THAT IS A TOTAL LIE!!! Better re check your history. OBAMI IS THE DO NOTHING
proud of spending our tax dollars?
This land was DONATED
blow hard
And he has blown more smoke up people's asses over the last 8 years to be considered an environmental disaster.
Agree! The facts don't lie! That's why I called Obama "The Green President" not money wise but nature wise!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS
.@POTUS For resettlement of Muslim jihadists...
Exactly
Cool
And what irritates me  is that no one is taking the time to pin either candidate on environmental policy
thankful for this.
great job...such an amazing president!
