Glad to see @MDCollege President Eduardo Padròn among the list of recipients! #MedalofFreedom
Congratulations to Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients including Margaret H Hamilton https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/11/16/president-obama-names-recipients-presidential-medal-freedom … @WhiteHouse @POTUS
I'm guessing Steve Bannon isn't on that list...
 I needs that laugh

@WhiteHouse @POTUS
.@POTUS just named the 21 recipients of this year's Presidential Medal of Freedom. Check out the full list here: http://go.wh.gov/EzRYBq  
so will we hear Trumpers start yelling about there being gay & black on this list? That they are being disenfranchised?
I only count 20 on this list. Counted it numerous times.
Wow. I'm disappointed in the President's pick of some of these people. Actors, basketball players, singers.
.  Who are. The 22 Freedom Golld medalists?
Great choices.
Congratulations to a fellow Washingtonian! You make us proud!
Nice list, glad to see Scully on there. And in case anyone reads this: small typo at end of first paragraph. "22th"
We have an NBA and a R&R hall of fame!  A baseball announcer ??? This fawning embrace of pop culture is embarrassing.
Worst pick for candidates ever! Athletes & actors, instead of those who put their lives on the line for our country. SAD.
@BeautyNYC @POTUS      
Peux-tu m'envoyer ton numéro
Great choices!!! Go President Obama! You will be missed BIG TIME!!!
@HumanRtsV @POTUS Essentially a list of entertainment industry political $$ bundlers, plus Vin Scully. Congratulations to Vin.
when is the award ceremony?
how does list of mostly entertainers exemplify virtues of the MofF? Maybe list of civ that really served this country?
great picks by our president
Obama is Increasing the best in America #gettowork
congrats to all. John Stewart, a deserving individual who isn't on the list. Maybe he will be after 4 years
Great list but how about Joan Trumpauer?  Civil Rights legend.  http://www.anordinaryhero.com  Would be fitting for this POTUS. @WhiteHouse @POTUS
We hope future former slaves as Solomon will be honored for the ultimate sacrifice paid to their country.
Let me guess...bunch of liberals

congratulations!
Presidential Medal of Freedom will put Bruce Springsteen and Vin Scully on the same stage. Thanks, Obama! 
award Bruce @springsteen  with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for "having helped shape American #Music"
#Springsteen
Great list of recipients!
Banks, computers and healthcare appear to be the greatest income sources today and most corrupted businesses.
@OldIgby @POTUS An incredible list of great Americans that spans academia, entertainment, sports, science, the military.
Vin Scully. Great choice  #Dodgers #GOAT
so michael jordan won cause he's good at basketball?
that will be a really cool room to be in during that ceremony!
congrats Mr.Bruce @springsteen 
@TheEllenShow YES! Beacons of hope and inspiration.
So nice to see 
Should give HRC a medal!
hopefully the next POTUS will name Julian Assange, he's done more for USA than Ellen Degenerate. #foxnews
I woulda liked to see Leonard Peltier, @xychelsea + @snowden also getting Presidential Medal of Freedom. Or just freedom.
it's the medal of FREEDOM - not socialism. Many of the recipients are alt-left pushers.
No posthumous Medal of Freedom 4 @prince or was he already a recipient? @PRNFamily @VanJones68 @LondellMcMillan
congradulations to all of you!! What a Wonderful Honor You All Possess!! Keep Doing what you're doing!! We love you all
so it's really a "friendship" medal
A tad heavy on entertainers, no? #wednesdaywisdom
List does not contain 21 names, what's up with that?
A tad heavy on entertainers, no? #wednesdaywisdom 
GREAT PICKS!
crazy how only Democrats received award-
Bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuce!
why isn't #leonardpeltier on this list?
@TheEllenShow Congrats We Love You!
can't even imagine who trump will name. Probably the cast from Jersey Shore. What a disgrace to our country
La Medal of Freedom della @WhiteHouse a Bill Gates e consorte, tra molti altri noti https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/11/16/president-obama-names-recipients-presidential-medal-freedom …
makes me very sad not to see John Mellencamp on this list. He is one of America's most ignored treasures
good grief
In a nation that just spit on our Constitution and took freedoms away from millions. No longer Home of The Free.
At least 7 are ultra Lib whack jobs.
BTW does Bill & Mylinda Gates count as 1 or 2?
meh
Ends with Obama. Trump cutting it from budget.
The oscars? Oh wait...
dang @POTUS @BarackObama I didn't make the list again this year... What does a guy need to do :)
Congratulations to all of you!! Very proud.
Will we have these next year or will Trump give them all to himself.
Flying Tigers (American Volunteer Group; AVG) and JB355.
