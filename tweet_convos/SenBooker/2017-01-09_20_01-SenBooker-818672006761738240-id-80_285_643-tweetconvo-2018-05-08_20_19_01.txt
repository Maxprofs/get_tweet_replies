- Booker is a bigot. It's all about the smearing of most qualified AG nominee peroid.
#LickAWitch
- Your meme is inaccurate and misleading rethoric. But, it's not unexpected from the left to smear republicans
Bahahaha can't trust anyone can ya? Not a meme. MSM . Internet or 17 National Security Agencies. Who do U trust
- More Sessions: Racism allegations “damnably false”
U want me to trust an internet site ? Bahahaha #LickAWitch

SESSIONS HEARING: Devastating flashback video of Corey Booker HONORING Jeff Sessions for work in civil rights! h/t @michellemalkin 
after praising the man last year... what these lap dogs won't do for a minute of air time
- Will Booker bring his friend?

Pull out the film @CNNPolitics A senator once said they are the most powerful in the world. Presidents come and go. They r 4ever! @CeletaQ
@CoryBooker This is EXACTLY what is needed. You rock! You're a hero!

Oh Yah Oh Yah!  Sessions will mostly likely get confirmed, but taking sh*t from a black man some how makes me feel better.
Awkward

@SenBookerOffice  Can't wait to vote u out of office @realDonaldTrump @AsburyParkPress  @starledger @News12NJ @NJSP @PANYNJ
@SenBookerOffice Thank you. Your leadership and integrity is inspirational.
--- @SenatorSessions is by and large one of the most honest and fairest men to serve the country!
- Booker likes attention, channeling his efforts toward issues that allow him to find a spotlight. He's a political player.
Booker, a Progressive Blowhard, loves too HATE, especially Constitutionalists and conservatives.  May he trip on his tongue.
@SenBookerOffice is a national treasure. Thank God for true leaders like him! We are with you Senator Booker!
Your past words belie your intentions with your testimony against Sen. Sessions.

Won't matter.
what a jerk
If Booker's testimony is anything like his DNC speech be prepared for a BIG FIZZLE.Booker all optics little substance  #Waywire
@CoryBooker @SenBookerOffice This isn't about black ppl it's a political motive and SORE LOSERS!!! a light eyed sharpton!
@CoryBooker @SenBookerOffice IS JUST pi$$ed 'cause Killary didn't win and that means no position in a Presidential Admin!
This may well be the senator's descent when we were all wishing he would ascend to high office.
....screw this moron booker~
Given that Trump is "unconventional", why should every1 else act in a "conventional" manner? He's only 1 "rules" don't apply 2?
@YDanasmithdutra It takes guts for Booker to testify. Note--His Twitter name is now Booker 2020.
@SenBookerOffice Booker is a racist!  Plain and simple.
the fact that he is retweeting anyone & everyone that mentioned this shows it is a attention grabbing attempt.
Screw him. Sessions is going through - FU democrats - remember "elections have consequences"
go Corey!
Booker is an extremely credible person.

@CoryBooker You are a true hero! WE STAND WITH YOU! Denounce this racist! #resist #TrumpTreason #resistintolerance #Resistance
The only thing unprecedented about this is how a senator disgraces himself. Cementing DEM loses in 2 years. We don't forget!!!
@CoryBooker #opportunist
@CoryBooker is the kid we all knew in school who ALWAYS LIED, grandstanding to make himself seem good, spits while talking
@SaculSacul @CoryBooker you get 'me and be as tough on them, no tougher than them ever!
@Shakestweetz Thank You!
go Cory someone has to save us!
Bravery is respected and needed in these very troubling times. Stand up and we will stand with you.
DO NOT ALLOW NORMALIZATION OF TRUMP HATRED.....SESSIONS IS THE PAY TO PLAY PAYBACK TRUMP PAWN....STAND FIRM  #STOPSESSIONS
#CALLTOCONSCIENCE  STAND AGAINST  ACTIONS & WORDS OF #SESSIONS DO NOT SIT BY & ALLOW RACIESTS BEHAVIOR TAKE HOLD IN AG OFFICE
big mistake
Yes, please!
just wondering if Booker has any skeletons in his closet that is going to come back to haunt him as he's making a big mistake.

SESSIONS HEARING: Devastating flashback video of Corey Booker HONORING Jeff Sessions for work in civil rights! h/t @michellemalkin 
more lies coming our way for the next 4 years. Dems believe theirs lies. Want rest of us to also believe them! You lost! Accept
Typical Dems.  They Keep smearing stand up people for make believe reasons. And they wonder why the lost to Trump .
Jeff Sessions lDefined By Race & Immigration Listen to the audiotape  http://www.npr.org/2016/07/14/486011917/sen-jeff-sessions-loyal-to-trump-defined-by-race-and-immigration …
he will get torched like a cross in Bama.  Not smart Cory.
of course let's cry some more
go get him Mr Booker!  Someone has to. I respect your decision
Booker was 2 run v. Christie 4 gov, but Obama needed Christie 2 credit him 4 Sandy aid, so O got Cory 2 go 2 Senate instead
I understand from close friends in Alabama that he is well respected by all races there.
All Senate Dems should get a pair of balls and do the same for Sessions as well as others. Time to fight back.
I like Booker
fantastic!!
Failed mayor and do-nothing Senator in a desperate attempt to be relevant. Booker thinks of nothing but being the next Obama.
My heroes are those who refuse to normalize Trump
TY @CoryBooker
good luck with that!
plan to make a big splash, politicize hearing, jump to top of discussion for 2020 nominee?
MSM cheers him on Booker try to secure 2020 Nom.Justice Thomas Rerun Will he bring a coke can. praceful transfer power Right
@DavidPepper Good. Democrats need to show some backbone.

Thats it.  Senator Booker is "Rightly Pissed" too.
#HeHasGotIt  #FuturePOTUS
