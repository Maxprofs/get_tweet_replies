way to go to try to drag someone's name through the mud with lies. You're a real POS. You'll get yours one day!
So @phunkin are you making a violent threat? @FBI
Sounds like you are putting out some bad Karma dude; and gaslighting too!
He said he liked the KKK, till he learned they smoke pot! 'least Emmitt Till didn't become a pot head!
You're entry into presidential politics was a complete flop. T-Bone must be embarrassed.
Hey! We're not blind! Enough with the publicity stunt for your 2020 bid
You spoke out for what is right. May your conscience always guide you to stand up and do the right thing!! 
Yes Senator Sessions did stand up nice of you to speak up for a great man.
I'm waiting to hear what makes Sessions a great man...

@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker
Ask Sen. Booker he spoke of him so glowingly a year ago. I'm sure he could explain why he said what he did.
If ur point is politicians say diff'rnt things at diff times,no shit. Doesn't change that Sessions is a bad dude.
@SenBookerOffice
So you're saying Booker lied?
You're being silly.  I don't participate in nonsensical conversations.  Bye-bye
@SenBookerOffice
That's what liberals do run away.
Like you joined them to allow cheaper Canadian drug into U.S.?
What a steaming pile of poo.
So do I, but we will even if they don't.
can we hear why you voted down importing pharmaceuticals from Canada to lower drug costs?
I prayed that Cory Booker would vote for cheaper drugs rather than protect big pharma profits
Well that didn't work
it was just a reminder his prayers mean nothing. His bought VOTE will harm the ill
Thank you for everything you're doing.
we have to wait 4-8 years unless there is a successful impeachment.

Start with yourself, drug company lackey! Oh, an this
SESSIONS HEARING: Devastating flashback video of Corey Booker HONORING Jeff Sessions for work in civil rights! h/t @michellemalkin 

@cajunsicily @CoryBooker The people do and we are counting on u and your honorable colleagues 2 save our Democracy
Thank u for having the guts to do the right thing. We need many more like u.
Was he watching the same hearing? Opinion: - Fox News
Will it really matter with McCain making Mad Dog agree to a global nuclear holocaust in year one?
You mean like you joined them on cheaper drugs?!
Next time, vote to make rx drugs cheaper. Americans need help out here. #dickmove
Im with Cory Booker!
Sessions will start the never ending war on drugs again, beginning with Colorado, and then others.
@RandyLoBasso @CoryBooker the rest of us were praying for lower prescription costs, too.
One can only hope and pray.  I cannot support a racist.
OMG! I finally found a US Senator I can give respect to. Hello from England Cory, watching in fear.
So seeking the death penalty for the son of the KKK leader in alabama just isn't good enough huh.
@Lee_in_Iowa @CoryBooker difference between the stand you took vs Rubio's
You will vote your conscience and Rubio will not
So proud of you @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker a true patriot! #stopsessions #LoveTrumpsHate #TheResistance 
It's amazing 3 black against Sen Sessions - looks like reverse racism to me?? & running 4 office are you???
Us, too. Rather like your colleagues prayed that you would join them in voting for cheaper prescription drugs.

@SheWhoVotes @CoryBooker 
I support your decision to stand up against Sessions.  Wrong man, wrong job, wrong thinking.
thank u 4 speaking out against racist #Sessions w long history of being fair  only to some
@DebraMessing @CoryBooker @SenSchumer @rosie @mmpadellan ReSessions,

If we'd all pray, it'd surely be answered.“HEAR MY prayer, O Lord,and let my cry come to You.”
Psalm 102:1 AMPC
how do you sleep at night after voting the way you did yesterday?
I pray that you all learned w this election:Clintons/Bushes dynasty ended.We'll not heel Hillary.
Disgraceful
Really?Career politicians all the same : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=chkAASced_0 … Stop the circus.Shame on u all.
@DebraMessing @CoryBooker I will oppose Jeff Sessions
Applauding you Senator for continually standing up for the disenfranchised. You give me hope. #NotoSessions
I agree, but why do you oppose affordable prescription drugs?
I applaud your testimony, thank you for speaking out.
The attorney general has a job to do and that is to enforce the laws of the land. Hope and empathy is not a law of the land.
While I support "No" on Sessions, your "No" on Dem. ACA amendments is concerning and contrary to "caring for all"
@DuleHill @CoryBooker Because...he placed a KKK murderer in death row and helped destroy the organization presence in Ala.?
what about praising sessions early last yearb
@gerri_elise @CoryBooker You "pray" your colleagues join you? That verb is inappropriate in this context, Sen Booker. #SCS
where have you been for the past 8 years allowing Obamas racial divisiveness? Now you stand against a good man?
@NatAbortionFed suck it up buttercup
yea, just like we prayed you would join the democrats in voting for cheaper medicine. you failed us. AGAIN.
@DavidYankovich Thank You Senator Cory Booker! Your opposition to Jeff Sessions during Con.Hearings is INSPIRING!#Booker'20
#Booker2020 #HindsightIs2020 Thank you Cory #JerseyStrong
Please Senator Cantwell & Murray
Best of luck from Canada, senator
Thank you Sen @CoryBooker!!
@summerbrennan @CoryBooker Thank you Senator Booker!
Thank you for speaking out and picking conscience and country over precedent.  You rock!!
I sure hope they do too !! Fantastic Job you did !!
RUN FOR POTUS NEXT!!!
Thank you for your testimony today. Keep going hard.
Thank you for speaking your conscience and for the people of the nation.  Courage
@mdlabranche @CoryBooker the ding dongs won't
Weird... totally contradicted his statement last year... take a look  https://youtu.be/3e2lR3tJfPw 
Thanks for standing up for the Majority of Americans. Racism shouldn't exist in 2017. Get rid of sessions!
@ChrisVanHollen @Be Card Information pls join Senator Booker and say no to #Sessions civil rights infractions.
Can you say hypocrite?
So you must be a typical politician. Say one thing, mean another. You praise Sessions last year now you condemn
@civilrightsorg @CoryBooker Thank you, Senator Booker, for standing up for your convictions.
Go Jeff Sessions and Trump!  Cory is obviously working for Obama and DNC now
Unlikely. Why don't you resign if you object but then you'd lose the cushy benefits of being a senator.
@linmp1031 @CoryBooker Senator Booker showed real courage and leadership today.
Just put a hold on the nomination just like the RepublicParty did to Barack for 8 years
@tomasrabago1 @CoryBooker  We pray with you Senator
thank you Senator Booker. Praying with you!
@realDonaldTrump Cory your delusional Pentecostal Thumping and Screaming routine is laughable. Keep Your Dog and Pony show for the ignorant
@seanhannity  Cory Here here is my take on you. "Never underestimate the importance of a stupid person in a large  crowd"
This is why I voted for President Trump. We need to drain the swamp and flush these self serving Schmucks . Sad
@MMViverito @CoryBooker the @POTUS staff and his appointees brought nothing but division to this country we need change....
Amen in JESUS' HOLY NAME !
you as to why America still has a chance.
Thank you for stepping up and fighting against these cabinet picks who have no room in office. It's people like
@DavidLeopold 
Cory "Wanna Be Obama" Booker for Prez 2020
today you made us proud to be American
thank you sir for all you do! True Patriot!
thank you for your leadership. Need more in Congress like you! #TrumpLeaks #preserveprogress #sessionsvotedno
U r a race baiter not a real man at all u and Al Sharpton would make a great pair
thank you
ugly bald phony
"I feel blessed & honored to have partnered w/ Senator Sessions in being the senate sponsors in this important award."
Senator Cory Booker 
Thank you!
What a disappointment you are. You squandered an opportunity to chart a new coarse. Can't support you
How about you oppose Tillerson while you're at it, since he's worse.  Forget 2020 if you vote for him.
thank you! #NoSessions
@occupybergennj @CoryBooker I hope you show the same principled conviction and oppose Betsy DeVos. Bad pick for public ed.
i wish he had shown some backbone on the pharma bill. but he has no spine.
@occupybergennj @CoryBooker Voter suppression was the true crime of the 2016 election. We need to protect citizens & vote.

.@CoryBooker attacks on Jeff Sessions are so far-fetched I half-expected his make-believe friend T-Bone to be next witness.
Thank you for standing up in opposition.
Thank you for being on the right side of history!
Thank you Senator for standing up.  We pray with you. #stopsessions
Only YOU & others perpetuate racism. It harms us all, but mostly black men, women & children. Shame on you.
The Country (well, @ least I do)-THANK YOU Senator, 4 standing up 4 us ALL!! #Integrity #Passionate4Right 
Thank you Senator Booker for all that you do!
he voted against cheaper medicine. he's a grandstand for cameras, throw ppl under the bus POS.
@theTonyGee @CoryBooker
#CoryBooker is a lying politician fighting democracy.Sessions is a wonderful guy;Booker once praised him. #TrumpPressConference @CoryBooker 
Pray hard Senator
Many of us are praying with you, Sen. Booker! #stopsessions

@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews @foxandfriends @Varneyco @mike_pence 
#Booker  trips over his own words about #Sessions https://twitter.com/Quoimio/status/819323067625259008 …
I will pray too. Thank you.
