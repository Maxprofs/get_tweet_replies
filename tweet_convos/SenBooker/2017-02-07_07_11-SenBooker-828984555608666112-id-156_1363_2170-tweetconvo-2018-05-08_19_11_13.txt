how is giving parents choice a huge loss for education? #confirmDeVos #noondevos
B/c rural areas will NOT have a choice-only less $ for their schools. Even w/vouchers too expensive for many
not true the more choices there r the less cost. More lies from education establishment
Where was your flock educated? Public or private? Choice great, no educational experience, who suffers
children in the inner cities suffer. They would thrive if parents were allowed choice with vouchers
will a billionaire make the choices affordable TO ALL. Public schoolers aren't billionaires. Are you rich?
This retired tchr says dept of Ed is unhelpful, generally gets in the way, & could best serve students by ceasing to exist
@djwoolverton I want to believe your opposition to her is justified your record says otherwise

As a NJ resident I ask that you please oppose Trumps Labor nominee as well.
why - you are indoctrinated
yes if we had just had the dems vote for lower med cost for USA
@nytimes our P.S.system hs bn in a downward spiral since Reagan. Prizing inherited "smartness" over effort is unacceptable
Remember Bush legacy C? Gov n school boards mst b removed or held accountable. Raping th system is not investing
Devos, a Calvinist n proponent of Homeschooling sees P.S.E. as edu 4 th poor She follows rigid biblical doctrine.
she does not- where do you idiots get this stuff?  learn something real
.@SenBookerOffice LOL huge loss for your piggy bank Unions.... She will be confirmed.
Answer: Yes. Question: Do elections have consequences?
Absolutely, will weakening the unions be one of them? I dont think so.
No. TBH Unions aren't terrible  in theory. DJT is smart for making a play for the moderate ones IMHO
Government employee unions are terrible in theory.
Agreed. I am in a special job that draws the same paycheck and unionizing is illegal
but wow, we'll have god's kingdom on earth. how nice. and fascist overlords. how nice. and more rubes! #resist
resist what - so ignorant and low informed - learn something
Not what you thought when you worked w/DeVos! Typical Dem hypocrite!
who will be a hero for USA #Education and vote #NoonDeVos

What exactly do you disagree with Devos on? Besides her political party? 

Vouchers? Nope.
Charter schools? Nope.
 #OhCory
The loss would be the teachers unions, not the students. Put Education first! @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump
says the hack who supports gutting public education.
not sure why you still desire to hold back inner city kids and offer no choice in education except low performing schools
@MarkCCrowley So sorry it didn't happen 
And we will know who to blame. The Repukes.


I would think they would donate it to the refugees
Like you found the backbone to vote for importing prescription drugs from Canada? You sold your vote! #CorporateGoon
too bad this congress don't have any balls
https://twitter.com/ReaderAdrift/status/828981929122885632 … @SenatorCollins
 @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain
This is the most frightening thing about this whole charade. Absolutely no senate check on Bannon and crew. https://twitter.com/SenFranken/status/828975579395477504 …
so stupid - Bannon is a good man
If Booker votes for #BigPharma , it will be a Huge loss for Americans.  oh wait.. what.?. oh never mind... #sellout
wrong as usual Cory - learn something
.@SenBookerOffice  Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, is a vocal supporter of charter schools.
Before being elected .@SenBookerOffice   became a political and social media celebrity  mayor. The Democrat was a magnet for big donors
really? Thought you supported school "choice", i.e. privatization. Too hypocritical for me.
bioker ur an idiot
sadly for our children another Republican backbone could not be found :(
What do we now that DeVos is head of education in America? #NoToDeVos
Loss? It will be a tragedy! No clue about public ed. Her schools have mink hallways, gold floors. Another DJT billionaire!
Thank you for all you do @SenBookerOffice.  You put up a good fight.  Sad that Republicans or so divisive.
@realDonaldTrump Boring, Fruitless, Delusional, Pandering, Carnival Barker, Misleading,Whiners, Liberal Party, Liars!
1 more Republican wouldn't do the right thing..SHAME ON YOU! !!
I sincerely appreciate your effort, Senator. I can't say I expected any of the spineless to sprout vertebrae. You tried.
how can this be happening?
I will tell you how: ALEC
.@SenBookerOffice @colbert_ed The new @GOP logo.
says the senator who back Clinton and stop cheaper drugs coming into the u.s. took money from pharmaceutical company
try to keep your hypocrisy to a minimum. I know it's hard.

@Big_Dave_1984 It's truly outrageous. This world has gone completely insane.
no backbone to be found
Wait, aren't you in favor of privatizing public education? Hmm.
don't even bother running in 2020 fraud-you make a good speech but then look at your donors and voting record - dishonest

How? Other than pissing off unions, she likes charter, ability 2fire a poor teacher, no common core BS, & students first!
because Newark was doing so well before...give me a break!
Thanks to the senators who fought to do the right thing for our children. We will not forget it @SenateDems
Apparently none of them have spines. We have 2 yrs to grow Democratic challengers for their seats.
You spelled unions wrong
Mr Booker. Unless you work across the aisle starting now , you are done !!   See the light my good man with slick tongue!!!
.   Well it's done.  More to blame the corrupt Rethuglicans for.
thank you for voting no.
pathetic pence!
@unbreakablepenn Sanders would have won.....
HONESTLYNO REPUB, HAS A GOD DAMN BACKBONE...We will will fight, and speak out LOUD AND CLEAR FOR OUR CHILDREN
You mean a huge loss for teachers unions and democrats. Tell the truth senator.
Just got a long E from Toomey, pursuant to my attempted calls  & my E last week.  He is supporting DeVos for sure.
I would think most would agree...we are responsible for our children... 

#noDevos @SenBookerOffice #holdthefloor #NOonBetsyDeVos
vote Yes on DeVos
get Dean heller from Nevada! He's a in a blue state he has to be feeling the pressure
thank you, @CoryBooker You make us proud!
If nobody comes forward, FILIBUSTER!
One more Republican needs to put the children of America ahead of party - that doesn't take backbone, it takes compassion
u didn't feel that way when u aligned urself w/ DeVos to help the poor school system in #Newark
but u hate teacher unions! You Cory Booker r a Devos inabler!
#NoOnDeVos #Republicans unit for the sake of our children, our values, our future. Please!
@SamSeaborn if she is, we keep fighting the good fight.
sure is pathetic seeing you dance for your Dem masters. But it won't help you.

Those opposed to DeVos: Read this, and please justify vote for teachers unions/rules.  http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/08/31/the-rubber-room … via @newyorker
Best endorsement one could ask for : )
As former mayor of Newark you should be supporting school choice. Don't condem poor kids to bad schools
Unions have run public schools in the ground for too long! That ends today!!!!!
please stop the dramatics and the crocodile tears.
Public education is already failing poor children. How can it get worse?  We need a change in direction.
Thank God for giving us a proven leader and champion for schoolchildren!!! #MAGA Yes to Betsy!!!!!!!
Thank you for your voice, your strength and your heart! @SenBookerOffice #NoOnDeVos
@VP @SenBookerOffice If @BetsyDeVos is confirmed, it will be a huge loss  4Progressive Unions/Common Core! NationalizedEd is pure ignorance!
still praying that someone with a heart for special needs children will stand up and say NO!
#YesOnDevos
Stop thinking of your political career! This is why Dems fail improving the quality of life in the inner cities!
STOP just STOP You are lying to the ppl! Shame on you!

yes
having U in the Senate is a huge loss 4 New Jersey & America! How much $$$$ did teacher unions give you??   I'd like 2know
How can you possibly oppose school choice.  You are a puppet of the teachers' unions.   Shameful.
I don't disagree. But where was your backbone when you voted against @SenSanders @SenSanders Rx bill, senator?
we R forced to bring in immigrants cos #Americans R not prepared for STEM edu - so much for public education! #NoOnDeVos
And...we will remember at the voting booth.  Many will be gone.  You, however, are here for the duration.  Incredible.
it'll only be a huge loss for the teachers unions
@ANTONIO47MEX dumb statement.Public Education in American is already at the bottom Internationally.What loss,union jobs?
Wrong Booker it'll be a win for poor kids that don't have any other choice
what else can we do? Let us know!
nope http://www.kotcb.com/2017/02/blackwater-in-school-house.html …
Thank you for continuing the fight. One @SenateGOP needs to grow a spine and do the right thing for a generation of kids.
you mean govt education. Just say what you mean next time.
You're wrong. It will be a huge loss for the union-boss monopoly. The win would be for real education...
@BetsyDeVos has done more to help #innercity kids than all of her predecessors combined
@mayread3
We pay more per student than any other country and we're ranked around 25th in education!!! Stupid policies got us here!!!
@PhoenixWomanMN - please lobby Jeff Flake
.@SenBookerOffice NO education takes place at the Dept of Education- should be closed- $'s saved
¡Muchas gracias! This middle school Gay Straight Alliance proud of you- You make real difference to our kids & our country

Thank you @SenBookerOffice Please keep trying to get that extra vote of #NoonDeVos
I am pretty much convinced that there are no more backbones in the Republican Party!
PLEASE. #NoonDeVos
@ClaraJeffery who are our best two chances on the GOP side to convince?
keep fighting for the majority of Americans who value education and the Dept of Ed.
BTW Sen Booker ... please stop supporting charter schools over public education. Thank  you.
and pls get your hand out of the cookie jar so you can represent & not just talk!
Back to the educational approach of the first pilgrims!
my son has special education needs and I'm so scared of her being confirmed. Fl doesn't have a strong education system.
This is part of the Repub plan to make America uneducated again. (So that they keep winning elections)
please 1more repub show courage Ipray u never have a child g/Child niece nephew who needs IDEA all children need a good edu
Huge loss for teachers unions...
Thank you @CoryBooker  for your support of #publicschools and for YOU having a backbone 
They are ALL our children and the foundation of our society.  They deserve a qualified Sec of Education. #NoOnDeVos
Unions did a lot for workers. Do some research. Not every parent wants their kid in a failing charter shool. @SenBookerOffice
all of us have children and gran children they deserve better  one of you please step up and be remembered in history
Block DeVos
