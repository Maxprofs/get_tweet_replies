@CoryBooker YOU ARE A LIAR! YOU NEED TO BE RESIGN!
How much did Soros/Hillary/Obama pay you to say that? You're a sellout!
Don't worry it isn't finalized yet.  But we can get to watch the discussions openly.  We can read it before the votes.
The house GOP literally would not let people in to see it. ACA was debated for over a month and took 200+ amendments b4 vote.
We can see the GOP plan(s) now and ACA made so many "deals" behind closed doors it shld have been illegal
Check out http://www.GETAnalysis.ca  Blog: #ObamaCare → #TrumpCare → #RyanCare → #NoOneCare
@hairmich42 Sen.Booker is the greatest. So happy he is on the side of intelligent people... Repugs are just stupid.
And the CBO said Obamacare is stable fiscally now. Not imploding as GOP keeps saying.
Corey you are a true supporter of America. Thank you for fighting for all!!
It is NOT Trumpcare, but Ryan-Rhino care. BIG difference in the two plans. Get it straight and stop mislabeling it.
@CoryBooker If you symbolically vote against lower drug prices what would you do on the real bill.
Canada has a tougher drug approval process than the USA.
Thank you Senator for speaking up for the millions of Ppl who will lose coverage under #Trumpcare #resist
@CoryBooker CBO says majority will be uninsured willingly due to not having to pay the mandated penalty.
they'll be uninsured willingly due to being unable to afford it. Just not penalized for it.
don't want it says he dont need insurance and hates having to be force to have it
@CoryBooker I think we should call it tRumpdoesn'tcare! Thank you for your stand!
please keep fighting for us!!!! Your our only hope!!! 
If 1/10th of 1% die from lack of care that's 24000 souls. The Republican view is they have an obligation to die.
@CoryBooker people like you said that premiums would be affordable with ObamaCare. Sooo, I'm guessing you're lying now too.
Why don't the American citizens get the same health plan as the senators?
Great video Senator. Very clear and to the point. Well done.
I hope your Republican colleagues will join you in outrage. Why shaft the most vulnerable? Emergency room visits cost $$$!
Trumpcare is Unaffordable Health Care Act:  UHCA like yucka
thank you, senator
Lets see him come up with a plan. This is going to take time send your ideals to Donald he a President that will listen
GOP & Trumpcare:  The plan's essence:  Survivor of the fittest & the Richest!"""
Thank you, Sen. Booker!
thank you for the explanation and looking out for all those people affected by this. #NoTrumpCare
Thanks so much, @CoryBooker , for standing up for our healthcare.
Love that you are keeping up the fight.
@realDonaldTrump 's Trumpcare is unbelievably bad 4 the poor, some middle class & definitely the elderly baby boomers! WTH
So thankful everyday that people like you are helping our country. You make the world a better place. #Resistance
this is criminal and will cause multiple deaths and possibly the beginning of the end. Yes if watch reports we were LIED2
@CoryBooker it let's the states expand Medicaid. Yet it's ok to force others to pay someone else's premiums which inc thers
please stop this miscarriage of equitable treatment. True access to affordable healthcare should be available for all!
..Don't call it Trump care, it is a fake care,Trump does not care for tax paying middle class
What a mess. The GOP/Tea Party is doing whatever they want without consequences. They are Zealots, Charlatans, Soulless.
Keep fighting and resisting.
Why aren't Democrats holding up their proposal for fixing and improving ACA? Wasting free press time. Start selling a better answer!
@CoryBooker maybe I'll get some of the money it's cost me for everyone to have insurance, even just lazy people
@AZ_GolferGal #TrumpDontCare
I am worried!
@CoryBooker It's so wrong. Can't you convince any so-called conservatives to care about their community & be selfless?
@CoryBooker And the same report say Obamacare isn't failing.
@CoryBooker Sen Booker read the ACA, then plug in the next 2 prongs. Now get on board. Mr. Positive. Help save American's
@Mark_Sheppard without medicaid, my spine will never be fixed... im going to be stuck like this-nearly immobile...
@Mark_Sheppard i have many chronic illnesses & im only 21, TRYING to be a student. How can i w/o my health? Im on Medicaid!
@CoryBooker I agree. Thanks for all that you do.  Your are a shining star in our party. I hope midterms change the dynamic.
Brain Education. http://www.einpresswire.com/article/371085341/brain-education?r=paf1v7iFdH20K1XNV3 … … via @ein_news Without brain ed., the majority will remain emotionally sick & nothing will change
@Mark_Sheppard wow
@CoryBooker I love that you have captions for your video!
only if they choose not to be covered
I can't wait to vote you out of office. Seriously  I am like counting the days!!! 
Since this ridiculous plan came out have heard the unfairness of this plan (it is not a bill) scares us all @Mark_Sheppard
@Mark_Sheppard Why do I not feel like America is "great again?"
The Rep bill ups how much insurance cos can charge old person vs young frm 3-to-1 to 5-to-1. Minimum $500 monthly to $900!
we who voted vs Trump & his lies, have written to our reps, tweeted, protested, & R still like sitting ducks ... #IMPEACH
with everything O has done for his terms he would been impeached. But we'd be called racist by u crybabies.
@Mark_Sheppard @SenBookerOffice MARK COME TO BRASIL.
@CoryBooker why not step in and talk to trump . Offer to repeal the ACH only if all Americans can sign up on Medicare #CBO
@CoryBooker all Americans can be taxed additionally on the Medicare side....insurance for all. Bernie is on the right path!
Lol. Okay, Mr. "I Take the Most From the Health Care Industry in the Country."
@CoryBooker propose Medicaid for all, insurance co's can monitor and address all payouts, CEO's all take cuts in pay..hmmm
@CoryBooker reach across the aisle with a plan that will works better then the Obama care scam
@CoryBooker Obama care was set up to fail to blame the private sector and force government health care
@CoryBooker Go Cory! Fight!
where is ur proof that it will be more expensive? Wouldn't cross state line lower premium?
avg premium for older ind in Nj is $800/ month-y don't u say how to reduce the premium? Y don't u agree w/cross state line?
This is Trump!
good job
@CoryBooker cob also was wrong by over 100 billion dollars
We need heath care for all (Medicare). We the people don't need to line the pockets of Pharm. and Ins.
were shocked at the democrats wont help fix there mess typical liberal make a mess let someone clean it up.
@CoryBooker bet most will be all the undocumented aliens that we are paying for now. Oh you knew this so tell the truth!!!
How many are uninsured rn that can't afford the premiums?
@CoryBooker I'm going out to shovel and howl a#t th#e moon if I can see it
@CoryBooker great optimism the president says we might as well be listening to Monty pithon but not funny
Kill it!!!
check into also the Sands Layoff several years ago and the reactions of people who used to work there Egg Harbor Township
.@SenBookerOffice .@CoryBooker keep spreading the truth. 2018 & 2020 are just around the corner. The White House belongs to the people
Obamacare and F-U-C-K  and Joe Biden and Galloway Township NJ  check into it is Inspirational and maybe a listen to
@CoryBooker with Republicans in control of House & Senate, what is strategy & chance of defeating his atrocity?!
@CoryBooker You say we should fight it. Are the democrats going to FIGHT it?
@CoryBooker And we're going to believe #CBO because....
@CoryBooker Thank You Senator Booker for an honest synopsis of this "disaster"!!!
this isn't final yet. Ur bill was bare to begin with too and CBO said it was too much also. Rmembr
produce the actual numbers that are currently enrolled in Obama care? Since the CBO's numbers are wrong?
@CoryBooker How angry were you when all your Wall St. friends ruined the economy for millions?! You must have been furious!
@CoryBooker I'm sorry for venting. I'm disabled. My hubby is my caregiver. Bad decisions will cripple us.#Frightened&Scared
@CoryBooker Medicare, Medicaid, Planned Parenthood, affordable medical insurance FOR ALL is necessary! #BeyondFrustrated!
Shocked? Hardly. Given the GOPs only interest was in tax breaks for the wealthy this was totally predictable.
I can hear the sound of the wheels coming off the GOP bus. Let's gear up Dems & get this right in 2018!
@CoryBooker Why can't this be realistically revamped? Who will actually do the job to help us? #SickOfGovtThatDoesn'tWork!!
@CoryBooker took me some time to figure out that the #s are not wrong. Trumpcare is wrong. #resist
as a fmr hospital CEO looks like a return to old days of cost shifting, caring for uninsured and passing costs onto insured
Thank you very much Cory !!
@CoryBooker please please fight this bill. We are seniors not ready to die.My husband has care thru ACA he will die.
@CoryBooker What exactly did Obamacare accomplish, other than ppl losing their perfectly fine insurance and Drs???
@CoryBooker thank you. #CallYourCongressman #calledmycongressman
@CoryBooker you should wear your superman cape when u do these videos. (And maybe tell us your plan or some proposal)
@CoryBooker trump is awful. What can we do to stop crazy?
Looks like you should have backed Bernie during the election, rather than the tainted one.
@CoryBooker -PLEASE keep calling it TRUMPCARE..make sure he owns it!
@CoryBooker President Trump has not had his input on this proposal yet. However, we have no doubt he will save us from ACA
These detailed breakdowns are so great. Thank you! I retweeted.
I love how you explain this to people.  I hope with ALL my heart, the right people hear you and understand.
@CoryBooker you are a champion. Thank you for speaking directly to the people. Whatever you decide to do you have my vote!
@CoryBooker thank you booker! Excellent summary; we absolutely cannot let this be our country! #Trumpcare #TrumpRussia
@CoryBooker Cory, I think you and Dems should not only fight against Tcare but stand up FOR Ocare. FIGHT!
Thank you Senator Cory Booker! Trumpcare will be a disaster for 24 million Americans. We will not let that happen!
@CoryBooker at least Sen Booker has the best medical care taxpayers can buy
@CoryBooker it's RyanCare not TrumpCare. I assume your latest is because you share some "sponsors" with Ryan.
It's Trumpcare because he's the damn president.
GOt one huge ? why didnt you do this for obama care scheme seriously ... im just going to wait and see ...
@CoryBooker Do you agree basic universal health care for all should be our goal as Americans?
@CoryBooker Thank you. Agree 100%. Basic health care for all. Paid by income tax and tax on unhealthy goods.
Lot's of phony blinking, over-acting, and faux outrage. Nice try

@CoryBooker When will I receive my $2500 premium reduction that Dems promised under Obamacare? Oh Dems are not lying now?
@Africanfighter
This is unacceptable. ..
thanks for all of your hard work!
Thanks!ACA saved my mom because her mammogram and treatments were covered. Her breast cancer was found at stage 1.
I'm so happy your mom is a survivor!!!! God bless her always!! 
Thank you for speaking out against this bill. This bill is just wrong. Healthcare should not be a luxury in the US.
is it a luxury today under Obamacare?
anything is a luxury to the lazy when they don't pay for it.
" If we took all the money & combined Medicare & Medicaid & had no private health insurance that should pay for everyone
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Cory Where Was Your Mouth When Barry Rammed Through ObamaCare? Selective Spam coming from You
