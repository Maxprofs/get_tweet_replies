Voting at midnight? Doesn't sound like the work of the people. Sounds like @GOP has something to hide. Maybe bad #CBO score? #KillTheBill

Really? Happened many times under Harry Reid. You don't recall his threats to lock them all in?  Selective memory.
This senator from Wyoming is an arrogant gasbag. "Spend your time reading the bill"
And he certainly is impressed with footnotes.
He says bill done in secret, SHUTTING US ALL OUT, was done "without any constructive suggestion from the other side"
Tomorrow when I fall asleep at my desk I will show the timelines on this broadcadt as explanation.
The chat on Periscope is as disheartening as the activity in the senate.
It is 12:54. Do you know where your healthcare is?

PLEASE  stop this bickering between each other and focus on what REALLY matters with all your joint wealth do GOOD
L
What a circus 
I want Obamacare repealed.Its http://unconstitutional.Health  Insurance is not a right it's a personal responsibility.stop living off the government
They should just repeal Obamacare. Start from scratch. If not done senators and congressmen need to be switched to Obamacare.
@VP @FoxNews @AJENews @MrRichieAtwood @Newsweek @realDonaldTrump  @POTUS @FLOTUS  @Pontifex @pope_news @MargaretAtwood   here's culpultation
why is it the people never know what is in the bill- AHA?? Until it passed. Now Trump-Care??? Almost criminal!!
Donald Trump is making himself untrusted. Obama health care is a teat case for him. Go and do the right thing Senators.
This idea was so silly I don't know why anyone thought it would pass, even with pinky promise with the House.
President Trump is threatening the republican senator.

Hahaha!
Can't believe these guys up. Trying for a vote 
If this passes all yes voters should be charged with crimes against the American people.
Stfu kaine.

Yes!  We all know it's broken.   Get off your asses and fix it!  This is what we pay you to do!
I'M ASKING MY PARTY TO VOTE NO ON THE SENATE HEATHCARE BILL AND ACCEPT OBAMACARE FAITHFULLY!!!
Check out this awesome website
"http://Mydependablemovers.com "
Thanks
Who cares. Just another political party waste of time
bad for USA,

Repeal now and start getting through the pain  stop prolonging 
The faster we get better
For the archives.
Now start working on bipartisan changes to Obamacare
Kariri
Sen. From Wyoming.  I LOVE MY HSA and I Love making my on choices. That is what I want in my healthcare coverage
2010 McCain was for full repeal...now just a vendetta against Trump, what of the people?
@Bethenny you need to file some sort of injunction against these brand swiping assholes!
Sit down senator
Healthcare is a human right not a economic right!!!

Single Payer = Liberty not Entitlement 

long live OBAMA!!!!
@ Impeach and Replace later
Politics that inspire
Well said!
No repeal skinny or otherwise we the ppl want U Congress 2work bipartisan w/@SenateDems 2fix improve ACA 4all US @SenateGOP do ur JOB

Live idiocy of Democrats.
We don't need a skinny repeal. We need a big, fat reversal.
Hey guys, @GOP stop trying to screw over the poor and sick and work with @SenateDems to make healthcare better. Stop this assault on ur own.
Thank you Democrats,  John McCain,  Lindsay Graham!  Now let's repair the ACA!
Trump has to be taught how the Senate works! How it analize and study every angle of an issue before taking a decision. Senators do your job
It failed how wonderful

@CNN @realDonaldTrump Skinny,fat whatever. Reps. had 8-yrs to have something written & all they did is complain about Obama. Such children
"3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!"
thank you @JohnMcCain
They should be ashamed.  This bill is not for the people as they not in touch with people. Don't have a clue what to do.
Senate let the American people down big surprise! Mich McConnell needs to go nuclear so they don't have to repeal under reconciliation rules
Corey Booker on Life, Liberty & Happiness, "How can you have LIFE when millions of Americans are about to be thrown off of health coverage?"
I don't like that name!  No fat chicks!
Washington Compost
Skinny dipping at midnight?
Perhaps I can sleep for 2 hours before it starts all over, we have no peace + greatly diminished national safety since the election, so sad!
@GOP #traitors vote for #PutinsDietPlan aka #SkinnyRepeal. #Fail #Bigly
GOP didn't "lose" on the bill, YOUR POTUS lied 2 the ppl. He PROMISED better + cheaper healthcare. He didn't say "but you won't be covered!"

Thank you Senator Booker
Thank YOU JOHN McCain & LADIES Thank YOU GOD loves YOU WE APPLAUD YOU  now work together TAKE time   FIX OBAMA Care for EVERYONE
Thank you for keeping OBAMA Care  now work together to make it better
Relieved - Shummer nailed it.
@SenateMajLdr is the most divisive & hypocritical person in the Senate.
Thank you Senator McCain for having a heart and a soul.
Keep muddying the waters McConnell! That's the only think you're good for
He's crazy and delusional he's gonna cry I think 
McConnell is going to cry and retreat to his shell
BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT!
Spewing the same BS about the Dems. Can we put him on permanent mute?
You are a clown, McTurtle! And a liar too. More people would suffer under your HELLthcare plan.
Lol
Well !!!!
Yeeeessssss!  Now get to the REAL work!
Whoa, Washington Post dedicated explicit URI to the skinny repeal coverage.
Ok @WashingtonPost, get off my twitter feed if you're going to make me pay to read your post! BLOCKED! No other news org. Asks for money!!
Those fuckers better not vote for that pos bull
McCain grandstanding!
Stay strong!Vote it down!
Yay FAIL @GOP @SenateGOP @VP @realDonaldTrump
Skinny repeal.. we only want to kill a few people. Nice job @GOP. 
Because making it skinny makes alllllright. 
It's stalled
Nothing good ever happens after midnight.
Pacific Standard Time? It's past 1am
What are they doing?
Feinstein just gave McCain a hug, then he meanders off, but he was talking to their circle.
Go to bed. Give us a rest.
#SkinnyRepeal is a crock of BS. #ACAIsHereToStay DO NOT REPEAL!!
These are OLD MEN!! They would vote for anything that got their head on a pillow!!
@GOP  This will be the END of you.
Lots of crossed arms in GOP, might be in trouble. Dunno. They aren't exactly looking perky the way they do when they screw people.
What's going on now ??
They are doing this in secretly and as quietly as possible hoping we won't notice how many people they are murdering
I ask because it is an hour past fucking midnight
Which midnight? East or West coast?
Trump is a NAZI!
Why no sound?
McConnell didn't look too happy. Stress!!
They don't look too festive do they?
I hope @SenJohnMcCain steps up
.@washingtonpost on #Periscope: Live video from Senate: Vote on "skinny repeal" expected around midnight. wapo.st
So. Another night with no sleep bc of this healthcare nightmare. Sen's like Graham are gonna vote yes bc Ryan "promised" it would go to (1)
Conference. Which of course is a lie. He'll hold a farce conf, or none at all and Americans will die. GOP will blame Ryan, he won't give a 
@ResistanceParty It's past midnight their time.  WTF.
We're waiting...
And watching.... 

#November2018
Running a bit late, aren't we 
@t_steinwald in case you didn't find any other option
Ahh thank you so much!
Kill this bad bill! Please!
Have they voted yet?
Can't wait until I have the "freedom" to start paying into the GoFundMe campaigns of employed friends who no longer get work insurance.
Republicans are willingly killing folks by stripping away healthcare as they meander jovially & refer to the vote as a show #SadDay4America
On with the body-count
The GOP are betraying the American people. You are responsible for every death that occurs, every family that goes bankrupt and is homeless.
Is that anything like "Skinny Frozen Yogurt"????
I wish I could laugh.
Our citizenry is threatened by the GOP.
if healthcare was food:
Obamacare- "damn B, u put yur big toe in this!"
vs.
Skinnycare- "dafuq in this? on my way to get Wonderbread"
Hey GOP maybe come up with a plan that's not crap before getting rid of the old one.
All I have ever seen is people standing around, talking. A bit like 25-30 highway workers on a road and only see 1 or 2 doing something!
...and no longer force insurance companies to actually sell comprehensive health insurance. They've convinced themselves we want to die.
***IT'S A TRICK. MITCH IS GOING TO DO THE FULL REPEAL IN PEICES. 30M WILL END UP CUT..JUST SLOWER. CAN'T YOU SEE IT? THEY'LL HIDE IT !!****
Thieves in the night
How cowards fight
Their target no less
the weak and helpless
9:24 AM
God these GOP Senators are idiots. They are like high school kids cramming 8 years of what should have been studying in one night.
Shouldn't a healthcare bill actually improve healthcare? Do they not realize this is their fellow citizens?
These snakes deserve NO respect ever again,NONE!!!!!
My gag reflex kicked in, sorry
We are watching! @johnthune #watching
Watching this, I just want to cry!!! #TheResistance
What a lying snake! These GOP criminals belong in prison!

Cc: @joanwalsh  FYI I said it

We Can See You: What the GOP does in the dark. @washingtonpost.... #ConnecttheDots #Periscope #KilltheBill
@LindseyGrahamSC U OWN THIS! Deaths on you! Eye for eye! My child dies nothing will stop my anger directed at those voting
I'm more worried about those old white men who may not stay awake for the vote.
SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SCAM, SCAM, SCAM
Very old white male politician with limited cognitive ability, fumbling through a bill he never read, nor cares abour.
@wpjenna why is this not on C-Span!?
PERSONAL GAIN over country the Trump's theme all along. Americans suffer the cost. This is not America...
#UnitedSovietStatesOfAmerica
*hot mic whisper* "how many more minutes until we're ready to kill the poor sick people?"
GOP are scumbags
@SenatorEnzi
you doddering old evil fool.
Wyoming voters must have bigger heads to voted for this numb skull. They need more doses of insulin.
Time for all lawyers to leave congress.
Stop trying to kill my mom #killthebill

Farce
What did he say? Bc my pump is going to be worthless when I can't afford the $1500/month for the fucking insulin for it.
he told a story about how we need innovation in health care, used insulin pump as example.
rambling story.
If they can get Enzi to shut up!

Vote NO
FatF*ck Piece of Sh*t
Go away Enzi, you're a stooge!
Check out on this GLOBAL PHENOMENON!!
A DEAD DECOMPOSING CORPSE IS BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE BY THE MIGHTIEST PROPHET OF THE LORD
