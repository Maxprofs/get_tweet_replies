Thank God.....Trump is going down
Seriously? For what? No evidence anywhere
LOL! Are you one on the 16 lawyers on the case?
Nah, hardly... Are you?
Keep this in your record book.. That meeting with Don Jr will be the demise of Donald Trump ;)...You can save this message if you wish too
We'll see, thanks for not getting ugly about disagreeing. You have links I can read @ evidence/laws broken?
and just an FYI-if the public is just finding out this stuff..Imagine how far ahead Mueller is....16 lawyers werent hired for nothing....
2 sides... but I'm going to dig
In the face of coordinated disinformation campaign carried out by Russian state media and @FoxNews , congress takes action. Revoke fox FCC!
and boycott Fox advertisers even if they advertise on other networks Obama was right years ago to dismiss Fox from WH press pool but...
fellow journalists stood up for propagandists wonder how they feel about that now?
fox is registered as http://entertainment.com  not http://media.com  which is news ..
True, but they call themselves news and the kool-aid drinkers believe every word
I still can't wrap my head around that capacity to embrace blatant lies easily debunked Until this nightmare I had no idea so many people..
As a kid, I used to wonder how Hitler got his people to commit great crimes against their friends and neighbors.   I don't wonder anymore.
I never wanted to know such a thing. I despair that we find ourselves understanding this.
Why don't they just start impeachment instead.
Thank you both Senator @CoryBooker  and @LindseyGrahamSC. POTUS must not be allowed to obstruct justice.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CoryBooker Please hurry. After today, Trump is on vacation and will have time on his hands to panic and do something rash.
@realDonaldTrump is ALWAYS on vacation!
Please suspend suck power until the investigation is completely over.
It is so ridiculous that Congress is having to pass laws to prevent @realDonaldTrump from doing things that shouldn't be done!
Obama and the clintons have no integrity completely crooked
Who pulled your chain bot?
I love how @realDonaldTrump is uniting everyone AGAINST him. These people should know he'll take anyone down to save his fat butt.
Graham has a long way to go to make up the the trump mess he has enabled and emboldened.
Save your applause.
absolutely!
This is a must.. if they're to afraid to impeach at least limit his powers.
Hard to impeach after you took the cash. Complicit.
How about legislation that says a presidential candidate needs to pass a psyche eval, submit their taxes & cannot employ their royal family!
Exactly. @CoryBooker @LindseyGrahamSC
Let's hope so.
Who wants to bet this Republican Congress would allow Trump to get away with firing Mueller?
@LindseyGrahamSC warned his @GOP Party abt @realDonaldTrump.. they ignored his advice! @cspan @SenateFloor @dscc
2 numbnuts that kust crave attention and political points. any of these 2clowns would FAIL in private life. they woodnt B so bold w/rhetoric
Hurry
This a great step forward.  Thank you!
Neither of these 2 mouthpieces woodnt make it in the REAL WORLD. go crooked agenda.
Yeah, and uh, hello hurry up....
Thank you @CoryBooker and @LindseyGrahamSC for your work!
Can you amend ut to add prohibition against firing nuclear weapons too, please?
That they have to write a bill preventing Trump from firing Mueller, proves Trump has the right to fire Mueller. Stop the madness.
Thank you both!
dt proofing the Congress
Can we change the locks on the White House while he's gone golfing for 17 days?
The theocrats ... whoa ... are they right? That God is working? cuz sho nuff only Trump could bring these two together. #bipartisanbros
Thank you for reporting on the bipartisan efforts to keep our democratic processes intact!
Follow the money, it's about the money and RUSSIA.
Of all the people running for president, the people had to let this guy into the WH, Trump's are running a game on the USA with Russia
You remember doing the Campaign he call our Senators stupid, remember when his Don Jr / Kusher stated money pouring in from RUSSIA.
Look Senator Graham, There's something seriously going on with the Trump's and RUSSIA. It's obvious and no one is above the law
It's about time you see the real deal about Trump. Trump will pardon people who gets caught,
Bipartisanship is Alive and Well! Thank you Senators! @AprilDRyan @SenSanders @jimsciutto
Thank you both
The Senate bill helps make America great again
Thank u for protecting democracy
@KellyannePolls Comments? Or nothing to say?!!
We now have to draft laws to protect America from it's own President #SMH
Bill would be unconstitutional. Then again,Congress is not concerned with the rule of law. Mueller's appointment and position are not legal
Thank goodness some of our Senators are on point, ever watchful and busy protecting our Constitution! Godspeed to you all....#grateful
Graham is just a closet case who's still bitter he got beat. This special counsel is on a witch hunt and should be ended.
A bi-partisan effort finally!  Thank you @sengraham2016 @SenBookerOffice
Aslmo alkom
Do it NOW!
Shoulda got it done b4 ur vacations this is has been going on too long for it not to have been done
@sengraham2016 ...hurry, please. Truly worried, daily.
R Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina + D Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware Also!
Is there a way to block @POTUS from pardoning family members?
A year ago I would've never called Graham an American hero, but now...
I think we need  senator cracker just so one time we can talk about the graham cracker proposal.
A Big Thanks to Senators @CoryBooker n @LindseyGrahamSC for fighting for the truth about Russia. Americans needs to know the truth.
Watch them sneak something really evil into that bill.
OMG Did the #GOP grow a backbone?
By the way, thank you to both senators!
Trump should be impeached. I have never seen a more corrupted person! The USA has to be saved from this demented and tyrant lout!
No. This is enabling him. Instead, congress should let him do it and then impeach him.
Wow, really. I'm shocked, good for you Senator Graham, #FakePresident full of #FalseNarratives #Impeach the #CheetohTwatWaffle
Write faster, gentlemen.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CoryBooker Thanks to both of you for setting an example & supporting needed safeguards. This can't happen again.
There is going to be some new senators.  here won't be long. you made promises and you haven't kept them yet.
you don't want to help America, you see what happen to McCain, might happen to you too.
Isn't really sad that They have to do this! What they need to really do is impeach him.
Sen. Graham has consistently exemplified courage.!
Bravo for your common sense  courage cooperative leadership
Time for single payer with incentives for wellness practices
Grow up Lindsey.
Senate will be in session long enough this month to ensure this gets passed. We're expecting big bipartisan support. @SenSchumer @SenateGOP
Get it done!
Well done. It is good to find congressmen who have not forget where their loyalties should be. Not with a man, but w the People. The Country
All for show - think Trump would sign it?? Lol!!!
Important to keep this treacherous weasel in check.
Thank you @CoryBooker for looking out for America
Like
I'm glad someone still has enough integrity to stop a madman.
Get on it, @LindseyGrahamSC
Dems need leadership now for 2020. Can Booker fill the role.  If not who?
So trump is going to sign the bill lol
I love it! A bipartisan effort.
And in so doing may be saving his Presidency.  If he fires Mueller both sides turn on him, and Mueller gets hired by Congress. He's toast.
Ahole
Wise...very wise...spoiled rich man with no regard for our country...
I may just be a country lawyer but I'm fairly certain that is a clear violation of Separation of Powers and unconstitutional.
Fast-track this @LindseyGrahamSC and @CoryBooker.
Unconstitutional law, dumb&dumber booker, does not understand 3 branches of government .
Thank you @LindseyGrahamSC and @CoryBooker!  America needs these laws now more than ever.
The unfortunate thing here is they have the power to impeach so why don't they use it. The country can't wait much longer.
Better hurry
this guy is in view he is out to get Pres.Trump anew person would Swear This clown was a Flaming Democrat Were is his Outrage on Clinton?
Every soundbite an appearance needs to be saved an USED against This sponge an the other Closet Democrats Masqurading as Repub n election YR
Great thinking!
Better hurry!!
Two specific Ass Hole of magnitude!
Graham and Mcain are 2 peas Ina pod, both are trators!!!!!!
Despicable Lindsey Graham. @LindseyGrahamSC
'bout time!
NO RECESS SENATE UNTIL YOU BLOCK ANY DT EFFORTS TO FIRE MUELLER
Thank you Senator @LindseyGrahamSC and Senator @CoryBooker for writing a bill to block Trump from firing Mueller.
They have nothing. How long will this "investigation" go on? The swamp trying to derail Trump's presidency. That's all this is.
God bless you both
Graham has got to go.
Thank God, it was time for someone to show some sanity.
#ImpeachTrumpNow #TrumpRussia #MuellerTime #MoneyLaundering #TrumpModelManagement #PutinsPuppet #Resist #ComplicitGOP #TrumpCrimeFamily
go for it!
Is nonsense to allow SC to have unlimited power for as long as he wants unless clears T and campaign of any crime first
Nonsense.As I understand it Prez can't fire Mueller. Has to be AG.
Thank you Senator @Corybooker and Senator @LindseyGrahamSC for stepping up to ensure POTUS does not obstruct justice.
Now if we can just get Graham to lead the GOP out of trickle-down policy!
This is SOOOOO obviously. Set up. @sengraham2016
Better hurry. Time's a wasting
Two zeros.
Finally, this is absolutely needed. Thank you both. Great bipartisan bill.
Such a law would be blatantly un-Constitutional as a violation of separation of powers.
2017 Christmas Card
@SenBookerOffice @LindseyGrahamSC  Hurry up! Get it done! Thanks!
Firing Mueller would be blatant obstruction of justice. Let him. Impeach him.
They best hurry. I got a fiver saying he fires Mueller tonight during his campaign stop
Sen Graham..we in SC are proud of you and fully behind you.
Thanks,
Well they better speed it up! After today's news of another grand jury, 45 is sure to blow.
what is going to be added to it
The saddest part of this clickbait is the comments from all the lefty lemmings who think this is even remotely legal under the constitution
Finally working together
They had better do this quickly. Seems like things are heating up!
Disgusting pos
Good! Get it done!
They are asses
Please hurry
GULP, GULP, GULP, GULP....
@LindseyGrahamSC needs to put the drink down.
Quit fartin' around and #ImpeachImpotus
Get ready to do the same for McMaster.
Why is all the moral fiber of the GOP apparent in only a few R senators? @LouiseMensch
I think the way Trump threatened everyone they are seeing him in a new light.
Wonderful, working together!
Thank you @SenBookerOffice @LindseyGrahamSC
She (Lindsey) a mess
Yea let them waste more time instead of working on the real issues America faces. Iran. Russia. N. Korea, budget, drugs, crime. Etc etc etc
Are u kidding me. Didnt like election so from 20,000 ft looks like BS .
Thank You! Hurry Up! A Long awaited bill! Will Trump have to sign this bill??? Can someone tweet me answer pls! If Yes, Trump will die.
Great move fwd.  I'd also like to see Congress restrict all of trump's executive actions pending the outcome of the investigation.
Lindsey Graham is really trying to screw. He knows that if you give a special prosecutor enough time he will find enough evidence on anybody
Like ASAP!
@LindseyGrahamSC @CoryBooker thanks to the both of you
@LindseyGrahamSC l am a constituent. Please follow through and see that this investigation is carried out to the letter of the law.
Can you write a bill blocking him from entering the White House?
When a bill has to be enacted to prevent the president from committing political suicide, you have to wonder about who you've elected.
YAY!!
This has to be done ASAP. A MUST TRUMP CAN'T BE TRUSTED SLEEPING WITH RUSSIA.

Of course, unless there's a huge majority (like with the Russia Sanctions) Trump will just veto the bill.
@PreetBharara next tax returns, conflict of interests, nepotism, for starters?
Fart in England is called Trump. 


@sengraham2016 One Brownie point, one demerit, one Brownie point, one demerit. Getting whiplash. End on a high note and impeach!
Next move should be to impeach the brainless tyrant.
Excellent! Too bad it has to come to this isn't it
Good idea to block Trumpster from firing him. He is running scared that he will be found out!!
Do they BOTH understand their lil plan goes BOTH ways & can bite them in the ass big time! IDIOTS to pursue this further!
Just impeach him already!!
2020's leading Presidential Candidate as of this morning! pass..
Amen legalize it and stop locking people up for weed -how stupid
Surely it can be written faster than the ACA repeal, so it should be ready in a few minutes.
Graham finds his own balls after Trumps approval rating hits all-time low.
and a bill on all presidential candidates MUST release appro. # of tax returns prior to primaries.
How would this work exactly? Discretion of the executive is as broad as broad can be. Is this just to offer Trump enablers some cover?
It's an easy way out for GOP.  They can rid themselves of  claiming their hands are tied when Mueller dumps the dirt.
Will Graham vote for it?
Impeachment would be faster than writing the bill. Why are they still condoning his ability to hold office? He's clearly unfit for office
It's over for him. The proverbial levees are broke.
Hurry up
Better hurry sounds like any day now. He made Demon Hannitty attack Mueller a sign it's comming.
And who's going to pass this bill Graham and Booker? Who's going to sign the passed bill, Trump? You really can't be that stupid
Mark my word. This is not going anywhere.
Graham, Booker writing bill to block Trump from firing special counsel http://hill.cm/a6cSpws  
That's not going to even hit the floor.
This is crap. Gets GOP off the hook. If 45 fires Meuller congress reaches the defining momnt in history they wish 2 avoid: IMPEACH or IGNORE
Putting it on the courts? This is Graham & GOP looking after themselves, not the US. 6 mos of ignoring 45. 2018 will still B a GOP bloodbath
They do know that Trump has to SIGN the bill to make it a law, right? Or do they  think they have the votes to override his veto?
Good job Lindsey and Cory.  We need more bipartisanship like this for the right reasons!
Why not just impeach yer guy.
Agreed.
He is raging about Congress forcing his hand on the Russia sanctions. He needs to get back his own. He's about to blow.
Better hurry!
But...but...Bernie thought of it first...
Better hurry - a lot can  happen between today and their plan to release the bill next week
Yes please write that bill. We have to stop his madness. Limit his power or better  get him out of office to save this country.
#Trumplies #Gaslighting #RacismWhiteHouse #ProtectMueller Good thing bipartisan agreement this is needed.
Fuck yeah!
Obama's not looking too bad now is he, Senator Graham?
