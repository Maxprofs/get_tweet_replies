trump wants fights, that's he's business tactics! Bully people to get what he wants or how much he can ...
how do they know someone is undocumented in order to stop them?!?
racial/ethnic profiling. Atrocious. And yes, illegal too
Trump hates the US Constitution! Trump deals in chaos! He has no respect for the courts. Impeach!
People will not call the police for help or to report an incident because their fearful of being detained.

@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis Stop first, then determine if they are doc'd? Like stop-and-frisk? You've got to be kidding. BS
Democrats do not care about America citizens only illegal cause they vote Democrat
@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis Show me your papers.
Wow... I work in Bel Air and hope other minorities will finally get what African Americans experience!
@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis deport them America first
@CoryBooker Yes it does! RESIST!
this was so bad in AZ, parents being detained bringing their children to school. Thank you for introducing bill to stop it.
why is everyone concerned about an illegal sucking our money from America citizens
What do you call a self-obsessed egg?  An eggomaniac.

@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis Yes it does! It's gets results!  And they are not undocumented, THEY ARE ILLEGLE! Open your eyes!
@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis Real good consequences that will keep Americans safer.
@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis  this is why ex Sheriff Joe Arpaio is in court
@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis goddammit this starts to look like nazi Germany... 'papers, please'
keep our citizens safe first not illegal s
@CoryBooker Didn't they stop that shit in Arizona?
@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis why, because they r enforcing the law? Cory, why r you so against enforcing law and protecting us
exactly
@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis seriously??!!!
@CoryBooker @HarfordAegis 
she's an American citizen
UNBELIEVABLE!!!! #WTF
It's also illegal. Local police shouldn't be actively enforcing federal law & performing immigration enforcement.
why they r first line of defense. They should ask everyone they stop and deport them
It will contribute to less trust between police and the communities they serve.
people don't trust police anyways
