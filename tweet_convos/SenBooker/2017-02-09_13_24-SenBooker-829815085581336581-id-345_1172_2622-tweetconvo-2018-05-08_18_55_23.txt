Let us pray for President Trump and his administration.
BETTER still let's IMPEACH Pres Trump and his administration
I'll second that!
Motion Approved. Next....
What exactly has he done that he should be impeached? Nothing...
admiration for a dictator,  trying to ban Muslims,
, come on, are you serious for impeachment?
Yes! They have form a coup and are using EOs as a pathway
@morgfair @CoryBooker maybe #FreeMelania is wrong.  Maybe it really should be #FreeTrump.  From Putin.  Just throwing it out.
He understands it but he can't say "This fucking traitorous man baby is neck deep in Putin's ass" on live TV.
its WEAK. They are all weak. WE are out there protesting. They dont seem 2 knw the Laws to protect us
If you get a chance, check out Noam Chomsky on @netflix . It's a reality check. We are peasants.
WE need to recognize that with out US there can be no system. Power lies in how we spend
I don't understand why your President IS HIMSELF someone who's causing so much global chaos & terror
Global chaos? Where? Terror? Against whom?
Where? Every international airport and of course Parliament. 2/3
seems the protesters caused more chaos than the order did.
You just do the care about the US. TRUMP and Tillerson are in this for oil money! Wake up! Do homework!
because he's a Manchurian Candidate who has traded his country for what he perceives as unlimited fame and power?
Bingo!
Cory is grandstanding these days. He thinks he will run for the presidency in 2020. But we all know he's a FRAUD!
Come on, we all know why he's cozying up - prevent info coming about 'sex' + his 'loans' being called by Russian mob @TheLeadCNN @CoryBooker
be real . You make it sound like the world is ending.
@CNN @CoryBooker We all know why, it's just up to you guys to find proof.
For a cut of the Exxon oil in Russia!
@FredPecora @CoryBooker is that trump on the right with a Russian connect?
@GloriaBorger @CoryBooker Can you please do your best to find out why?  You are the only peeps I trust these days!
hey booker,when obama told the Russian diplomat to tell Putin to wait until reelection,that's cozying up
It's really so simple. Putin praised him.
yu should have more Dem WOMEN on.
Please tell us you do understand. Not the time for disingenuousness.
@GloriaBorger @CoryBooker Trumps got media in his palm-all the talk is Putin while Trump moves past them
you know we're really tired of you running your mouth why don't you just go find your safe space and stay there
Are you SURE you don't understand?
3 weeks on the job & you pretend you in the press know all. I know, lets have a rehash of the early nuclear 80's
Donald Trump acts like a third grader. Bullies team up with other bullies to try to get more power.
I would highly recommend watching the original Manchurin Candidate!!!!
Trump's verbiage on Putin shows he shouldn't be in the WH, and he's a danger to WE THE PEOPLE, something is wrong
- I concur!
.@TheLeadCNN @CNN @CoryBooker He can't possibly be talking about the guy whos picking up the slack caused by the Dems continued insane rants
Cosying up? Rubbish. He's never even met Putin. Possible he's going to try and manipulate him to our advantage.
CNN is fake news meaning You people suck at reporting the real news! What American's really need to know.....
because he is inspired, and hopes to achieve the same level of pure insanity.
The face of @CoryBooker  does not show any signs of intellect. Is it common for US senators?
You know that birds of a feather flock together!
did you said that when #Obama & #Hillary did the famous reset error spoken #Staples button?
big difference between establishing rapport and cozying up. Maybe you like the idea of US fighters engaging Russia
he wants to work with Russia, better than being their enemy! We need change! You guys want to fight like 5 yr olds!
he doesn't want to start off on the bad foot! He isn't going to bash Putin no matter what you liberals think!!!!!!
Cuz Cory would rather send an Iranian regime Millions of $ and gold to build their weapons against us #MORONS
@ft14051 @CoryBooker maybe water seeks its own level. Landlords operate on a different frequency, it's all about them.
Give me a break.  Ukraine always has been Russia
put pressure on @jasoninthehouse his constituents sure did
BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE AN OPTION TO EMIGRATE TO OTHER PLANET CAUSING REASONS THAT LEAD TO DESTRUCTION OF THIS PLANET
two words of explanation : #money and #power
@luvmom8702 I understand. It's not rocket science. The reason-blackmail. The Russians got the goods on this lowlife.
@summerbrennan @CoryBooker 

@jasoninthehouse please #DoYourJob and #investigatetrump
Thank you Utah. Jason Chaffetz got the message loud & clear: DO YOUR JOB! Investigate Trump! NOW!  @jasoninthehouse  
It's possible we will be in a shooting war with Russia before the year is out. The left seem determined to make sure
None of us knw wht this cozying up 2 #Russia is abt! My eductd guess wld be Money! MONEY! MO MONEY!#Corrupt 4 sure!
I believe DT thrives on chaos and doesn't care how he gets attention just as long as he gets it!
Follow the money U will find that Trump is deep in debt 2 a lot of Russian players & Putin has him by the short ones
@realDonaldTrump the president LOVES chaos and terror! He causes his it and thrives on it.
@Analisa_Swan @CoryBooker because our presidents goal is to cause terror and chaos so as to take away our freedom
Same reason Booker is cozying up to drug companies. When they give you money, they own you.
like begets like, the US have been selling arms to russia for yrs why stop now huh 
Because he's a lunatic.
b careful! #45scaredofbrownpeople
@CNN @CoryBooker keep your enemies close just a ideal
keep up the good work #kickThatSkunk
@DearAuntCrabby @CoryBooker Because that is exactly what Ttump does: cause global chaos & terror! T & P  are soulmates!
These are the type of people #Trump identifies with!!!
that's because the Republican Party is afraid of him one tweet is all it takes a lot of pay for play going on
@maidenwarrior @CoryBooker whose that, Murdoch?
It's plain as the orange makeup on his face:  One would-be despot supporting another.  Watch the actions, not the distractions.
cuz Putin has plenty on Trump, Trump has done biz with Russia for years
word on the street is trump's biz is bankrupt and Russia loaned him money, he is in their debt
we know why
@DearAuntCrabby @CoryBooker get his tax returns! We want you to
Thank you for covering THE MOST important issue of this so called Presidency.
@CNN @CoryBooker so we should just ignore Putin? Or go to war with him?
Just ask Bannon & Sessons.
@pilotcine @CoryBooker because it's very obvious he knows Russia helped him win just waiting for it to come out eventually.
#liberalmedia constantly talking about #Trump cozying up to Putin. He has only chosen not to pick a fight with him.
Because they are too like-minded
@CNN @CoryBooker nt cnn
@CNN @CoryBooker Sad Cory doesn't catch on to whats really happening M.E
any  reading this WE the People of  don't have ANY problems with you. Your government sucks right now like ours.
@eileen_gunn @CoryBooker Because they seem well matched?
<g> The opposite, I think. Putin could take Trump in a bite....
#investigate
@CNN @CoryBooker #manufacturingconsent #manufacture #consent #badpr
in addition to the chaos and terror he is causing in his own rite!
@BarackObama gave nuclear capabilities 2 Iran yet these democrat terrorists lie about Russia ! @realDonaldTrump
first of all he lied about knowing putin, then he says he's a stronger leader than President Obama.
Be REAL, Obama has caused global terror and chaos, he let Russia take Crimea.
@CNN @CoryBooker did you question hussiens cozying up to iran?
We need to get to the rock bottom of WHY!!
go Jake keep it up thanks #TheResistance
The USA needs an enemy....a bogeyman....how else do you expect the  Military Industrial Complex to make money?
= #FakeNews
Oh sure you understand, we all do. Obama or Clinton would NEVER have gotten away with any of this.
what's there to not understand? Daddy Putin bought him this election for a reason.
Cause Mr. Putin has a secret on trump that will mostly likely destroy him. So for NOW trump jockin puttin.
and poisoning his critics
chaos & terror. You don't say…
#NazismIsBackInEurope – sponsored by John #McCain and the US War Cabal. Next will probably be burning everyone who was born in the USSR https://twitter.com/marcelsardo/status/829846128195731458 …
@POTUS  owes them$$$
@Brialalexi @CoryBooker We have to cozy up to Russia since liberals/dem party copied up to Islamic terrorists
@Earnest_One @CoryBooker you guys fighting potus is causing chaos work with potus let him go to work! Congress fails
the Heathen will rage and not know why...The truth will not be found in them for they are a corrupted people b4 YHWH
haha,the whole world is laughing.Ask the people in South America/MiddleEast who is causing more terror/global chaos.
Yankees, are you sick? Yes. You are.
Sorry, Mr. Booker, but NO ONE has caused more chaos and terror in the post-Soviet era than the US of A. #hypocrisy.
hahaha you mean like former U.S. leaders have to leaders in/representing Iran, and the Saudis.
BECAUSE HE IS AN AH
MrBooker one wonders why you support illegals coming in our countrywith out proper vetting and the false news by cnn
@frosty8556 @CoryBooker I understand.. trump is not loyal to the USA. He is loyal to putin and $$.
sharon is sick
so much we don't understand about this President.
Follow the money... look into the financials of trumps businesses..ill bet you'll find what you're looking for.
we don"t understand How he"s NOT doing what he was voted in to do??????
#booker2020
When will we see litigation on Trump/Russia collusion? This is going too far too fast. They need to be stopped now!
@TheLeadCNN @CoryBooker
Mr. Booker & Congress know y. trump bought & paid 4.  Taxpayer paid 4 bs GOP "investigation" lies Crooks  at fans
& That is what worries us Trumpers! Your Blind-Enemies keep closer- Geez! Flawed Logic!
Because he, too, is causing chaos and terror.
because I am your dear leader.
Cozying?  NOT-He's not pissing off the man- how come we can see this yet your BLIND! Crazy
you at CNN are the FAKE NEWS headquarters so tell" Chris Cuomo"to get a wig so he can pass as  BLACK cuckser !!
Looking for a mentor?
Question asked and answered in the same sentence. #chaos
Why don't u standup 4what is right 4&by majority that voted 4u
Not by ur minority riotous lawbreakers that didn't
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.
Which is why we need to focus on Trump/Russia connection then impeach the traitor.
Perhaps because he's also causing chaos and terror?? #commonenemy
@PJ_Kaiser @CoryBooker Because he, himself, is global chaos and terror.
absolutely true!!
what  else is there to NOT understand? Make a move. Get the TAX RETURNS, get the PROOF of RUSSIA"S INVOLVEMENT
FAKE NEWS!!!
yea we all knew this before he got elected. No one seems to care. #ipromise2vote when mid terms come in #NewJersey
Ally against "Huuuuge Gyna"
@CNN @CoryBooker The Democrats are a greater threat to America than Russia. Just step back and watch.  Pathetic clowns
@nytimes @washingtonpost ...It's in our country's best interest to IMPEACH 45 before we find out!!
Another Democratic Hippocrit Tricking RIght WIng COld War Curmudgeons and Media To DIstractFrom ClintonEMAIL$$$
We don't understand it, or you-- go back to your husband in Jersey. stop campaigning 2b our president
UCensoredDemocraticTreasons-StateDept ClintonTookForiegnDOnationsChangingPolicyEndangeringUS- #EmailDistraction
Cory,  usually you and I are on the same page, but why did you sell out to big Pharma?  So sad.
there's no reason except undermined the United States Trump wants power and he sees him in that power position scary
Because: Bannon.
@CNN @CoryBooker @jaketapper once again TAX RETURNS PLEASE
@CNN @CoryBooker well the pharmaceutical industry terrorizes as well and you seem pretty cozy with them
For @realDonaldTrump to be kissing up to Putin, he must have some really good stuff on him. Find out what.
- Because 45 is an amateur and has no idea what he is doing.
@CNN @CoryBooker thank you #CNN and Senator Booker for keeping this issue raised
Keep  your enemies close.
This is CNN trying to get the narrative going Trump cozy to Russia b/c he calls Puttin a leader (which he is) Lame
@CNN @CoryBooker Booker is trying so hard to be relevant. Did nothing in Newark..meet his imaginary friend TBone..hes Obama lite
@CNN @CoryBooker    Please! You know why?. 
We don't want to go to war!!!!!!
@CNN @CoryBooker   Oh! You don't understand?  Because we don't want to go to another stupid war!
was this filmed 1 year ago? why just airing now?
.@TheLeadCNN @CNN @CoryBooker 

Hang tight I'll send you a copy of "Foreign Policy For Dummies" to help you out!
@CNN @CoryBooker I didn't hear you crying when Obama gave 150b and ransom money to Iran. #justsaying
I bet Putin is coaching Trump.T has close ties to Putin for yrs. Frequent calls to Putin & celebration when T won.
@CNN @CoryBooker no one cares what Cory Booker thinks He & Democrats are irrelevant & can protest & march which they are good at
why don't Yall try cozying up to America citizens.
@CNN @CoryBooker Russian Nordstrom still carries his daughters clothing line
Mr. Booker, you have seen the classified documents. You do understand 45's motives.
You come across as too rehearsed/political.  I respect you, but we need leaders who aren't afraid to get real.
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker I think President Obama gave $1.3 Billion to Iran. Let's talk about that first shall we!!!
..i think he talk about the legesl. Obama.
need to see his tax returns and see how far and deep this goes before things are done that can't be reversed!
Birds of a feather? This #POTUS seems to revel in #fear #insecurity #blame. See: #Sessions false #crime stats today.
Senator it's time to address all of 45's buisness  ties to Russian Oligarchs/mobsters ! He's beholden to them! We
Investigate and then #ImpeachTrump
I do not see why any rational person would cozy up to the likes of Booker.
Booker ISNT crapping on our Constitution&U Drumpf Weeds know Its the one that men&woman fought&died4.
this is where the story is, we need to find out why?
"Don't understand" is a dangerous euphemism at this point. Let's start speaking the plain truth.
Why he gives aid & comfort to an enemy? GOP fighting to avoid losing the White House.
@summerbrennan @CoryBooker Yes. Strange. Why is Congress looking the other way?  Unacceptable!
thank you Senator Booker for continually speaking out about this
Don’t take your eye off the ball @TheLeadCNN  — the bigger story is that Putin and Bannon colluded to win the election.
.@CoryBooker on Russia: I do not understand why our President seems to be cozying up to someone who is causing so much global chaos & terror
