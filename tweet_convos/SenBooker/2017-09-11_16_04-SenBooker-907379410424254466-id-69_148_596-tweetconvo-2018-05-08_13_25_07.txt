Where does the $13.8 trillion come from?
You mean estimate, right? An estimate that comes in lower than any other plan proposed.
LOL, sure, what's a few trillion when it's other people's money.
Are you insanely wealthy or just believe you can get there some day when it all trickles down?
Government has never solved anything. Go ask a Veteran how they like the VA.  Not wealthy just work for what I have.
Ask a senior how they like their HC. The VA is working within a very fragmented system. We can fix that with Medicare For All.
Medicare is not Medicaid.  OMG
Who said anything about Medicaid?
I am not against this, but real Q...what happens to the people that work in the insurance world, do a majority lose their jobs?
Let's say that's worst case scenario: 

# of ppl working in HC insurance industry: 2.5m

# of ppl currently uninsured: 27 million
But those 2.5m would also have insurance guaranteed. They'd be able to find work in the public sector, transition to other companies.
Also, private insurance would still be available for those who want it.
Sorry I can't support this. Start with Medicaid for all who need it. The financials of Sanders plan and transition dangerous -inadequate
The financials and transition plan for Iraq and Afghanistan were dangerous and inadequate...but virtually every congressperson did it anyway
I have changed my mind on this issue.
IF the party supports it, I'm in.
Uhhh why?
Because the more people on it the more we the people get taxed so insurance companies can charge more knowing politicians will tax us more.
2016 Medicare budget was 970B, covering 1/6 of U.S.; Total budget expenditures were only 3.999 Trillion #MedicareForAll cost is astronomical
I remember when insurance covered annual checkups. For the past few years, labcorp alone has been several hundred out of pocket.
the people are the country the people have paid in and the people want that right of health
Actions have consequences. Don't be surprised when all of the US turns into Detroit. What good is healthcare when you can't afford food?
Because you're worried that you'd lose your seat if you didn't?
Booker 2020
Furthermore your leglisation on marijuana doesn't redeem you for voting against cheaper medicine, something the US severely needs.
Senator, you need to address the issue of College Park MD allowing illegals to vote because they live here yet homeless American Vets can't
With you on this. 100%.
Good job
All health care should be patient centered and evidence based. And should be available to everyone.
I also support health care for all, but Medicaid > Medicare, esp for preventive care. Medicare promotes unethical chiro practice
Medicare has horrible limitations, esp for chiros like me. It says we can only treat subluxation, a nonexistent diagnosis. Pls reconsider.
Because you believe in providing equal care for all. Only way to give everyone chance to reach their potentials, live life to fullest.
Cuz Bernie is way more popular than me and I have to. Bandwagoner
Cory Booker you do ? I'm sorry was it you who voted against US Citizens getting there medicine from Canada for much lower rates ? !
Best option.
The Democrats had their chance and pick the Heritage Foundation based Republican plan so get over it and learn how to win elections
I have always been for a public option, how do we pay for this? 20+ trillion in debt, we need to be responsible for our kids/grandchildren
Announce right now that u are not gonna take money from big pharma and insurance companies ever again. do that & I will support you in 2020
If I can come up with a better plan, can I e-mail it to you? I really don't think this is the correct solution to health care
RT Because U don't care that we are $20 TRILLION in Debt #DeadbeatSenator  Control Their Healthcare Control Their Votes #communistcrimes
Hahahahahahaha
Hey Senator, are you on Obamacare??  Yeah I didn't think so.  You're a joke
Look at one of the biggest sellouts in the Senate trying to act like he cares about people.  Keep taking that drug cash while people die
Why don't you explain why you look the other way on the opioid crisis?  Oh that's right, the ones who make it give you a ton of cash.
And yet you voted against Bernie Sander's bill of making medicine cheaper
You can't support Medicare for All if you are for illegal immigration.  Who is going to pay? The 1%? They'll just reside in Panama. #notax
Isn't it weird that once this idea became popular, you decided to support it?
Higher Education should be an American right, not a mark of economic status out of reach to many just because they don’t make enough money.
Home ownership should be an American right, not a mark of economic status out of reach to many just because they don’t make enough money.
Lobster should also be an American right, not a mark of economic status out of reach to many just because they don’t make enough money.
Bcuz it gives gov't control? When you say Medicare for all you mean congress too?  Right? NO exemption for congress!
Corey, where and when can we look at the bill when it is introduced? I'm a supporter-will it be online?
it's a good bumpersticker in these post-truth days, but Medicare buy-in makes more sense
I look forward to a robust convo/debate. At least we're moving in the right direction and all hands remain on deck to protect #ACA.
Cuz ur a fraud
Looks like we have another Dem senator who can't do math...

Let's throw another 18 trillion on top of 20 trillion!
You never see @ Potus sitting on some steps.  He has energy!
Why all the pics of yourself @SenBookerOffice I know you're good looking but what to do with story?
How about removing the tax penalty for individuals who pay for their premiums 100% themselves?
Because you don't realize how big the country is? Or How many illegals there are? Or How much corruption is in the State and Fed Gov?
Need2 look@overcharging!My MIL passed away@hospital &they had charges 2Medicare 4procedures that were never done & dated AFTER her death.

We need I have it as a renal patient
2020?? Please 
Only after the tremendous wave of support and how cool it will make me look like a progressive will I finally support single payer for all.
We need you more than ever @SenBookerOffice to speak to the core issues of working people across America. Love @repjohnlewis!
Love @RepJohnConyers (16yrs of hard work) #HR676 Bill, it's the only cost containment plan, covers #veterans & is accepted in all 50 States.
Hang on I thought Obamacare was the solution? Are you now admitting it's failure? Nah...nevermind...
No but it was our real goal dummy
Yessss thank you for your support!!
