This is the person to watch, after hearing his words, his honest sincerity, intelligence & drive to run our Country. Way to go Sen. Booker!!
Equal protection under the law already exists.. another grandstanding leftist Divisive Politician...
Does it?  No, it doesn't.  If it does, then why is conversion therapy still around?  Why can people be fired for being gay/bi/trans?
Where ? I'm in Ca. I don't see it, Nor do I care about anybody's orientation.
America is a big place.  What might not happen in one state may happen in another and vice versa.
Besides as a parent I reseothe Government restricting my ability to investigate any possible treatment or conclusion for my child .
Being gay does not require treatment!  That's the point.  It's not a problem to be fix.  You don't have the right to try to change your kid!
I know, what if my kid requested further investigation knowledge of his orientation ? My kid should have that choice. I would love anyway.
Then you should explain to your child that they don't need to change themselves for anyone or anything and shouldn't try.  It's dangerous.
Well said! I believe It takes inner work on all of our parts to make a difference in equality
Finally doing your job. Still won't forgive you for cheating us out of inexpensive medications.
If you really believe that, listen for the truth: https://getcrookedmedia.com/pod-save-the-people-56bc42af53d â€¦
I watched the truth unfold with your vote. Meds are safe in other countries, people have not died from them, etc.
Your holy books were written by goat herders before the age of reason.  Enter the age of reason, please, and throw away your faith.
Nah, he probably would rather believe in a higher power. I don't blame him
I blame him for perpetuating that ignorance.  Higher power indeed.
I got this rash on my back that's been there for a couple days. Should I go to the doctor or do you think I'm fine?
You are just fantastic and a very, very important part of our Congress and country.
Thank you Kathy
Thank you Senator for all the good you do for us, the American people.
Sen. Booker, keep up the fight.  Let's make America. America again!  Continue to love what you stand for.
Thank you, Senator.
you are like president Obama
@MarriageEqualty @CoryBooker senator I hope you run for president!
I completely agree
Is there anything in there about "positive action, " that would seem counter productive to equality. Serious question
Beautifully said
Isn t that rich with all men standing there and no women....justice for everyone except women, minors and minorities...frigging dink suits
No one is free unless all of us are free. Thank you for standing up! #BlackLivesMatter #NoWall #lgbtq #PlannedParenthood @WipeHomophobia

...Our next PRESIDENT....PLEEEASE
Look at the guys behind you get all fidgety and nervous. 
The big question is does equality for everyone include those of us who are single with no kids?  We take care of our bills on one income.
Get it buddy! Powerful words.
We can serve life better together #ServeLife
@NancyPelosi @chuckschumer 
Please support efforts for an open welcome to pro-lifers & a hearty collaboration in service to life #ServeLife 
Cory Booker can I just say THANK YOU for fighting for my sons rights as a gay man! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!!
Just words
They're are many men in prison cause justice was denied by prosecutors withholding exculpatory evidence, DNA, cops lying so DA can make case
DA's not seeking justice they're seeking convictions.
Show me what your religious beliefs look like fellow-Amercans.
So what rights do lgbtq people not have? Just curious
Thank you for continuing to have the backs of the #LGBTQ community.
It's really true
So proud to be a Jersey girl in moments like this! 
Our hero-Sen. Cory Booker!!
Justice does't exist until it can be claimed by colored Muslim gay women.
Thank you!
Then let's look at how Christians are treated right now in this country regarding LGBTQ...
 and this is valid for several countries (unfortunately)
@POTUS see this?  2020 is coming. If you're still around.
Booker 2020? I would be honored to campaign for you, Senator! Still remember your inspiring speech at airport #MuslimBan #noBanNoWallNoRaids
Thank you for being the voice of what we should and must, someday, be!
Brilliantly said @SenBookerOffice  and @CoryBooker

PREACH Senator Booker. Plz think about running for POTUS

Glad we propose this at a time you know it has no chance of passing. Grab those headlines
It would be so nice if you hired a staff person to do this work full time exclusively. Not just beautiful words, but hard work. I thank you
@SMSIndivisible @CoryBooker Good Lord, this guy should become our president!!
