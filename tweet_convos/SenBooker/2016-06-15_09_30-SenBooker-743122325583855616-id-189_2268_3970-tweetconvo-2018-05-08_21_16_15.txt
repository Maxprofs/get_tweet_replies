Common sense will show you that these terrorist NEVER attack Gun stores/shows, NRA Rallies, or Biker Bars, I wonder why!!
@Richardafowler @CoryBooker how about Chicago, New York...put gun criminals in jail? Jails in America are hotels filled with bums
Common sense is to control inanimate objects instead of the actual immigrants from known hostile countries and cultures.
The media is almost praising the Orlando Shooter Mateen http://bit.ly/1txeHOD 
and people who are not "willing" to give up a tiny piece of that "freedom" to reform "security" also deserve...neither.
so what about the liberties of the innocent people that were slain by guns in schools and nightclubs? No choice for them now.
accidental falls, unintentional poisoning, medical error are all accident based deaths. Guns are not used by accident and even..
when they are, they still cause death. The point is, guns are made for a very clear purpose..to kill or seriously injure.
i choose not to defend myself with guns because my country doesn't  allow it. Do i feel safe? Yes. Do i sleep better? Yes.
@thewritelady @CoryBooker I am not Your Fan, I am an American Citizen and I thank You for Speaking Out! This is unacceptable from GOP
Stop these unelected Tyrants from grabbing more power. Obama has given the country over to Jihadist!
what the bill you're pushing have stopped Orlando shooting  answer .NO
Last time I looked there are more mass murders in the Middle East where civilians have no guns. That is on planet earth
Not many mass killings in Canada or UK @JoeMoor33349838 @MSNBC @CoryBooker
As much as one can note that but there are some. What is the number as related to population by Muslims or non
....where there is a greater % of Muslims than USA...Columbine, sandy hook not Muslim and the list Co tines @JoeMoor33349838  @CoryBooker
Have a great evening - Two final note 63% of gun deaths are suicides. 415 people died in mass shootings in 2015.
What was the gun homicide rate last year in the States compared to Canada? @JoeMoor33349838 @CoryBooker
With or without suicides. Because if you count other weapons in total the death rates is close
firearm suicide rate is 7.2 compared to 3.1 in Canada
let's start cleaning up the Wild West show that we call Newark first
NRA blocked legislation to stop sales to ppl on Terrorist watch list http://www.salon.com/2015/11/18/nra_fail_more_than_2000_people_on_terror_watch_list_have_legally_purchased_guns_in_the_last_10_years/ … Not their fault?
and they also forget the 2nd amdnt state WELL REGULATED
we are with you. We elected you to be our voice. Today, the country will hear that voice. #HoldTheFloor #Enough
you voted for that moron? Wow, that's embarrassing. Failed politician. Failed policies.
@SDzzz @CoryBooker  OH YES YES, Thank you @SenateDems !  Keep it going! #Enough
Orlando Shooter being Praised? http://bit.ly/1txeHOD 
The right to keep and bear arms is our rights!
I'd like to point to Canada, sensible gun laws....few mass killings. @alanahoff144 @MSNBC @CoryBooker
@Richardafowler @CoryBooker cory booker is an example of a runned over city electing candidates based on party affiliation
@Richardafowler @CoryBooker Democrats lack accountability, many laws have been in place and they don't affect crime.
Common sense would be to supply every American citizen an open carry side arm.
@Richardafowler @CoryBooker  It's not about guns.  It's about Islam. You're Welcome #Giftagun
@meetthepress Let me translate for the gun grabbers: NOTIFICATION = good. CONFISCATION = bad aka unconstitutional
Go after the terrorists but don't even think about treading on me! More people are killed by bicycles than AR-15s.
The Dems always blame someone. They had the majority and didn't do anything. This is just grand standing at our expense.
yes, firm gun control, just like chicago.
@caitrionambalfe @CoryBooker My Senator working diligently! #NewJersey  #gunviolence #USA
bullshit!!!!!!
thank you. Proud to have you as our NJ senator.
to voters time for a change we have to make a Change to many mass shootings put the people feet to the fire for a law about gun's
he a muslim
~ Preach! Awesome guy (and I'm a Rep.)!
thanks Senator Booker for braving #CommonSenseGunLaws. - #ENOUGH #ENOUGH #ENOUGH #HowManyMore? #holdthefloor
@IMBrettDalton @CoryBooker dear god .. Now your retweeting this  garbage Brett .. From Paris .Paris with their gun laws ..
many other civilized nations have loose gun laws. People are not killing others as they do in the USA?  Why?
@MSNBC @CoryBooker
any questions? I have some.
@LeaKThompson @CoryBooker BOUT TIME!!!!!
New Jersey is so proud of you.  Thank you so much for trying to keep us safe, we need Gun Reform kept fighting for us.
Booker was an incompetent mayor of a slum. Banning blacks and Muslims from gun ownership will bring down the crime rate.
@IMBrettDalton @CoryBooker What people are sick and tired of is NO action being taken to address the problem of gun violence AT ALL.
@IMBrettDalton @CoryBooker Further, to the 2nd Amendment Nuts; No one wants your guns.  No one is going to come seize them.
@IMBrettDalton @CoryBooker Unfortunately, common sense and the GOP have long parted ways....
You numbskulls think this will help? Insane.
Thank you, senator. I am a new resident and new New Jersey voter and proud to have you represent me.n
@sandyhook @CoryBooker This  is a free download of the song "I Want To Live" http://cdbaby.com/cd/berrie3  #non-violence
agree
I love you @CoryBooker
@karenhunter @CoryBooker and after 20 years serving in the Congress & Senate bye bye to many of them on gov dime doing nothing
@MarcVegan @CoryBooker #EnoughGunViolence #filibuster
Which is why democrats shouldn't look inward.
how about not tying the FBI hands with political correctness. The shooter not arrested because PC moved the goal posts
@caitrionambalfe @CoryBooker I love Cory Booker. It just makes sense.
thank you! Thank u for taking a stand and restoring faith in our officials.  Please run for president  #corybookerforpres
@MSNBC @CoryBooker
Idea, How about Enforcing the Laws you have now. The FBI SCREWED UP on the Shooter. Knew about him 3 Wks ago. did SQUAT.
@caitrionambalfe @CoryBooker So proud of my senator!
@caitrionambalfe @CoryBooker Cory Booker, one of those leaders like a voice in  wilderness of political egos & self aggrandizement.
disgusting
@ShaunKing @CoryBooker
I really don't get why it's so hard to comprehend after all the massacres the US has encountered! NO GUNS NO SHOOTING!
@caitrionambalfe @CoryBooker I'm an artist and listened to the entire filibuster while painting. Fascinating. Kudos!
Thank you so much for taking a stand on this serious, frustrating matter.
@sanderswinsbig @CoryBooker But Booker's endorsing the queen of International weapons sales. #NeverHillary
would be the perfect VP to @HillaryClinton he has the traits people are looking for in leaders. #ImWithHer #NeverTrump
So, the rate of terrorists killing others with guns in other countries is less than here?  Get your head out of your ###!
thank you for this Senator. Thank you for standing up for what is right. #Enough
Unfortunately, what they're NOT looking for is an actual.soltion to the problem. #filibuster
Note that their proposal wouldn't have prevented the Orlando shooting, as shooter wasn't on the list.
To my knowledge, there hasn't been a single mass shooting by anyone on any watch list.
Of course, we don't know who is on the list.   And that's part of the fucking problem.
The director of rhe FBI said this legislation would blow their investigations. But, gotta put on a show.
Kill this with an amendment to also deny the vote to people on the list.
Dems would be beating each other to be the first to vote no on that.
@aguywithnolife @CoryBooker
i suddenly like my state
@aguywithnolife @CoryBooker as soon as you say common sense people opposing this immediately think of banning guns. #ROFLMAO
Let's require Gun Insurance for each and every gun in your possession not just those you bought. No need 4 Assult weapons
@aguywithnolife @CoryBooker that's my senator. Great job Cory.
Filbuster for Sandy Hook. After Sandy Hook 80+% for Universal Background checks. We get a bill?NO BILL! 20 children dead
@sanderswinsbig @CoryBooker talk to your idiots liberal freaks of every kind! Stealing trumps"common sense"approach huh! #Come&TakeIt
@BlueTeam007 @CoryBooker I hope @HillaryClinton is seeing this! He'd be an awesome VP!
agree!
...obamas muslims killing obamas gays,  go figure...
yes, yes, yes.
What did T-Bone have to say?
Go get 'em, Cory!!  
@ammboston @CoryBooker the sad irony is all this attention will send gun sales threw the roof
Read the names of the 400K people killed by guns since 911
#Leadership
it is NOT controlling the weapon, it is controlling the IDEOLOGY!!!
OMG it was TERRORISM! take away the guns & it will be airliners, trains, buildings, explosives, knives to be blamed next!
@texyellowdogdem @CoryBooker Go Cory Go!!
Thank you @CoryBooker - some more interesting stats. How American is the NRA really? http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/charts-foreign-gun-companies-laws-nra …
Because abandoning the presumption of innocence & constitutional due process is 'good sense' or something.
STFU abt "common sense". That is USELESS & POINTLESS. Spell out which LAWS, exactly, you want! Otherwise, EMPTY RHETORIC
@ShaunKing @CoryBooker decent speech for an in the tank for corporate money neoliberal political hack.
thank you! You're an American Hero.
READ the names of victims in every State! Make local news highlight
retarted ass republicans still think we're tryna take there guns lol Thats all they hear  stricter gun laws please!
thank you, Sen. Booker, for your words of sanity about an insane topic.
YEEEEEEEEEEES.
Cory - you rock.  Ask Americans to join you - we will.  It'll take a nation to bring down gun violence.
@ShaunKing @CoryBooker hope u someday get that guns out of the streets.
#ENOUGH

#ENOUGH

#ENOUGH
now he is making a speech? I used to never hear about this loser until the election
@ShaunKing @CoryBooker They all have Blood on their Hands
Thank you for saying this!  #filibuster #Enough #EnoughGunViolence
this man will be President one day.  Can't wait!
~ I totally agree! He is one amazing man!
thank you Senator Booker! Proud to be a NJ voter
#corybookerforVP
how awesome that this eloquent man represents NJ.
thank u for hopefully getting the Senate to make some movement on gun control! #NeverAgain
THANK YOU!!!!!!
To think that disarming the public is the solution to Terrorists with guns is ridiculous.
We thank you so much for speaking so passionately on what is only right
Thank you for your dedication, energy & hard work,  America will not forget your love and passion for your country
Common sense was the FBI stopping him when they investigated him the first time Legal system negligence is to blame
Why r terrorists not on no fly list? ##RedNationRising
Thank you, Senator Booker!
THANK YOU.
I'd be willing to listen about gun control but I don't trust the democrats they just want to disarm the people
Yes! Go go go! Please please please, keep going on this and don't stop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder if booker wearing poop sack. He always looks uncomfortable.
yes yes yes yes!! #EnoughGunViolence #EnoughIsEnough #enough #Orlando
OK BUT WHO IS FILIBUSTERING FOR LGBTQ RIGHTS?!
no they don't say enough. you need to look at chicago and ask with all the "gun control" why so many die daily.
Auditioning hard for veep.
Senator, my boss lady and I watched this and loved it.  You and we have common sense.  Keep at it.
http://www.sfexaminer.com/prosecutions-serious-criminals-decline-fewer-arrests-made-police/ … If story has any merit,civilians may have need 4 self protection if cops hands r going to b tied.
if you want to get this moving look up how the Australian government did this back in 1996 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Australia …
Thank you #SenateDemocrats! #Enough is enough!
#filibuster for better #GunControl @GOP @SenateGOP @SenateDems
Call your Senator tell them to vote YES Close the loophole no fly no gun! It matters!  text ...DISARM HATE to 644-33
TYSen Booker
we stand with you!
Enough of you talking about gun control.
Hell make all guns illegal. It has worked out so well trying to control illegal drugs.
Hasn't this discussion happened before? Time for talk is done. It's time to make a change.
How well is gun control working out in Chicago, Detriot, Baltimore and New Orleans???
http://concealedcarrykillers.org/  Current CCW=No background check 2 buy more guns n 25 States #NotGunSense
was Orlando killer on terrorist watch list? Dems need new talking points.
I agree ppl on terrorist watch list shouldn't be able to buy guns. Do us all a favor take tea party members off list
outlaw assault weapons now. Please
I agree! Gun control is so sure to work I propose we take it a step further and just Ban All Murders. That'll show them!!
Lies on top of lies so sad, now we see why your press credentials have been taken away
the end goal for true left wing politicians is to strip every gun from every citizen. Diane Feinstein admitted it!
Cory, I am a female independent who purchased a 9mm for protection. I took safety classes & joined NRA. Elimin Gun Free Z
the shooter may have been born here but his parents came from Afghanistan and he was probably N anchor baby #radicalislam
#Enough
Thank you for taking a stand and giving a voice to the frustrated masses who've had #enough!
Just don't do anything that channels potential attackers towards more lethal weapons.
So proud that you are my senator. #Orlando #guncontrol
The republicans are just fucked up, and more people will die because of them.
The Truth,, Democrats are putting the blame on arms and not in MUSLIMS.  The truth is that a muslim kill the americans.
...no you are not. You hate/fear guns and the people who own them. Stop lying...
@Mrtamhas @CoryBooker 
He already lost.
"Common sense" is anathema to Republicans.
Love this man!
if only this phony vermin booker was as passionate about closing borders &keep illegals out.
There's a net zero influx of people crossing from Mexico.
think again!!. They ve caught people from Muslim countries sneaking from mexico into usa.
480k have overstayed visas
Yes, They just look like idiots. They (Gov't) issued the Orlando Shooter his special gun permits. Do they know that?
YES, Republican Govt. the Dems want stricter regs! D'Oh!
Einstein, The Democrat Gov't of the DHS issued the gun permit to the shooter. Not State!
you may want to take another look at your sources. who does the background checks?
France has a gun control and terrorist killed more than 100 ppl. We need to defeat radical islam before any gun control!
US government, ban all assault weapons, then if multiple murders happen they might address the true issues.
typical politician - all talk no action #Trump will git her done!
We reserve the right to keep and bear arms period!
I hope your child is never a victim of a mass shooting. If you are a legal gun owner you should want tighter laws also
audition for VP, we get it Cory
I am tired of these despicable, deplorable leftist scumbags.
What happens when a state makes federal laws unenforceable I wonder?
He knows he talking to Republican voters right? The same people who nominated Donald Trump to run for president?
He sounds like the Pres. 'Don't look here'. Changing the subject....again.
Thank you to Sens.Murphy and Blumenthal as well.
