Sen. Booker, you must stand up for your constituents like other Dem Senators. This situation with Trump has gotten out of control. Nullify.
Don't blame Trump for this! He didn't tell them to riot in the streets! The Dems and the media is @ fault for this one!
So the Dems told someone to run people over and kill someone.? You are seriously disturbed as are the rest of the Trumpetes & Berniebots.
CAB please share events like #BlackLivesMatter #BLM #MuslimLivesMatter  happening around #Newark #montclair #NJ
When you remove the statues in Washington you are limiting a parent*s right to school his children. Condemn all hate and bigotry senator.
Also being vocal against hate speech and violent acts  and make people accountable for their actions
Dated 1/16/17
I don’t think you actually believe that
yes
so true. There is no place for violence.
Humm...let's see, you mean like the "love" ANTIFA and BLM show Trump supporters.
If kids had fathers they could go to Lee Park where the father could explain who Lee was and that although he was brave his cause was unjust
Amen ! No more hate! We are all human beings!Same creator!racism n racist laws such as prohibition must end..it's ripping our country apart
"God Bless America, Land of #Freedom and #Opportunity"

It's time to meet fire with fire and put an end to the vile oppressive agenda of Sessions, Trump et al. which breeds & feeds such hatred!

Internet is flooded w/ contrived heinous lies to discredit political leaders & reputable organizations! Russia et al. are masters at it!
@realDonaldTrump complained Obama won't say Islamic terrorism yet he won't say white supremacists. @donlemon @gop @TheDemocrats  #hypocrite

That means get rid of Antifa and BLM as well...both terrorist organizations.
Senator, what does @realDonaldTrump have to do before you will publicly call for his resignation?
then impeach trump he is bigotry and hatred he caused this grow some balls and do your job this man must be stopped
One of my favorite Dr. King quotes. @SenBookerOffice lead the way to peace, understanding, and LOVE! This country needs a hero!
You have a very uniting voice that can provide comfort to a hurting nation. Please do more to extend the reach of that voice and speak w/&
Yes: Love defeats hate.  Now: Shock, despair & anger over violence against US.  Nuclear threat, war threat, Charlottesville.  God, help us!
The outcry against the Alt Right/Nazi attack in #Charlottesville today shows we're still a decent people ...
Soon we will learn that the driver of the #charlottsville car is an antifa member… WAIT FOR IT!! Why are you holding back #CNN?
As you encourage & support the violence and hate of the 'resistance', blm, antifa, etc. You dont get to tweet yourself out of resposibility
SORRY I adore you I really do but we have to fight and fighting is not pretty and not politically correct..but fight we must ...
#2020 pres Cory booker.
But how do we do this when our own president refuses to call out purveyors of racism and violent dogma?
He called out the violence from both sides! I guess you're forgeting that Antifa is not alt-right!
I agree Corey. But remember Berkeley .ca.  Its a 2 way street. We all need to chill out.
This vile regime in WH led by Trump, Sessions, Miller & Bannon need to be accountable for their anti civil rights & anti freedom agenda!
Not the solution. Obama felt this way and you saw where it got him. Get your opponent down, step on his neck and deliver the kill shot.
If you really think that'll work for you Cory then fine but they are killing us out here Bruh
Thank you for your quiet voice. Bravery is speechless. It's silence deafening. @realDonaldTrump you loudly support bigotry #Charlottesville
Shari, can you prove this other than what liars have been feeding you? The liars like Hillary and Obama!
@AgilistaAG I can't say it enough. White 'supremicists', Black Lives Matter, La Raza no place for any of these s-itheads in America.
You have to know & acknowledge the difference btwn right & wrong in order to distinguish dark from light. Left is perpetually in the dark.
So the riots we have seen for the last 8 years weren't based on bigotry and hate?  Believe you were silence.
We must cal evil by its name?
Says the man who's party couldn't utter Islamic terrorists for 8 years.
#hypocrite
We have a DARK demonic force driving out the light from America.  True, light is the only way to drive it out.
that shit aint been working for a while Cory. We need action.
And an impeached president
Time to #ImpeachTrump before another person dies! #Charlottesville
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70atIUbwAi8 … We could've said the same thing about Obama when he called 4 violence on police!
If only we had @POTUS and @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr that felt the same there action and rhetoric speak lound and clear fuel divide and hate
Only if you made any sense! POTUS doesn't represent hate, but you listened to a liar for 8 yrs, so of course you'll believe what htey say!
When is someone in Washington going to man up & call this terrorism? Point at other countries but face facts. Blood on Trumps little hands.
I blame Trump!
Nice slogan but I grew up on Long Island in the 1970s and 80s and no better #It'sEverywhere
Start by denouncing ANTIFA . Can't come together until both sides take responsibility.  #Charlottesville
Deflect deflect delfect.
If your gonna single out one group then call them all out ! No place in America for that BS. #DontBeAHypocrite
AMEN BROTHER
Thank you @SenBookerOffice for standing up for #Charlottesville and American values! #UnitedweStand
Very true
Sad day for America lets hope they listen to you @SenBookerOffice
Sory Booker, you and the r st of the Racist Democrats have brought this act of violence to America. Blame yourself for this.
You tell 'em, Senator.
Booker2020 we need him in the White House

"A Challenger plowed into ppl about 40 mph. Hit 15-20 people". Witness says it was intentional. #Charlottesville

 
Thank you Senator, your voice is needed more than ever now. #Cory2020
no let's do it like this"  fire begets fire".  fight and fight to the death for what you believe in.
Be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good. Romans 12:21 #Charlottesville
TRUMP THE KKK AND THE ALT-RIGHT ARE ALL AT FAULT FOR THIS!!!!! SHAMEFUL HISTORY OF AMERICA!!!!!
Say the same for BLM (or whatever it becomes next) and Antifa.
Thank you for the reminder. It's hard to keep this in mind.

Thank you.
Please go to #Charlottesville, @CoryBooker, or let's gather at the @uscapitol. @timkaine @MarkWarner @RepTomGarrett
