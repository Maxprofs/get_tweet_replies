Except that vimeo doesn't caption anything, so I have no idea what is being said.  Like millions of other people in the US.
So sorry. If there is another solution I should be aware of let me know.
Alternatively, stick it on youtube so their "automatic captions" (which are a joke) might actually work well for a change.
Not so much of a joke anymore. http://www.diycaptions.com 
I know the program but people complain it takes too long, too hard, too costly to pay someone to use it. I'm deaf or I'd do it for others.
What I was saying is YouTube's automatic captions aren't as much of a joke anymore - getting very accurate when speaker and audio quality hi
1.Yeah, they are better.  I don't understand why people aren't enabling them.  One person said "they don't want captions on all the time"
Viewers decide for themselves when they want captions on or off. Unless the choice is made for them by refusing to make them available.
Left Ari in tears, he could barely talk
Having a hard time wrapping my head around the disdain GOP has for the people. How did so many heartless & gutless men get in our gov't?
Agree. And we r going to need a lot of help from COTUS & SCOTUS to get rid of it. So we better not hold our breath. Gonna be a long time
We all better put our best thoughts into the universe for Judge Kennedy that he stays strong and healthy and gives us another year. @Scotus
Don't usually save newscasts - saved this one because agree - this is the video that if everyone saw could change tide of trumpcare vote.
Cried last night and again watching it. IF any GOP Senators watch this and still vote yes, they are evil fuckers imo
It wouldn't change the minds of my college-educated, Christian, Trump-voting in-laws. They have an "I've got mine--so screw you" mentality.

Please vote NO on this cruel bill @lisamurkowski @SenCapito @senrobportman
@NancyCatLover Brilliant, poignant words.  GOP is a disgrace
So agree. Should be all over the internet. Karen and Mike are great spokespersons for the harm that could happen.
Dear GOP You can't be pro-birth and anti-healthcare. This young man's story says it all.
To all the pro life's
Depression, sleepless nights the norm for lots of us now! Live today but maybe die tomorrow? Republicans don't give a damn! 
MURDERERS 
A stunning video. Thank you, Ari, for giving Mike and Karen Clay the spotlight and time to tell their story. They speak for millions of us.
@lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenCapito @senrobportman @SenDeanHeller @TomCottonAR 

Really? You can do this to Medicaid?
Josh that's what bugs me about Trump he said he was never going to touch Medicare Medicaid with Social Security he's already on it
This is a very important video! Please watch and retweet if you care about others! Thank you!
To all the xtians
@IvankaTrump  This is the definition of a working mother
Want to I want to know how he got elected if Clinton won the popular vote how the heck did he get the electoral vote.
This is the exact same thing that obama care is doing now !!!!!!!!
I'm betting you most of those "pro-life" legislators don't believe all of those lives are worth saving.
Of course that's the case. They think young Mike's life should have ended long ago, probably because God says so. Expensive to keep alive...
Until it's their turn to need expensive intervention.
It's not unusual for people to change attitudes when a crisis hits them personally. An elected official SHOULD be able to think for others
The dignity of Mike&his mother.Please show this in the Senate.Can McConnell,Ryan&their henchmen watch this&carry on?Whats next?Euthanasia?
Heart breaking.  "What kind of country are we living in"?
Aren't your the guy who stole a ton of money from the government?
As a doctor, I gained respects and admirations patients.Trumps should listen to young man, Bravely
I'm in tears. I'm applauding this incredibly grave intelligent young man. I'm humbled at the the MSNBC host who's obviously choked up.
*BRAVE* Tears blurred vision.

This is the guy who ripped off the United State Government, he has stolen a lot of money.
You realize that we are talking about the same legislators who didn't feel compelled to address gun safety after Sandyhook.
This should go viral,like yesterday.
'big profits have come... via the ACA's Medicaid expansion, in which the largest insurers play a major role.
So powerful. Thanks for sharing
Most poignant appeal for voting down #WealthCare! Mike & his mom's plea is most heart-wrenching thing I've seen on the right for health care
we wept ' what kind of county have we become?'
Anyone who has a heart will be moved by this story.
I wish that was true, but the people pushing this Bill & the Trumpers that support them are heartless & don't care if these people die.
Trumpcare is meant obliterate any healthcare options & give handouts to the wealthy. To roll back the clock to a time before.
Used to work with kids like Mike.  He expresses himself beautifully and explains his situation perfectly.
I again urge everyone who views tjis to tweet it to @realDonaldTrump  @POTUS  @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump
I sent this to @DNC @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer yesterday. US shd see/hear their story. It could be ANY of us.
This video - w permission of the family - could be used in numerous 2018 & 2020 adverts as a real-life example of consequences of voting GOP
Is ANYONE suggesting care for the severely handicapped/disabled will/should be cut. There are other options like getting people jobs with HI
Caught the Recap Friday getting home late from OKC, had me in tears.
Karen Clay's an American Hero. #SenateGOP voting 4 #AHCA ? 4-profit health Insurance whores. #VoteNoACHA _--> @SenDeanHeller @SenatorCollins
I shared the story, and will get not one comment on my FB page. Trumpers I know have been dead silent since election.
We need to keep making this about the human condition.
Not sure GOP or T hv a soul & don't believe T has working knowledge of responsibilities of Fed Gov't to protect rights of the individual.
First, 1 must hv logic, knowledge of gov't & a soul 2 appreciate eloquence of Michael's understanding of his protections under Fed Gov't.
CORY all you appear to be doing is Pissing In The Wind, that's why You are all wet You waste our time, U may be An Out Of Work Politician
Can't believe the USA has been reduced to such a state as to being left in the stewardship of such cold calculating heartless evil as GOP!
I wish Trump could see this!!!  or would!!
You would think-  in a civilized society.
Sadly, it's not going to change the hearts of the R legislators. Want proof? Not one R referenced this clip when most have seen it.
Exactly, Medicaid should be a lifeline for those who need it, not for half the country. We don't have enough $. We have to be more efficient
I think the republicans should let obama care fail completly. Let the people who support it complain about what trump is trying to do then.
I learned about Mike from @ThisAmerLife. Wrote to him a month or so ago. Great to see this piece.
10 million people with disabilities. These are the people that need us to speak for them. I'm just sick right now. So ashamed of our govment
@JeffFlake and @SenJohnMcCain 

From a voter that votes for your job.
#HellerVoteNo
This is an extremely powerful piece. These are Americans we should be standing with, supporting, every day.
Yes, but it'll need to be edited down.
Very powerful, the interviewer was close to tears! Anyone who votes for this bill will be on the wrong side of history and judged as so.
My best friend has SMA. Not as advanced as this. But alas, this just makes me cry.
I watched @AriMelber @MSNBC interview. Want to know the devasting effect #trumpcare will have on the most vulnerable, watch!
You underestimate the Cult of Death of the Republican Party
See also
and
we should make this viral.  this is so compelling and heartbreaking.  go viral!!
Why can't we have Medicare For All? Let all of us buy into Medicare, force Ins. companies to compete against Medicare 4 our business.
I watched the whole thing & it . Repubs will gut medicare & medicaid & then lie & say, "Oh they are not sustainable" Tax breaks 4 the rich!
It won't.  They don't care.
VERY EMOTIONAL, even for interviewer.... effect of Trumpcare on real people. Over 50% of those on Medicaid are children!
Mom spent 40+ yrs ensuring every disabled person an equal dignified life. Trump wants to destroy everything she stood for. Why so heartless?
This is a remarkable young man
So glad to see it here. Hope it goes viral. It was gut wrenching. GOP senators need to see.
This is heart breaking. The GOP senators no longer represent the interests of the American people. We must take to the streets.
no, it will take a LOT more, these ppl lack hearts, conscience - they are pathological & bought
@deraymckesson @ASlavitt @AriMelber watched interview last night & husband & I were in tears.  Medicaid is vital! Stop @GOP #AHCA !
@OrrinHatch  @SenMikeLee Trumpcare is a tax cut for the wealthy. Listen to the people you will hurt!  Trash all drafts of Trumpcare.

It was astonishing. l shared it earlier. Profound.
So @60Minutes @ReliableSources @NewsHour @FaceTheNation @MeetThePress @ThisWeekABC @CNNSotu @FoxNewsSunday have ALL Governors booked, yes?
I urge everyone to view this video, & get it out on Social Media in every form.
Get it to all Republicans on the Hill, Govs., Mayors etc.
This bill serves two purposes: wealthcare for those who don't need it, and the Republican version of the Nazi Aktion T4 program.
Must see! Heartbreaking. GOP Trumpcare is terrorism, no doubt about it. Bill causing terror & fear. Mean and un-necessary to give tax breaks
And yet i feel they still won't care.
GOP have hated disability community ever since ACA was passed. The ACAAA exists because the ACA didn't work.
This was heartbreaking and also motivating. We are not the country the R's suggest we are
The purported wealthiest ctry in the world  has NO excuse for any of its citizens to go w/ out adequate HC. Do not give 1% taxes back! 2/2
Shame on Florida. Shame on the Trump administration. Shame on the GOP. Shame. #AHCAKills
If the US were an impoverished 3rd world cty. we would have citizens dying fr lack of HC of all kinds. It would be unavoidable but cruel 1/2
Why?  Because GOP will suddenly & miraculously grow a conscience & feel compassion?
If someone does not have compassion after viewing this, they lack humanity.  Not only Congress but the GOP voters that cheer the bill on.
At what point will people acknowledge that GOP philosophy has ALWAYS been Darwinian at best.  "Culling the herd" is often the goal.
Mike Clay is an inspiration! 
An eye opening interview by @AriMelber ! How can anyone not have a visceral reaction? Mike and Karen have gained many new friends!
As Paul Ryan said " Not everybody gets what they want." Whew, let that sink in. Immoral.Beyond murderous.Cruelty @ it's most removed
Breathtaking. I double dog dare...... Oh never mind. I'm convinced they are not human.
I didn't need convincing, but when I saw this last night was moved to tears!
So let me get this straight.  The holier than thou pro-lifers want kids born with pre-existing cond. but won't allow them to get med help
One of the most moving pieces of journalism!
#ADAPTandRESIST #SaveMedicaid YESS! #freeourpeople #PWD #ADA
We hope! Everyone retweet!
I saw this last night and cried how cruel is the GOP and to give their masters a tax cut #WealthCare
Watch this @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr  then defend your  #TrumpCare  U & turncoat #GOP HOODWINKED your voters. #Medicaid
It is sad. Bedridden, no run and play, no social interaction.
It is *highly* persuasive because it evokes strong emotions.
Saw this earlier. The computer works with your eyes to communicate  So amazing  we are fighting for you and everyone else! Pray for you 
Thank you for your hard work, @ASlavitt.  A nation is grateful.
I wish I had the faith in Republicans that you do. I expect them to mock & belittle this young man because that's what they've done before.
#HellerVoteNO
It is amazing that those who are given the direction to care for the least of these my brothers want to take away healthcare. Christianity?
How can you say you are pro-life, when you rob people of lives & taking away healthcare, you kill them. NOT CHIrSTIAN! SHAME!
I saw this last nite. Ari was visibly touched as I. Does anyone opposed to Obamacare realize how repealing affects millions?
@jk_rowling Please help spread the word.
Thanks Andy you and Ari did and great thing with this story!!!
This is the single video that gives Rs the ability to claim the high ground for 'greater good' instead of capitulating to mawkish exceptions
All these deeply human pleas mean nothing to people who have a cynical, ideological perspective on life and it's economic value.
Their view is blocked by  stacks!
Every legislator MUST watch this video! #SavetheACA
Most of the Republicans in both houses do not have hearts.
Mr. Trump. STOP war in Syria and Jemen immedeatly!!!
Thank you, thank you so much for sharing this, for sharing their story. I cried like I haven't cried in years watching that.
I can't comprehend, I can't imagine, how we could think the lives of people like that, people like Mike, are worth less than a few dollars.
I heard it last night but it was with listening to again. #AHCA will kill ppl. It turns US into a nation I don't respect. I fear this vision
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @FLOTUS You need to take a look at this.
Watched the whole thing. Thank you!
I watched this last night, heartbreaking.
So proud of you Karen Clay and Mike Phillips!!!!! Tampa's own!
We all cried .. The GOP used to say they were pro-life. Clearly, life doesn't matter, only some births. It will be voluntary manslaughter
We're damned lucky to have a mother and son pair like that orbiting with us. #GRATEFUL
The GOP doesn't care. They have no souls..
@SenToomey Watch this. Watch it over and over again and realize what you are going to do to real people. Do you have a heart?
@SenToomey doesn't care about us! He is bought and paid for!
There is nothing that can change Rs vote. Have plotted and bitched for 7 years to destroy healthcare reform and they'll deliver. Believe me.
#HellerVoteNo
What an inspiration to us all!
I watched this live yesterday evening and teared up.
The GOP is the DEATH PANNEL...  GOP always talks about redistributing wealth. Their DEATH CARE BILL redistributes all the wealth to the rich
This video should be played on the floor of the Senate before the vote.
Brilliant
Ain't that the truth
But billionaires need tax cuts, sorry Mike
@SenSasse @BenSasse @SenatorFischer Please watch this video and THINK HARD before you vote on the health care bill.
Most people think it's a done deal because of the way things seem to be going. I hope not.
Devastatingly powerful....& effective...& truth. Spread it!! & keep tissues handy. Most important & impressive spokespersons I've seen yet.
How can our government spend trillions on a war to preemptively protect our citizens and cut medical care for needy citizens 
These members of Congress are deplorable!
I hope it does, it should. But does GOP have the heart?
Everyone needs to watch this video.
think this would change anything? Trump thugs routinely threatened disabled at rallys. Alan Grayson had it right GOP AHCA= pls.die quickly
We can only hope.  Afraid its going 2B a nightmare that could be a revolution or civil war
Maybe but Trumpians are,a heartless bunch. They will say, "Awwwww" and then discuss how they hate paying for THOSE people
I cried ugly tears watching this. I'm so scared. I'm 43 so if I die so be it but children... omg. Children should not suffer.
This breaks my heart. How can GOP so blatantly hurt millions? They think they're daddy & father knows best. Even if it kills us.
I cried watching this. There are so many people who depend on family for their care. Why deny them their care, family and independence. Why
But repubs just don't care about any of this.
this video is just another argument for single payer and no more crazy schemes necessary to get care.
But none of the Trumpsters will see it unless Dear Leaders communication dept, FOX news, airs it so I wouldn't count on it.
Pat? Hello? Are you watching? @SenToomey
A phrase that might help @GOP @SenateDems determine the correct path: but there by the grace of God go I
Pre-existing condition?
Video gives 2 reasons to oppose WealthCare billl: 1. Empathy for folks like this man and/or 2. Higher costs to taxpayer w/o Mcaid
Terrific work on @TheLastWord last night.
Wish I cd agree but Left believes in compassion & good Gov't aids all, BUT Right wants tax cuts even at cost of safety nets. Falls on deaf
The republicans need to check their pro life cards on this one.
It's really not pro-life anymore. They should be honest and change it to "pro-birth."
The saddest, bravest video on earth would not move Mitch McConnell for whom it's all about politics and $, not compassion and morality.
It's money, millions of dollars passed out to GOP. Many of them also getting "donations" from Russians directly and affiliated entities.
Maybe u can get @bellvisuals help you project it on public building in DC where would get a lot of attention.Don't know abt audio
I'm assuming the industries and non-pol orgs that support AHCA are wisely staying silent.  Can you out them?
As if Republicans cared. Sorry I wish this would change things but not for those heartless bastards. Their sympathy with rich & powerful .
I cried my eyes out last night watching this.#SaveMedicaid #KillTheBill Please everyone RT. Make the world see the consequences
The heartless Repubs whose healthcare is paid with our tax dollars, don't think everyone deserves it.  Trump voters you will lose yours too!
I have worked for local Medicaid office 29 years. Cutting Medicaid services to disabled & elderly will ultimately increase costs!
Yeah, but rich ppl need their tax cuts! Priorities!
Entire interview was remarkable. I appreciated hearing Mike's Mom, Karen. Thanks @ASlavitt for all the work you do for all of US.
Sadly, some people will look at this and ask why they have to help him, "not my problem." Most of those people are in Congress.
I cried watching this last night. I worry about anyone who didn't tear up after seeing this.
Me too. It's  a human being. Our Dad's, mother's,  brothers, sister's, friends.  N still by accident  so sadly some die exactly as this man
Michael Phillips, hero of #TheResistance 
@wholeexpanse
@ASlavitt and this is the thread that could ... https://twitter.com/aliranger29/status/878428841773019136 … It will steal your heart clear out of your chest, I swear to you
It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
This is heart-wrenching, and gut-wrenching. It will happen every minute of every day in every way one can imagine.
no it won't Republicans have zero HEART and zero care about their fellow American. They only want to harm people and make $$$$
They don't hv to hv a heart. Options w/o Medicaid more expensive for taxpayer.
This was outstanding!  We fight on!!!
