 @dremmelqueen @SenBookerOffice @verucasalt10 @BrookingsInst @mdcolli
Trumpcare could raise insurance premiums by 750 percent for some older Americans http://slate.me/2nxW3Tm  
99% of Americans should be scared to death.
scared enuff2change their mind on GOP not seeing it!
They don't care.
you mean Trump voters?
What about the real story? The ACA is anything but and going to collapse.
@CoryBooker Thank you for your support & fight to provide all Americans health coverage!! FIGHT ON!!
1/2 my fam is in the 2% neg affected by aca. GOP plan will not help us. Pls let us buy in to Medicare
2/2 so our $ goes to help those who need it not into ins corp pockets!!!
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst "You don't have to insure them if they're dead."
I guess this is one take on universal healthcare.
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst why doesn't congress give themselves that health ins plan and give us that beauty they have?
I've been tweeting that same question for 2 months no answer
There is NO CARE in #TrumpCare - except for the rich!  The #ACA saved my life! DON"T PASS THIS!
plz do not talk about the "bad" Repubs! Didn't u learn from Hillary? Talk about the BILL n only the BAD BILL
The plan all along, I'm sure. Karma will find them all some day. Always does. #RESIST 
I'm good, I got the crappy Tricare for life for serving 26 years.  How many years do politicians serve to get healthcare for life?
REPS DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THE L.PEOPLE ALL ARE EXPLENDABLE
Caring decent ppl,would never promote this indecency,but selfish pea-brained ego does not care about people.
Why isn't health care a constitutionally protected right in the US? Gov should only exist to help humanity tackle issues we can't alone
Why are insurance executive being given Million Dollar Parachutes by @GOP in #TrumpCare? #TrumpCareless
GOP hubris knows no bounds. Americans who are the most vulnerable are about to be screwed. Speak out !
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst @corybooker call @JohnKasich  healthcare is big. Together for a chance to be healthy.
That's not true. Their you go again with the Democratic playbook. Lies and scare tactics
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst 1/2 I ask this with the upmost respect for you, Sen. Booker. Lifetime benefits for politicians,
2/2 provided by us, is an entitlement. What makes @GOP & @TheDemocrats more valuable than us?
Bookers NewJersey Failed-Ghettos?
Why Did Booker Voted Unread Failed Obamacare?
let's just pass it real quick so we can all find out what's in it.
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst Cory, UR pledge to be the one to fight for PEOPLE gives me hope.
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst  Cory do you & your family have Obama Care Insurance ?
Answer please #Nopenot good enough for Me
Rich coming from a drug company serf.
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst I don't believe anything you say , how did you get elected?
Your the one who defended private equity Cory Booker
Has anyone given a reason for this?  I just can't fathom it!
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst @POTUS @SpeakerRyan And it is up to Congress and Senate to stop this insanity! CBO will show it!
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst you all llied your no good and you deserve to lose your job vote you out liar
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst how did they get their estimates. Or is this more Democrat bullshit
The compassion that was a hallmark of the Obama presidency is totally gone. Anyone without $ is in big trouble.
Once again, the hypocrisy of it all.
DUMP the wall, healthcare for all.
Why Booker Voted Unread Failed Obamacare? Why does he Fail New Jersey Ghettos?
@CoryBooker  Current healthcare sucks anyway. Even if it was cheap I still wouldn't want it. ACA is so-called healthcare
@KatCapps @BrookingsInst republicans seem to have become salesman for cheap and useless catastrophic plans
and when we deport hard working undocumented workers how will under-employed uninsured fill the gap?
Only the Trump Chumps thought Trump was doing things for the people, the rest of us knew better
else can we do?
the GOP does not care ab the working class. Why do people think they do? I try to make calls everyday. What
Exactly what the GOP and it's simple-minded followers want. Let the rest of us eat cake.
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst They will kill for tax breaks. How very "pro-life".
that's misleading. The 'tax break' is a retraction of an ACA imposed tax on insurance companies, not execs
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst I'll say it again, you better be gearing up to run in 2020.
care or insurance ??
do you know the difference BOOger
not to mention breaking of ins cos that are pulling out of 7 hardest hit States, premiums will skyrocket.
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst psychiatrists are reason why health care is a problem in this country
Dear @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @BrookingsInst, read this washpost piece
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst At least the middle class and lower knows our/their value in Rep. And big business minds.<than.
When big bus. values all, things are pretty good for all people not just top 1%.Greed,not good.
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst and what do those execs give the GOP. Investigate this corporate corruption !!!!
We need to stop paying for free for life health care for congress while they throw us under the bus.
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst Stand firm. We support you and colleagues. Keep sending out mathematically sound projections.
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst Thank you for fighting back along w/my electeds @sethmoulton @SenMarkey @SenWarren! #resist
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst some people can't understand what they read,you are so lost
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst Healthcare is not a right.That's like saying car insurance is a right...
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst making the rich richer, that's what this admin. is all about
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst propose a bill that would give all Americans access to the same health insurance Paul Ryan has!
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst @CoryBooker Obama care was certainly pushed down our throats!  What?    It can't go both ways?
@CoryBooker @BrookingsInst well we know now why you will never be more than racist, get ou more
@imwithher61 @BrookingsInst $500.000. Tax break for Ins. CEOS that make 12 to 24 million a year. Really?
...and what is the solution you are proposing in response or are you working with the republicans on something else?
no they could lose their stolen subsidies from tax payers. If they want ins they can buy their own.
Hospitals will bear the burden of this. I'm a nurse. We are NOT prepared.
LONG OVERDUE WE FIGHT THESE OUTRAGEOUS DEBATE ABOUT HEALTHCARE THE RIGHT WAY - VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION
