First Senate @GOP wanted to just repeal the ACA => @USCBO told us this would leave 32 million uninsured 2/
Then they tried repeal & replace => @USCBO told us this would leave ~22 million uninsured 3/
Then, Senate @GOP went back to just repeal => AGAIN, 32 MILLION would be left uninsured 4/
Now, that Senate @GOP plan is doomed too. 

Americans are sick & tired of being sick & tired 5/
Senators should treat Americans the way we would want to be treated. We should be a nation that does right by its citizens 6/
We should be an America that stands up for children, for the elders 7/
We should be an America that stands up for those battling cancer, those with pre-existing conditions 8/
We should be an America that stands up for those with disabilities, those who rely on Medicaid 9/
We should be an America that stands up for women's health & veterans' health 10/
We should be an America that stands up for those fighting opioid addictions and mental health conditions 11/
This fight for better health care has risen to a moral moment in America. The health of our citizens is on the line 12/
We CAN work to expand coverage, reduce cost and improve the quality of our health care 13/
We CAN do better, and we MUST do better 14/
It's time Republicans join Democrats in the fight to improve health care for Americans 15/15
@CoryBooker @GOP Until they realize that a 12% approval rating WON'T GET ANY OF THEM RE-ELECTED!
Until they force their own noses in the filth of the greed and hubris that drives them!
Can't both parties work this together already!  This is not about political gains from either party this about every American affected
how long are you Dems going to sit back and let Your health ins plan die?
#SinglePayer
Obamacare HAS TO STOP!
Admit it NEITHER party can successfully reform healthcare
ACA was damn close to perfect! Saved my life when I lost employer coverage during cancer treatment. GOP tries to force failure incessantly.
till people are dying cruel deaths... they dont care they want #taxcuts for the richest which is bound to crash the whole system...#insanity
#Ditto!! They R #cruel & #abusive to #all of #us in the #USA #Stop it #now!!
It's a death bill.
It's time for single payer!
But the Dems created Obamacare and expected Clinton to keep it alive.  Nah the Dems own this one.
PUTIN  and trump own it all. ACA needs revisions not TAX-CUTS for the rich
Senate GOP hc committee condescending to Americans, don't recognize our need for good healthcare, care only about making more $ for rich.
They don't care about anything but their sick agenda. Thank goodness for the 3 women who blocked this latest death by healthcare bill.
The child health care program SCHIP needs reauthorization soon. Another opportunity for Trump/McConnell/Ryan to show their sick cruelty?
Senator,  as long as your willing to use whatever is passed I'm good with that!
@SenateMajLdr  @SpeakerRyan You blame Dems on healthcare when it is YOU not listening the the 83% of Americans who actually want healthcare.
@physicianwomen a group of 7500 women docs would love to help
Yay! I just lost my healthcare & now have to wait 6 months to renew. At 64 this is not comforting. My blood pressure was 220/120 this AM!
The repeal plan is DEAD, thx to Sens. Collins, Capito, Murkowski, and Portman. Republicans have lost again. Trump is a traitor. No surprise!
I especially love the fact that it was mostly the women that had the balls to stand up to trump/McConnell. Now, GOP probably has a target on
their backs. Fortunately for them, they'll keep the support of their constituents because they stood up for them & had their backs
thank you for your service and dedication to the american people. get seeing u tonight
Well it's over. Continue on in comfort of your fabulous insurance coverage which WE pay for-while average joe pays 20,000 deductible
sad but true! 20k a yr for a basic local hmo with a hosp deductible of 10k! #RepealObamacare
Maybe in calif or Illinois - democrat bankrupt states maybe it's different but it cannot last.
The purpose of congress is to work together for the good of the country,not just try to hurt Obama.
Thank you sir.
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @HouseGOP You all can start by removing the # 1 danger 2 America #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachPence NOW
How long? As long as they are on control. Then the dems will take over and retaliate. And so it will go ad nauseum. I wish it would stop!
I agree let Obamacare distruct on its own its the democrats bill.let them come up with a fix for Obamacare instead of complaining Good luck.
That and the threat of taking away SSI/SSDI.
Absolutely!
Be objective, Senotor. Your Party created the debacle. GOP met an impass at fixing it because you won't participate in a solution. U OWN IT!
That's funny coming from a Democrat. You people don't give a shit.
Until special interests like BIG PHARMA  are no longer the OWNERS of Reps & SENATORS!!!!!!  Any other stupid questions????  #Resist
Yes and YES, Senator Booker!
Look  inward to find out it's the Dems doing this
keep the pressure on...the last time Trump blamed the Dems, the House passed the AHCA bill...stay vigilant#NeverRepeal 
Better late than never
And it creates instability in the insurance market which makes everything worse! Where are the ins. lobbyists to tell them to cut it out!
As long as the Repukelicans can 
Yes, it does need to stop. They need to work with Dems
Thank you Senator and well said
It is cruel, but I think that do it as a fear tactic. Used to be fear rhetoric. Now it's just fear, fear, and more fear!
Time for single payer, universal healthcare for all like every other industrialized country.  Hey, even Trump compliments Australian HC
Can they really think repeal and worry about it later is going anywhere???
It is soooo cruel.  You're right.
I don't get Gop,Picking up that working together on this would b a win 4 party, ppl,& they can become heroes 4 the bnft.of the ppl
D's need to make public aware of their offer to work with R's on healthcare. Let US hear it loud & clear. Don't sit & wait. Announce plans!
Thank you, Sir.
Repeal & Replace
If Obama had not told you not to help with healthcare maybe you could have helped. But no, listen to the man that almost ruined America.
I keep quiet you are team Obamacare which is failing
What is cruel is democrats have become so evil & ugly & not doing their job which is WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE!!
Like hearing yourself talk??? Insane??
DA: The health care bill is dead for now-time to obstruct Senate business until the GOP gives Democrats a seat at the table!
Until it's ripped out root and branch! !!
Seems to all of us Repubs are struggling, working hard, arguing on how to fix/improve the disastrous, craven, bankrupting ocare you created
GOP will keep doing it till they are certain 2018 will be their undoing
#TheResistance will make them certain.
Thank you Senator! And can I get a big Amen!
If you believe what you're saying&you mean it,stop all the BS w "improving" our current sys 2include insr monopoly &supt #SinglePayerNow
Please, please take no more money from big Pharma, it's important that we appear or not be hypocrites. We can be down & dirty not hypocrites

They will not stop!
You rock! Keep it up!
After dealing with the 7-yr curse of high premiums and rising deductibles of Obamacare that was passed on a bunch of lies?  Obamacare Sucks!
Democrats OWN Obama Care. When it finally hits the bottom of the TANK you will be singing a different tune!
Perfect subterfuge(most important/interest 2public) 4 #trumpRussia revelations/investigations 2b smoked/fogged/hidden/buried n2 DEEP SHADE!
Cory Booker is a fraud.
So Americans are bunch of snow flakes that cant handle deversity of thought  and only the democrats  can save us,Cory?
Sweet from a politician who accepted pharmaceutical money..running for president anytime soon sounds like one..
Your persistence for what's right for the American people makes me proud to be an American 
I blame the Dems and Republicans.  not working for the people I'm tired of the BS
you admitting that Obamacare was a disaster. It's not GOP  debacle dems are part of this debacle you are all cruel

If they only knew how much my sister, whose life depends on the ACA, is suffering, knowing they are trying to take that away. So cruel.
You have got to be kidding!!!! The dems created this mess. Do you think money grows on trees? Spend other ppl money. Dems good at that!
Are they trying to scare people to death so less to cover?
The longer it takes the more pre-existing conditions the stress will cause. Fight on!
Well they don't know how to lead so who knows? They have no plan- all they care about is huge tax cuts for the donor class
Repeal health care
How long until you take advantage push for Univer Healthcare? 
Duh !! they're handing it to you on a silver plater.
Yet crickets from Dems.
@CoryBooker @GOP At least lower income percentage for seniors to deduct medical expenses.
trump doesnt know whats in the healthcare bill
I'd say January of 2019 is a safe bet. #2018MidtermElections
Until they lose
Thank you Senator, because I'm about ready to jump out of my skin with all this crap. Don't know what to do, where to turn or who to trust!
@GOP has proven themselves to be vile and pathetic men with no moral code and zero ethis. I feel absolutely sorry for their children
well, do you support the only real solution #singlepayer?
.@GOP is terrorizing American citizens daily with the constant threat of losing HC in the name of tax relief for the rich.  Exhausting.
When will they stop this cruel game of terrorizing American citizens.  @GOP worse than ISIS as far as terrifying US citizens in need of HC
@SenBookerOffice. Thank you!
They need to step up, EXPEL Russia & her agents from OUR government, then, if there are any left, work with Dems on bipartisan solutions.
Do your job Corey. Stand strong. We are standing with you!
Right on   
It is cruel..many of us are living with constant uncertainty.  Thank you for working for us.
Yay, team, but more work ahead!

Until YOU stop them.
#HealthCare NOT #WealthCare (#TrumpCare) . Fix #ACA, #RepealMcConnellRyan #SaveACA #SAVEMedicaid
What happened to  Unifying the Country? Time to make the ACA improvements.
What happened? Seriously? Do you not pay attention? TRUMP is what happened and McConnell is his puppet.
Every time they try some new shenanigans, it makes my anxiety spike. 
Mine too
Not sure who is running Dem Strategy but now might be a good time to put up your ideas .....  stop letting McConnell control the cycle.
Neither party has a plan, politicians are only concerned with reelection, we americans are a distant 2nd
Expecting the GOP to stop being cruel is like expecting water to stop being wet.
