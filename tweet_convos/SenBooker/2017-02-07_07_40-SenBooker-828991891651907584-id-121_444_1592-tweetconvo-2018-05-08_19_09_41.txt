. This clown worked with her in Jersey.   This guy is a clown!!!!
He voted agnst her I don't care if he did know her She's unqualified & he saw that
Give her a chance  before your cast judgement . Work together
Yeah, they have a plan, all right -- to abolish the education dept.  All good with you?
that truly is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard to abolish the education program. Not
Yes, it is!  That's why those of us who have been paying attention are RESISTING, not waiting!
I pay attention every day all different new stations media if it's bull crap   brainwashed
what about my right to keep and BEAR arms????
this ain't about guns you nut!!  Sheesh!!
Rights are rights...
right are rights??  Dude issue isn't about guns!  What is the matter with you man!?

Here is a fantastic Cory Booker speech in favor of school choice and charter schools. Venue is Betsy DeVos’s group. https://youtu.be/6pHqWDqdkSM 
Weren't you two friends and for many of the same school politics?
DeVos being confirmed is a tragedy. Both my parents are retired public school teachers & they're horrified.
what was she before she was appointed this position ?
Are you referring to all children of all races ? Upholding Civil Rights !
you are the joke that never stops.
thank you for taking a stand, Senator!
what is she going to do ? And how ?
Why EXACTLY do you feel DeVos would NOT defend student's civil rights?! Another Democrat Bigot...
Rights come from God, Senator.  Our founding fathers gave us 10 of them.  Students lack an unbiased education.
So very true
go testify against one of your colleagues. No one will vote for a backstabber. Hope you enjoyed what you did.
Thanks for your effort. Proud of your work. We are supporting you.
unhappy Devos got in it's an embarrassment to our country #notmypresident #stoptrump
thank you so much senator for the tenacious fight. The republicans now own the education of our kids :(
weren't you all about school choice? UR A politician for sure. #Wattsneedschoolchoice
This vote today is the CLEAREST sign that you are indeed the biggest hypocrite in Washington, D.C.
like the unions?
thank you for trying
You spoke at her events & worked w/her on school choice! Hypocrite!
can the bipartisan Senate Task Force on Federal Regulation of Higher Education reform to keep DEVOS in check?
That's my Senator!Jersey Shore,so proud of you 
You worked with DeVos when you were a Mayor.  Did we forget? Are we a hypocrite?   #politicalhack
.@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker:
We don't believe you no more.
Not when you support her policies. #Betsy #DeVos

how does a voucher system benifit the low income? The voucher will be worth less than the private school cost.
@CNN Please provide examples of lawmakers improving public schools the last few years along w/improved stats
@seanhannity   Boring, Fruitless Delusional, Pandering Carnival Barker Misleading, Whiners Liberal Party Liars!
teach them their rights and allow them to stand for themselves
Thank You Senator Booker for putting our children first

thank you for standing up for our kids!
our @VP would rather jeopardize lives of children than upset the right wing. These are sad days.
forNJ #withholdconsent #filibuster NoVote on unqualified ethics ridden noms DeVos Sessions Price Pruitt Mnuchin
so sorry your efforts went to defeat. We will concentrate on replacing in the 2018 vote with more dems. 
thank you for trying to defeat DeVos.
Stop talking.  You already turned your backs on Americans for big pharma money.  You're just as bad.
Thank You for trying.
give states the ability to manage it. No unions, higher salaries for teachers,
that is the most insane comment. You guys are so out of touch. I support school choice. Why not?
you did your best. I'm not mad after watching u fight hard last night. I hope my son can stay in pub school
Thank you, Sen. Booker for trying so very hard to prevent the confirmation of Betsy DeVos.
You fought the good fight. We'll never forget! Right behind you. @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker
why?
Thank you for trying your hardest. Always devastating to see ignorance win. Keep fighting, we need you.
Thank you for being on the right side and voting no.
Thank you for your service!
I'm a Republican, and I want you to please run in 2020! No Trump!
Stay Strong Senator. You are our kids' voice. Don't quit. Hold the floor. #VoteNoDevos
yes please!  #BookerforPresident!
#NoOnDeVos The Senate vote is tragic for our children/grandchildren.  A clueless airhead heads education sad.
. You Democrats have done nothing for education in 8 years so it's time for a change
Well then fucking step up since it seems no one else will.
Shameful display of partisanship by GOP Senators to confirm an egregiously unqualified candidate like Devos.
I admire you. Wish you could stop this ludicrousy!!!!!
thank you for the good fight..Appreciate your efforts.
it appears our VP is going to break tie!  This IS AWFUL!!!!
Obama-----said that it's wrong to focus on the trouble of black people

She fits We have  President who never read the Constitution or knows basic American rights & calls us murderers
Dems have to make sure all illegals get their fare share.
Good!
Forget where u stand on Betsy #DeVos as SecOfEd. Where do u stand in relation 2 her ed. philosophies? #aligned
thank you thank you for all you do while taking sh*t the whole time #lovetheuneducated
nonoDeVos
we need our own "tea party" otherwise all these protests will be pointless. We need a leader/organisation
weakness is only virtue you display Unable to stand up to unions and big pharmaceutical U r bought and pad 4
i think u should see a doctor, ur eyes are popping out of ur head again. #termlimits #yourfired #crook
I agree with Mr.Booker because Mrs. Devos did not help the Schools in Michigan that needed support
yes!!! So passionate about this
WHAT ABOUT PHARMACEUTICALS!!
its personal to all parents with kids in public schools. We will hold her and everyone accountable 4 failures
#booker2020
Thank You for standing up for all our children. I am proud of all the Senators for VOTING NO
When DEMs are forced to #holdthefloor its obvious the nominee is spectacularly bad. Thanks for fighting!

Thank you Sen Booker for focusing on what is best for our children.
no to DeVos!
Education is important. #noDevos 
@RobertAlbine
Does the teachers union pay as well as the drug companies?
Troll 
@cvsjr002
VOTE NO
As well as someone that knows anything about education at all! @BetsyDeVos = #UneducatedonEducation #NoDeVos
God bless you, Senator. We need more people with your integrity.
Misogyny is duly noted. 
You were happy to work with her before? 
But give a woman power you are threatened?
Racist still scared of Hillary but totes cares about sexism... Or 24. Can't tell.
@JudsonMcCulloch
thank you for standing up for students.  Improving Ed is about more than funding! About equity, teacher quality
what an absolute crock. forcing them into the same failing schools that have been awful for decades is a right?
Block. 
@Veritas4America
You mean you want someone who will keep your Party agenda.
TY @SenBookerOffice for leading the sensible outcry #NoOnDeVos; @ThomTillis @RichardBurr_DN - we in NC are WATCHING YOUR VOTE with ours.
just another man selling out america.
Behead them in their own homes”: Pennsylvania Muslim’s assassination list of US military personnel. is this ok?
thank you for standing up for students!
Betsy DeVoss is CHAMPION 4 all kids!!!  YES Betsy!!!! #MAGA 
Education is not a priority for this President. Remember, he said "I love the uneducated." He doesn't care.
Thank you.
