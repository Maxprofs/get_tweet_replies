BREAKING: Congressional Budget Office sees 22 million more uninsured by 2026 under Senate health bill in latest hurdle for GOP.
Thanks for your great work for America!@repjohnlewis  @CoryBooker  @SenKamalaHarris  @SenFeinstein  @MaxineWaters  @SenFranken  #RESIST
Government stay out of health care, you bankrupt everything you try to run.
I stand firmly with you to block this health bill. Thanks
I wish you folks with no real understanding would get real.  The reason Medicaid cost so much is because of CMS regulations
I could fix the problem with my 45 years experience.  How much experience do you have, Corey?
Great that you are calling!!! Tell all your friends to call too! The more that call the more they will listen!!
I'm from CA and I have been calling my senators. But if I would be calling with you too if I was in TX. Keep it up!
You know. Liberals are doom and gloom. Take the blame for thus mess. Obama care a DISASTER.
How quickly could this be reversed (if it passes) in 2020?
What are you doing about it?
Like you took action to vote against cheaper medicine then took millions of $$ in donations from companies that benefited from your vote?
Thank you for fighting for us !
Fake news
Just like how you took action on limiting big pharma's powers?
Obamacare is slowly destroying our small business.  What about us @CoryBooker?
Most the people complaining about trump killing the ACA don't have a small business big enough to be affected by the mandatory insurance.
We are too small had to buy individual coverage. 1500per month with a 6500ded for me and a 6500ded for my husband not worth going to dr.
Had great insurance before Obamacare. Pls don't tell me Obamacare is good for us. It's not!
Lives mean nothing to GOP when compared to deficit reduction
Sadly, they don't care about deficit. :(
The last Republican to reduce budget deficit was Eisenhower. 
*note deficit is not the same as debt
You and your party have created this crisis
I live in New Jersey and have great representatives. So what else can I do?
Says the man bought and paid for by big pharma ...repeal and replace DC
Yeah speaking of that, u wud win the WH easily in 2020 if u stop catering to ur corporate donors and run a much more progressive platform
The crises in our country has been real because of people like you that are corporate whore's for big pharma.  Canada prescriptions now!
Why dont you be Honest and lookat how much better it will be if they justr do what they did before this OC. Medicare will cover them. OPTION
Please take action to reach across the aisle and be a part of the solution #ProblemSolvers
CBO score is devastating. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is reportedly voting against it too.
When does the nanny state end and personal responsibility take over? Does 50% dependency phase you in the least? Your sentencing generations
Cory booker my brother do what you know in your heart is right

#ForceCONGRESStoBudgetIncome & #PayoffTheirDeb
what a joke it is embarrassing that we still r fighting about this  "in the western world"  uuug!!!
Single payer with a flat tax is the only option!!!   Sell @realDonaldTrump that!!!   
It will still pass. Dems no longer relevant
you're obviously illiterate.
With this bill by 2026 45 million will lose healthcare They did this in secret & want to rush the vote. Americans deserve better government
Where were you people when this shit bill passed 7 years ago
You had your chance and did nothing about it.Obamacare is failing.Devastating impact on millions of families.Shameful!!
GOP hates people.  They only care about money.  They will screw us every way they can.
No worse than Obamacare which is in its death throws!
The problem is it won't apply to those voting yes for this bill. Easy to screw others when you are unaffected. Republican motto.
ACA nearly DEVI STATED ME...I wrote your office about it, got a phone call asking me if I needed help filling out forms..I"M NOT ILLITERATE
and cost of absence from work
i noticed there was no actuarial analysis done by CBO on increased disability and treatment costs due to poor care
Thank you Cory for being the rational side of things.  Healthcare for all should be the goal. Which will get people back to work
Come up with a plan besides Obama Care! It is falling a part! People are gonna die! Dems want to kill people with Obama Care! AAAHHH!!!
The ACA is better than the Republican plan, but we the people want something different than both. What is your stance on SINGLE PAYER, Cory?
Only GOP Senators can stop it...and let's get real...we know they will not. They are not only putting party over country, party over life.
Try 2 get a note to @SenToomey VOTE NO on healthcare bill. Phone lines busy & voicemail full. PA doesn't want this bill! We want a townhall!
