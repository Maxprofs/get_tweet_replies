More liberal grandstanding........nothing more and a great deal less.......
you realize this man wasn't confirmed as a judge and is now up for AG, right? Racism aside...
Where is the racism?
It's under every rock and behind every tree for those who look to see it in every thing
Just because the left doesn't agree with someone doesn't make them racist
wtf you talking about. No one denies it exsists. All races can be racist but everyone you don't agree with isn't
@MattWelch @CoryBooker @MSNBC great tweet exposes Cory Booker for the traitor he is
I'm going to be generous and assume that you're not racist, just ignorant.
investigate the case. Read further than the headline. Sessions is no racist.
As a lawyer, I sadly have. His career as a litigator is despicable.
yeah convicting kkk leaders and desegregating schools is despicable
Record shows he tried to stop the KKK prosecution. Details matter
look again. Read deeper than the headlines
Because he's a sore loser just like all the other democrats.
A thoughtful, deliberative confirmation process is part of our constitution. It IS patriotism.
mark levin did a great monologue on Jeff sessions today listen and learn
....a biased outrageous monologue
I guess uncomfortable facts is biased Man get out of your echo chamber
now why would he tell a little rat weasel like you? That's right #FakeNews
Don't do it, Cory!  We'll put you on the list!  So sad.  Dishonest @CoryBooker lies about fantastic Jeff Sessions!
Thank you, @CoryBooker!

Gee, @DanaBashCNN, I'm still not seeing the rank "partisanship" u refuse to let go of. Apology to @SenBookerOffice?

COULD YOU EVER BELIEVE A DEMOCRAT? NO CHANGES LIKE THE WIND TO SERVE THE 'BIGGER PICTURE'
political aspirations always are the death of them
Nice photo. Booker looks like a doofus.
So he's just concerned about getting his name in the history books, narcissistic
For those who think theirs a nuclear option for this one. Your an idiot he'll be confirmed 1 day.
grammar, bro.
When will they learn the difference between your and you're? I mean, it's 3rd grade knowledge.
Why thanks, for that little irrelevant assistance.  But any help; helps
"Irrelevant" lol. Willful ignorance.
You may understand words but willful would indicate I knew I made the mistake.
And your network will continue to kiss up to his party.
Cory booker is another political hack w an ego almost as big as Obama.
First the nuc option for SC justices, now this.  You progs keep setting precedents and giving us new tools. Thanks!
jerk
Obama-lite trying to build himself up. He can try, but he can't escape his failure in Newark.
He's a racists.
African Am Wm Smith testified 4 Sessions known him 4 20 years not a racist bone in his body!
how's that Harry Reid historic decision working for ya'll now? Winning. 
Except he will still be confirmed.
It is so obvious U do not have best interest at heart, only yourself, like so many of your colleagues! SAD
Booker is being groomed for possible POTUS run, which is why he pulled this stunt. He's a Dem political hack.
Thank you, @CoryBooker. The time has long since passed for passive aggressive Democratic response to proposed tyranny.
You benefitted from leftist "tyranny" for 8yrs.The time has long passed for your ilk to be marginalized
i wonder if Cory is being completely honest too
CORY BOOKER IS AN OLD SOROS HACK JUST CARRYING THE MAIL... ANOTHER GLOBALIST  https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/press-releases/osi-baltimore-tops-10-million-20-million-fundraising- …
Mr. Booker, your actions, should you take them, will be reprehensible.  #NoHonor
bc @CoryBooker wants to run for President in 2020 & Trump asked Black D's what do you have to lose after 30-50 D rule @MSNBC
@FoxNews Drain the Swamp of this 
@FuTheChef @CoryBooker @MSNBC Wouldn't that be hypocrisy. He's slready lavished praise on Sen Sessions.
Yeah, he'll be remembered for his insane hypocrisy and lack of honor and decency.
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @MSNBC Sessions isnt a racist! 1987 testimony was a lie! Check the transcript! Guy lied about him
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @MSNBC bc he's a leftist pawn who will say how high when they say jump disgraceful
let's hope Senator Sessions is ready and destroys Booker's 2020 run like Christie did to Rubio on debate stage !

Cause he's a liar and a fucking fraud. Or more simply aDemocrat.
Cory booker is a sore "looser" who is just trying to waste people's time bcuz he HATES Trump!
no need. We all know it's for grandstanding and because he's not over election.
Just Another Liberal Loser like His Cohorts. He's Going No Where. Regurgitation of Same Ole Democratic BS  Retoric.
It it because he's a Clown and needs attention?
Isn't he the same guy who was praising Sessions last year during a civil rights ceremony they worked on together?
Interesting. Getting rid of the census? You need to also STOP discrimination against VACCINE INJURED. #CDCfraud
Yea.
he will never make history! 60 million people will never believe him! He praised sessions one day now trashing!Fool
Tool Cory Booker honored to have served with Sessions. All about 2020 phony.
You cannot see it in the picture but #GeorgeSoros has a gun stuck in #Bookers back.Pretty good reason
I would not attend a public flogging so I'll pass on watching #CoreyBooker make a fool of himself. No Honor.
@NewEra17Michael @chrislhayes @CoryBooker hahah. Love this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9WtYFdnc4A …
he bombed ..everyone now sees him as a turncoat and a liar ..used because Hillary lost. but he let it happen
let's see, could it be $$$$$$$$$?
Because he needs the attention. #wasteofspace #uselesstool #buttlickerchrishayes
Is he bringing his friend T-bone for support? #PoliticsOverDecency
he just  wants to run in 2020
Chris please go back under your rock - you have not learned a thing from the election
Never gonna happen.  Watch the hearing.  Sessions is very smart.  Smarter than you. Smarter than @CoryBooker. #Maga
nobody cares about Cory wanting to get attention. They don't need his vote. Thanks Dems for changing that law 
Bravo 
..he is trying to stay relevant and employed as most Dems are at this point. He is useful idiot.. #ConfirmSessions
Cory, Al Sharpton, Booker - thinks
he will elevate himself by pulling this stunt BUT IT WILL BITE
HIM IN THE A33
Cory Booker Praises Jeff Sessions For Civil Rights Work [VIDEO] http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/10/flashback-cory-booker-praises-jeff-sessions-for-civil-rights-work-video/ … #Sessions #AttorneyGeneral
becuz he has no future & wants his 15 mins of "fame"
praised @jeffsessions for civil rights 6 months ago, now he's got grave concern. Wish my state's Sen. could decide.
STOP POLITICIZING EVERY MATTER.  RUN FOR PRES IN 4 YEARS, DON'T PLAY THE RACE CARD.  AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF IT
.@chrislhayes @CoryBooker His imaginary friend T-bone told him to do it. Dude's a loon. #CreepyCoryBooker
losers do what losers do. @CoryBooker is a loser who's actions will contradict prior comments he's made about Sessions. @MSNBC
https://www.youtube.com/embed/chkAASced_0 …
Why is it making history to act as a political opportunist? That's not even news, let alone history.
because he's wanting to stay longer in politics and knows the DNC is decimated. This is a ploy
medical marijuana???
@kjohansson1920 @CoryBooker @MSNBC Judah's made history also
Make history.  He won't be the first well qualified black to make an utter fool of himself.
Did his imaginary friend tell him to do it? @chrislhayes @CoryBooker #tbone
Because Democrats are the scum of the Earth.
Because I plan to run in 2020

Politics?

https://youtu.be/chkAASced_0 
The truth!!
because Eric Holder was a shining example of fair and balanced judgement. Where was everyone when he was AG?
will testify against his colleague bc he has values & respects rule of law? He does this precedent is set.
@amazinmikey @CoryBooker @MSNBC Local news @abc @CBSNews @NBCNews @FoxNews spenfs under 5 seconds on this. #msn complicit
Agreed. Amazing how they just "gloss over" items that are extremely IMPORTANT
I have been more aware of the absolute fluffy sticky cotton candy we get fed everyday
good way to put it
Looks good. Smells yummy. Terrible for every part of your body. Causes Mind Cavities.
Did you ask him whatever happened to his promise to make Newark's poor neighborhoods safe?
Chuck Schumer cheated poor blacks where's you outrage
@cheryl319 The left always pulls race card so if going back 30yrs I think Schumer needs 2 explain this. https://spectator.org/47532_race-top/ 
How does it feel to be the master enabler of #CoreyBooker's excellent masturbation fantasies? #Sessions
Who is this guy Cory?
booker just wants his 15 minutes of fame
#ConfirmSessions 
@realDonaldTrump WON AMERICA WON!
is a fraud. Ask him where he was brought up? How he ran Newark? The question is Is he a racist?
Slandering @JeffSessions with hearsay is unethical & very, very disappointing. I used to respect you, Cory
Cory is a  a Black racist!
suck it up snowflake you lost get over it u r no longer in control as Obama told the Reps have a seat in the back
Black Pastors rally FOR Jeff Sessions. #ConfirmSessions #MAGA
Radical Left Wing Kook = Cory Booker
He imagines his "blistering interrogation" will create political capital. That's all he cares about.
you both are big dopes! 
Fighting the wrong battle. Try getting minorities jobs you stooge! You've done zero
You liberals never learn
Because he can't get enough of that borking?
https://twitter.com/randyebarnett/status/818680894177296384 …
.@chrislhayes @CoryBooker @MSNBC It's because he hates black pastors & wants to stay politically relevant. Sessions is right 4 the job
did he make history when he worked with and praised Sessions?
@joannesmoot @CoryBooker @MSNBC easy. 2020
To testify implies that he has some personal knowledge. He's going to give a speech to further his liberal cred.
I also would like to know why
it's because he's a bit of an ass and wants to run for President
go Corey we are with you tell truth to power!!
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @MSNBC This is the epitome of racism.  Booker is targeting Sessions because he is white!




How many racists in picture? Sen. Cory Booker and Jeff Sessions at Congressional Medal of Honor ceremony
.@chrislhayes We'll, well... let's hear what race baiter .@CoryBooker has against Jeff Sessions. #SessionsForAttorneyGeneral
Corey has been a great disappointment to all who knew him when he was a smart Independent politician
Cory, we are going to have a REGISTRY. Get over it. You can't stop it.
Cory should know by now, elections have consequences. They're going to get beat again in '20
And Forever After..If we Raise our kids right....
Yep. We need to break the Left's stranglehold on education.
Absolutely  and Totally.
