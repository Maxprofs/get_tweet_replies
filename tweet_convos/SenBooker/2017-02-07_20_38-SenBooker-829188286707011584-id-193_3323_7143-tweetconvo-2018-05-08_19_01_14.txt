Sen. @CoryBooker quotes Dr. King: "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter." #StopSessions
.@CoryBooker is reading from @repjohnlewis' testimony against Sessions. Here's the written statement: http://bit.ly/2k10bOC  #StopSessions
Thank you, Sen. @CoryBooker, for recognizing that the real issue isn't voter fraud. It's voter suppression. #StopSessions #RestoreTheVRA
.@CoryBooker: I will not be silent on this issue. I am here, we are here, because people fought to stop violations of voting. #StopSessions
Sen. @CoryBooker: Senator Sessions has criticized consent decrees, calling them an "end-run around the democratic process." #StopSessions
.@CoryBooker is right: Lawmakers from both sides came together to work on sentencing reform. Jeff Sessions derailed it. #StopSessions
Civil Rights: Hate Group like BLM# Its so obvious! Get a real job!

#FreedomofSpeech
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @SenWarren Corrupt GOP were appalling trying to SILENCE  Coretta King! #HappyBlackHistoryMonth

WE, The People are aggrieved by the loss of Democracy by Republicans their epic corruption and lies
I am aggrieved over the last 8 years of foreign relations...
: So am I Senator Booker! This is what happens when crooks run the country!
your on the wrong track socialist are not what American people want
thank you and now I just wish you could sever your pharma ties.
your right its her truth which = pile of crap lie. But its become obvious that your party is in dark.
@itisdemocracy @CoryBooker @SenWarren Hate nut racist
@EliseErosenb827 @CoryBooker @SenWarren Rep party been playing dirty thru Obama's time& now.Its cleat racism exists w/them
What political theater. Your right,SenWarren has right to 'her' truth just not non-truth against fellow Senator
Obnoxious! Rude! Disrespectful! Impugned fellow Senator-Rule 19. Founding Fathers demanded 'class'-she failed!
Warren FUND RAISING. PRETENDING she was censured for reading 'a letter'-lying again-was the Ted Kennedy quote
of course you did
@JoyAnnReid @CoryBooker @SenWarren McConnell has shown his true bigotry! Birthism, 8 yrs obstructing Obama! Now this!
of all the racists in the senate McConnellI I wld luv to see gone.He's horrible
The Senate would be a whole lot better without McConnell. His day is coming. Nothing lasts forever. God gives us both good & bad!
What happened with Warren will happen again.. Please help us search and choose a new DNC Chair!
@smidge001 #LetLizSpeak
WHY is it so hard for you guys to follow the rules and law? We have to, so do you!
Would u stop quoting that? were soo sick of it honestly!
@JoyAnnReid @CoryBooker @SenWarren booker also voted to protect big pharma
aka I want to be BHO in 2020.
Cory she knew the rules ,she didnt follow them
Sounding more and more like a loser?!?!?!
thank you Mr. BOOKER for standing up for decency #letlizspeak
As if no senator spoke against Senator Clinton on Jan 21, 2009.
the Senator is a righteous man. Whatever path he is destined for...I'm sure dems will follow him.
@bryanbehar @CoryBooker @SenWarren tell me about the award jeff sessions received in 2009 from NAACP
rule of law ! Do you all know the rules set forth? Yes you do nothing but continued race baiting
speak out and make NJ proud !
Wish you could stop him but you don't have enough votes.
@luvman33wife @CoryBooker @SenWarren #StopPresidentBannon
If @LindseyGrahamSC had a spine he'd correct the #CongressionalRecord by putting in Mrs King's words
it's pathetic and Senate Majority Leader is not fit for the Senate.  Remove him!
She should have passed her letter on to every DEM that spoke after her. #LetLizSpeak
Sessions is a freeking JERK, We must hold him #Accountable
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!!!!!!
#LETLIZSPEAK
congress needs to KNOW they are there. To be the voice of the American people not their own ageda!!
thank you Senator Booker For your strength and Courage backing and supporting Senator  Warren.
Senators: Please keep reading Coretta Scott King's letter on Jeff Sessions. Force McConnell's hand.
If the words of icon C.S.king are not allowed on Sen. floor what hope is there for the masses? 
#stopsessions
Impending doom for freedom thanks to http://Trump.You ,Corey Booker shine a light in the doom!!
tell us wht to do as citizens
so your upset how one senator treated another? Really. Glass House Corey. Also how is T Bone
Republicans don't even have respect for the late Mrs Coretta Scott King. Mitch is a dishonorable nut
@JoyAnnReid @CoryBooker @SenWarren GOP walk in locstep on their core issues lke Vtr suppression Dems don't agree #outofpower
@JoyAnnReid @CoryBooker @SenWarren Prob is GOP agrees with Sessions GOP r architects of vtr suppress strtgy They don't care
: Got no truck w/Sessions. He should be confirmed. EW needs to tread lightly w/due respect.
This is my Senator-so proud of him as my Representative and as a role model for those of every age.
you are in trouble once Sessions investigates you.  I will enjoy watching your demise.
@simpsonrob39 @CoryBooker @SenWarren Term limits for legislators. 2 term max and restricted funds for 2nd reelection effort
I give you a standing ovation. No one could have spoken better than u did now will the R's litsen?
Every Senator who is a democrat should stand up and read the CSK letter.
stay strong Cory!  Freedom and justice are worth fighting for especially in the face of repression!
she was mansplained, nevetheless, she persisted...
The country is sorely aggrieved by the actions of McConnell and Daines!
what a disappointment you are you'll turn on anybody for your own selfish reasons
should have vetted your sorry-ass Booker seen all this BS cuz you have plans to run for president
Dangerous Times. Must NOT lose Freedom of Speech. Flash Protest for: MrsKing, SenWarren & Freedom!
what a supreme liar,faker of emotions&empathy.
#LetLizSpeak  Thank you Cory.  There should be pubic readings of the letter.
The Liberals in Washington are a destructive cancer to our democracy.  Warren was wrong!
Keep up the good fight and know we stand with you.

I feel a march coming on!!!
#holdthefloor 
we are standing with you all! 
#sisepuede
Mr. "Never met a pharma ceo he didn't like" Booker needs to sit down in shame. He is a problem.
Senate Reps have sold their souls. When the trump admin implodes, hopefully they go down w it.

Black Pastors Rally in Support for Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions. God Bless these Godly Men speaking out!
#CorettaScottKing #Warren 
Don't share the truth. Then the libs will know the truth. They don't like that.
is a threat to the Freedom of We The People #RepealCoryBooker an appointed irrelevant Obama Lap Dog
thank you senators. Speak loudly for us all
impeach mitch
read the letter #resist
, keep standing up for  the rights of all people - old, current and future Americans
But only the ones who agree w her. The rest of us don't deserve rights.
So you have no problem w/ Coretta King meeting with an ACTUAL KLAN MEMBER, but Sessions is racist?
The should put in silence 
People like  kellyanne conway for saying lies,not @SenWarren for speaking the truth.
Warren is a big liar. Admitted she lied abt being part Indian so she could benefit financially.
is that @KeeganMKey  ?

whhhaaaaaaa
It should have stopped before the letters were read. What I heard was a disgrace to the Cherokees!
Why disgrace to Cherokee?
Well I'm Cherokee (on the rolls), and I thought she said she was Cherokee!
Oh she said it. It just wasn't true. She lied to get approved for $$
Are you also aggrieved that Warren was breaking the rules?
I know Dems are suppose to play all nice and stuff, but all that kindness crap went out the window
The GOP - silencing women.   That isn't how it works.  The backlash will be a tsunami..count on it.
The Republicans never acted this childish when Obummer had the reins and fucked the whole country up
you give me hope and reason to keep on keeping on
Thank you Senator Booker!

Weak is our gov't that did this 2 a FEMALE. They would NEVER have done this 2 a MALE colleague #SHAME
get over it Cory ! I am so sick of this pussy foot crying by the democrats!
Sen. Warren is great, but Sen. Booker is the stronger Dem candidate in the next election
Corey is another Obama & wants America a 3rd Country. Warren wants socialism & her as a dictatorship
good job Corey Mitch McConnell will get his in the long run
U need Vetting. You are part of the Dem Party, holding up the Presidents cabinet to harm our Country.
It seems that the purpose of this Cabinet is to harm our country.
@SenateGOP  silenced 2 women but desecrated the memory & work of Coretta Scott King during BlackHistory month #SODEPLORABLE
keep speaking out your voices will be heard
Hey Cory : Learn the Senate rules before you speak . Democrats are the minority party now . Sweet.
#Democrates Good, so sick of the #liberals and their rights ... you had 8 years, you lost get over it

#PocahontasWarren is a loon! @CoryBooker kisses BIG DRUG companies butts! #LetLizSpeak in solitary confinement

Ohhhh "Boo f'n hoo"
