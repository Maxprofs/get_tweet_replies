This is so sweet.  Congrats on starting to do that when you could have just voted to do it.  You make me want to vomit.
you are pitiable to think a relatively small amount of money for you is more important than helping millions of sick people.
IS THE BILL READY? We are still waiting 
are you aware US #BigPharma raises prices skyhigh in our country to offset price limits in other countries? @SenBookerOffice
oh yeah? or will you just say that and keep taking money from the pharmaceutical companies you sellout. We dont want you in 2020

Booker has received more pharmaceutical manufacturing cash over the past six years than any other Democratic senator https://interc.pt/2ilPhCe 
Watch out. Progressives will do more harm to you than Trump supporters.
you lost your progressive creds. In the pocket of big Pharma, just another political hack.
ALL LIES! You Took $547,000 from Big Pharma- He is their Bidder! #GTFOH @SenBookerOffice  Even @tedcruz stood w/ @SenSanders
Mr. Booker, you've received enough $$ from Big Pharma to have already paid an army to "start to do that."
Sellout
Sounds rather like HRC's "I'll look into it..." LOL #politiciananswers
@SenBookerOffice Stop #suckingup to #corrupt #BigPharma #profiteers > #WeThePeople

Your vote against the amendment shows whose side you are on. Your next election can't come soon enough.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI can someone explain why @CoryBooker voted no to Rx bill this week but then posts this tweet?!? I'm confused.
CALL your Reps, Senators. Tell them: US has no business colluding w extremists, stand w NATO, respect our allies' sovereignty...
We are alarmed by what Trump is doing today!!! Will u look into this?! P.S. Good job w/ the hearings!!
After further research you have taken numerous donations from Pharmaceutical Corp. That explains why you voted against it...SMDH
You had an amazing opportunity to help everyday Americans, and you didn't. FORGET a 2020 run. Forget it.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI is the BILL READY?
Lame deflect excuse. Canada has stronger regulations than we do and the majority of those drugs are made here. #SELLOUT!!
Corey do you think we are stupid? You voted against Sen. Sanders Amendment regarding importing prescription drugs from Canada.
this was a really disappointing vote on a bi-partisan  bill,  especially after your courage testifying against Sessions.
That was pure PR. Booker has no moral compass.
Yep, Booker is an absolute FRAUD.
u r in the pocket of big pharma, nobody is fooled by your bullshit talk. u could have helped millions, but u vote no, shame on u
What is the ECD for your alternate import plan?  The numbers look suspect.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI when can we expect another vote on this bill?
bullshit. @MartinHeinrich

Return BigPharma donations and work for citizens. Just a suggestion.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI Bernie Sanders is the leader of your party. You should have followed his lead.
lowlife, but now every one see it! #sellout
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig&sns=em …
Just get the government out of the market. Yes, some will die, but none of us are gonna live forever. Gubment causes inflation.
@SenBookerOffice @QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI not buying it like you were bought.
starting to take steps means we shouldn't expect anything. from you.
When exactly do you plan on working for the people and not big Pharma? Yeah, we know about your vote.
You and the other 12 corporate democrats are done! Your corrupt treachery will not be forgotten.
Must b nice for people who make 7x what middle class makes and wk 1/3 year to not worry about how they will pay for their meds.
is buying time, folks. $250k+ pharma campaign contributions 2010-16 @QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI
@SenBookerOffice @QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI  bull! You are in bed with the Pharmaceutical Industry! Corporatist Shill!!
why did you vote down prescription drugs from Canada.
If you plan to lower drug costs, why take $ from big pharma? Conflict of interest, no?
.@CoryBooker - Sell out. No 2020 for you. My mom needs lower med costs. We see you. #indivisible @Indivisible_CA
@SenBookerOffice I read you voted against a bill that would lower pharmaceutical costs?
Big Pharma called, they said your check is ready.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI why don't you help your constituents instead of big pharma. . Shame on you
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI if I had a penny for every legislator that was starting to. . . But never did

It's hard to believe that this is a priority for you when you are taking $ from #BigPharma. #QuidProQuo? We need low prices now.
With one vote, you just ended any chance that you will ever be president.
What was wrong with Bernie's bill?
We're not convinced - you'll need to do better than this tweet. Over $250K pharma contributions have twisted you.
the idea this is quality control issue is simply false. Generics are manufactured around the world and we manage to inspect them
How can you be taken seriously on this issue after yesterday's vote? Be a Dem. or switch sides.
I was ready to support you for the Democratic nomination in 2020 until this vote. Now I will support whoever can defeat you.
what did he vote for? I missed it. Was becoming a big Booker supporter
He voted against the amendment to allow people to bu drugs from Canada.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI Yes yes Absolutely you are Workin It
..Safety, which I find concerning, most of these drugs are made by the same group, stand up to Pharma, stand with your people!..
You are a huge letdown. People believed you have the courage to stand up to Big Pharma. You claim you fear imported drugs pose..
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI side. Dems r not above being criticized, can't believe u did this! https://www.google.com/amp/m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5877edd4e4b0b3c7a7b05c29/amp?client=safari … 6/

@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI that gives $$ to politicians always makes them work for the wrong ppl! U r a PUBLIC servant 3/
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI but when u & other Dems go against our best interests u prove yet again that BIG whatever 2/
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI Look, u r the main reason we need to get big $ out of govt. U seem to come from a good place 1/
You had 267,338 reasons to vote against this amendment. You're becoming like Sharpe, Senator. Shame on you. #Bernie2020
proudly voted for you in '13 and '14. Never again.
cuz were always hearing about Canadians dying from their prescriptions! You are a hack and a fraud. Progressives aren't fooled.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI start by rejecting big pharma money and introduce legislation that benefits its citizens.
You took payoff $ from drug companies to vote the prescription bill down..tell the truth!!
Show a bill that meets Bernie's standards not your big Pharma donors;
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI If it is important to you, you will find a way.  If not, you'll find an excuse. Just starting?
Senator, you are an embarrassment to progressives. You seem to only vote progressive when your owners allow you.
Yeah. Do get back to us once you, Bennet, Casey & Murray get a green light from your #BigPharma masters.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI Mr. Booker, come on.  We are not that gullible, we know medical drugs used in Canada are safe.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI How is it other countries get cheaper pharmaceuticals than we do?
what other steps? You betrayed us
baloney. you had your chance here and you went against the people and for Big Pharma, both you and Menendez.
Do you really think people will believe your nonsense? You took  $442,678 from pharmaceuticals industry?
You all are at best thieves and possibly murderers... selling out people's health for political gain.
Excuse me if I find you justification for voting AGAINST lowering drug prices "ridiculous" you're a sellout!
Difficult to take you seriously when you take major $$ from big pharma. You seriously believe that Canada doesn't have standards re drugs?
Starting? You've been in office how long?
I get my EpiPen from Canada I wouldn't be able to afford it.  Get real, Booker. You just joined the opposition.
We won't ever forget this.  You will never run for President now.  So disappointed in my party now.
This is why Dems are trash now. Time to move on to a new party. Republicans and Democrats represent corporations, not people.
you blew it - should have voted with Sanders to lower drugs costs for Americans.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI https://twitter.com/danscavino/status/818886391648161796 … phony
"I feel blessed & honored to have partnered w/ Senator Sessions in being the senate sponsors in this important award."
Senator Cory Booker 
Primary this #fakeprogressive!
You and your team aren't gonna work on anything. You're a FRAUD and we all know it.
extremely disappointed in your vote! I guess you stand with big pharma.
you're a huge disappointment. to think we thought you were the future of dems. payback is a bitch. such a drag; i really liked you.
yeah, you "start" that process now on this new problem. WTF have you been doing besides fundraising? Seriously?
just ask a nurse what patients do!
let the Dr do that. I have become that Person who get RX from Mexico. Same package!
FRAUD! LYING SACK!
@SenBookerOffice what a hypocrite you are. I think you just blew your 2020 pres bid
Please. Don't let big pharma buy our government.
Glad to hear:)
Except you've made over $260,000 from big pharma & voted against Bernie's plan for cheaper drug costs. Damn I really liked you.
I
@SenBookerOffice We are watching and will remember you votes against working people. It is time to stand up and fight back.
@SenBookerOffice you're never going to get prescription costs lowered. Do you think the standard of the FDA are above reproach?
If you can't get on the right side of this, you are done. We had a chance for a win while ACA was being repealed. You killed it.
Yeah, right!
Youll never get my vote if you run for Natl office. I wont forget. I hope the 267,000 was worth it
@SenBookerOffice Cory booker blocked bernies bill for lowering drug costs because pharma is a top contributor to his campaign.
Was your real problem that you weren't one of the bills sponsors?
@SenBookerOffice Bye Bye Booker #OurRevolution
We're done with this kind of Wall Street Dem. two-faced Clintonian "progressivism"... We're not going to accept it. #NeverCory #NeverBooker
Its too late. You can't accept money from Big Pharma, vote against a chance to achieve key Dem goals, then pretend to support it "generally"
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI shame on you for voting with the Repugs
Hope you won't go knee-jerk on pharma price control. Distorts mkt & fails in end. Reform gov't intell. propty giveaways instead.
bullshit vote him out
Senator Sanders would not have introduced the bill if safety was an issue.  The rejection of the bill is disgusting!!
Sen.  Booker, the excuse for rejecting the bill (safety) is the same excuse big pharma uses!  You have $$$$ ties to pharm?!
I have admired your career - until now. The donations combined with this vote don't sit well. Why would saftey import regs fail?
Like what? Ensuring dat pharma will make obscene profits first? I hope d American ppl see u for what U are: A sell-out for money
.@CoryBooker
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI So... you tank someone else's amendment, so you can try to pass one your donors like?
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI Yeah sure. Just don't piss off ur big pharma donors
Impressed with your humanity and engagement as a Tweeter continuing as a US Senator.
Your team? 
Is that the pharma team, insurance team, or 
sugar plums wrapped in $$ bills $$ dancing somewhere far off in the distance?
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI bad politics and bad for real life people. Genius.
@SenBookerOffice No, Booker.  You don't get to act like the good guy anymore.  You're just another merchant of death like GOP.
http://theslot.jezebel.com/for-some-reason-cory-booker-and-12-other-dems-killed-a-1791116094 …
Liar.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI It's costs $1 for 1 month of colchicine elsewhere. It's cost $1000 in USA. Why? #PoliticalHacks
Sir, based upon recent events, I have no confidence in you or your promises.
Sorry but your vote shows it all. Won't ever believe a word you say. Bernie Sanders works to improve the lives of all Americans!
http://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/01/12/big-pharma-backed-dems-join-gop-block-sanders-effort-end-drug-price-gouging …
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI U need to work for easing the sick's cost. Taking note 2/
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI Why were u against Bernie's amendment? Looks unethical on u who received +1/4M frm big pharma 1/
Big Pharma runs our cou try :( Along with Monsanto & the FDA. Take them down, Cory!
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI What steps are those?
First Charter schools, now Big Pharma. Your true colors are bleeding through....
I'm SOOOOO happy u mention the connection betw charter school scams and big pharma scams. He's a snake
does your team also take hundreds of thousands of dollars from Pharmaceutical companies like you do?
Face it, you're bought.
Don't expect working class Americans to support you after this vile and disingenuous act. I hope your patrons are happy.
Too late for promises now. We see. #NeverBooker
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI yeah right
@SenBookerOffice Appalled you opposed bill lowering drug costs
bullshit your a liar. you got more money from the drug companies than all of my freinds will make in there whole life's combined
we need votes, not vague 'steps we are taking' that will result in NOTHING
Please explain what was wrong with the bill and how you'll fix it in order to settle everyone down.
nice vote. either fight for the middle class or get out. we'll remember this betrayal.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI Corporate sellout. Why don't you just go and join the Republican Party? They'd love to have you.
what are these steps? You care more than repubs but not that's  saying much. We need help here! Not a  corporate stooge!
well with your vote you have killed people who can not afford their medication; Not Good Cory
If you don't get that passed by 2018 I wouldn't recommend you run in 2020. Shouldn't be a problem since enough Repubs voted yes.
stop taking pharma money and get that bill passed. Then maybe we can start to believe you.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI I'm saving this tweet. Let's see how long it takes you and your team to actually do something.
just tell the american people you sold them out because u get a lot of money from big phrama.They will appreciate your honesty
You would rather let @realDonaldTrump take credit for pushing this thru rather than @SenSanders. Transparent..
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI Yes because you need to be squeaky clean and on the ballot in 2020! #makeithappen #lowermedscost
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI why did you vote against cheaper drug prices why Cory now I look at you differently
I'm appalled you did not vote with Sanders to lower Rx costs. You don't need your own deal. But we needed @SenSanders deal.
Move ahead then on prescription drug cost issues, but refuse to to take pharmaceutical company contributions too.
We will be holding you to this
That 12 hours in which I reassessed my opinion of you now seems like a total waste. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice...
it was definitely whiplash.  Heard Sessions testimony thought maybe not so bad. Woke up to news.
before or after you pocket all that #BigPharma coin, Mr. Booker? #healthcare
In my 30s, have MS & the injections needed to slow it & me to stay active for many more years are 3K/mo even w/ insurance. Help.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI well according to reports, YOU are in Big Pharma's pocket... so we won't hold our breath
that vote from you was disappointing. You have to decide if you are with the people or in with the corporations.
he already did decide
Yes, because your team is definitely more capable of garnering the public support needed to make this happen than @BernieSanders
What team? The other Dem money grabbers that voted no?
This was a stupid vote that will haunt you. Not the time for that.
How many people did you hurt with your vote? Come on!
I'm from Passaic County & disappointed in how you voted. I'd like to see those steps asap. Meds need to be affordable.
@QuintusHaterius @LaurenLovesWI as one of your constituents, this is a terrible betrayal. Just when we need Dems unified
Does this mean you think the majority of your Democratic colleagues voted in favor of a bill that would harm consumers?
NO it means they weren't bought by big pharm!
