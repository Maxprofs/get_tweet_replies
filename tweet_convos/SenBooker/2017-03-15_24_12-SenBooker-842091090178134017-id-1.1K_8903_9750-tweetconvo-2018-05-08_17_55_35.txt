Dear Cory.... this is exactly the reason you will ALWAYS get my vote and the votes of most of the people I know... due to your compassion for animals. And many of us voted for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  You will have our vote, Cory...
All due respect, Senator, but this is a distraction to confuse and confound.
If we stop these abominations at the source, we're done.
How can they be so mean & hateful to people & animals? Absolutely heartless & if they only had brains!  GET RID OF THEM ALL!
The GOP comes only to Kill, Steal, & Destoy
Sick Evil People
SOMEONE IS GETTING PAID LOTS OF MONEY TO AGREE TO THIS!! IT STINKS! & THESE VULNERABLE CREATURES THAT HAVE EVER RIGHT TO LIVE HAVE NO VOICE?
GOP voting for killing folk deemed financially unable to meet investors cost overrides for healthcare. Externalizing costs or extermination?
Inconceivable!!!
We have to put a stop to this #whateveritakes
We got to do what we have to do to save these animals- #whateverittakes
I can't believe this passed through the Senate.So sad that they are willing to kill these animals & in such an inhumane way
If you haven't seen this, please take a moment to do so. The GOP wants to allow inhumane killing of animals. #VoicesPeople
What is with the GOP? Gleeful over throwing millions off health coverage, eager to kill defenseless animals..
God! It's a constant battle! Why the fuck are they doing this?
I think this is criminal and, we must hold the entire Republican party accountable for t h e destruction of the planet.
@jonnybernthal this falls right in line with letting mentally ill people buy GUNS!
#stupid
. What is wrong with you @realDonaldTrump? How many more enemies do you want to make? People love animals more than people!
@LeoDiCaprio help us and the animals leo........
Thank you so much for speaking out on this issue.
@DaveyJonsen57 I hope we start hearing about more twattwaffles being mauled by wolves and bears. I'm rooting 4 the animals
@LeslieMarshall should let the wolves and bears roam free in Central Park? If you don't live near Predators, shut up
although the terrible news happened, which we hoped to avoid, i want to say #thankyou for standing up for what's right.
@realDonaldTrump please Veto #SJRES18
#SJRES18 please Veto!

@now7grandkids Trump/GPO willing to deny poor people food. I'm sure they relish in killing defenseless animals.
I'm not american, but this is unaccetable!

Thank you for opposing SJR 18. @MarkWarner @timkaine Please vote #NoonSJR18!

@JamieOGrady When humans think their lives matter more than that of animals, humans lose their humanity! This is sick evil!

this GOP Congress is unBEARable!
@antonio5591 @gop is destroying everything.
What is the possible reasonable explanation for this?There cannot be any explanation other than pure evil!
@SwampchickNorth They have evidence bears n wolves R #democrats? Oopsy, #evidence? Never mind they're #republicans #resist
This is WRONG in so many ways!!! 
There is no reason for this killing! Only a sick person would come up with this.
Very!
@LindaLawrey U are a sell  out to corporations
@JaredLeto no one should be killing like a bitch. That pisses me off. I pray they are STOPPED 
calling and tweet's. I feel like it's all hopeless!
This is bad! all the other BS is a smoke screen for this! Our values for everything is being obliterated! Do something!
Thank you Senator Booker for speaking up & being the voice for the voiceless.
How about doing something about this big pile of orange puke Know other issue is a problem But soon they will be killing us
omg thats sick.... why do people want to do that?
Let's show the starving carnivores, decimated by disease and hunger. And educate ppl .
Not one Ranger in this thread?
It's outrageous, cruel, and simply inhuman. Who would DO such a thing? Just vile.
Smother them in their sleep. All Ethics was so - yesterday.

I did not object because I was not a bear, nor wolf...
Wake up, these are the same people who want to take food,heat and healthcare! You think they care!
Can we do the same to the @GOP ?

Pleeeeease?
why?
@ProgressiveXX cory... You take CORPORATE money, you are corrupt!! Bernie would mop the floor with you in a 2020 primary
@CoryBooker Wait, is this real? This sounds like a joke. They can't be serious... Right? 
@sactolawyer Booker for President!
@DearAuntCrabby This is insane... STOP!!!
.@SenBookerOffice @expatina @lorax58 R "great white hunters" thatbored or r their ammo caches overflowing? Safari Tours hurtin' for biz?
@TeresaBerkowitz 

@GOP the Pro Life Party 
.@SenBookerOffice @GOP shld stop being hypocrites & show they care for lives of baby animals as much as they claim to care for unborn babies
@CoryBooker that is wrong. now if i could only trust your telling the truth
@gop is the party of death. They never miss a chance to do harm.
The @GOP are demon spawns, out to destroy the environment and everything else.
reblogged!
@JonathanRKnight   I know you would care. 
@RepMcGovern @SenMarkey @SenWarren @RepKClark @RepRichardNeal @RepStephenLynch MUCH TY 4speaking up 4animals/elders/poor!
GOP- anti abortion but no compassion for hungry children, starving elderly, or defenseless animals.  SMH.
@The_Borg_Queen_ CORY...I'm in NJ and animal rights activist I heard this Zim sick What can I do? Do we have a petition?
You can also donate to organizations like the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife.
thank you for bringing awareness to SJR18. I know I can count on @KamalaHarris and @SenFeinstein!
Thank you for speaking up against this incredibly cruel and inhumane law. We ALL need to keep pushing and resisting!
you have mine!!!!  Thank you Senator Booker for standing up for what is right.  NO to SJ 18!!!
Thank you for your voice ! It is greatly appreciated !
this is terrible!
this does not even deserve discussion. Since when is wildlife more important than human life? Abortion is murder!



@ChelseaClinton @benshapiro Democrats allow people to kill BABIES living in their dens.THAT IS WRONG. feel free to speak up
So Don Jr and Eric can kill more animals.
Every @Repub Needs 2 B PurgedOut OfAll Local City,County,State,Fed.Political Positions Until They Care Abt People Not Money
-Thank you for your strong voice for animals!
Can you back NJ Reps in the House in starting impeachment processes for the ENTIRE administration? We have 'em 6 ways...
It's cruel and heartless! We're the animals voices! We must stand up for them. There is absolutely no reason for this bill.
Why would one want to kill hibernating bears? Who are these #BadHombres?
I'm a Ted Cruz person, but have always admired your animal welfare advocacy. The GOP is poor in this area for sure.
I'm very aware of this bill and disgusted by it. I've signed petitions, tweeted, posted, etc. What else can I do? Please...
"The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated." ~Mahatma Gandhi
Thanks Cory. I would support you for POTUS. Admire your actions and passion.
What can I do @SenBookerOffice ? No need to call my senators, u & @SenatorMenendez r my senators! I've signed petition (?)
I have contacted my Colorado senators. These keystone predators vital to a healthy ecosystem and also cruel to animals
Just horrible!!! 
@PayDownTheDebt Don't forget poor people too
I bet you will be going after PETA tomorrow.
They kill more than 80% of their shelter animals.
OH, COME ON! WILL THEY STOP AT NOTHING?
this is shameful. What kind of people would even consider passing this through? Remember those names of those who vote yes.
What in the hell is wrong with these people?
@DaShanneStokes Damn! I haven't heard this. I can not f***ing handle this. I can't.
.@SenBookerOffice What the Hell's going on!
@GOP's trying 2 kill our animals/environment, poison/starve our poorest ppl & steal our economy.
How disgusting and WRONG!  Leave the animals alone!!!! 
who initiated this and what was their argument to do so?
Another atrocity. You'd think they're just trying to wear us down, but love has no limits. Man the phones, we have a voice.
All I can picture the Trump boys in camo gear hunting. Hope if someone goes to set a trap, the bear will get them first.
@Anomaly100 And they are supporting forced motherhood and poison apple pie.
WTF is "forced motherhood?"
I'll call tmrw. I'll also speak up for Big Bird, Wheels on Meals & everything else that is right & just in this world. 
@Pluralgnorance  Follow the cattle/cash. Wolves hold no value to a rancher. GOP likes Property/profits over people/animals
how can we stop all this insanity? I think of the animals alone, and it's too much... #AnimalCruelty
I hope the bears and wolves set them up and attack them instead!
If they can't starve it, kill with no health care...now add killing animals to the list.  Satan's workers.
I hate these assholes.
How about a little outrage and advocacy for a #MedicareForAll plan so we don't kill our older poor, folks who need care.
I am speaking up, but you are in washington,Impeach that raving lunatic.PLEASE!
WTF???
You stand tall Cory for those that have no voice. We hear you! #NonhumanRights #ImpeachTrump Don Jr kills ELEPHANTS
It's very wrong, please stop them! Do they not have even a shred of decency or respect for living beings?
Wish you had gotten this worked up over the affordable pharmaceutical bill you killed with your Republican buddies.
TY Sen Booker 4 speaking out. UR so right how crucial 4 ppl against such animal cruelty H.J.Res69 proposes 2 speak out 2!
@jonnybernthal This won't make up 4 the way u voted on @BernieSanders RX plan @SenBookerOffice. NJ resident who'll remember
@katekersten 

@SenBookerOffice & @ChrisMurphyCT for president I don't care who is on the top of the ticket
@MichaelTrucco and any arguing it, a handy rebuttal I posted to an online article some weeks ago
What is this supposed to accomplish? Feeding sadistic impulses? Count me in.
omg it just keeps getting worse and worse
It's going to go through anyway bc they are in control!!! But Why? Wtf, why would the legislature have a stake in this???
@DaShanneStokes   I care about these dear animals, but I worry more about hungry children and the elderly.  Trump's America
What about unborn children?
Go take paintings off the halls of congress.
@amyklobuchar @SenFranken Please vote against this!
But letting anyone stream across borders is ok! Killing the unborn is ok! Trillions in debt is ok! Welfare state is ok!
@JaredLeto TOTALLY WRONG! Wolves are endangered and this is just bad.
@larklittlefoot Well if not sport hunting, how else will they spend their corporate welfare? #howlongtil46
@LeslieMarshall Corey should take a Drug test. I see the Meth is devouring his brain. Maxine Waters is probably his dealer
@ChelseaClinton what about the poor calves separated from their grief stricken mama's, then killed by the MILLIONS.
where were you when Obama's BLM was slaughtering horses throughout the west?
How are we to keep up with all these ridiculous orders they are putting out?
@SharonJ44257163 Seriously, what is wrong with these people?
Aside from contacting the governor, who else should we be contacting?
