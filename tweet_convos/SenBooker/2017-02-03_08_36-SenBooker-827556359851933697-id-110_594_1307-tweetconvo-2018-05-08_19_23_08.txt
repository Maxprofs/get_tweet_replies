poor #friendsofdonaldtrump my friends work hard, pay their bills and can't borrow from banks either.
There should be MORE PEOPLE concerned about this country and less of #AgentOrange and his #PuppetMasters
@StupidMenThings @realDonaldTrump Thank a Trump voter when it costs 5 bucks to use an ATM. 
You can't fix #TrumpTrain CULT BRAINWASHED @verucasalt10 @SenBookerOffice the REAL issue is #GOP in power playing those people for $ #RESIST
As long as R's throw out guns, fetuses and gays red meat, they'll get voters, best interests be damned Smh
More evidence of the conflict of interest that this man has that will ultimately lead to his impeachment!
good luck, the corporations control this country now. Pipeline approvals, billionaire cabinet, Dodd Frank, coal in streams
Thank you Senator Booker. Keep fighting for us.
Do not speak on helping friends when you are choking on that Big Pharma peen sir.
@CoryBooker
please don't stop fighting for the middle class,  sencorybooker. 45 isn't for the people, he's for self!
never thought in a million years I would witness a bona fide nut running the US or thinks he's running it SMH.
Are you against small businesses?
Financial Regs, cap require & disclosure critical to a healthy sys. Looking for dems not to support any changes.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump. the loss of consumer protections from D-F will be devastating to middle class.BIG TROUBLE!
Highlighted part doesn't make sense,interest rates are low-banks are dying to lend.Bad credit.Not bad Reg.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump can Mr.T explain Dodd Frank to me? Which parts are you rolling back? Replacement plan?
apparently Trumps friends are more important than the American middle and poor.
@margaretresin @realDonaldTrump Hopefully, Dems will fight against changes to DoddFranks. We need to protect ourselves.
Regulations r PROTECTIONS. Republicans play w/words to their advantage. Right to Work is 2 work for less.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump OMG Cory reel this maniac in he is a dangerous dangerous figure in charge. This can't be right
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Thank you Senator Booker
@suejohnston56 @realDonaldTrump  We're counting on you Senator. Thank you. #Resist
I think we are way past appalled at ANYTHING that says. We are NOT his "friends". F*KIN idiot PLEASE stop him #impeach @SenBookerOffice
That's my Senator!!  Fight the good fight!!!
I think you should challenge him Senator, what businesses and what banks?
@Lee_in_Iowa Big deal, Democrats don't have the votes. Party continually eroded past 8 years. American consumer is cooked
Who is he working for, #WallStreet or us? @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump
Seniors cannot have retirement funds put at risk at his whim for his cronies! #unfair @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump
: He really played the Rope a Dope on his voters. But everyone else is getting shit on as well...
#traitortrump is more interested in helping his rich friends than he is in his real job. #resist #united
So much for looking out for JohnQPublic. Taxpayers are going to get stuck with the bill again. Trump lied.
Thank you Sen. @CoryBooker
Do not lose sight he is also taking the fiduciary responsibility away that will protect esp retiree invest
@SenateDems & @HouseDemocrats demand @POTUS tax returns to see banks he's in debt to (why he's doing this)
.@SenBookerOffice @realDonaldTrump
#doddfrank was nothing more than a BIG Govt power grab.
Restore Glass-Steagall
Repeal of GS may have added to Recession of 08,but we cant revert,12 recessions since GS in 33
Sad, his friends cannot borrow money Typical of him..helps his friends and bankrupt Americans  #doddfrank
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump guess The Swamp is getting larger!!!!
as soon as he said "my friends"...... should our president be catering to his rich "friends"?!
@APPROVEMAN @realDonaldTrump Don't let us down again Corey! You want to get reelected!
@CoryBooker  this little real estate appraiser fears the return of mortgage sharks. SQUEEZED w/ this &health insurance SOS
why is @realDonaldTrump only concerned about helping HIS friends, not the millions of Americans who will be hurt by this?
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump you're as narcissistic as Obama
@CoryBooker So those are the "forgotten men and women" @realDonaldTrump meant. Not the American people, but his friends.
@CoryBooker please, for the rest of the world too. It was only 8 years ago. The wounds are still evident all over.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Rolling back of bank regulations What can go wrong
ole partisan booker at work
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump IMPEACH lil Donnie now!!!
Oh, some people get their money for free from Lobbyist !  #DrainTheSwamp!
Who's friends?  Lord forbid someone gets a loan in this country! Fanning & Freddie are next!
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump this is fucking unbelievable.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump how about starting impeachment proceedings, better yet, treason charges.
@BrodyDalle @realDonaldTrump if new law makes me eligible for a small biz start-up loan from my bank of 15years, i'll like.
Thank you.  IMPEACH @realDonaldTrump
Sen. Booker you are one of the few politicians who actually looks to walk the way you talk. Thank you 
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Talk is cheap, you don't have the votes for anything due to your failed ideology.
How? What exactly are you going to do? Talk is not enough, what actions are you going to take and support?
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump GOPs have amnesia regarding what happened 9 yrs ago during Bush admin. Hence Dodd-Frank
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump outrageous!
take away Trumpâ€™s sharpie.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump   Chief swamp king...lied for position as tyrant!  Some populist!!
Such a shame when the 1% can't borrow money because people have to be protected from predatory lending.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump what wouldve @GOP done if Obama had said he was making #policy based on what friends wanted
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump @PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell Fight for our democracy and the American values fairness.
Tell Trump
Keep saying NO to them. NO NO NO. Thanks, @CoryBooker
@DemsTalk @realDonaldTrump you're making this Jersey-boy proud. Fight the power! #resist #operationavalanche
This is what happens when one panders to friend's interest over all of us.  Very sad
WOW! I thought a president worked to help the people.
thank you, this is important as you know, even if it's not exciting to many Americans
Americans are being thrown to the curb by Trump and no one seems to care. You didn't even vet Trump
Senator Booker - this all sounds good but you guys can't seem to be able to stop anything.
When businesses borrow money, everyone wins. #Economics101
please protect us, our homes and of right to liberty and happiness
45 don't care because he can buy more homes, land and build. #45LookingForHousingCrash
thank you Senator Booker for fighting for Our America
how? you guys cant stop a anything???
Cory Booker is the hypocrite who voted no for cheaper prescription drugs
@dcasapwarren @realDonaldTrump Thank you @SenBookerOffice
Role of gov't & the people who work for & in the gov't are sworn to serve and protect the US&its citizens.
thank you Cory! #resist
@realDonaldTrump@dacullington /2, as Mnuchin did w/ Ross's AHMSI,Homeward! He owned K's of shares of Ocwen & sat on board
honesty at its finest..... pays to have friends in high places I guess.
@realDonaldTrump@dacullington.Why was "Wilbur's" nom. not ? more by u,Sen.'s Warren,Sanders,Brown?He's foreclosed as much
we have to make sure no legislation gets passed that limits protesting unless real crime occurs. Some state r attempting
thank you @CoryBooker
so many nice people, that had businesses, went belly up in #AtlanticCity when you filed for #bankruptcy
