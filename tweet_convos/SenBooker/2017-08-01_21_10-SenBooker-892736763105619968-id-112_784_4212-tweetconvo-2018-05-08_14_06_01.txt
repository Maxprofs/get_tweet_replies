I hope @amyklobuchar and @SenFranken join @SenBookerOffice and end the ridiculous, racist and ignorant prohibition on Marijuana.
the war on cannabis is not only moronic it's downright unamerican- plant from the earth- cultivated by natives. kills nobody- much remedy.
Oooooo. Even more race baiting to indulge myself with.
When white people call other people racist
Will I don't think apatow is truly laughing thats 1 billion lost revenue because surroundings not quality not Jew geniuses unrespectedscrap
Weed is racist?
They are?
How?
Also, let's insist on using the word cannabis rather than marijuana. MJ is yet another politicization.
OK, but FDR forced everyone to use the pejorative, since 80 years ago today: courts everywhere have no choice
Way to wipe your ass with a good cause that effects everyone.
Legalize it however If you decide to sling weed you have to own the consequences. You're not the victim.
I was SAVED - from a "legal" opiod addiction - by marijuana & CBD oil! To think that Oxycontin is TOTALLY legal & MJ isn't - is INSANE!!!
having oxycontin without a prescription is still illegal, and you weren't saved, you switched from one drug to another.
I have a rare form of cancer & will ALWAYS be on drugs! But the ONLY way I detoxified myself was with MJ and CBD oil! no more gums bleeding
I need a joint..
Anyone who doesn't think it's racism pure and simple -- all you have to do is Google Harry Anslinger and read the quotes.
All you want is more drug to wreck the young people life
I knew a breast feeding mum who used drugs daily- was it abuse?
I think we're all victims/offspring of our ancestors drinking or doing some kind of narcotic during pregnancy. Would explain so much ! 
ACBFF
SPRWF
Now is better than never...but...
Never again will they be so cheap.
Hoping for 4$ in two years in ACBFF!
Did I meet you with @AmericaFerrera, Sarah? (Don't lie, please.)
The law stems from the arcane 1937 Marijuana Tax Act which by all measures was rooted in racism and economics.
Even Stevie Wonder can see it!!
But is it racist when white people go to jail also?
Motor City by Sherri Jefferson highlights these impacts but who is listening/ reading https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-9654656-5-6 … #JusticeReform #prisonreform
"Undoing the damage done". Yes! And prevent more institutionalized racism. Please.
That wart on your nose? Now tgat's racism.
not sure about the tenor of the tweets, but legalization will certainly drive the underclass further into the abyss...
I stand with you Senator.  Americans need to refocus.   There is so much more data today.  Opiates are destroying our society
Can we legalize weed already haha
Nthing 2 do wth race chicken little it wld compt wth lumber oil & Pharm. That's why it's illegal. It is the green energy prod we r ignoring
https://www.gofundme.com/lossing-everything-need-help …. Please if anyone can.  Help  please .

I was fired for using medical marijuana, man claims http://dlvr.it/PSMRrV  
@nowthisnews A manufacturer in Indiana said 20 years ago that finding workers who could pass drug test is hard
Saying the war on drugs is racist, is like saying MSNBC's "To Catch a Predator" is sexist.
He should also vote yes on a bill that lowers prescription drugs , because last time he voted NO  get out of big pharmas pocket
We need clear headed professionals for a good future not pot heads
You know psychologist say, people who cry racist for everything are the ones that are inherently racist, behind closed doors of course.
T-Bone smokes.
The history of drug laws and prison industry was always about controlling minorities. Texas prisons build, literally, on former plantations
That is so irrelevant
I liked the video. I think he should keep emphasizing how much wasted tax $ has been going into policing, prosecution and jailing over M too
@CoryBooker knows all about pharmaceuticals and donations.  Lol
Mad cause somebody didn't hand out
Love this guy
Why shouldn't Corey Booker benefit when Big Pharma cashes in ya racists?
hahahahahahaha
Playing the race card again!  Yikes.
It's legal in Massachusetts.
Agreed, Sarah. #LegalizeIt
Sure Cory that's it legalize POT! Every where in the country! Pot heads unite. You JERK!
Again nothing to do with racism. Just big pharma doing its thing.
When in doubt.... scream racism!
Booker took 300k from big pharma to block cheaper drugs for americans booker is a criminal and a liar
He & others should be focused on this fight #Resist
Oregon
Hmm, like weedlike British guysI'm now in love with you
@CoryBooker is lining his pockets with big pharma money AND supports Ivanka and Jared. No thank you. Go away Fraud
@corybooker is in the pocket of Big Pharma and probably wants to help them control weed production. He is their #1 man in Congress
I agree , but what will we do with/for all those in prison for marijuana offenses?
@blumspew @CoryBooker weed never even fulfilled the original criteria to be called a Lvl1 controlled substance.
Sounds like a smart way to fixing the dumb law and I hope he gets this passed!
While everyone is enjoying their weed, know it was picked by people suffering in human trafficking #bloodweed
lol that's a good one
The legality of weed is not racist in any way. The application of the law, however unquestionably is. Legalizing ignores the real problem
Repeal federal criminalization of MJ by Nixon regime.
It is and it's bullshit that MUST be stopped without delay.
Nixon official: real reason for the drug war was to criminalize black people and hippies
It's a step in the right direction, but it's merely a ploy for Booker to save face after being caught with Big Pharma in and around his ass
You want to steal Trump supporters in rural America, legalize pot! 

You want to get the disabled population, legalize pot.
CBD oil helps so many and legalization will help the opiod crisis.
I mean the actual literal original criminalization of marijuana specifically mentioned race and we still kept it.
USA better get a move on because as of July 1 2018 I will be seeing alot of Americans crossing the boarder to visit us EH
Yeah, this really balances out @CoryBooker 's defense of Bain Capital and Wall St.
You are a cartoon character
how about making it a corporal punishment to claim to be a comedian
Please don't ever reproduce @ pat. Please.

I like Cory Booker, but all the money and support he got from big pharma really made me wonder about him.
Free the weed!
"Weed the People" & stop the big scam,
Fuck Big Pharma & For-profit Slam!
Didn't Jeffey"BigBluntz"Sessions Quit The KKK After He Found Out They Smoked Pot?? #LegalizePotPayOffDeficit
OH MY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2nd smartest thing to come out of her mouth...the 1st being @kevinbrennan666 s dick!  Haha #mlcpodcast

@diane_magnette
That last clip of the toddler in the stroller is not winning anyone over- poor editing choice
I mean #BigPharmaWhore @CoryBooker
Spot on!
racism?
WORD! Everyone needs to get behind this initiative @ Booker! This is the big tobacco lie of our generation & it's time it ended!
ferreals
Fuck yessssss!!!!! I've been saying this for the past 15 years!!!! Wake up America!!!!
Unfortunate those savage effects financially benefit a lot of rich folks, which is the only reason we seem to have trouble fixing it. 
They could legalize it, tax it, regulate it, and if you sell it and don't pay taxes it's tax evasion, they could do it, but it's "evil".
Increasingly states are legalizing at least the medicinal use of marijuana if not the recreational. it's time to rethink a lot of things.
wrong
Buuuuuttt smoking marijuana might lead to people not being racist.
here's some more pure & simple #racism on the #iPhone plz help me convince @Apple to change iMessage's image search!
