everyone should stop trying to package us as consumers for insurance companies. Pass #MedicareForAll
that's actually not true and it can - and should - in any event be expanded. See H.R. 676
please work will Bernie and bring a universal health care bill to the table we can ALL work to back! we will be there
@SenSanders @SenWarren it's time to raise the bar. Their kill shot is missing, so offer something even better! @justjen525
why not put a pause on 45 til investigations are cleared up! use all tools necessary! work harder to full stop!
@marybeth_lawson @GOP trumpy's Trump#Care is a failure from the get go
Citizens United bad for both parties and the real citizens of US.no lasting reform good til then.
Get Republicans on record by introducing bills that document their hypocrisy. Voters will take care of the rest.
For example, sponsor bill mandating Medicare block grants to states must meet needs of those states as documented
all GOP who vote for trump care need a heart transplant. Hope they're covered.
Amazing
even more are going to lose it when the insurance companies totally pull out of it
get HMO AND Big Pharm money OUT of elections.Taxation without Representation is tyranny.
@BeMe_BeFree so can you guys go on the offense NOW and propose the changes to ACA and show them how it's done!  #lead
@CoryBooker @GOP not any more
unacceptable and inhumane
Unacceptable indeed and, with the exception of @RepTomMacArthur , all NJ MoC's agree.
that is a #lie and u know it. Choose is not = lose; they gain #liberty and #choice
It's a clusterbomb! Keep Obamacare! Ppl I know on it love it/critics have other ins 4 themselves. KEEP ACA! Big win!
You get those facts from some of your fake friends Cory?
it needs to be stopped Mr. Senator! Who can I call?
Thank you for fighting against the evil that has taken over our government!!!!
@CoryBooker what have you done for NJ? Cory you are big government and deficit spending
@CoryBooker @GOP They will lose it anyway. President Trump should just let it die.
@CoryBooker @GOP NOT!!!!
@CoryBooker @GOP Congress works for we the people the ACA does not work when you have no real choices.
@rltech07 @GOP Go Cory!!! 
@CoryBooker Is there a fix that will lower costs for your constituents and insure even more! Author one! Now is the time
@CoryBooker don't let republicans just trash ACA. If we get a fix or new bill that will lower med costs we can mobilize
@CoryBooker If you have a fix. We, your constituents, can get to work calling our reps to vote for ACA fix.  Don't sit back
@CoryBooker Republicans failed. Now is time to propose the fix to ensure an even stronger, better ACA.
@CoryBooker @GOP are you working on ACA fixes? Bring new bill to lower med cost and fix ACA to American people! Now is time
would they lose or chose not to be covered? people should have never been penalized into taking insurance
@CoryBooker @GOP does @CoryBooker use the same figures to come to this conclusion he used that Obamacare was great #fail
@CoryBooker @GOP  it costs to repeal what does it cost to fix it and make it better bipartisanship is needed #countryfirst
@CoryBooker too much profit motive in healthcare driving costs out of control coupled with aging populus #no easy fix
tax breaks for wealthy no health care help for the vulnerable It's our tax dollars paying for everything we deservebenefit
people's taxes pay for healthcare we deserve some benefit not only the rich our reps are lopsided
@CoryBooker @GOP Reps don't let #45 and Ryan make you Eunuchs overnight. Stay with your NO vote.
@CoryBooker @GOP American need and want Universal Health Care for their whole body not this ahca bill
This cannot happen. Why does NASA get funding and families and the elderly do not? Our lives are 1st.
@CoryBooker @GOP 1/aren't "We the People" supposed to be the true employer of the government? If so then why can't ...
2/ ..."We the People" get the same healthcare coverage we offer our employees???!
@CoryBooker @GOP really..huh...??maybe you should provide them jobs.
@CoryBooker @GOP but, but, but, she had an email server
@CoryBooker @GOP I'm one
@CoryBooker @GOP get them jobs!!
@CoryBooker @GOP What does "Big Pharma" think about importing safe drugs from Canada?
He is unacceptable!!! How bout that.....
#TrumpcareNOT
@CoryBooker @GOP #fakenews
We all know that. But @RepTomMacArthur thinks the tax cuts are more important then the folks in NJ03.
I recommend GOP do nothing and allow Obamacare to implode then blame the democrats. Pretty easy political victory
your recommendation implies death and disorder yo prove a point. Some "victories" aren't worth winning. @SenBookerOffice @GOP
being in order to put people back to work. healthy people will create more tax revenue. sick people will delete it.
sick and can't go to work to earn an income to pay taxes. Why are we not focused on our neighbors health and well
I wonder if anyone has thought of the millions of $ of loss tax revenue when people can't work because they are
Nothing to debate here. The GOP has unmasked itself and revealed it's contempt for the avg working American. Vote NO
@USRepRodney and..... you are Undecided,Mr F??
#Trumpcare Sux
Yr leadership & tenacity in staying on ppl 2 fight #AHCA is noted & appreciated! 

Go fulfill that potential, young man!
People need humane healthcare.  Remember what happened in Russia in 1917, do Republicans want this? Votes not guns!
Dead Americans whose jobs and houses filled with white breeders....
says the Deplorable
if they deny maternity requirements is that not counter to that whole value of Life thing?
Unreal.
