Yeah, Cory Booker  We are with you
@potus offered to fully fund PPA if they don't do abortions-they declined because that's all they do.
PP is not closing. All they are doing is not forcing taxpayers to fund abortions. It is only fair.
Thank you for ALL your HARD WORK  ON THE HILL  my prayers are with you for continued STRENGTH
Thank you for fighting for women's rights and for PP!
@stopnuclearwar It's not only about PP.Ppl need to know it's a death sentence for older Americans &;poor will suffer
TrumpCare!

What about GYN cancer screenings?
@wordbirdsnest @PPact PP has been in forefront in deadly disease testing, diagnosis, prevention & MUCH more for M-F/24-85.
I agree. Though I would call it #Ryancare. He's the evil uncaring mastermind of this fiasco.
Also posted on fb.
Cory,I would use a couple of adjectives to describe you, but I'm Christian above all! 
I feel sorry for you though.

@JonMelton14 @PPact both control is available for free at any public health department.
@JonMelton14 @PPact thank goodness!

and
@kristeena65 @PPact stop having babies you can't afford, hes not giving you money anymore, find a job and take care of you
typical republican, I make way more than you will ever see in your lifetime I never took money
Thank you, Senator! We appreciate all you to support women (and men)!
thank you 4 taking the time....
Thank you!  On behalf of women, thank you!
Yeah! Cory!
Next President.
Thanks for being for the people!!!! We need more politicians like you 
keep up the good work thank you
That term doesn't do what Dems think it does. It makes Trumper supporters accept it despite the atrocities. #DontUse

Thank you for your actions and I am seeing what I can do locally
ALWAYS proud of you.
very informative and important message. Thank you Senator for all your hard work.
Senator #Trumpcare (more like Trumpdoesntcare) is an assault on the American people. FTFY.
I stand with Teresa, Natalie, Mame, Dewayne, & your many supporters.  Thanks for being tireless, Senator.
birth control is essential especially if you are against abortion. Birth control Is truly respect for life
sure thank u
@CoryBooker  never mind policies,  what are you all going to do with unstable delusional & scary @realDonaldTrump ?.
This bill is DOA.  Look at it !  IT HELPS WEALTHY, YOUNG, & INSURERS  IT HURTS ELDERLY, POOR. SICK !  NO NO &NO
Thank you Senator Booker! Thanks for fighting the good fight.
@NastyWoman4life @PPact Conservatives feel ovarian tumors are being denied their rights.
How tragic for a child to be born unwanted & then resented. Shameful that Repubs are interfering w family planning.
Thank you @SenBookerOffice @PPact Defunding #PP illogical; #Trumpcare direct assault on women by GOP & Trump to save egos of both.  #saveACA
God Bless You And All Your HardGenuine, Caring Work That You N your Staff Does. LOVE To See You Here In CALI.
Thank you for tirelessly working for all Americans.  Your advocacy for women, poor and middle class is commendable.
Thank you Senator for sharing real #Facts with Americans. Keep up the good fight. We need you.
call it GOPCare pin it on the entire party.
thank you for caring and making it a priority among the many issues you face.
@NatalyinAK @PPact I remember saying that I thought you were a good presidential candidate. I still do. Thank you âš˜
we stand with & alongside you. The power of the people who built this country shouldn't be underestimated
it's important to call it #republicare not Trumpcare. Trumpcare lets other republicans that worked on it off the hook.
I agree 100%++++
Thank you, Sen Booker.  It makes no sense to take away PP and birth control because there will be more pregnancies.
GOT IT AND RETWEETED IT!!! THIS BILL HAS TO BE STOPPED! THANKS FOR ALL YOUR DOING
Thank you for so clearly explaining the value that P P has had in reducing unplanned pregnancy & abortions
Cory Booker is a voice of reason stability kindness & compassion please take the time to listen to his video
thank you for your voice Senator Booker! We appreciate you.
#Bookerforprez2020 please please run for president we NEED you!!!! 
please keep fighting for us. And please let us help you fight. I know I'll do anything I can to help!! Thank you!!
Thank you Senator! Standing beside #PP tells millions of women, like me, that you care about our welfare.
it's nothing but a ONE TRILLION DOLLAR TAX CUT bill so far
thank you, Senator. There are numerous problems with #Trumpcare but defunding Planned Parenthood is a nonstarter.

@GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @POTUS OFFER AMERICANS THE SAME #Congressional #Healthcare #Plan as yourselves! #SMART!!!
You cannot argue w/logic, truth & intelligence! #Trumpcare is abysmal! I fight for Planned Parenthood w/Sen. Booker!
@RepLoBiondo would like to hear from LoBiondo on healthcare and FAA privatization.Against proposals for both issues
thank you for your persistence in fighting for what's right. I am so scared
agree 100%
Thank you for taking a stand!!
Well Then cory  I would suggest They PROVE NO TAX DOLLAR Reimbursements On ABBORTION SERVICES SOUNDS FAIR
planned Parenthood is a must have for public health it is a must for human rights to dignified healthcare.
i'm a middle-aged nurse and Planned Parenthood came to my rescue as a young woman several times. We must protect it
Thanks for fighting for the rights of woman!
Booker for President!!!
Thank you, Senator Booker for looking out for women's health and family health. Healthy families make  countries.
People need to remember that PP is more than abortive services. Preventive care and birth control help are crucial!!
what they don't understand is women will need to go elsewhere for wellness care putting a strain on other providers
It's @SpeakerRyan's healthcare KillBill, he named it to #Trump so he can have escape route
GOP replacement for ACA is not a "Health CARE Plan" it is a "WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH PLAN!" or "DON'T CARE PLAN!"
I think we need to call this #Republicare so they have no scapegoat if/when this plan fails.

there r more Community Healthcare Ctrs than @PPact stop scaring people & give them knowledge
-Thanks Sen. Booker-#Trumpcare is another for of violence against women-How Russian of 45 #Trumprussia #ImpeachTrump
we need to repeal and replace TRUMP and his crooked cabinet. Oh and we can't forget RYAN.
Thank you Sen.Booker.
 thank you.
Thank you for fighting for us on every action, every issue. #NoTrumpCare
#resist! Thanks Senator Booker.
