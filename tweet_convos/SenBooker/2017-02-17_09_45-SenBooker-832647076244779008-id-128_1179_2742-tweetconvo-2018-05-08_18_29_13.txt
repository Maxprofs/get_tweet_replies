This feeling is spreading throughout the country an unhinged anger that is almost uncontrollable We feel unheard#beourvoice
Senator Booker, I'm sure you will be part of the solution, the light that will triumph over this darkness. We stand united!
@CoryBooker     You just don't get it. He won you and your ilk lost. Get over it.
from the mouths of babes!
@CoryBooker wonder who brainwashed that young child to think that way 
Judah has been listening to all the hatred coming directly from the President. Sad. Very sad.
give an example of the hatred coming directly from the president please try , think hard , GO!
I won't have to think hard at all. His childish, rude remarks are all over Twitter.
You understand the difference between legal and illegal immigrant? Why do you insult those who came the right way?
@MeatballMom2   This child is a special person who will be a leader and a blessing for America. Bless his exemplary parents
@CoryBooker Simultaneously heartbreaking & inspiring. #empathy will not die w/ this Trump Presidency. Young Judah is proof.
Written by an adult. Fake.

That is something his muslim mother told him to write, or did you write that yourself Cory? Such bullshit! #MAGA
@JustinTuck poor kid must have to listen to his parents whine daily.
Illegal aliens need to be treated as illegals
@CoryBooker 3 CHILDREN killed in Chicago  2days  ago that's what you should be TALKING  ABOUT NOT THE BULL YOU BEEN SAYING
Muslims and illegal immigrants do not deserve to come to this country
@CoryBooker  you should be ashamed of yourself exploiting a 10 year old for your political agenda of hate and mistrust.
Our health system deserves better than you and your nearly $300,000 from big pharma. #CoryBrokeMyHeart 
he needs to be stopped. Not even a whole month in and he destroying the country
Message needs to get LOUDER!  Start your campaigning now & When does the @HouseDemocrats start campaigning? NOW
Aww, this should open some Republican eyes and hearts, but unfortunately will probably skip past their brains.
@CoryBooker How do the Dems help Judah and us all when you don't have the votes to do it? #resist
@CoryBooker this is propaganda perpetrated by adults using kids... shame on you...
@CoryBooker my heart breaks
@crgonzalez A 10 year old American feeling like his heart is broken? Heâ€™s too young to be caught up in our depression.
@CoryBooker please call out Trump for his autocratic behavior. He must work with Congress! He's wasting our time!!
Am with you 
YOU & these teachers are brainwashing these kids will a hoax! This is BS and you are a senator!
@CoryBooker Using children to further your agenda, ya we know this tactic is a favorite of Dems. Schools in back pocket too
it is shameful. It makes me as a Canadian very disturbed. Who gave nutbar an access code to destroy the world? #ThePeople ?
Did you write this your self or have Nancy Polisy write it. You guys are pathetic. FAKE POLITICAL FIGURE FAKE NEWS FAKE
@CoryBooker thank you for sharing.. we all can use more kind words.
@CoryBooker 10 yr old Judah for president!

Teachers deserve combat pay for trying to explain this situation to school kids. Sad for country,ppl,land& sea,global wrmg.
@fmc21369 if a 10 year old had drawn you a cute picture would that have stopped you from voting no on affordable medicine?

@2017Ace 
I do not even
Have what you would call a heart
And still, it's breaking
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @oreillyfactorCory hopefully you will come back as a Muslim Women.Then tell us how it feels.
It is really disheartening that us Americans have to be bothered with this kind of bullshit of yours & other Dems. Move on!
Take responsibility for your lack of achievement and improve yourself as your voice so far does not speak for the people.
Try focusing on doing your job as it is because of Congress' many failures is the Reason Trump is sitting in the WH #MAGA
Those kind of parents should be reported to children's services for abuse as they are teaching their kids hate & 2 b Stupid
LMAO. Yeah right.Parents using their children to write letters.Sorry a 10 yr olds mind is not developed for political arena
Trump is a FASCIST.  IMPEACH HIM !! He and his fascist regime are a danger to this country.
Forward to Ashton Kutcher please ..........

New Jersey citizens need to know why you voted against the Sanders proposal to lower prescription drugs.

how sad but kids take their parents feelings.  I wouldn't do that to a child. It's bad enough 4 adults!
#FakeOutrage
I'm sure their parents are leftist & filling head w/ half truths. True education is knowing the whole story not half of it!
@JustinTuck Corey booker go away.   You're just an opportunistic hack.  You will never be POTUS
@jonasokon   I keep saying...Cory Booker for President 2020
@JustinTuck please, you know the parents made him write it, my kids do not follow unless there parents feed them this crap
@CoryBooker  a good senator would reassure this child...and not use him to reaffirm his own agenda. Tsk. Tsk.
@JustinTuck Booker you are a jerk
#BuildTheWall #DeportThemAll tired of the Billions we spend on #Illegals 
#CluelessLiberals
Kids are listening, watching, and taking notes. Kids can be smarter than adults.
indoctrinated by*

@CoryBooker   Fabulous idea using these postcards from real people, keep up the good work.
Where is Meredith McIver?

Thank you for listening to your youngest constituents!
....and could you NOT vote against allowing cheaper medicine from Canada into America again? I like living.
I guess his parents have brainwashed him
@CoryBooker 10 year old, seriously? No doubt a poisoned mind from a Lib parent.
@CoryBooker please get to work with your fellow senators and draft a fair immigration policy!  #gettowork
we see in europe how muslim refugees refusal to adapt to western values is endangering the citizens.
@CoryBooker pretty low using a kid Booker
we meed to make sure muslim refugees and immigrants are willing want to accept our values...
@CoryBooker AMERICANS deserve better!!..what about homeless moms and kids?..homeless vets?..american children going hungry?
americans deserve better protection than you are offering. Look at Sweden and the rest of Europe to see that...
@CoryBooker My 9 year old wants to start a PAC to raise money to support candidates who support issues important 2 children
DID YOU GET ONE OF YOUR KIDS TO WRITE IT? Teach them that we have laws and it's ILLEGAL to come here ILLEGALLY.
@CoryBooker what are you doing besides planting seeds of hate
With all possible respect, go soak your head.
@CoryBooker I see @POTUS working with women business leaders and entrepreneurs to promote female business leaders.....
i agree with you!
@CoryBooker bunch of SNOWFLAKEs talking about how "hurt" they are and how "their worlds make no sense" lmao pussies
@CoryBooker life is about survival not about being nice
@CoryBooker stop with your fake bs! Time for compassion is over. We need to get control of our country!No more open borders

...

@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker
@CoryBooker Judah-He is breaking a lot of ! Be strong and know there are more good people than bad! We will fight the hate
Sure - bring kids into the political debate for your own personal gain.  hope you 2020 campaign still has momentum in 2 yrs
kids are in this . They see the news. They hear their parents. They are upset, as well they should be.
I think the kids should be in this - but not to be used to score political points.  Poor form.
@CoryBooker Judah - you are a VERY wise 10 year old. It's embarrassing that a man 7 times your age has less maturity. 
because a 10 year old understands all of this and made their own mind about the issues right?
Powerful
@CoryBooker Always playing the sympathy card. Getting old. As a woman and Immigrant why don't I engage in self pity?
What does it say that a 10 y/o understands the impact better than our president?
my 10yr old understands what it means to have a TRUE AMERICAN PRESIDENT n backs him to the fullest!
I feel your pain Judah. I've told my kids 2 look up 2 other ppl who represent their values @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker
Love that the Sen is actually READING these. Thank you
stop the bs
out of the mouths of babes
our children and grandchildren deserve better. 
Judah, Senator Booker and many others who love our country will try to stop Trump. I will not lie to u - he won't change.
