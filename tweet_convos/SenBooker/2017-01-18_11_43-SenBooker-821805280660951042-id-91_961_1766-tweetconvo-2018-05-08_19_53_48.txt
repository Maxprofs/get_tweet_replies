If only they could get them for half that from Canada... could be life saving.
@CoryBooker @EPA - if the parents didn't smoke pot and expose their kids to secondary smoke they wouldn't have asthma
@CoryBooker @EPA U forgot started WW2,EBOLA,FERGUSEN RIOTS,BALTIMORE RIOTS AND HE IS THE ANTI CHRIST,"THAT'S THE TICKET"!
Kids with asthma don't make campaign contributions and don't vote.
Great questions, thank you for asking
@CoryBooker @EPA As an Okie, I can say Pruitt was cancer in OK. The gov won't fill his spot until he's confirmed. Worried?

@CoryBooker @EPA
My mom died of Asthma in NE Texas.  Pollution is unnecessary and very dangerous
@CoryBooker @EPA you care about people with asthma? But not enough to get them cheaper medication?cause you need pharma 
@lehimesa @EPA yeah, but let's just go ahead and put him through.... the bullshit is high
To see how Pruitt will 'protect' the environment, look no further than Oklahoma.  Earthquakes anyone?
I really appreciate this research and line of questioning, but please do show responses to give us fuller picture.

@CoryBooker @EPA you are a disappointment. Take a Stand with your 55 brothers and sisters. Take a Stand for us not for you
You do not give a shit about kids or else you would not stop them getting cheap drugs, child killer!
@CoryBooker @EPA. Asthma medication is cheaper in Canada Cory Booker.
Cory would block medicines for kids with asthma of it is coming from Canada.
nice BS we will remember your vote to keep our medicines costs high, next election you will lose
Too much money involved in all of nominees, most of them appear to have criminal & borderline criminal backgrounds.

Serioulsy, thank you @CoryBooker for eloquently/passionately/intelligently drilling @AGScottPruitt re #Asthma. @SenBookerOffice @EPA
does your air purifier do this to allergens?
I believe they call this a straw man argument.
I really wish we would have Senator that could speak for the Democrats in my state of WY! but we don't!
Take Booker New Jersey sure doesn't want him. Not good for people just himself
@pdacosta @EPA well if only you would have shown such verve in dealing with big Pharma.
anything that pisses you bernie bros is a good thing
Who elected @SenBookerOffice? Disney should make a cartoon figure based on his demeanor & believes. No wonder we can't do anything.
"Beliefs".
Keep it coming, Senator.  Your moment is now
