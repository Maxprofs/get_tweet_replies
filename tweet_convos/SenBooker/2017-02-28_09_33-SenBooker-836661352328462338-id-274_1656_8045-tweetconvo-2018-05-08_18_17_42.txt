STOP TRYING TO SAVE THE  PEOPLE PROGRESSIVES INTEND TO VOTE OUT OF OFFICE BERNIE. With US or against US
Bernie is starting to get in the way of his own movement and it's troubling.
His movement is to transform washington with progressive values, not prop up a dead party
that's actually workign against him and everything he stands for. Like Booker and Casey
If he can be flexible and pragmatic, U can 2. He is wise & not at all militant.
His obsession with saving a party he won't join is hindering his revolution
Corporate Cory has already showed us his true colors.
has he? Because it seems like he's redeeming himself here. People learn from mistakes?
he got scared of backlash. He didn't choose this. They twisted his arm.
I mean damned if you do, damned if you don't.
it's better he's "on this side" now, no doubt. We can admit that and admit it's all for optics, too. It's not either/or.
Bernie has been complaining about the '94 crime bill but he did vote for it. What was the optics part?
he explained why he did, and what he didnt like about it. If you don't believe him, that's fair, but Booker vote with donors.
His vote was the biggest endorsement of that bill. Everything else is just talk. But u r willing to give him a pass.
Booker is paid for by NJ big pharma. He's an opportunistic fake. Don't bother.
So has Bernie given the Pharma money back? I'm gonna guess no
fair point but Bernie sponsored the bill. Booker did this
Booker voted for similar Bill with stronger safety protections
what bill? Got a link?
Here is a link to the new bill with considerable safety provisions added: http://www.booker.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=546 … …
Thanks Senator. So if I'm reading this right, Canadian importations can start immediately after passage of the bill?
Booker's excuse is both disingenuous and xenophobic. Canadian standards are at least as high as the US.
did Cory suddenly grow a spine? Is he going to return the $100K plus he's received from big pharma?
you can get them from communist country. commrade
Yes. Moving forward.  @akurlady
I don't want imported drugs.  I want fairly priced drugs
Did Sen. Booker have achange of heart? I hope so. Would like to see him run 4  president 1day.  #mysen
You mean those two traitors who voted against it last time bc of Pharma donors?! Gonna take A LOT more
Why would you be opposed to them voting for it this time if they do so? That would be a good thing.
Corey has horrible record - big pharma and DeVos charter schools. Why SHOULD I trust them after one turnaround??!!
you definitely should not ever trust them, I'm just saying that if they vote for a bill that helps millions of Americans
afford their meds, then that's a good thing.
No argument but it does not erase their previous vote either and so will not take eyes off them!
you are correct, we are on the same page.
Awesome!
This prob. won't pass. It's all smoke + mirrors like Ellison position! Just strategy by Cory. #DemExit
why import what is made here? lower the cost here, what are you guys doing ffs?
Yessssss, fall in line. Your resistance is futile. You will be assimilated into the Bern.
how does this differ from the prior prrscription import bill that @CoryBooker opposed?
protections for safety standards, which was Booker's prior objection.
thanks but @SenSanders original bill had safety standards. How were they updated to gain @CoryBooker support?
Thx for not falling for his disingenuous & xenophobic excuse/lie that CDN standards are lower.
So @CoryBooker's trying to save himself after being caught red handed being a shill against working/poor Americans?
this time corporate democrats please work with @BernieSanders @SenSanders to pass this bill and stop selling votes to corp
Don't let these establishment hacks ride your coattails

This piece of shit will use this in 2020
There was no mistake the first time.Cory said he wanted a more robust bill. People just decided he lied
It was a disingenuous and xenophobic excuse of @CoryBooker. CDN standards are at least as high as USA.
didn't @CoryBooker vote against your last amendment to do so?
You mean Amy Klobuchar's NON-BINDING Amendement. Give credit to the RIGHT PERSON.. @SenSanders @CoryBooker
You cant save @CoryBooker you can only discredit yourself. Leave the Dems, theyve dug far too deep a hole
what a combo--this is why America said NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
= "I like American"
#3billbernie is co sponsoring a bill. Won't pass as he didn't ask to rename a post office
@neeratanden @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey great move! @realDonaldTrump Shd support !consistent with his objectives ! Let us test him
what is the bill? Would love to actually read what it entails. Please don't bloat w uncsry details! 
I worked in big pharma. Extreme rebates/discounts to manage care and none to consumers. Corrupt, unethical business practices.
Still voting him out. It's 1 strike you're out, not 3. I'm so sick of the Dem. BS that I want to vomit.
Hopefully Cory Booker won't sell out again as a corporate lapdog & will sign your proposed amendment.
Cory Booker the fake corporate puppet
thank you, senators, for standing up to Big Pharma! #politicalrevolution
Maybe you should be proud of the Democratic party enough to join it instead of denigrating it? Leach
#misguided #easytargets #worldwidepacttosupportinnovation
@EricMorrison_S
I'm still suspicious bro. But for now, he has gained some trust back.
I was upset with Corey at first as well but faith for now is restored 
@EricMorrison_S we can restore faith in Cory lol he had me worried for a second 
@neeratanden @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey let's hope this one passes!
Video 
@neeratanden @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey good for you. Less rhetoric; more working for the best interest of Americans
Why let a sellout like @CoryBooker coast on your reputation?  He'll just try to put in a poison pill.
The only reason @CoryBooker would support it is if he knew it wouldn't pass, same as last time. What a phony.
Thanks for joining forces and fighting for the American people
Who oversees quality control?
stop tweeting on behalf of Bernie.
#putAmericanpharmacistsoutofbusiness
you rock!
medication can be made in America.... How about we tell our pharmaceutical companies to lower costs?
Lose @CoryBooker and I'm down. @SenBobCasey
sorry but I disagree. US prices must come down. They will just raise prices worldwide. It's a band-aid.
ha what a joke
Big thanks to my PA Senator.
Thank You for caring.
Great! Was pissed at Booker when he voted against it the 1st time.
this is good news!!
why are you giving cover to corporate shill Cory Big Pharma Hooker? Bernie, you're better than this.
Do it
Thanks for your efforts!
Sen. Sanders, you owe it to Booker to tell the truth about the "vote story." You broke it, you fix it.
sheepdog sellout
bad move, Bern. you're mucking about in the slimepit of the Dems and now YOU'RE dirty too.
talk to the dopes that follow you.
what's the Senate bill #? All this discussion is empty until we see the text.
over Big Pharma's dead bodies
why aren't pharmaceutical costs regulated? Why do we need to import them?
Love how Berniebros are talking like they did something. This bill will be DOA in the House.
where can we sign petitions?
Let's get this done like yesterday! It's looooong overdue!
Good. Hurry. People are dying for them!
 goes through & helps. My Glaxo inhaler is 250 for 1 here & only 110 for 3 from Canada & New Zealand.
>@SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey By IMPORT U mean GENERIC which R forced upon us instead of the REAL medication SAD
OurGovernmentIsDead
This is hilarious.  Bernie, you failed your own supporters' purity test.  Good work!
Hey hey!! Welcome to the light Cory!
Booker finally saw the error of his ways.
No way Corporate Cory suddenly cares about people affording medication. Be dubious, Senator Sanders.
Bernie, Cory voted against that recently...
thank you.
let´s hope @CoryBooker votes in favor this time.
Yes!!!
Keep up the good work.
Cory Booker better correct his voting on protecting big Pharm. We need affordable medicine NOW!
glad it *appears* Cory learned from last months fiasco, I'll believe it when he suppprts #draftbernie
Oh don't do it!

DEMOCRATS: 
TODAY 9 pm Eastern Time, 6pm PST
Hashtag #InvestigateTrumpNow
Let's make this country hear our voices loud and…
wanna resist something? how about corp bribes to our legislators? #HangCongress
The People want to partner with you only Bernie #StillSanders #DraftBernie #DemExit
Cuba has great prices!
@darianknight @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey we have a republican president now all this should have Ben thought of done before
Yeah, it was... it was supposed to be the ACA until it was gutted by Republicans. @breezycarver @SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey
sigh typical Blaine rep for all your problems new flash life is Not Free !!
Booker didn't have a choice after he got taken to task on the last vote. The people are watching!!
WHY can't the insurance & pharma industries become govt arms? I mean, they wouldn't like it but, tough.
i can think of several billion reasons a year 
Glad all of you are trying to help the American people.
both of them sold out the last bill. We're working on replacing @SenBobCasey
Good to hear. Last month, I saw nasty side of @RBReich et al more inter'std in headlines than solutions
Did Cory change his position on this now?
I'm proud to be a @SenBobCasey constituent!
Maybe Booker & Casey can return the $1/2 mil they've taken from Big Pharma too.
yeah what he said!
YES!!! #PAProud
Happy to hear @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey come around & support this.
Let me know when its done.
You can add seniors to that list. I can't afford my Part D copay for psoriasis cream. Ridiculous.
all I can say is I donated to the Justice Democrats to remove people like Cory Booker from office. 
Is this an actual bill with teeth or another symbolic amendment just to rally your followers?
God damn better be!!!

@SenSanders  @SenBobCasey
We desperately need Single Payer Healthcare Coverage!
oh, so @CoryBooker flip-flopped? He could've worked with you the first time you tried to pass such a bill
...like last week.
.@SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey great. now do that with trains too.
You rock Bernie! Keep fighting the good fight. Dan Rather's FB page Join The Movement! Save the USA
@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey my glaucoma med is cheaper in Paris with no insurance then what I paid in US with ins
Insurance companies make under the table deals with drug companies for medications coverage
yes check the connection between drug companies and Health insurance companies
thank you for this important work!
THANK YOU FOR ACTUALLY DO YOUR JOBS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! 
Congrats on getting Cory Booker to see the light.
From Canada?
Are prescription drugs Muslim?
Booker killed the last one!
@brianjconnor nice work
the leaders of the Alt Left that need to be exposed,crazy socialist provide everything cradle to grave
UR saying right things but doing it wrong way. True change can't happen within. Historically only thru new parties
establishment Dems are using @SenSanders like Clinton, they don't truly believe in justice unless it's for votes.
suddenly @CoryBooker cares? Political strategy, sociopath politicians don't truly care or else they'd be consistent
YES!
Please vote with @SenSanders this time. Please don't sell us out to your donors again. Please vote progressive.
thank god, this is literally life saving legislation. It needs to happen
Great work!  I did not think Booker could be shamed into doing the right thing.
thank you
Every discussion about health care needs to address prevention through healthy food first. #plantbased
.@SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey ....yea, level the playing field.
Wait, I thought criticizing other Dems ‘‘wasn't helpful.’’ 
it passes the time, tho
LOL. Cory trying to undo the damage. He is forever marked as a Wall st enabler unless he apologizes.
We are hearing a lot of noise that this is not reserved.  Is that going to kill it?
would you mind explaining what "not reserved" means?
The new budget calls for all new legislation to be reserved.  If there is no reserve it may not pass.
thank you.
http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/drug-importation-bill-summary-and-background?inline=file …  last paragraph talks of cost savings.  Cross your fingers.
lol watch the attacks on Booker by Bern's minions!
Hopefully @CoryBooker won't vote against it again
Great job! Cost control is key to affordable health care. Proud PA constituent and NVOT graduate!
Thank you!
Cory Booker is just trying to salvage himself for 2020 run! #pharmalovescory
fancy that! Hey @SenatorCantwell & @PattyMurray, you get a chance to redeem yourselves!
Thanks for working on new health insurance law.
Do a mass walkout tonight.
Hey Bernie, you guys had both houses under Obama and never passed this kind of legislation. Why
Yes!!! Unfortunately, this will mean less profit for big pharma so it will be blocked by GOP.
where's @tedcruz ?
@EricBoehlert @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey :  Yes!
Way to go Bernie, grab that tiger by the tail !
just remember the jobs tied to prescription drugs plse
THANK YOU SIRS!!!  THANK YOU!
Canadians have lower drug prices because they have price controls. Legislate price controls in US
Oh THANK GOD. Thank you guys, this means the world for party unity even if you can't get it thru.
thank you Senators!
the only problem is importing drugs gives governments that set prices for drugs a hand in our govt.
you cant just call yourself a "democratic socialist" and push for more socialism.
I like idea, keep on Trump taxing imports
.@SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey  Is Booker coming around? Praise the Lord and pass the pancakes!
I'm very happy to see this!
what changed from when @CoryBooker voted against it last time?
Thank you for your service to this country!
I guess big pharma here is too powerful for you? Way to give up.
All of a sudden this is safe to do now, @CoryBooker? Might wanna check with your pharma donors.
lmao, that response was absolute horseshit.
I thought Booker voted against it last time?
oh ... is @CoryBooker on board now? Those terrible Canadian safety standards no longer an issue? 
great job!  Keep up the good work! We are so very grateful for your efforts.
he had the chance! And squandered it. #votethemout
How so?
Both Senators had voted for the Wyden Amnendment that same day. This brings both bills together.
http://m.dailykos.com/story/2017/1/13/1620234/-So-the-LEFT-is-outraged-over-votes-against-Klobuchar-Amendment-What-about-the-Wyden-s …
Good for them, they are in desperate need to save face
Bernie, please run for president under the People's Party in 2020!!! Your country needs you!
Partnership is like saying Schumer is conservative! Just another Dem Lie!
doing anything to legalize marijuana today or just keep talkin bout drug companies?
glad to hear it. We need more democrats following the Bernie's lead. That is the future of this party.
Bernie, these Corporate scum are not with your struggles for Average People. Please abandon the Dems.
wait Corey voted against your amendment for cheaper drugs. He's in the pocket of pharmaceutical execs
even thought the Canadian drugs are made by the same company Cory bullshitted and said it isn't safe.
no @tedcruz on the team?
.@SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey Just make sure Booker votes for it this time. He's one of the voices who killed your bill last time.
" Trump won't like this!
Yes, assuming Trumps border tax doesn't jack the price right back up again.
Ummm...Do you that's a good idea working with these two? The DNC already screwed you over multiple times.They'll do it again.
But clearly its not based on clear sense in right and wrong. Opportunistic.
at least get us tax rebate for our medical tourism
when will u intro bill?
~ When will you introduce a #SinglePayer Bill or demand that all health insurers become non-profits?! @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey
Way to go, Bern... now you're actually doing something.
it took a relentless backlash for corporate booker to disobey his big pharma donors
I drive down to Mexico and get my prescriptions.
Good luck Bernie!!  I hope you can get it to a vote.
I love it! Thank you B!
This is why I cant take Bernie seriously. #Sellout Booker is a fraud
| ? Why import the same stuff? Reform prescribing practices would help more
Dump @CoryBooker, he's a cancer on your party.  @SenBobCasey is a good guy though.
Please try to stop Direct to Consumer Advertising. It raises the cost of prescription drugs. Thanks
Glad they are on board-But this reads like cops partnering with OJ Simpson to find the real killer
What does that make Republicans in your analogy? Mark Fuhrman? @SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey
the grim manifestation of death itself?
OK. I can dig it.  @SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenBobCasey
Bernie followers woke AF
let's hope #BookerTheHooker doesn't sell himself again and undermine the people of the USA... again.
He has a lot of eyes on him right now it would be political suicide if he did!
Coory Crooker trying to redeem his election chances!
