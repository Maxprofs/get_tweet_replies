@CoryBooker It is high time to come to terms with the fact that you lost the election. Give Trump his cabinet & move on.
You mean like when Obama won the '12 election and the Republicans gave Obama's SCOTUS nominee a chance?
Go look at how many of President Obama's cabinet members were seated by this time in 2009
So it's okay for Repubs to ignore a SCOTUS nom, even though they set the precedent for obstruction?
They were following the "Biden" rule -- No SCOTUS nomination in an election year. It was a risk.
@CoryBooker We don't need nor want him, but the so-called President needs a yes man for attorney general
@CoryBooker Why won't all senators get on the floor and read Mrs. King's speech until XIX is refuted
yet the dems could not block Devros. What can we do to help? Seems the dems are powerless
they got there ass beat bad on election night. I heard it was the worst beating in there party's history
you mean their.  Omg the GOP is a bunch of morons.
Thank you for doing the right thing.  There will be more losses but we're paying attention.
@CoryBooker His family was Republican in the 50s like MLK. The Democrats were the 1s attacking people in Selma.
MLK Sr was Republican until 1960. MLK Jr never was & he voted Dem.
@CoryBooker he absolutely is the Attorney General America needs.
#LetLizSpeak #FaxMitchMcConnell a copy of King's letter if he won't listen to her! http://www.faxmitch.com 
The whole So Called Administration isn't what we need. We DO need proof of collaboration w/ Putin so we can toss them out.
The  #dworkinreport by @funder is that proof
Very true. So what we need now is to have it ACTED on. Let's get this So Called Show on the road!
Sucks to be you. Your Nuclear option will now be biting you in the ass with the Supreme Court pick
disagree Sessions is a perfect choice. We need change what you are doing isn't working.
and you're not a Senator we need. Quit and give us back your pension
@CoryBooker weren't you praising him last year for some bullshit?
Very True! Keep up the great efforts! Keep screaming!
at least HE will uphold the law way better than Lynch./Holder did, you have a problem with people actually doing their job?
unfortunately the GOP will confirm him.
@CoryBooker Thank You Senator for your eloquence and speaking truth to power!!!!
@CoryBooker watching you speak, now! Keep speak up. Brilliant! YOU could be President! Thank you!
Your a racist Cory
@CoryBooker Thank you for your words and your courage, Senator Booker.
@CoryBooker You're a hero, man. Keep up the good work. I watched you bare your soul to protect our schools on C-Span2.
@CoryBooker is Mr Booker a homosexual .
@Leta_says  Just by looking at the people he nominates (and gets pushed thu) tells me what kind of person he is.  Wtf???
@CoryBooker 
You're awesome, Senator Booker.
Don't give up.
And trump is not the pres we need.  It's no longer business as usual.  Impeach him.
@CoryBooker
@CoryBooker you go and go and go! Watching you on CSPAN deliver perspective and a much needed history lesson
@CoryBooker Google Booker/Devos-failed to mention he worked w/Devos on school choice,an advocate & ran on it for election
let us all know when we need to be there for a repeat of last night...we'll be there.
@CoryBooker. Pls. get people together and get Mrs. King's letter read piece by piece to spite Mitch. Tax
#getoveritCory
If we were indeed Trump's white supremacist carnage-strewn hellscape, Sessions would be, but WE'RE NOT.
Because your message is all about hope and healing, right....
@CoryBooker #theoppositeofloveissilence                 #speaktruthtopower
@CoryBooker stop  posturing for votes do the correct action go trump
@CoryBooker thank-you! Watching you now WOW  Speak Truth to Power! What a speech! Thank- you!
@CoryBooker stop  posturing for votes go trump
@CoryBooker Please do your best.  I am heartbroken with what's going on in our country.  I'm scared for me and my family.
@SenWarren Jeff Sessions is unqualified because of his clear history of racism and McConnell clearly is, too.
Thank you for fighting for justice, and with great integrity !
Seems anyone Republicans nominate not good 4 you & USA..one thing for sure is you're not good 4 USA..!
Couldn't you have objected today?
have u heard or read this https://tinyurl.com/jexsn2y  re 'the Bannon-Sessions nexus" Y Sessions is not the AG USA needs
Agreed-LIARS, RACISTS, PLAGIARISM, INSIDER TRADNG Only the Best Trump has to offer USA! Sucks!
#Sessionshearing #TRUMP
please finish reading Coretta Scott King's letter on the Senate floor.
Sessions AG shall restore justice &  order lost during Obama years..& ensure USA values !
@CoryBooker what's to keep the next Senator from continuing to read the letter from King?
@CoryBooker  fact that you oppose him shows US Citizens they need him. What are you afraid of Booker; real law enforcement?
@CoryBooker he is just the person to correct the corrupt, politicised body the DOJ had become under LYING LORETTA LYNCH...
@CoryBooker don't say that on the floor of the Senate.  It'll get you in trouble!
@CoryBooker but he's the ag the minority states want. So be it it lets plan for 2018
@CoryBooker Corey booker is a race pimp race baiter. Hey Corey you don't have a choice whonthe AG is!
@CoryBooker Jeff Sessions is exactly who we need. Thought you were a very fair statesman, not so much anymore
@CoryBooker  And Mitch McConnell is not the House Majority leader we need in the age of Trump.
@CoryBooker - Amen!
@CoryBooker And also that letter by Mrs. Coretta Scott King.
@CoryBooker duh. Gasoline doesn't put out fires
Agree! @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker It's a sad day in USA when Coretta King's words are seen by @MitchMcConell as unfit for Senate floor.
@CoryBooker Totally agree after the fascist Holder and obvious incompetent Hack Lynch, the whole DOJ needs to be drained.
@CoryBooker Amen
Sen Booker is not the kind of lawmaker we need
Obstructionist racist mysoginist do anything for a vote. Split em up Booker!
@CoryBooker  good thing its not up to u ... we lived with the dems choices long enough time for you guys to live with ours
@CoryBooker  thank you Senator for fighting the good fight
@CoryBooker you're right but @SenateGOP is #spinelessrubberstamp
@CoryBooker Ain't gonna happen though.
@CoryBooker look at your self are you better than ever body don't think so quit acting like aPOUS your not hope never will!
WOW ...you are shameful. Your hypocrisy knows no bounds.
@CoryBooker Yep after 8 years of division, we are so screwed
@CoryBooker ...and you & Menendez are not the Senators NJ needs
@CoryBooker after Rule 19 invoked ALL DEMOCRAT Senators should read King letter from last place read and be GAVELED!
@POTUS Senator Booker why did you support Senator Sessions stance on civil rights a short time ago? https://youtu.be/chkAASced_0 
So true.
@CoryBooker join the winning side please for the great state of NJ
@CoryBooker Try to read Coretta Scott's letter. Every one of you holding the floor tonight should try.
the whole administration is what we dont need.I hope people will turn up in November 2018 and fire their Republican Senator
@CoryBooker my answer to Jeff sessions related statements and questions.
@CoryBooker be careful NoLipsMitch will yell impune.
#canwehaveourgovernmentbackyet

@CoryBooker Let's get a woman to impersonate him on @nbcsnl and see how fast he falls. #SNL...ball in court!
It amazes me that a racist majority leader has the nerve to defend a racist Senator for nomination
@CoryBooker neither was DeVos,she got in, so I would like a job in govt, qualifications u ask....dont need them apparently
Uhhhhhh
Hello 
Pensacola here 8 years in Philly
I am aware of his racist politics
Shame and diaguat2
and Coretta Scott king's words are apparently offensive. How do we fight this?
@CoryBooker you can't always get what you want
Shutting down Free Speech on the floor of the Senate?
@CoryBooker Read Mrs. King's letter! #letlizspeak
The next Attorney General needs to be faithful to the United States Constitution as it is written, not as they think it so.
@Preach_Council Do not want to go back to Jim Crow ideas. Country needs to go forward not backwards.
do you think America needed Eric holder and Loretta Lynch?  if so why?
Thank you, Senator Booker!
Yes, he is.  He's just not the one you need 
#ConfirmSessions

then stop him. Don't let him win a roll call vote. Refuse and resist. #welcometo yournewjob
@MiaFarrow No but he's the one we're getting.
and DeVos wasn't a good pick for ed sec - #DoBetter
@AnneRiceAuthor he is not acceptable.he won't stand up to trump. they are trying to drag us back to the 50's. Ridiculous.
@MiaFarrow Cory is right on many levels.
On to our next battle!
how is this country not permanently fucked?
YES!
Sen Cory Booker Loves the good peoples in his home State and the good peoples of America. I support you Sen. Booker. ;)
