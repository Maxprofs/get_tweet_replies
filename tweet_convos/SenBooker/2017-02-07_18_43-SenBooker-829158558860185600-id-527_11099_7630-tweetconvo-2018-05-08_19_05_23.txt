Actually she was silenced for breaking Rule 19, I am sure you know, yes?  oh, sorry forgot dems above the law.

Corretta Scott King also warned about illegals

He's ust whipping up the BRAIN DEAD voter base into hysteria, when he gets booted out he can join Obama's SG
Dems are powerless against GOP right now
The voice of the majority of voters cannot and will not be silenced

Really?!?!  Seriously?!?!  Grab a warm bottle of milk and ludes.
#fakesenators
@SenWarrenNeither Neither King's widow or the communist King himself have any authority over free men.
She was silenced because she broke the rules! Stop the rave baiting....it's disgusting!
Warren knows what she's doing with King letter. Shutdown but ready on FB podcast. Will America remember in 2020?
also helpful:  if you could post a list of those who voted against her speaking...handy, come election time.
The parties have basically reversed since then. Anyway, I very much agree with your portrayal of Trump as a puppet.
@CoryBooker this is a #SoCalledPresident who doesn't know whether a strong or a weak dollar is a good thing...
you give nice speeches. But you are a class A hole
@HoeflerCo @SenWarren we got your back Booker.
He's being investigated right now like a true corrupt Dem.
REALLY 31 yr old letter! Q: Is Cory, Liz & Jeff the same people in 1986 that they are now? A: NO! People change!
Fake Tweet. Factually inaccurate.
Move on!
I hope her state doesn't re-elect her if so they are just as crazy as she is. The woman is insane.
Nope. #FakeNews
She was silenced for breaking rules. Rules like laws should be followed by EVERYONE.
Dems. are above rules & laws.
Could you b any more dishonest? 0% to do with King. 100% to do with senate rules on disparagement. #learnyourjob
Session rc'd NAACP award by Booker with praise! 8 yrs later you stab him in back just to advance career for 2020
after being fucked by Obama for 8 years we dont care.
They gave some, need more?  How many red lines did he draw....failed fixed elections?
I was thinking of maybe just slapping him...with a chair..in the face
I thought a chair would be more accessable, but I would love to take a tire iron to his ugly turtle face
Violence is the answer to everything for you libtards, LOL. #MAGA
I call B.S. Booker. Stop spinning the truth. Have you no shame?
Cory, why are you lying to your consituents? Didn't work for Obama, or #Fauxcahontus Won't work for you!
Cory do you still feel like Rosa Parks in back of bus? Do you believe that will help, using race card for 2020?

So what is your point Booker? A little more to the story in the last 30 years if u bother to look.
no she was silenced for breaking the rules. Just like u praised sessions so did Mrs. King! Selective memories
Every Democratic senator should read the letter on the floor. Force the GOP to silence King over and over and over again.
Maybe @SenateMajLdr needs a copy of the letter faxed to his office. fax: (202) 224-2499
She broke the rules, Dems. don't follow rules or laws though.
@SenatorRubio 3 million and more want to hear Mrs. Kings letter read! Stop shutting down freedom of speech!
HYPOCRITE, she broke the rules,was spewing LW hatred against another senator

Every Democrat in the Senate must read that letter. Let them silence each one of you. @TheDemocrats. Please RT.
the party that didn't want the constitution read.  Only a matter of time before the rest get over your b.s.
to ignore the redistricting is comparing apples to oranges.
Not true. She was censored for reading disparaging remarks from the late Senator Ted Kennedy.
@IrishRose23525 @SenBookerOffice @SenWarren Lizzie broke senate rules!She was disparaging a fellow senator.I vote to lock her up!
@CoryBooker @SenWarren -We must vote out every one of their asses in midterm elections and the main ones.
@ukexpat19 @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @SenWarren We got to figure out why half of registered voters actually voted!
That's a stupid reason to avoid voting.
actually she broke the rules, but we all know Dems. don't follow rules or laws.
here you go, do this:
Sen. McConnell didn't want this letter read on the senate floor. Maybe he'll like it when we call his office to read it to him? 202.224.2541 
While you're at it, play this video of MLK's niece. http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/careersandeducation/dr-alveda-king-sen-sessions-has-done-things-to-advance-justice-in-america/vp-BByaiTJ …
...YEAH, he's harmless (NOT)...all the video did was @CoryBooker impressed me, even more.
Wrong. She was told to be quiet because SHE BROKE SENATE RULES. Sheesh.
actually she broke the rules.  There are rules even if dems don't want 2 follow them.  Maybe u should read them
Lying senators! Udon't deserve 2 b in Congress! Warren broke rules n letter not relevant coz CK made peace w/ JS
wtf is the matter with u? Unamerican pos
She was "silenced" because she broke the rules.  If you can post the letter on SM was she really silenced?
Liar. Tell the real reason why she was stopped and it had NOTHING to do with who wrote the letter. #dishonest
..you are being dishonest.  She broke the rules which was why she was silenced.
She was repeating Ted Kennedy's slurs, that's why she got censured. Letter was read by folk who follow the rules
yur tweet is wrong and a lie she was silenced for breaking senate rules period!
You are such a race-baiter. And YOU are not an Indian. Lmao
LIAR! She was silenced for breaking the rules, don't push this racist BULLSHITTERY. Americans are SICK of that.
HEY booker she violated rule 19 of the Senate! Let it go because you are done when election time comes!
Nice try. You know that's not the reason.
McConnell will ride Trump's coat/tails right into hell if necessary.
GOOD! She tried to sneak around Senate rules by hiding behind a letter from a truly biased woman. Busted ~
Please work effectively & quickly for. Quit partisan antics & running for 2020!!!!!
Coretta Scott King doesn't believe that anymore (It's been 30 yrs since she said that!) & retracts her statement
@CoryBooker @SenWarren Liars!! She was silenced because she attacked another senator calling him a disgrace!!! Stop lying!!
This is how they get her to run for pres and get @realDonaldTrump another 4 years. America goes as middle votes
thank you
get your story straight, #warren violated rule19 by calling a fellow senator names via her mouth or late Ms King
How do you fight a dictator and win?   Sad state our country is in.
oh please
@toryjohnson @SenWarren So let me ask u both this- why'd she wait until now to oust Sessions? Money & campaigning.
@2020fight @SenWarren too little too late bruh AG Sessions confirmed. Boom!!!!
@kalamazoomi1 @SenWarren More indignation, more division more crippling our unity. Equality comes thru tolerance.
@kalamazoomi1 @SenWarren What was said 30 yrs ago was irrelevant. We evolve as people, our likes and dislikes change.
This decisionWillCostU millionsOfVotes&huge support @realDonaldTrump Sessions=SMD (small man disease)
HeBites!
Sen. Booker - follow Liz' lead.  As Hamilton the musical says, #Riseup!!!!
thank you both for standing up to racist cronies. So glad you're in Washington!
I honestly don't know how you keep from punching him right in the face.  Just go for it.  We'll bail you out.
@LeslieMarshall @SenWarren This 30 year old letter was predicated on incorrect and inaccurate information. Can ppl change?
you are a joke expecially if you speak for Elizabeth Warren go away dude
Right on!
Everyone should send this letter - via USPS/hardcopy, to Mr McConnell @SenBookerOffice @SenWarren
it's been known for sometime @SenateMajLdr is a disgrace to KY and USA.  This should be expected from him......
.....after he stymied the initial #RussianHacking.  Thank god  #ShePersisted
"Hear Ye  Hear Ye"  "Big Mouth Liz - - Senate and McConnell have spoken and "Slapped Your Ass Down" So   S-T-F-U
This was priceless!!
because  @SenTedCruz calling @SenateMajLdr a liar was just fine, but Mrs. King's words weren't.  Okay. 
@kristindiversi @SenWarren You supported Sessions last year. You just want to run for President in 2020 as Obama 2.0 ! 
why because she was a woman ? Becareful.!
As we can all see, falls on @SenateGOP deaf ears. Regardless of majority of Americans. They know it & care not
@SharonJ44257163 @SenWarren Outrageous. Do not allow yourself to be Silenced. Do not allow yourself to be Distracted!
Being that he was going to be rubber stamped! All of you dem senators should have attempted to read the letter!
Blumenthal meet with Repubs pick for the stolen seat on the SCOTUS, Shld Dems drop their support for Blumenthal?
I suppose Mrs. King has known Sessions since he was little enough to wear a pillowcase to meetings.
she was told not to speak & like usual she & most democrats have a tough time FOLLOWING RULES & the law!
and that is called policy and procedure Ben it had nothing to do with what she was reading fauxahontas

there your rules, live by them.
. McConnell needs to stuff a sock in his mouth
thank you
mcconnell should be censured. He is a criminal and unethical
And then Orrin Hatch got up and talked jibberish for half hour
@realDonaldTrump @MitchMcConell  then end of democracy lies ahead for our nation with Mitch in charge
@MikeTanier @SenWarren you should read the letter on the Senate floor...all Dem Senators should.
Did you also include Corretta S Kings PRAISE of Sen Sessions on Rosa Parks Library?
Keep Standing for US Senator Warren get back on the floor.."banned"?? tell them to BAN THIS !! #FightingForAll !
we the people believe in freedom of speech but not at our expense #doitonyourowntime libertard not in Congress
Mien kampf Trump &Swamp Rats cant handle strong women!Or Truths!Shows them up 2 much!
@Preservationist @SenWarren  #shepersisted
she broke senate rules criticizing another sitting senator. What shameful behavior for her to do. So sad
.@SenBookerOffice Good tweet-still not clear how u & @Menendez4NJ plan 2 vote on #Sessions | @SenWarren @SenateDems @SenSchumer @njdotcom
@CoryBooker @SenWarren  we are outraged by the Senates behavior towards Senator Warren.  Impeach them all
Trump won and won big by taking many many "blue" states.  Accept it and move on. Enough childish behavior !!!!!!
@KatieQLowes @SenWarren Awesome job to silence this asz  fraud "social justice warrior". No proof. So meeting adjourned.
Not fair play, but expected!
@CoryBooker @SenWarren @RepMaloney I agree. Block Sessions.
Thought she (CSK)was dead??
WAHWAHWAH. Keep crying. Keep virtue-signaling. Keep losing (it). We'll keep WINNING! #MAGA 
@SenateDems @SenWarren
The American people are watching @TheDemocrats disgraceful behavior, this is why you lost!!
Senator McConnell and his ilk should be ashamed of themselves. Bravo Senator Warren. This is the Twilight Zone.
She broke the rules, and you played into her 2020 campaign. #ShameOnPoliticalTheater
Amen Sist'ah 
Well  said !
your voice is being heard. Keep fighting,GOP Alternative Facts must be stopped. Say NO to Jeff Session AG
Jesus Christ. You all say criminals can be rehabilitated but suspend belief for anyone else. Man's not raycist!
@DavidCornDC
Authoritarianism is not creeping, it's here. Given time, it only becomes more difficult to fight.
@MMcFaddenWNDU @SenWarren ..she was warned it was against House rules,she kept reading, House had no choice but to shut her
@MMcFaddenWNDU @SenWarren ..as usual, fake news, Warren was warned that the language she was reading was against House rule
Great,  She's a liberal freak.
Shameful to silence Senator Warren for reading the letter from Coretta Scott King, Shameful!
Booker are you going to speak out about the way libs are trying to silence conservaives on campus?
lies like this are why WE voted Trump.....wait till 2018 BYE BYE
@CoryBooker @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @doctordi11 @drwrunaka @dynamicdaphne This is going to be a problem?
READ THE CONSTITUTION...if you want to quote something, quote that...
Will you, Sir read the letter on her behalf on the Senate floor?
Did I read that McConnell's wife will have a cabinet position in Justice?
Listen to Dr. Alveda King, MLK's niece. https://youtu.be/R3vGeTZw7uE 
False. Letter was OK. She was reprimanded for repeating Kennedy's disparaging remarks.
@LeighLis @SenWarrenhttps://twitter.com/ten_gop/status/829336657350508544
Mitch McConnell is a threat to the democracy of this country.
its from 1986  so people cant change in 30 years?
silenced for breaking rules not for reading Coretta.  U must be a racist!
Booker, the  NAACP gave him an award for his civil rights activities. And you still call him racist.
We are with you! Help be our voice. @SenBookerOffice @SenWarren
@realJKCallaway @SenWarren You can make this about race if you want. But it isn't. Senator Warren was hating as usual.
What will you do, Sen. Booker.
It seems that roaches and @SenateMajLdr have something in common. They both avoid light, hiding in darkness.
@tharp_tara @SenWarren read it
McConnell is an asshole, we all know that. I didn't know about this letter.Thanks turtle for bringing awareness!
what are you planning to do about it?
.@SenBookerOffice @SenWarren So? She's dead, the letter is decades old, she lied in it. So what?
Follow the rules!!!  She did it with full knowledge to intimate Rep.
I tired of Mitch McConnell playing his games
Doesn't appear she was correct. "Devastating effect" never materialized. Plus, there's this...
disgusting.
Senator Booker I did so last night and will continue to.
Are you not commenting on King saying Pres Reagan was bringing the Ku Klux Klan? #definitionbyagenda
When @SenateMajLdr ignores racist behavior, he is complicit in that behavior.
Rules are rules. I guess you and a few others don't think so.
She was "silenced" for breaking the rules. You know this. I used to have respect for you.

Senate rules silenced Faux Princess Running Bullshit.
anyone else think we are in a fascist state?
Please start censure proceedings against @SenateMajLdr for his sexist anti free speech actions in shutting down @SenWarren
@chasejarvis @SenWarren so she's using her opinion of what she "thinks" Mr King would say? Of course this shouldn't b used!
.@SenBookerOffice @SenWarren She was silenced for breaking the rules of Senate. Shame you lie with such partisan ease.
Historical context: The 1836-44 gag was to prevent discussion of abolition in Senate. Appalling move by McC.
there are millions of other letters favoring Sessions. Stop using Mrs King as a prop. Get over it!
Except that's not why she was silenced....but you already know that. Keep the propaganda flowing, though.
you folks do understand she broke senate rules. She picked up the Coretta Scott King for show. She's all show 
@CoryBooker @SenWarren Silence can speak volumes.
Next time you speak Please read the letter
read the rules.
keep fighting for democracy. Thank you.
Read and RT this piece of American history not allowed on the GOP controlled US Senate
This is not America
