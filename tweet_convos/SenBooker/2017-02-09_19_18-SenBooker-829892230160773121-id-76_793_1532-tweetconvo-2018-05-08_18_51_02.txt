women can buy contraceptives at most drug stores. They don't need my help or money to access them. Spreading false facts!
,So women don't deserve more than condoms for birth control? Otherwise, safe, effective contraceptives require RX @SenBookerOffice
wife got more than condoms at drug store get your facts straight. Why do  you need RX when you have PP?
no script for PP, script needed for Pill. Dr appt needed for IUD, shot & hormone implant.
Go to the Dr Office but u don't need me or my money to go there & get either, right? Do you want my approval?
ALSO that's where ACA helps.Lower cost of BC. Too much $$? Fine. Don't complain about # kids on welfare
judge much?? When did I complain about kids on welfare? My guess is I have done more 4 them personally than u
So, you're ok paying taxes for kids on welfare & not the $$ to prevnt pregs in the 1st place? Twilight Zone much??
Grateful to ACA. It insured I had health coverage during my 1st pregnancy #ACA
#TomPrice >> #SoWrong
@DavidYankovich There's not one.  There are hundreds of thousands!!!
thank you for standing up for women in NJ and the rest of the country! I am grateful for your leadership!
@dumptrump33 I've got an idea. Anyone who wants to keep #BirthControl UNaffordable can keep their penis out of a vagina!
@DavidYankovich bring me to him! I'm one of those women!!!
@DavidYankovich no on price he is a sexist pig. @SenateGOP
You can tell him millions of women would gladly shove his male privilege up his arse.
Years before, I was denied BC they said I had too many paps done. It was precancer spot on cervix needed removal. Asses
@DavidYankovich Tom Price should come to work with me & see what it's like for a woman to get health care.
and you're a traitor killing Sanders-Klobuchar. Too compromised to even call for independent counsel to investigate WH russ
This is the disgusting SOB Tom Price A crooked bastard if ever this was one
@DavidYankovich I claimed bankruptcy because of ovarian cancer at 27 & the fall out of chronic illness after
Not affordable 4 me 2 see a doctor. I have 2 pay almost 10k a yr before ins pays 1 dime. Time 2 work 2gether 4 every 1! NOW
Thank you!
Tom Price is a fool. he should be a woman for just ONE day, & then would love to hear his BS
WHAT IS UP WITH THESE MEN!!! Omg ITS AWFUL HOW THEY THINK!!!!
Wow... he's completely wrong and out of touch.
Guess we know where the next Million Woman March is headed.
-This nation is being destroyed in plain view by this madman fascist trump regime. Do we need a civil war to wake reps up?
-Price traitor 2 US Just sworn n 2 the trump regime This 1 will c that women/children/elderly/disabled/ minorities die soon
@Kinniska  Girl on the pill purely for medical reasons. The cost is horrible! But the little blue pill is covered
@Kinniska Price has no clue... None at all
There are millions who lost their insurance due to Obamacare with super high deductibles, and high prices!
The level of this entire administration's denial would do a freight addict proud. Time for a major intervention
I can't believe he said that.  (Note: I can but I'm appalled)
Wow, Tom Price is an utter sexist bigot in addition to being an insider-trader.  A perfect fit for Trump/Bannon
Mr. Price:  There is no sales tax on viagra or rogaine but there is on tampons and sanitary pads. Say What?
@Suzy_Makher 
@harveyjkaye yes bc b4 ACA women were considered a per-exsisting condition
What world do these people live in? Obviously not a woman's world.
Birth control pills have many health benefits women find medically necessary besides simply preventing pregnancy. #ACA
@PPact we can't afford to pay insurance and college for my son at the same time. He is attending college.
be sure you vote NO!
3 women in my immediate family alone - coverage now cause of #saveaca #PriceIsWrong
@NoLiesLizzy Me!
with my very good employer sponsored insurance my copay for contraception was $75/mo before ACA. How many can afford that?
@PPact  you can bring me to Tom Price
Maybe #TomPrice should look for one in Mitt's binder full of women...No? Maybe not.
Never would it be accepted that men are responsible for beginning a family yet this basic right is denied to women.
@PPact We need real change and people who will fight & not just pay lip service & then vote with GOP. @justicedems!
@PPact Rich! You voted with GOP in favor of big pharma, you need to be primaried!  No more corrupt corporate Democrats!
I have a son who is the result of lapsed BCP due to not having the $ to pay for BC. I adore him but at the time $ was tight
I'm impressed Price knows so much about my uterus & its needs.Being a man, he understands it much better than I can!
I tried to come up with a sarcastic comment like I've done with @realDonaldTrump. This is just horrifying and pathetic.
@RepTomPrice @SenBookerOffice I have a sibling (45) who was uninsurable b4 ACA. She'd gone w/o health insurance for most of her adult life.
@PPact They struggled with prescription drug prices too.. Thanks for that BTW.
@PPact #1 doucher
Hi Tom. I was left behind. I'm a SAHM. Had to take myself off husband's insurance so we could afford it for our children.
I'd also LOVE to work & get my own insurance, but childcare is too expensive. My husband is a MS teacher & we struggle.
@DSenFloor This infuriates me. Seeing that you used a Happy Gilmore ht does make me smile through the anger; ty for that.
Put me in front of him. I'll tell him some stories about being a young women without much money in the 1990s.
I was working for a company that got ED pumps to diabetic MEDICARE patients 4 no cost while I was paying $65/mo for pills
men's erections are very important.
, I am one.  Thank you for fighting for us.
Price wrote his condemnation, great, fair minds are definitely not coming together in this administration.
@PPact Wow! He's certainly out of touch. How about that white male privilege?!? #rejectprice
@PPact hi
Me! I was refused contraception before the #ACA. Then, that unplanned pregnancy was called a preexisting condition.
I wish any of this was a joke. @SenBookerOffice @PPact
Thank you for voting "a resounding full-throated NO" on Price @CoryBooker
I'll be happy to introduce him a few hundred of them and their families!
maybe all the women who had no medical care before ACA should pay him a visit at his office. Need another woman's march.
Keep the government off my body!! #resist
2 presume all Am. women can afford copay 4 bc is 2 assume all Am.s can afford lunch. #'s are sm. but results R significant.

Tom Price should be brought up on insider trader charges!!!
Hey Bookie. Your graphic says "one women." #learnEnglish #Booker2020 #Trumped
ewwww how did Trump get into the oval????
I grabbed it by the pussy. Want a job? #MAGA #westillhaveopenings
Yet how many of the GOP are going to vote to confirm him? Spoiler alert: Probably all of them. #partyofnoethics
Yes @SenBookerOffice I know one. my daughter turns 26 this year. She will be left behind without ACA
tell Tom that before the ACA I was told I couldn't get coverage at any price due to pre-existing conditions.
and when I had coverage before ACA, birth control was prohibitively expensive
