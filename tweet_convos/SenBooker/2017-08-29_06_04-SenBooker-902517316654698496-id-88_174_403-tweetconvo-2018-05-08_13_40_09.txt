How about the recent Guatemala deport-High School grad,Montgomery Co
MD? He was found dead in the truck trailer at Texas Walmart.
Vote out all Democrats
...but the congress of the us hopefully will stand behind us promises
Narcissists with delusions of grandeur do not ever stand by their word cuz they always lie
He has no heart, stop w the language. Join GOP get a bill done. We won't have DJT tossing these citizens! Charge ICE for human rights viola
Cuts to Medicare, threat to DACA, protections for LGBT, reversal of affirmative action on campuses -broken promises! Needs to be accountable
Hey @SenBookerOffice I guess you don't meet with military Veterans?? Your office is rude. Lost my vote. What do you show? Hate for vets?
He only cares if you have a sexual preference that is NOT heterosexual, otherwise, dont waste your time on this self loving bozo.
How much do you care for the young citizen adults of New Jersey, by keeping them HIGH?
You do realize that 95% of trump's words are lies right?
Well, you know, they call you KKK. They did me. I think it's an honor, right? Means we're doing something,” Arpaio said of the comparison.
Are you kidding me? Your talking about pathological lying trump?
sadly Trump's word means nothing
THE DEMOCRATS SLAVERY NEEDS TO END

Many of our kids were dreamers also, but they are dead, overdosed or are paralyzed by their addictions? Where is your heart?
Hoe about you showing great heart and fight to make the lives of your voters better, like healthcare, jobs, DRUGS off the street, crime
#DefendDACA
Research shows that DACA beneficiaries will contribute $460.3 billion to U.S. gross domestic product over next decade! Should this stop?

Which time?  Which words?  He is a walking disaster
YOU need to show us #WhatsInYourWallet do you need an #ObamaCare card?

https://youtu.be/1-BCJ3bJxpY . Let's Get Our Facts Correct. Corruption inside Democratic Party they are CORRUPT.
I do not understand why so called dreamers are receiving more attention than our own citizens?
What part of illegal don't you get?  Since when do people who break the law not pay the penalty? Dreamers lead to more illegal immigration
45s great heart is set to destroy anything that Obama did no matter what
What part about illegal can't you understand? It's like a white lie is still a lie.
Whats that word you use to describe one who seeks to undermine a nations democracy and sovereignty and supports violent, anarchist groups?
Would be better if at real Donald Trump had a heart. All he has is lies

He's shown the middle finger to DREAMers and the rest of the world.
the congress needs to stand up for dreamers the us gov promised them sanctuary if they registered trump has no integrity...
And tell me booker, what have you done?
He has a liver for a heart
I am a dreamer for US citizens who are struggling. We need to take care of our own people first before we try and take on the world.
Sorry to say if you think he's going to keep the program you're dreaming. He won't honor anything he said in the campaign. He has no honor.
He can't show what he doesnt have
Pres IS about leadership & heart every day.Big question; can Dems EVER stop screaming racism to get more votes since Trump is not racist!!
Dreamers are also citizens here who are minorities and pushed out of jobs for white dreamers. People like the white temps in the summer.
You are supporting an organized crime group of human traffickers that cause massive suffering all over the world with this fake compassion.
No, dreamers are ILLEGAL and a drain on America. His heart is with Americans. #nodaca DEPORT ALL ILLEGALS
Stand by his words?  Did you see #LiarInChief trending?  Better to be thought a fool than to speak up and remove all doubt->#trump speaks up
Good luck with that.
Please. He can't stand by his words. Not possible.
I hope some of the compassion shown to Texans will be reciprocated
You need to have a great heart to show one.  Trump is bankrupt...
Right now Americans are worry about other Americans being flooded out of their homes...but you go right ahead with your BS
And @SenateDems & @SenateGOP need to #ImpeachTrump
You are not serious, our President. Won't happen in my life time.
How about US citizens first? Every US child must live w/ parents criminal decisions...NJ foster care glut
Hahaha   Dream on (pun intended)
"I don't stand by anything." - Donald J Trump
Heart? He doesn't have a heart
Does he have a HEART? for anyone? Show it in Texas today
He has no heart, no soul. PLEASE. Get rid of him. I'm barely hanging on.
Fight for Dreamers this is thier country the only one they have known what if we were all sent back to our country of origin
A action based on pandering statement,not going to happen.
POTUS plan is to bargain Dreamers for the Wall
Thanks for protecting DACA
He wants to use this money for his wall
He could, if he had a heart. He's a morally corrupt, vile human who needs to go. He revealed who is years ago, believe him.
This is just another example among so many that prove he is mentally incapable of the position of @Potus - #UnfitForOffice
What's scary is if trump is dumped we get Pence
Illegal bottom feeders.
You're using 'trump' & 'heart' in the same sentence Senator. You should know better by now......evil has no heart just selfishness & greed!
Box-of-rocks @POTUS doesn't have a "great heart" but does have a small mind.
No they broke the law!
I was born in America not Russia.

Stop asking him to stand by his words. IMPEACHMENT is all that needs to happen.
Focus on Texas please. Many of those DREAMers live in Texas as I am sure you know. Bet they are more worried about flooding and loss of life
He won't. He's a heartless, odious, self serving narcissist.
Trump needs to resign
@realDonaldTrump standing by his words? That's a good one. 
Trump just pardoned the man who would  put  dreamers under arrest.So much for great heart.
when anyone benefits from an illegal act and you let it go you just encourage more illegal acts whats so hard to understand about that?
@CoryBooker please cosponsor the DREAM Act and ensure its passage before Trump nullifies DACA! #DefendDACA
