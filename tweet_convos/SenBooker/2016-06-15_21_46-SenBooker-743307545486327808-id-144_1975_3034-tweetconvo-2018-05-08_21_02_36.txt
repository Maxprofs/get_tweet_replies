@jack @ChrisMurphyCT Shorter: The clueless blink blue
@staggs8309 @ChrisMurphyCT Does it sparkle when I respond to this tweet?  Anyway, awesome job, Senator Murphy!

"Gun violence"? How about "psychopathic radical Muslim violence"?

interesting to see where Twitter users are
interesting that Florida is so engaged. Although no indications of support or resistance
I wonder about scale here since we in #yyj are represented(?!) Level of engagement not obvious actually :(
