@CoryBooker @TeaPainUSA @AynRandPaulRyan The one that benefits from private prisons are the owners themselves #ImpeachTrump
Hillary got the private prision industry campaign money, look it up.
@SenBookerOffice@TeaPainUSA @AynRandPaulRyan Obama was getting rid of the private prisons your jack ass is bringing them back
I didn't mention Trump, I mentioned the facts that I thought were shocking on who took their campaign money.
@CoryBooker all I'm saying is get rid of the private prisons we don't need them in this country. #Freedom
Mike, you don't understand why we have them. There is not enough space for immigration processing.
under the new travel ban then we won't need them we're just gonna send them back @CoryBooker ?
You might be right.
they have a quota?!? Why is there a quota? No wonder some aren't objecting to this!!
They don't need a quota for the 2 million Obama rounded up. Clinton got their campaign dollars, look it up.
Why bring up Obama and Clinton for something Congress enacted, @Burbankbonds ? Everyone but Trump.
Congress didn't enact a quota for private prisions, ICE contacts with private prisons to handle the amount of detentions.
When you're doing business in America you need a business license, who gave the prison system it's license??
Is that a real question?
@kimmie8264 I want stats on Trump, DT Admin, and Congressmen invested in private prison system. Can you help, Mr. Booker?
Hillary Clinton got the private prison campaign money, look it up. @BuserMary
I certainly will. But with REAL news sources... not Breitbart.
The actual numbers are shocking not just for Clinton but for all politicians.
so Mr. Booker can change this all by himself? Who knew!!
quite a generalization. Must be easy to think in absolutes like that.
he's writing it now, or so his people told me.
@Fixer_guy Get profit out of our social institutions.
You're asking the wrong ppl bc #ClintonMafia HELPED DO THIS

 @SenBookerOffice We SEE YOU B

@mmyron1018 Yep, detention facilities and privatized prisons ... Money machines for the rich.
that made no sense...defending criminal's rights...oh I forgot, you appear to be an African non USA.
@CoryBooker is working HARD to draw attention away from the fact that he's just another big pharma wh*re! Daaaaayam!!
or there is more than one issue. Also, he is working on a bill now to import SAFE meds.
Booker is a non stop liar takingfrom pharma and even DeVos because he's really a Republican/corporatist. He backed Bernie..
only when called out for siding with Repubs on the drug import resolution. He couldn't even stand with Dems on principle. 
his message here is important.
Yeah....that's beautiful...wake me up when he stops talking and actually does something...ANYTHING of any substance.
What's wierd is how much money the private prison industry gave to Hillary Clinton campaign. Check it out.
We need to end private prisons.
then why don't we send them back?  Why do we pay to keep them here?
isn't it the same for private prisons in general? don't forget cheney/gonzalez impeachment in texas
weird that someones life can amount to a few extra digits in someone's bank account, confining someone to +comfort 4another
.@SenBookerOffice Are you bragging about one of your largest donors here Booker? #BookerTheDonorHooker
American workers benefit as illegals aren't stealing jobs from them by working for less than tax paying Americans!
Can you really buy stock in American prisons? Wow! Now that is truly insane!
nobody so deport them it's that damn simple get to work get it done
YOU LOCK SO MANY MORE PEOPLE UP FOR PETTY DRUG CRIMES THIS CONCERN IS BIAS AND NONSENSICAL
that would require getting money out of politics. Something to match your big  donors will not allow you to do
Private prisons should be outlawed. Some things should not be for profit. One private prison was starving inmates 4 profits
We need to take some out and #deport them!
Thank you for your clarity, your integrity, your courage and your compassion, Senator Booker. I stand with you on this.
Everything that goes on in the new White Nationalist Party is about profit for the wealthy, they will never have enough.
The more the people rise up, the more the government will create laws to prevent them!
What crimes have they committed to be locked up?
send them back it's easy It's only difficult because you make it Ask that girl in MD how she feels. They all need to go
@ResistTilDeath $!$?$?$?$?$?$?$ Surely you knew it is taxpayer dollars they want.
It breaks my heart, this trump hysteria, and I do stand with you, however I am a Canadian.
stop all votes until hearings/investigations complete #OrangeDuce #Guilty #LockHimUp
it has bothered me for years that this happens. Even more so that most people are complacent with it.
that seems like a low number
Obama had 8 years to fix immigration, he fixed absolutely nothing...
deported more people than any other president
Worst president ever, Obama sucks!!
I wonder who your fifth largest donor is and what industry are they connected to???
ok Booker let's your solution! I'm behind you 100%
remove them from office
@barbfeldon1 - who sets "the quota?" #endthequota
PLEASE don't support corporate Democrats like Sen. Booker, Abdul. PLEASE! This just makes me cringe. 
And you're STILL wondering why we rejected the #ClintonMafia a third time?!
What about the big lie for 80 years on the plant we all know if food Cory?Do your job. Move the plant off Schedule 1 to FDA
@CoryBooker $1.3 trillion in debt can be paid off in 20 years at $65 billion per year..we can handle that right??
@CoryBooker Cory when you gonna get on the floor of the Senate and propose paying off existing student loan debt??
#endthequota
@trentoll A forked tongue speaking out of both sides of his mouth; the post modern Democrat. There will be consequences.
@trentoll For heaven's sake Cory, let's not lock them up even temporarily. You'll need a better schtick to run for office.
Man i thought that was Keegan-Michael Key.. Just for a second i was happy..
While impt to attack quotas, even worse r the policies that require detn of immgrnts w/o hrngs on danger and flight risk.
Those policies lead to thousands of people who need not be det'd, many of whom will won their cases, held for no reason.
disgusting
we need real progressives in the Democratic Party not people like you, Cory booker that are corrupted by money.
don't think this will get my vote if you run in 2020. You sold out to the pharmaceutical companies.
#DonTheCon
isn't it true that some of Trump donors have stock in private prisons?
inmate quota is written into private prison contracts
All I know is President is highly unqualified for being Chief of staff in our country!  File criminal charges!
@RoughAcres Private Prison model is beyond Draconian.
Who on Trump's staff Cabinet  ( or DT'S kids etc) own STOCK in private prisons?
How many of these people are children?
thank you. We stand & stand tall but the juice is in the ACTION. What action can we take to #EndTheQuota
this is just horrid. #GetOutTrump
totally agree but you need to stand up to big pharma.  #healthcarenotwealthcare #HealthcareIsAHumanRight
This is sick
@pondandkolb How many prisoners are paroled due to laws about overcrowding and then reoffend and come right back?
@KansasLib terrible!!! What has happened to this ONCE great nation
Amen Sen Booker. How we wish U had been Clinton's running mate.
@1StarFleetCadet The prison owners,private company's!!
I've been saying this since Trump administration lifted restrictions on new contracts w/private prisons. Keep saying it!
CCA and GEO Jails are happy with the fool in the WH
@Lee_in_Iowa  Private Prison is legalized slavery. What incentive is there to let anyone out?
Empty the prisons. Send them back to their home countries?
#PrivatePrisons & NJ's County Govts both profit. Essex, Hudson & Bergen generate $10's of millions. Soon Cape May will too.
@HiJCP BLAH BLAH BLAAAAAH BLAH BLAHHHH!
you continue to amaze me and we all applaud you, the truth is what we need in the American government again, thank you
ok I with you
@shreec I wonder if other efforts could benefit from the resources expended herewith?
thank you for pointing this out
I stand with you! #EndTheQuota
Agreed.  Started in 2009 with Senator Byrd.  Time to relook at this.
Quota? WTF?
@CoryBooker send them back home. Cheaper than detaining
send them back instead of detention then
@kimbudant Watch 13th, people. Netflix
@samswey #endthequota  End private prisons!
I'm with you, as are many others, this is sick and wrong, please let us know what we can do.
@Donotriverme Economically makes no sense. Fascism doesn't care about people as long as the Il Duce is happy. #FascistaInWH
When communities threaten to kill Christians for having meetings in their own homes. There is concern. JAX FL
if immigration law wasfollowed in the first place people wouldnt think they can sneak in illegally and end up in det.fac.
why dont you start with campaigning against lockin folks up for weed......while others who do worse get less time....
Go away Cory, you and the establishment democrats are the problem and the reason Trump is there.
thank you for your courage. Please continue to keep us educated and responsible to change this ongoing horror.
thank you for speaking up #EndTheQuota
What is the best thing we citizens can do, @SenBookerOffice, to fight against this outrageous system of oppression and profit?
Wow! Thank you for shedding light on this! Was not aware that there is a quota! Thank you for speaking values over profit!
Thank you for your stand, @CoryBooker! Grateful to have you as my Senator.
By locking up people, they cannot continue working, supporting their families.
Need to study that economic impact.@pjhnsn8
@philtering1 Love Cory Booker's political philosophy. See good future ahead for him. He looks out for all Americans.
Deport them faster.
police state for profit
@axomamma oh you mean the ones like Trump's buddies own? He wants to expand privitization.
@BeautyBind private prisons are a stain on our national reputation and soul.
For profit private prisons who supported Trump
defending non US citizens against US law. Are there no issues you can defend for those you actually represent?
don't forget the weed smokers & ppl that can't afford $300 bail. #EndJailQuotas #prisonSlavery.
I STAND WITH YOU AGAINST PRIVATE PRISONS
ya, nothing to do with protecting American citizens, when our elected officials start justify our lives it time to impeach.
My wife and I rely like you Cory. Please keep up the good work that you are doing for us. Thank you
@CoryBooker Which group will be next?
And guess what, Cory? YOU benefit from it, too!
@se4realhinton No prisons should be privatized.
2020 ????
.@SenBookerOffice @deray the problem with that is where was your voice Maxine Waters needed someone to sign a bill to possibly stop @POTUS .
@SuelouiseS  And which friends or spawn have holdings in the privatization of federal prisons?
making a prision population requirement seems a lot scarier than corp greed - Thank you for standing up for us
Privatization of prisons began while Reagan was in office. Anyone surprised?
@JayWoodVegas I had a fight on here with a supervisor from a private jail in Alabama - he was a racist scum bag! I told him
I hope the jailies get him! Pos scum!
. Yes sir. You said it perfectly. Keep families together #AfuAct hr 1036
thank you
And the Pharmaceutical companies get the benefits from greasing your palms Cory
#AMEN--AFTER ROUNDING UP THOSE #IMMIGRANTS TO PUT IN #PRIVATEprisons=
#GOP SELLS #VISAS TO IMMIGRANTS& GIVES THEM OUR JOBS
@CaptainsLog2017 they are verging on human rights, ethnic cleansing, per ICC definition. Need to demand Red Cross inspect.
@TheRock  if u 2 haven't met, u should.
@CaptainsLog2017 They are not allowing Red Cross inspections; & using them for labor without trial. These are labor camps.
This needs to be stopped. @ACLU need to be involved. You guys need to involve the UN.
THIS IS CRIMINAL! End privatized prisons!  This is despicable! Only in America, it's all about GREED & MONEY!  Hence ICE
@CaptainsLog2017 modern day slavery...nothing less!
@DavidLeopold private prison corp contributed to Pence's campaign
@DavidLeopold And their stocks surged right after november 7th!
@Maggyw519 Go get 'em, Cory!
better than in our homes...killing us or stealing from us.
and #EndPrivatePrisons.
@zjparker5310 private prisons are money makers & they donated enough money to the #45  campaign to make sure they stay open
Is time we put stop to private prisons!
@Lee_in_Iowa THANK YOU, CORY!!!... More US Government BULLSHIP!!!... It Make Us Sick!!!!
Cory, U just the TRUTH er'day...ALL DAY.  Thank U
@MikeMedavoy incentivizing incarceration is like a hospital selling cigarettes @jd_evermore @MiddleAmericaMS @coccodrillo21
@derrycanvasser private prisons in the United Stations are an abomination in the eyes of God
. Mine also. And should be for anyone with a conscience. Pure evil.
trump has gone mad, none are safe
&Let's end  mass incarceration of Black men & women & School2Prison pipeline
InstitutionalSlavery
Private prison wealth 
@Benioff  lock Cory up at Gitmo for treason!!!
@avantilaw
man what are you doing to fucking stop it??? What????
I hope he's properly crediting this inhumanity to Obama.
today in Detroit 45 were detained. He is detaining "criminals" who maybe jaywalked
stop him
Private prisons should not exist. The incentive should be for people to not commit crimes not to fill up prisons for profit
Goldman Sachs in top five contributors - diminishes his comments
@CoryBooker well, a lot more would be a lot happier if we were looking at 34000 deportations a day.What's the hold up?!
@shreec DISGRACEFUL!
- Look at Corey trying so hard to make us forget he is an agent of economic  inequality & social stagnation.
illegitimate election invalidate install Clinton save US
long
We should be creating a legal way that will allow immigrants to commerce and work here free of prosecution
@samswey by law??? What?????????
@threesmommy How long has this been true? 34000 in 2 months?
@DemsTalk Immoral!
@TheObamaphile Don't forget those private prisons will hold people in debtors prison.They hate the poor.
@Benioff stop building prisons
Related story.
one of the first things SESSIONS did was privatize prisons. Not about immigration. About $ Why is he still there AG? On you
@RaceAndRomance 
@CoryBooker take them home with you so they can be around your family
This is greed! Not security!
YOU'RE RIGHT CORRY,
THEY SHOULD BE SHIPPED WHERE THEY CAME FROM RIGHT AWAY,
AT LEAST ONCE WE CAN AGREE.
"Its all about the $ not a damn thing funny."  You r the real statesman in the room- Sir. Where is the fortitude of others?
@blndvmpyr Unconscionable
Decriminalizing drugs will have many positive effects:
1) Fewer people labeled 'felons' for life for being businessmen

/1
2) Improved families due to fewer fathers being in prison. Statistics show black men are great fathers when living in home
3) Would improve community relations with police due to less police presence.
Illegal immigrants kept trading jobs at very lowprice,now we'll 've t do it ourselves & premiun pay
By law, we keep 34,000 people locked up daily in immigration detention facilities to fill quota. Who benefits? Private prisons. #EndTheQuota 
you voted no for lower prescription drugs.. big pharma gives you millions of dollars. Who benefits? Not us that for sure
@zephyrkissed Seriously? That is unconscionable!
hello man
