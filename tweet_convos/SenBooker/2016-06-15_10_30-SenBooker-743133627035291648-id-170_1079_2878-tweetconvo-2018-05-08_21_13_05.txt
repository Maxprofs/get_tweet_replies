THANK YOU! @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT @CoryBooker #ENOUGH
Can you close ALL the loopholes please? Nobody needs a gun.
Mateen was vetted by the FBI and Homeland Security. Valid Florida Carry permit. What more gun laws do you have in mind?
Amazing all these leftwing sheep thanking this fascist for stripping them of their right to due process. Amazingly dumbfucks
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT your all frauds

Vote on the Tiresome Windbag Loophole that lets @CoryBooker run for office despite opposing #DueProcess.
We are 2 hours in on Sen floor. No business as usual. We want a vote on closing the terrorist gun loophole. #ENOUGH  https://twitter.com/tatr/status/743132192138743808 …
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Thank you Senators!
thank you #holdthefloor #filibuster
thank you for standing up & saying #EnoughGunViolence #SenateFilibuster
You mean the loophole for American Citizens who have never been charged with or convicted of a crime, right comrad?
Once you're good with removing rights without due process or evidence; who would buy you'd stop with ONE right?
God-willing, history will remember your actions today as a turning point in America's gun problems. Thank you.
What loophole is that? Please cite specific US Code that covers said loophole.
@GavinNewsom @tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT now there's a terrorist loophole?? Do you guys make this up as you go along??
thank you from one of your NJ constituents!! *THIS* is what we need our reps to do. THANK YOU!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT thank u ...now we can pursue a ban on assault weapons I hope  soon ..DC March? Say when
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT thank you!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT 
You all forgot that this shooting occurred in a gun free zone.
; go home . you need more rest.
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT be our voice! Say #Enough !
@ChrisMurphyCT Thank you. My family suffered at the hands of a felon who was able to get a gun. #holdthefloor
@SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT THANK YOU for what you're doing,I have so much respect for u all #EnoughisEnough #fillibuster
Why stop at 2A? Restrict 5A and 6A rights of suspects, lock them up forever without a trial!  What? Too far?  Why?
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Go Cory! Go Cory! I could watch/listen to you talk and talk for hours. Vegan protein rocks!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Props for gettin' it done, #courage . #enough
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Thank you!
There is no loophole. Unless you count @POTUS' abysmal record on open borders, inefficient bureaucracy, & political correctness.
Thank you for taking a standing today. I'm proud to call you my senator. #Enough
Thank you for some action on closing gun loopholes @CoryBooker
We? Oh yea, I forgot T-Bone. @CoryBooker @ChelseaClinton
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Let me guess, every Senator with an NRA membership is against closing a gun-loophole?
@ChelseaClinton Thank you!!!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT  I am with you! #guncontrolnow
@ChrisMurphyCT #Enough #EnoughGunViolence Thank you. Keep up the fight & filibuster. Counting on you doing what's right. Urgent!

@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Stay the course! #EnoughGunViolence
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT go Cory Go
@SenBookerOffice Keep it up! The American people are sick of Congress doing nothing about this.
Obama and Muslim Brotherhood: Tarek Fatah's speech  to Canadian Parliment.
instead of guns, put your foot in the asses of Obama's FBI and DOJ! Also ask the CIA why their hosting daddy!
#Enough of the senseless slaughter. #Enough of the racial and religious hatred. #Enough of #NRA and weapons manufacturers greed.
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT y'all are amazing and I can't thank you enough!!! Finally!!!!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Senate GOP... don't kill in the first two trimesters. But it's ok in the 63rd trimester!  HA
@ChrisMurphyCT Thank you! #ENOUGH
@pam_mangas @tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Thank you.

@SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Please don't give up on reinstating the Assault Weapons Ban
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Thank you, Senators!
Thank you for your courage! This madness must stop. #enough #filibuster #closetheloophole
Your speech gave me goosebumps.
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Please get guns off the streets,our youth are dying every minute.Stop the violence!
What is this "terrorist gun loophole" you speak of?
@JeremyDeeSelden ...please!
@GavinNewsom How hard is it to get on the right side of an issue for once? Scalia Court on guns bad, watch list of a million bad
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT THANK YOU from the reasonable people in Texas without a voice.
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT my heros!!!!
@GavinNewsom The Democratic party has done zip to restore habeas corpus. 1984 is something to move away from, not towards.
Thank you Senator!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Keep up the good work! Need to do something to help prevent another mass shooting!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Thank you, Sen. Booker! #EnoughIsEnough #BanAssaultWeapons
#KeepUsSafer
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT thank you!!!
@GavinNewsom linking the watch list to government power over citizens is a horrible, horrible precedent. Grow a brain please...
@GavinNewsom you don't seem to have any conception how flawed is the terrorist watch list. You already took away habeas corpus.
Go get ‘em, Senator! The status quo is unacceptable! #ENOUGH
Grateful for the stand you are taking!
@GavinNewsom OMG you Democrats lose my registration and vote over dumb shit like this. Huge stride for police state. Get a clue.
@sapienist @tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT so thankful, so proud of you all!!
Great!!! keep going-finally the American people are being heard. #ENOUGH #HRC @HillaryClinton
@GavinNewsom @tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT you can't make a secret list and take away citizens rights #1984
Thank You! While Crying 4 Orlando...
Thank you!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Go get me!  Then work on banning assault weapons too!!  Thank you!!!
Thank you!!!!  You guys are awesome!!  <3 from Colorado!!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT No more automatic weapons.  That's the loophole.

@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT We are all with you!! Please keep going!
@CAPgunsandcrime @tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Stop the gun research ban!
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT thank you! Common sense gun control! #Enough
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT I totally support your efforts to filibuster-thank you for not taking "no" for an answer
Thank you!
My hero! #ENOUGH
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT They only care about the $ the NRA would spend to primary them not human lives.
@SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT THANK YOU!!
Shut down the government until we get gun control, @CoryBooker. #ENOUGH .
what is the "terrorist gun loophole" exactly? Due Process?
Can you PLEASE reform terror watch list standards to include basic due process before expanding its power?
The measures y'all are talking about are a start. Bring back assault weapons ban which shouldn't have expired in 1st place.
@ChelseaClinton @tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Still too many #GOP people in the #NRA pocket?
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT This is the main reason people are fed up with the status quo
@SenBookerOffice  thank you for standing up for Americans who know we need to address gun reform #momsdemandaction
@tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT Thank you Senators!

Nice. While closing loopholes, reinstating asslt weapon ban, plz address Rx SSRI SideEffects #WhatsInTheToxicolgyReport #Orlando
"well regulated" would def allow for requiring gun insurance, like auto insurance.  If that industry is involved, you get change
Thank you!!!

Thank you for this effort! BEST WISHES!
@ChelseaClinton @tatr @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT thank you all so much!
