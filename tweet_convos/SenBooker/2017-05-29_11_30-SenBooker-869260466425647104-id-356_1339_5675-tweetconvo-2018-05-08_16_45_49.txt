You are dead to me... what the hell are you thinking defending jared??
I know why just wanted him to say it... or lie about it
there isn't a meter on this planet, that can actually register the amount of BULLSHIT that you spew. #BookerKushner
Of all of them you're the one I'm saddest about.
Me too. Was hoping Cory Booker would run for Pres/VP someday maybe. Like on a ticket with @SenWarren or something. This hurts like hell.
Serious question the viability of the party at this point.
Jared's security clearance needs to be revoked.   What you did is inexcusable.
Do you think it's beneficial to be no better than Trump supporters shouting "Lock Her Up"?  

Obviously Kushner needs to be investigated.
Yes,  criticizing my senator for doing something I find unacceptable is totally the same as demonizing a women & making her a scapegoat
You called his answer "inexcusable" simply because he called for an investigation instead of making demands without evidence.
With what authority does he have to even speak on it?  Which committee is he on that'll handles this stuff?
We already know Kushner lied on his security clearance forms.  Is that not enough?
I'm behind you Mr. Booker. You honor our fallen soldiers and won't turn on a friend without having all the information. I respect that.
I don't know how a comment honoring our military morphed into a bash...just accept & respect the post. I'm with u Dawn
There is no respect to be had for such feigned sentiments, especially on today of all days!
Well, I think keeping to the topic of the post, whether believed or not would have been better bc the bash was disrespectful to vets
Its disrespectful to vets is to exploit them & memorial day in the same breath he's betrayed  the entire country they sacrificed for!
Apparently u r a mind reader. Start a new thread.
Stating his memorial day tweet is from his 2012 address is a fact not a guess! Spare us the sanctimony dont want a reply don't make one 
There, I fixed it! Congratulations you are the official Fuckboy of senators, your mom must be so proud! #FuckCoryBooker #kushner
Not to mention...  #BigPharma #Fuckboy    #FuckCoryBooker 
https://twitter.com/SalemElizabethQ/status/869442012336017409 …
he got 6 figures for that big pharma shit! He sold us out to Jared & Ivanka for $41,000, maybe they paid him the rest in Trump merchandise
You accept money from Jared Kushner.  He expects favors from you.  Is that why you defend Jared Kushner?
@InSpiteOfTrump we hope that your wet flannel approach to Kushner scandal has nothing to do with money u received from Kushner
So R U a patriot or just a bought politician?  Support the Russia probe or leave the Democratic party.
We see through you traitor
Very poetic!
@corybooker sold out long ago...don't count on him to pull kushners security clearance http://politi.co/11UsLSX  via @politico
@CoryBooker what in the hell are you thinking? this is just beyond stupid, thanks for making it 100% clear you can't be trusted
You have no honor left after voting against cheaper prescription drugs and defending Kushner while spending his campaign cash.
#TheResistance @IndivisibleTeam  - Cory Booker no longer represents the interest of the Democratic party.
"We are focused on waking up the 60% who did not vote in the past election."

As long as they support the candidate you want (Bernie).
Cory Booker's soft tone against Trump is alarming.
He speaks the way Obama would. Here's his full interview:
Done!
Just want to add to the chorus of voices saying that I'm shocked by what you said about Jared Kushner. Please clarify/reconsider.
He also voted for big pharma.  He is bought and sold. Happens on both side of the aisle.
#Unfollow this  sellout #Cory+Kushner
To the Booker Bashers. Please watch entire interview. Responsible answer. No vengeance. Just truth.
Did Ivanka and Jared tell you to say that?
Senator, what are you doing? Kushner's security clearance must be revoked. Dems will not forget this misstep next election.
And we can make a choice to take our vote away from someone who is served by the almighty dollar over humanity.
What does that have to do with voting FOR the people & not Big Pharma, Corporations, WStreet or Banks!? People are watching voting  records
@CoryBooker went to Jared and if he continues defending him. He won't be in the senate much longer.
it's a shame your so anti Trump, going against our president is a turn off, cannot vote for you
Return Kushner contributions and get on one accord with everyone! Please don't be the sell out you are looking like.
Disappointed in you, Senator.  Standing with Kushner?  I guess money does talk.  You just lost this Democrat and I was on your team.
$41,000 dollars. That's what it takes?
He sold out way before that. That's the thing about these Corporatist loving Dems. Their pursuit of BigMoney overrides all that's decent
Yes, he sold out before this.  Don't have the cognitive dissonance to think its only the DNC.  GOP are as crooked.  Peace be with you!
Yet you gotta give GOP props--they tell you up front it's all WallSt. EliteDems hide their Corporatism behind the cloak of rainbow flags.
That's beautiful, Sen.
More sin than Sen, regarding his love of Corporate 
Thanks for letting me know. It's  still beautiful.
I've contributed to your campaign in the past. You sold yourself out and lost my vote.
Really?  Why?
He is defending Jared Kushner right now
What?!?  Really?  Where did u c this?
You are such a thoughtful soul.
Sorry Cory. You have vested interest in Kushner b/c you got donations. Disappointing to see you choose money over country. I'm out.
I am so disappointed in you, Cory. Looks like I won't be donating to your campaign again :(
Once believed you might be our next President. Nope..not going to happen. Is Russia blackmailing you or is it just about the $$?
Your either with us or against us. Figure it out!
And take money from Kushner.  Moved over to the darkside for cash. Thanks for taking care of yourself first.
Block Trump's every sleazy maneuver to un-empower people he targets as unworthy. Please.
It's time for you to switch parties and be the lying cowardice republican that you truly are!!
Wow...I just don't know what to think. Have you ruined your career?
You are so disingenuous, it's unbelievable.
Honor.  You?  Lol. 

Sooooo when are you switching from a registered democrat to republican? 

Wolf in sheep's clothing. 

We. See. You.

Et Tu, Cory?
Very Disappointed. Please clarify. #TheResistance
No longer support Cory Booker, he's as corrupt as Kushner, Trump & the rest.
Empty words...traitor.
@NTVNewsColleen AMEN
Used to think u one of the good guys but the kushner thing siding with him,taking his money for campaign, you just like the rest of them sad
Lost a huge fan here!! I hope your political career ends soon! You're a bum!!
And so it seems YOU have been drinking deeply from the Kushners' treasure trove. You honor NO ONE.
Time to retract your pro-Jared views. Unacceptable given all that has gone on.
It take a demented level of "fucked up" to make a tweet like this in the same breath you betrayed our country for the likes of #kushner ???
Trader!!! So disappointed in you Cory! #Usoldout
If you don't reverse on revoking #kushner security clearance just follow Chaffetz lead &  resign! Your career /reputation will never recover
@corybooker sold out long ago...don't count on him to pull kushners security clearance http://politi.co/11UsLSX  via @politico
Honor:
So you are now defending a communist in Jared Kushner. How much money can people buy for?
Best way to honor heroes? Be one. Take away Jared's security and make mess more affordable. Will not vote for a corporate dem!
At EXpense of American Voters.  Democrats do NOT want ANY Trump enabler apologists!!!
So you to have joined the Greed before Country group. Man I believed in you... Faith. It wavered with the prescription drugs... now this.
Issues with Corey Booker.  2nd was his refusal to vote for lowered drug costs via Canada.  Your funding sources R being exposed Corey 2/2
How on earth did you really think you'd get away w yr despicable 'too soon to revoke Jareds security clearance' blathering. Now it's "2" 1/2
Where are your morals Cory?!  I'm so disgusted with you!!! Taking money from the devil incarnate's son-in-law!? #haveyounodecency #gross
Cory Trumper
Some drink deeply from the Kushner well
We drink deeply from wells of freedom we did not dig. We honor those who have given the greatest sacrifice for our nation #memorialday2017
Money talks
DO NOT TRUST YOU of course Jared needs security revoked, why would you defend him???
#loser
If it's true about $41,000 donation from Jared, you should give the $$$ back.  Please address this issue.
Something smells funny!  You've lost street cred.  Playing into their hands.  They need you.
Do not run for President, I will not vote for you. You're soft
Always classy, I love you
WE are drinking deeply from the wells of freedom, but YOU are happily downing all those $5200 glasses of Kook Aide. Nice, Kushy  job. WTF??
I understand you drink deeply from the Kuchner well.
He thinks he's talking to an ignorant bunch of know-nothing Trumpfuckers. You're not, Cory. Step down, step away, step aside. WTF r u doing?
Wow!  Lot of issues there. What is a know nothing trumpfucker?  How will we know them when we see, talk or tweet with them?
Come to my house for Thanksgiving.
Cory, you have pissed upstream, you can pack your bag buster YOU ARE GONE!
You're exactly what we don't need in public office, bought and paid for politicians.
This really saddened me.
The Democratic Party is not bringing nothing to this country. Nothing but hate
We drink deeply from the pockets of certain people and then don't question their actions.
No!  Please no!

.@CoryBooker is defending Jared Kushner http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/335506-booker-too-early-to-revoke-kushners-security-clearance … So it's worth remembering this about Cory Booker: 
Pathetic
And some politicians drink from the wells of .01%er people who profited off other people sacrificing their lives.
Feet of Clay.
So well said and so very true.
You're defending Kushner cause he gave you money?  Bad
What's up with you and Jared?
Another lying Dem you are canceled
P.S. I REALLYLOVE THAT U ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING ON #Kushner & #NoImpeachment...swiftly!! OUR PRESIDENT NEEDS TIME!
GodIsUsingHim#ALM
Im so disappointed you are no different than the gop, taking money from kushner then defending him. Thanks for showing us how bad govt is!
#MDW2017

AMEN!#semperfidelis #SemperFi 


THANKGOD FOR THEIR SERVICE!
You dishonor that by being in the pocket of a possible saboteur.
@RebeccaWinthrop Thanks Cory, Rebecca. I  just so taken back when I see the cemeteries, in Europe and the stories of those that

Do you have a response 2 recent news articles suggesting you're not a true progressive but a bought & paid for politician with no integrity?
Links?
You sold out to Kushner, really?? I'm so disappointed and disgusted. I thought you were a man of integrity and morals. Guess not. SAD!
BTW please unfollow my account. Now it's just embarrassing to have your name in my followers list. I don't want to be sullied by Trumpers.
You're bought & paid for by Jared Kushner. 
You sold your soul to Trump, you need to register as the greedy WIIFM Republican you truly are.
WTF- what kind of koolaid are drinking from Jared and Ivanka.
Is it true your taking funds from the Kushners and defending him. Not ready for impeachment  Saw on FB can't believe it's true!
You've been drinking campaign cash from a probable traitor.
Beautifully stated. Thank you.
This is meaningless if we have a Russian Op in the WH! You are also owned and for that I am truly sad!
Are you being threatened to hold your tongue? We people need a hero! Speak up for us if you are being threatened say it 4 the world to hear
I want my campaign donation back, you fraud. @RawStory
Guess you really don't want to run for President?
Big Pharma
Then why do democrats want to keep shrinking the military?
???
You will get zero support from me.  Done with you ......shame too, I had high aspirations for you
The Trump Crime Family and 'benefit of a doubt' can no longer be credibly linked within the same talking point. Who is advising you?
honor the vets and democracy.
Why are you accepting money from the Chumps, I mean Trumps ? Losing respect for you.
Did Jared host your memorial day bbq today?
No you don't. You sided against them when you defended Kushner.
So, so, so, so disappointing.
There MUST be a good reason. Right Cory??????
Hear you have made more money off wall street than any other senator.
While your buddy Ivanka is tweeting about champagne popsicles. Bad optics for you to be supporting them and not the DNC.
Explain your actions?
You don't get to talk about "freedom" when you're defending a traitor.
Why are you posing with Ivanka and Jared and taking money from them? Traitor!
You sold out to corporate interests, @CoryBooker. Worse, you sold out to Kushner, who's complicit in treason.
shame on you for taking Kushner money
please say it's not true.not trump connected?

#MemorialDay string:

The circumstances surrounding my Great Uncle Ely Berenson's death on September 18, 1944 have been…
Can't believe you don't think Kushner's security clearance shouldn't be pulled.
MY #NJ Senator! EXPLAIN THIS! "Democrat Cory Booker defends Jared Kushner-after receiving loads of campaign cash"
Cheap shot.
Signed,
A retired Marine.
Why don't you sacrifice for our nation and resign, you fraud.
Perhaps the greatest way to honor veterans is to ensure Trump's cut to funding prosthetics for veterans in his budget.
I'm sure there is more to the story, if we allow Cory to respond before turning on him like rabid dogs. You know how things get twisted.
It's not their kids they will send to war!!!

Disappointed to discover your defense of Jared. How much more gets swept under the rug because of donations?
Buy selling out all those that voted to Wall Street deminshing both their Sacrifice and the Constitution for which they protect #DEMEXIT
Including those that are willing to impeach
First the big pharma debacle now Jared Kushner? You're dead to me. I hope you're not thinking of 2020
@LambQuest so why are you against Kushner having security clearance taken away? They donated to your campaign, right? Sad!
Crooked criminal Hillary Clinton needs no slack. Need to prosecute.
Yeah, sure, but that pesky Jared thing...
Yet you support criminal Kushner
Rich people like Kushner's and Trump's drink deeply of wells they did not dig. I work for my water. Get Kushner out of the White House.
You are a good man Senator, I deeply admire you and your principles. Keep up the good work and thank you.
Did they give their only lives so that future "leaders" could conspire with foreign nations to gain political advantage and personal wealth?
Are you referring to the USA or Russia?
Sell out.
Jared Kushner? Really???
How beautifully put
I am so disappointed in you. I trusted you and thought you'd make a difference, you're just like Trump, bought and paid for
Eloquent & so true...we owe deep debt to all who served & sacrificed, then & now 
Of course, like @jaredkushner 's CASH wells!
Jared Kushner, who should never have had security clearance, needs his revoked. What's your reasoning for refusal?$$$
22 years military and your tweets are offense to my eyes as your are nothing more than a common criminal and traitor to this country!
You sacrificed your integrity when you accepted dirty Kushner money. I had high hopes for you. So disappointed in you. Embarrassed for NJ.
Stay Woke New Jersey..Trump is a traitor and so is Jared . Impeach Trump.
Booker: "I'm not going to rush impeachment" for Trump http://hill.cm/E7TBl3J  
Stay Woke New Jersey.. Which side are you on Cory?? Trump is a traitor and so is Jared.
Dang, you got bought?! Seemed like you had stayed above that, really wish you had, traitor... #TrumpRussia #KremlinGate #Kushner
