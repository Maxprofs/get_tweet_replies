Cory, you are in the minority and you should just stop trying to bring people down about Trump. #JealousMuch ?
He is not in the Minority! 10 mln more ppl voted against DJT than 4 him. Russias puppet
Always been 10 million Imagine that a DJT name calling Shocked I tell ya Shocked
Davey, listen to me. Stop doing #CommonCore math and drugs. They are both messing up your brain. #ITELLYASHOCKED (say it like that)
Oh so losing by 10 million popular votes but winning the electoral college no means the MAJORITY R with U. TKS Fuzzy math
FIX YOUR MATH, DAVE. And your grammar. And your life.
LOL Live is good math is great & grammar's not 4 twitter. But I guess thats the best U got..
How many takes did your avatar photo take? You look happy but in an angry way.
Not so smart. Making Americans gag again!
with 9 followers and spunk in your name, that's the best you can come up with, Rita? Go back to trying to get laid.
Crude. Better 9 intelligent,  successful followers than an ass like you. And, it's Spunky to you, j.o.
umm, your 8 followers are as intelligent as the spunk in your name. Nice try, spunkee!
@Hogan80Hogan this is rich coming from Dems. What was your reasoning to oppose Bernie's mess bill the first time around?
What in the video are you referring to? It doesn't mention any bill from Bernie.
no it's the "put up or shut it portion" I'm more zoned in on. We need money out of politics #1!
Agree  about $,but right now the fight that matters is getting the Russian Oligarch's puppet out of office
opposed to who in the office??? Corporate politicians who have eroded our privacy laws, voting laws, and
You can find dem corporatists and rep non corporatists, but have you heard of Donald Trump?
yes, the populist who saw how much our politicians were lying to us, and figured he could do the same
Dt is not populist, he's a narcissistic buffoon who wants 2 rob us blind.Respect u, but don't want 2 argu
Never stop fighting Cory! We need you as president !
So it’s ok for Cory Booker to assault women.while she was drunk. Hummmmmm
Didn’t hear that and if this is so, I think it’s disgusting as well. Women aren’t objects of vile behaviour.
Yes I agree but this is our of hand. All a woman has to do is say he did it. Sad. Even if it was 40 yrs ago. Since when did allegations become a fact. I feel for men In business if a woman get mad look out.
See now, if it were one person accusing, man or woman, I would be sceptical. Even if it were two making accusations. But 9? Sometimes we have to accept that where there is smoke, there is fire, politics aside. Many reasons why women don’t come out right when it happens
There was only one that accused him of misconduct. The others only said they dated him. That I believe. It wasn’t uncommon for 30 yr. to date teens back then. Actually I had a class mate that did  in 66. Nit uncommon. But the 14 yr Old was lying. She was paid & proven liar.
@DianaLynnParker @Swamp_Cop @andrerucker51 @samroza @DustinGiebel @PeteStopTire
Love You Cory but, you know it was a pep rally, please find a way to get them all out! Lies on top of lies = GOP.
He exaggerates dangers to make people afraid of each other & uses this fear to gain support.
u r not my senator, but knowing we have people like you fighting w/us gives me hope. #resist
Nah, Booker. It's time to push for impeachment.
.      not gona happen snow flake.make america great again.adjust your meds.tards lives matter
Bull
That's great Cory but I'm still fuming that you voted against the bill which would have lowered the cost of pharmaceuticals
Your the only one creating division and supporting terrorist entry into USA
@KarinfromMars you need to go out and talk to people like myself before you paint this gloom and doom picture about Trump.
@GayEqualGlobal @DNC this is who SHOULD have given the response to the 45 address. Dems you still don't get it.
I agree with you, Liz. The reason the ex-gov of Kentucky chosen/he had #Healthcare experience at state level??
@KarinfromMars it's call the calm before the storm, I see it everyday around me. Business already booming.
Umake my point any literate person could've read the Teleprompter #speechApnea @realDonaldTrump
Wouldn't he make a much much better President, folks?
thank you4standing4a #navyseal widow thank u4putting the flag & love4our country FIRST others could learn
Exactly, Alan!
sure
shut him down senator
Where were you for the last 8 years
@KarinfromMars  by the way even the liberals are bragging about their investments going up on average 24 percent in 6 wks.
@KarinfromMars Rome was not built in a day. It takes months of preparations before roads, bridges, infrastructure to begin.
It's coming by mid-week next week. For the past almost 2 yrs now. Thank u Senator for pointing it out. Listen, people!
@CoryBooker i need to get into Government,  because if you can get elected anyone can
Absolutely
What we the people want out here is an INVESTIGATION of Trump's involvement w/ Russia & Putin. We need ACTION
Yes, we trumper's want this too, so it exposes Demorats.
@camp_liselotte I don't know your senator but I know him and he is the real deal. Please RT.
Exaggerated promises? True. But look in the mirror corporate democrats. @SenBookerOffice
@CoryBooker your unAmerican,   And I look forward to the Democrats continue to lose
#Booker2020 Ever Vigilant!
I'd rather him shut up via #impeachment and take his perjured buddy @jeffsessions with him; not necessarily in that order.
Cory's taking Donnie's acceptable delivery pretty hard.
@KarinfromMars you're deceiving the public with your rhetoric. The perception of good times to come are already here.
@KarinfromMars home construction is in full force, Auto sales is tracking 17 million for 2017. That's a lot of action!!!!
@DianaLynnParker @badgirl_loony @narrahkp @TheWayWeSawIt1 @DemResistance @DustinGiebel @Veritaph @SenFranken
love you Cory!! Please run for POTUS IN 2020!!!
How can anything be done? The striking down of the #ResolutionofInquiry shows us the @GOP in @POTUS pocket via #TrumpRussia
69% of Americans had a positive view of Donald Trump State of the Union Speech

News http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/8074036/1/#new …
Never have had a shortage of easily fooled citizens. Weaken the schools, decry "the elites"  see the plan?
Keep fighting the good fight!
The usual BLURTING & BLUSTERING. But pay attention to what he actually DOES.
well said .we should not let trump waste r time. words result of his classes in positivity. lie or no lie.TRUMP SHUT UP
All the speech showed was he can read a teleprompter.  Whoop dee do!
in response to 45's address to congress, he talks about the real work to be done, and encourages us all to stay involved.
it's time to walk the talk or step down
@cathyef50 maybe if you stop fighting and try working together you will see
betray our values? Nobama care is value? Jobs? Get over it a three year old sees common sense.  Maybe a kid needs you job
can you & @JasonKander be my favorite ticket for 2020? Or with @SenGillibrand or @ChrisMurphyCT or @KamalaHarris ?
@kalikat68 Go Booker!
Unfortunately, he won't put up, and even more unfortunately there isn't enough duct tape in the world to get him to shut up
@mistyeb69 God only knows and I in small part wondering if God knows. Great talk sir Metro Detroit
please bring the policies that made Newark so wonderful to the rest of the country!
preach #TrumpRussia #FireSessions
. Please contact me
amen!
It's time for Trump to resign.
or devise a pathway to impeachment..but what will the blowback be from his supporters ..tear nation?
Thank you Senator!!!
he can't simply put up or shut up he's the frickin president, guide +script him best you can..go Cory
check, balance, be vigilant, not obstruction, turn him 5 degrees at a time
Sir, it's about time that a democratic politician talked with a sense of duty, level head and common sense.
you know what booker I live in jersey and you don't represent me. I never voted for you nor will I ever!!!!!
Proud of you! Remember, their core values are ripped from the Nazi handbook. 
Quiet before the storming?! 
Hate must stop!
@user33131 As we've been told, watch his actions which always contradict his words.
call them out Cory!  Time for them to give details - what & how.   The campaign is over - they must own it now.
yes, of course you're looking out for us... unless lobbyists are paying you not to #BigPharma
correction--a still dangerous shithole despite your being Mayor
Put up or shut up? Be careful Cory. Those of us from NJ know you left Newark still a shithole despite all your talk
OMG. I am so sad for you. You had such an opportunity to be a leader & you've sold your soul. 1/2
@toriyoung22 Senator Booker tells it straight on. Refreshing.
@mdjacksondallas  No time for him to Get Out
Good luck, Hon.Sen. Booker! You're a better man, than me! I promise you one thing:Trump never Puts Up!.Nor Shuts Up! Nyet!!
His infrastructure plan is to privatize so his friends can charge us, the taxpayers, for usage. #Kleptocracy #Resist
How can you let him stay in office, Senator??!
@Botrublu Well, no $$ for all. Infrastructure alone = $$ trillions if done right. Every delay is a higher bill.
Hold up ! Didn't  I see you standing there & applauding him along with everyone else at his speech? Why so salty now?
How about "Lock him up!"
The man can't speak coherently without a teleprompter. He can't formulate a complete thought. Can't they see this?
time for you to shut up and do your job, vote DEms out
guess he is not getting impeached anytime soon like you said?
where do I sign up?? Cory Booker fir President 2020
@ThrsaDeal2bMade It was the same old thing; just in complete sentences this time.
You're laughed at by your peers
You forgot the free unicorns.  He said we all get free, huge unicorns.  Spot on by the way, that was a load of crap.
looks like your young political career will be over when your reelection comes around. Pity....
@randyprine Senator, forget his speech. Please help ensure an independent commission to investigate Trump-Russia ties.
He's destabilizing the US and Europe exactly as he has been ordered to do by Russia. With a side line in filling his wallet
"Details" and Trump are opposites. This man doesn't even speak in complete sentences w/o teleprompter. #resist
no it's time for him to be impeached on many grounds.
Wow Corey, you're STILL not awake.
we want trump to resign and shut up.   There's no fixing this
@DearAuntCrabby I want all in Congress to force him to show his taxes & to make sure the Russian connection is investigated
like your grandiose speeches with no action?
right on cory booker you are the leader i am looking for. I stand behind and with you.
Please make sure your colleagues,DE @SenatorCarper and @ChrisCoons hear your message as well.#TheResistance
Thank you Sen. Booker for leading by example and standing up for what is right. Your perseverance is much appreciated.
Thank you Senator..in the desperation for a real POTUS, press has sold it's soul...#NOTNORMAL
You are full of Cory. BTW, how come we never see u with a female??
#Trump uses exaggerated verbiage to distract us from #unconstitutional EOs #russiagate #conflictofinterest #SwampPeople
Yes, it is....

#ThingsWeShouldNotForget
#resist
Amen...
you are an inspiration to me and so many others! I'm disheartened by most Dems response to DT..send help fast
Crosscheck = evil. Stop funding sanctuary states? Hell no. Stop funding disenfranchisement states.
yeah, look what he's done for rapid transit so far in California. Real job maker.
I agree w/U! & will support your efforts! Please try 2 get Sen.Lance on board!! We the people R watching him & his votes
get em Cory. Keep fighting the real and good fight for our country. We must save us from ourselves.
Grandiose is exactly the right word! Consistent with his personality disorder.
I guess time will tell
What can be done in AZ? Our Senators don't listen to us. They are set in the Republican mindset.
It is time for the Dems in congress to stand up and get rid of the whole treasonous gang.
stop crying he been in office bout month left is so funny
@pamslay have you not noticed the first month and a half? He is getting stuff done!! Nothing grandiose about it! #wakeup
You might be alright someday if u quit worshipping billionaires and just pretending to care #neoliberal
hey #45 talk is cheap. your actions speak louder than your words. Stop talking and start doing, for all Americans.
He gave the usual grandiose statements & exaggerations.The Democratic rebuttal was almost nonexistent. Disappointing.Very.
Our democracy cannot afford anymore corruption. Please help us repeal citizen's U. @WolfPAChq sign up for the fight today.
@vistachick79 Or preferably, retire to his Florida estate to live out his days, tweeting away.
This is right on the money! Now We need to make #trumpRussia #impeachTrump & #russiagate trend friends!  Everyone tweet!
this was a fabulous response and should have been the official Democratic response. You nailed it Senator Booker! #resist
@JadedCreative Thank you for listening. I heard the same thing.
uhh hes only been in office for less than 2 months..try to be bi partisan instead of pundit- booker!
@CindyLLovejoy Thanks Senator!  Keep speaking truth to counter the Trump B.S.!
Thank you Senator Booker. The new voice for the Democratic Party! Way to serve it up!The fire we need.
@AP @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @CBSNews @ABCPolitics @BostonGlobe @chicagotribune @denverpost @CNNPolitics  Cory Booker is on FIRE
Very well done Sir.
BOOKER - SHUT UP OR RUN FOR POTUS!!
Girrrrrl, I'd vote for him based on looks alone. lol
I'm with you 100% Senator!
@CoryBooker since it's unlikely that he'll "put up", I would love for option B to kick in sooner than later!
I agree senator. #FakePrez should put up or shut up 
@deejay90192 lord please I wish he would just shut up
And then drop dead 
Out of Him For Thier Agenda Because trump Is So Mentaly Off The Charts. His Head is Spinning Out Of Control.They know It
Bravo Kory ,My Feelings Is RThat The GOP, DTs Cabinet Have OtherThings In Mind Like Buld A Dictator/UseTheHell OutOfHIM
Sen Booker great knowing there are people like in our Senate fighting for us I will continue following and supporting you
Thank you, Sir, for not falling for trump's obvious tricks & manipulations. Pls help us continue resistance of his agenda.
how can we force him and GOP to admit their ties to Russia/Putin. Thank you for your efforts. You're a true Leader. #resist
Mr Booker many agree w/u but GOP in control say we R 2 except that they will do nothing against him,What can/R U going 2do
Thank you!
@Mainie59 Trump is making promises that would require a great deal of regulations to enforce.
How true that 45 spins a good dream but has yet to come up with specifics
PREACH! Booker 2020!
Senator Booker Trump and the GOP sholu be under investigation. Is Trump intimidating the GOP.
please be our next president!!!
If I had my druthers, I'd sure like him NOT to 'put up' on his heinous threats.
he has no ideas or policy. Will let p. Ryan pass legislation that destroys our America
thank you Cory
@BodhisattvaKat Cory, why didn't you give the rebuttal last night??
#trump #PATHOLOGICAL #LIAR! #resist #indivisible #yeswecan #2020potus46 #TrumpRussia #theresistance #russiagate #resistance
may sound naive but how do we support the bills being introduced to Congress.  Calling our reps or by signing a petition?
. Actually, it's time for him to get out.
infrstruction $ is good, as is vetting immigrants but he won't fill these promises.ryan will use him to destroy govt.
@WestParkGuy   SORE LOSER!!!!
you make good sense keep talking keep working help the American people who feel so abandon by Washington and billionaires
yes trump same old same old bull shit.
@AlonzoBallard
that's exactly what I said three weeks ago.
great comprehensive reaction to Donald Trump's speech and our next steps. Thank you!
Just shut don up then, he's a pathological liar and a disgrace to the country.
Well said! GOP=trump*=fascism
Theesa guy much better bombad Senator than meesa ever was
Thank you for acknowledging the job you are doing for US. We deserve to feel safe and economically sound. #resist
Please hold out for a Special Prosecutor to investigate Team Trump's ties with Russia. Best chance of getting him out?
I'm just watching, Senator. I'll believe it when I see it!!
I agree, but it's also time for you to stand up for military and police.
thank you this is exactly what I've been saying sir
@snowakowski4574 Highly reminiscent of Australia's ex-PM Tony Abbott's early speeches. He lasted <1/2 of a Parliament term.
I certainly hope so! Unfortunately a lot of Trumpanzees think this faux president can do no wrong.
1. will financial markets become skittish? 2. as deficit gap deepens will GOP or financiers panic first?
