WHAT ELSE IS NEW WITH REPUBLICANS
@Fran_Neena20409 @CoryBooker #DoYourJob
Voting Republican is a vote for a Nazi government with no personal freedom.
@MrDane1982 @CoryBooker hmm I notice something similar between the two
What happened to respect in politics, even for the other aisle? Now, we have stalemates that harm us all. Must stop.
PEOPLE WE WILL NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE WITH GOP IN OFFICE!
What do we expect for the Party of No?
@SenateMajLdr When the Dems take over the Senate next year they should do nothing but Confirm Judges for 1st Month.
they most likely do not support the #Constitution or the #BillOfRIghts. Or, they're #SJW and bad for #USA
Reason(s) being????
Good for them. You implored for them to do their jobs, and their doing it, @SenateDems @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker
don't ask, demand
It would be silly, laughable if it were not so horrifyingly damaging to the USA as well  as the lives of these men.
.@SenateDems @CoryBooker It is primarily because President Obama nominated them & not at all coincidentally because they are dark.
.@SenateDems @OfficialCBC @CoryBooker Wasn't #CoryBooker labeled a #BlackTrojanHorse? Maybe the title fits this organization too
As 538 points out, the GOP is "a party of breathtaking whiteness."
#ImWithHer
Hey you simple-minded cuck, remember when you said Trump would be beaten in landslide? AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHA
Here's one for the men. Youtube Video >
that's why voting matters... if we have learn nothing the past 7+yrs.. the gop is not working for the people!
I wonder why
you are right about that so ask them for the hearing
Gee. I wonder why theses two in particular have waited the longest? Republicans are vile! VOTE THEM ALL OUT! 
@SenateDems @CoryBooker
what do you expect from DEPLORABLES
what a classic example of OBSTRUCTION.  Vote some democrats into the  Senate.
-@SenateGOP & @HouseGOP, have become obsolete, and need to be replaced, IMO.
RepubliCANTS, CANT and WONT do what's right for the country they CLAIM to love sooo much.
should've supported Bernie and not the least trusted politician #hubris, now an orange fascist might be President
Hmmmm what could it be?
They won't because they have vowed to stop Obama on everything at all costs. InAction is all they have. Rep assholes
And this BS will continue until Democrats win back the Senate.
@ChrisPaulComedy @CoryBooker What is the reason?
The republican party is basically dead.Should be labeled Police State party or SS.The sane repubs left are moderate
Idiot, obstructionist, racist Repubs. We need to throw the lot of them out in November.
but we're suppose to vote republican
Of course they say no. They ALWAYS say no. Until Democrats take back the House & Senate, This is it
VOTING IS SO IMPORTANT! We nd 2 definitely learn how 2 VOTE together! Unwritten rules hav applied to highest office!
Vote out the do nothing Congress. Change the Congress! Congress is holding this country back..
Republicans want to abolish Democracy by disabling the judiciary
Hey, @CNN & @MSNBC ...where is this story on your shows or newscasts? I know why @FoxNews won't cover it!
And yet; 10 hearings on Benghazi and 60 attempts to repeal ACA. @SenateGOP is too busy! #WhenPeopleTellYouWhoTheyAre
if the were White the ll be confirm by now.
That's the only word they know!
If we do not vote out everyone who is blocking the process set forth, we have only ourselves to blame.
Well, they are black, what do you expect?
The GOP needs more white-privilege KKKangaroos on Federal Courts and SCOTUS.
Washington isn't broken.  It's the GOP, pure and simple.  This looks about as racial as it gets!
Senators need to do their job or resign.
GOP obstruction is destroying America!
The Constitution gives POTUS right to appoint judges. The only part of constitution GOP know is the 2nd amendment
Just another day for a do nothing @GOP Congress
They should have at least confirmed Denzel ! SMH !
How does this not go against the 6th Amendment?
The GOP need do their job or be voted out. They don't care about the people in the U.S. They only about themselves
@bannerite @CoryBooker what's the reason they gave for not voting? I can't wait to hear this
Time for a needed change in both the House and the Senate. Everyone vote DEMOCRAT up and down the ballot #HRC #vote
vote the republicans out and vote straight Democratic ticket that's what I am pushing in my sphere of influence
This is f-ing ridiculous. What? They don't like the color of their skin? We need to call our senators.
shameful!!! Be sure you're registered and VOTE people!!!
VOTE BLUE, VOTE THE REPUBLICUNTS OUT. REGISTER TO VOTE MAKE SURE U HAVE WHAT U NEED TO VOTE
@GOP #DoYourJob
so @SenateGOP why?
racist superior white Congress
these folks need to voted out!
Things that make you go hmmmm...
Republican voters are brain washed by Rush/Sean/Fox for years but many are voting purple this time.
Hey @SenateGOP #DoYourJob
they will regret this obstruction when history reveals how they tried to sabotage Obama because he was Black & DEM.
I hope all republicans up for reelection are voted out of office. Then this country will see progress.
They should be ashamed, but they can't be shamed. #DoYourJob
Can't these republican bafoons be impeached for NOT doing what they were ELECTED to do?
Impeached by whom? They are in the majority. Only recourse is for the people to #VOTE them out of office.
Sitting out elections is what brings this kind of trouble ppl. VOTE!
NO one other than Dumbo would do that with his financial ties to foreign countries  hes Mr DEPLORABLE
Gee...that's odd...I wonder why?
