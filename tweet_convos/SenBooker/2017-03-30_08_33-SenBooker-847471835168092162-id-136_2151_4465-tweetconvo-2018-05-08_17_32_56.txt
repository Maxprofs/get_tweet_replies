@CoryBooker @GOP @VP what are they thinking? (Or not thinking at all)
They don't want to confront it as they don't have the guts to take action-always worried about their next election/fund raising.
The only thing the GOP is good for is war and corporate welfare. They can't govern, Obviously -> ACA
Welfare is ridiculous. Way out of control thx to @TheDemocrats & their love for illegals.
And you're OK with Corporate welfare. The GOP loves corporate welfare & lobbyist padding their pockets while kids get crappy education? TY
Fact is our government is a mess. Deep state won't let @POTUS fix things because THEY have too much too loose. Sad.
He isn't trying to fix nothing. He is running up the deficit and has no plan to DO anything but role back regs that protect ppl. $$ matters
Our president models cruelty and dishonesty. As a therapist  people who can't  recognize what they do not know are the most dangerous(trump)
now you can do what you want in your state of new jersey. that is what was passed. use the correct narrative
I do not believe Michael Flynn would tell the truth if deposed.
Disabled family-----health insurance rate went up 300% under Obamacare

Must watch videos http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/8082941/1/ â€¦
blame insurance companies - not ACA.
The unaffordable care act made things worse, prices went up even higher under the unaffordable care act
Question: How would these GOP men feel about a group of women deciding their access to condoms and vasectomies? 
and Viagra and penis pumps.
I believe Trump is behind Flynn's recent ask for immunity.
Thoroughly disgusted by this latest misogynist BS powerplay.
Please invite ND Dem @SenatorHeitkamp to coffee and suggest she drop appeasement policy. She took oath to protect USA from traitors/tyrants
Is it to stop lots of children from multiplying?  And genetic cloning correspondence with England?
To bad you dont fight as hard to save lives as to abort them
@CoryBooker  Everything they've done is shameful. They only care about $ not people and especially not women. #resist
I think alot of these so called men have no women in their lifesto smack them off side their head.
Good one!! I would agree.
Was this signed by the President?
How can Pence sleep at nite having "ripped away"Hlthcare needed for those who no place to turn?.This appalling attitude out of the WH=
We should also be saving lives not taking them! Abortions are not healthcare, they are death sentences.
Government mindset of the likes of Booker take Americans to poverty and chains.
I agree. Hey Booker, I'm assuming this costs your pharma benefactors $, is that why your against this one?
Getting knocked up by that drug dealer 2 days before he goes to jail is looking less and less enticing huh
Totally agree. Thank you Sen Booker. Where is the heart in the White House?
This Admin is wrong on every issue. They are not representative of our country. Every day we weep but must mobilize and fight back!
I'm just sick of this WH.. just waiting for the Impeachment alarm.. its sad! Embarrassing for the US!
@odeedee
So my tax dollars should pay for sexually promiscuous women to get abortions
why are these guys so into destroying women's health #TitleX
Exactly
Check my count. 
 18 Female Senators voted NO including 2 republicans. 
 3 Female Senators voted yes: Capito WV, Fischer NE, Ernst IA.
@Pattillotrish we can't expect anything better from a man like Pence - and we can expect a lot worse.
Planned Parenthood is a scam, a sham. They don't provide the services they say they do like mammograms and contraceptives
What are you talking about? Have you ever been to one? I always get my birth control filled there and an annual exam to go with it.
and the whole church said
How can we expand it?
What will you expand when we have nothing left for you to take
I've always felt proud and fortunate to be an American. Never b4 have I felt so abandoned by the country I was born in.
Thank you. I don't know WHO raised these people. WHY do "they" #GOP think that "conservative" is synonymous with cruelty? #resist
Cory support single payer
Absolutely #shameful and disgusting
Thank you Senator! Keep up the fight.
We shouldn't be shrinking affordable prescription resources for elderly & Americans. It's shameful @SenBookerOffice  to vote for #bigpharma
Its a shame your term's not up.
Agreed they want to keep women barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen just the 50's era they're from..
What is wrong with this country????? Why are we holding funds from PP???? I don't even know what to do anymore @SenBookerOffice
and this is just one of a plethora of items for which Trump/Pence should be ashamed. us agents of positive change need to keep working.
I paid for health insurance for myself and my family for 30+ years.  Tell me again why I should pay for everyone else.
we need to get vice president Pence and president Trump out in the next 4 years
we need to get pants out of there along with Trump next time around
Funny you mention "families" while insinuating the defunding of planned parenthood
Don't they realize the cost of not having preventive care? Ppl dx later & longer in hosp w/complications & secondary untreated illnesses?
Oh, Mr. Booker, could u pls pls pls go try to talk some sense into Colorado's Cory? We'd be in better shape if he saw things your way! 
Unborn children matter. You pple are disgusting.
I say do nothing until we iron out the Russian ties. We can't let these assholes get away with fuckin treason
that's a misleading, nasty & divisive tweet. As a woman, I find your tweet shameful. Gov't has no $ & not its biz
thank you!!!
U need universal healthcare to start
Especially with his poor handling of the Scott County AIDS epidemic.  Just when u thought AIDS was under control along comes a GOP holyman
If religious institutions want to shape policy, maybe they should pay taxes.
But you undoubtedly liked the archdiocese of Newark ringing their bells for the "immigrants."
Here's what's shameful .. these rural idiots will continue to vote Republican in 2018 and beyond .. that is a truth from the fucking bubble
Shame on you, pence.  Your wife is either horrified or brainwashed.
Disgusting and evil ppl. Targeting families, but call themselves party of family values. Karma.
Stop suffocating alive babies , abortions and the selling of baby body or organ parts and we will give the funding. Ur choice.
Shouldn't healthcare be a right for women not restriction?
How can I help?  I want to be part of the wave that corrects their betrayal.
Okay then. Vote for the Single Payer bill being proposed by Bernie. If we don't see your name on it, you'll get even more hell from us.
the #InsuranceCompanies or #providers should pay a penalty for non-compliance #HealthCare isn't #business, it's #LIFE
#HealthCare costs NOTHING to cover people - no cost until used - needs to be #NotForProfit & ALL #InsuranceCompanies must participate or
So what action can we take to try to reverse this?  More horror every day!
Shame on you. Nothing is Free, somebody pays for it
On a 1-10 scale for heartlessness, those Senate Republican guys get an 11.
@CoryBooker @GOP @VP Pence was a horrible governor facing losing seat & now he's a miserable VP for same reasons
what is more shameful is bringing an unwanted child into the world. I work with those. SAD
Also, David, the day you get pregnant is the day you get to have a voice in the law.
@CoryBooker @GOP @VP  Ivanka will save woman health care...cause she cares about women issues.  Ivanka is shameful!
It's only shameful if you care abt anyone who isn't white, rich & already insured.
I liked the picture of Pence in his younger, gayer days. Does he swing both ways?
These people are unbelievable. How can this keep getting worse?! We have to do something to stop this carnage!
You sound like Hillary Clinton women only
@CoryBooker @GOP @VP Time to ask all lawmakers' healthcare coverage beliefs - legal right or not.  This will help us vote.
@CoryBooker @GOP @VP #TitleX so can my state refuse funds to any HC provider they don't like? Like catholic charities?
@Ez4u2say_Janis @GOP @VP You are one of the most valuable assets this country has
@CoryBooker @GOP @VP . Applaud the President for trying to create jobs that will supply healthcare instead of objecting.
Blocking affordable Rx, you are despicable.
@CoryBooker @GOP @VP There is no money for expansion until someone decides to control abuse. Abuse is the problem.
@CoryBooker Great idea! PP can convert their abortion clinics to mammogram facilities & save lives instead of taking lives.
Is this the Christian way or Taliban way?
.good question! Look at the top execs. salaries and you will see why they give millions to politicians.
@SenateDems @GOP @VP 1st positive remark I heard,& yes it came from a sen demo
this group of trumpites is frightening and we must resist wherever we can
@CoryBooker @GOP @VP  how about we all get same health care as congress?
This will be a moot point when we get #MedicareForAll -- right?
@SenateDems @GOP @VP go to Ferguson and play outside please. Also, stop killing babies
@SenateDems @GOP @VP Women are a force to be reckoned with! We will make sure they NEVER hold office in the future!
read what the vote does.  it makes it a state issue.  handle this locally.
@SenateDems @GOP @VP What's shameful is the Democratic support of abortion.
@SenateDems @GOP @VP Anyone know if Booker has said he'd support Bernie's Medicare for All bill? Someone screenshot this.
@SenateDems @GOP @VP 
Exactly. This is a sad day for America.
Come to our hospitals/clinics and see what it's really like for low income Americans, @VP #detachedfromreality
.they will never do that. They do no want to face the results of the actions they take.
we should also mind our budget. Trillions in debt is irresponsible
single payer system will only benefit the rich- we need to think about the poor and the middle class
. What? Please explain how.
they pay cash & cut the long wait 2 get an MRI, proceadures and etc...I know 2 many rich that do this:(
To what single payer system are you referring?  I see you r an ins. Broker. Please detail how you are compensated.
Single payer system like Canada and all other countries
Just about everything that this Administration is involved in is #Shameful
wasn't it @SpeakerRyan that said government should not tell people what they should do with their healthcare?
