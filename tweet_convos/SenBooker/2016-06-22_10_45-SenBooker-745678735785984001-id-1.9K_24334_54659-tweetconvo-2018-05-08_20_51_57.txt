Sometimes you have to get in the way. You have to make some noise by speaking up and speaking out against injustice & inaction #goodtrouble
And for covering for your administrations failure to stop ISLAMIC TERRORIST in the United States. 

@POTUS @repjohnlewis
maybe Bush should have cleaned up his mess instead of leaving it 4 another prez??
7.5 years of Obama and still blame Bush. Obama has attacked 7 countries. Troops on the ground in 4 of them. 

@1clarez @POTUS @repjohnlewis
yes, bush started the mess: I bet prez Trump will blame Obama when things don't work out for him.
No, sweetheart. Bin Ladin killed 2,996 Americans on 9/11. 

@1clarez @POTUS @repjohnlewis
paraphrasing u- covering 4 Bush's admin failure to stop terrorism. He started fake war, finish it
Al Qaeda attacked the United States and killed 3,000 Americans. @1clarez @POTUS @repjohnlewis
yeah I know. It was under Bush's admin. Using ur logic, blame Bush 4 attack
@repjohnlewis deport Trump!
Take ur corn rows 2 Pakistan, China, Saudi.  Write us, let us know how great it is.
@AlexSolovkov @SoyRMCF @POTUS @repjohnlewis Hey Alex, u call me a racist but you retweets racists things like this. "corn rows"
they tell me name "Black Lives Matter" is not racist
->there is nothing racist to RT pic
at least BLM cares abt blk ppl. When cops shot Wht ppl, whts do nothing.
u mean media controlled by whites?
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm just trying to help out and make a contribution.
When ur mom takes you 2 the grocery store & says no to the candy you want, u lie down in the aisle & scream don't u, @repjohnlewis? @POTUS
.@N_Fatale This isn't candy. This is lives of innocent Americans who just want to go to school, a movie theater, to a club. #NoBillNoBreak
It's restricting the right of due process. Read the Constitution.
.@N_Fatale Life and liberty is also a part of the Constitution. People have the right to go about their business without being gunned down.
READ THE CONSTITUTION.
.@N_Fatale We the people "establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare"!
DUE PROCESS. Don't tweet at me again, please. We must agree to disagree.
@repjohnlewis what?!
dont need a gun for your peaceful friends to kill, 

love 9/11/01 Nice victims
sir pls get a snapchat too @FLOTUS has one
bless me with a dog filter on yo face
Yes because our founding fathers wanted the Government to control and limit our rights without due process #dueprocessmatters
@WhiteHouse @repjohnlewis
Yeah we need it in John Lewis's district in Baltimore and your home town Obama 'Sweet Home Chicago'! @POTUS
@repjohnlewis #NiceAttack perhaps John can lead legislation banning  trucks too as they cause slaughter of innocences too.
@WhiteHouse @repjohnlewis not only the lack of Forsythe by the American and Canadian government downright ignorant but utter stupidy.
@repjohnlewis So John is heading up gun control in Chicago?
WHN JHNLWS SAID "GETINTHEWAY" DID U MEAN BLOCKING STREETS,SHOUTDOWNS,INTHE COLLAGES,MAKING SURE POLICE CANT DEFND THMSLVS?

Esp when its created by the DOJ against Americans
@repjohnlewis That didn't work for Snowden. You and your comrades still call him a criminal
@repjohnlewis A hissy fit just demeans the democrat party further. Will they hold their breath until they turn blue next? #Infantile
YOU WANT TO FIX GUN VIOLENCE THEN CONTROL YOUR UH PEOPLE IN CHICAGO. DO NOT PUNISH THE REST OF US NORMAL PEOPLE.
@repjohnlewis We need more Islamic Terrorist Control not Gun Control! IMPEACH OBAMA!
@AlexSolovkov @POTUS @repjohnlewis how abt keeping guns away from terrorist? Why keep it easy for them to kill ppl?
Why let them in without background checks? Ask #JihadiBarack your presidential terrorist!
all 4 terrorist attacks were done by us citizens. Including  army officer
MULIMS!
Not Terrorists! That is why we want #JihadiBarack aka @POTUS out of office! He's another racist terrorist!
racist? He's the first blk prez. When blk issues come up he has 2 respond. That's what happens when First.
He is an admitted Muslim who is causing the division in America! Racial division has gone back 50 years under him
Thank you for your leadership on this issue, Mr. President.
@puppymnkey @POTUS Thank you @HillaryClinton for being the only candidate brave enough to take on @NRA. #Enough
Only? Bernie was doing it long before Hillary came around on the issue.
When he voted against the Brady Bill, or when he helped shield gun mfgs.?
you are wonderful. You make me proud to be an American. Thank you for speaking up and @repjohnlewis thank you as well!! 
@repjohnlewis please see me first b4 taking matters like this into your own hands. Let's make sure we've correctly ID'ed the issue
Ban Guns welcome the "Assault" truck! look at France and count the dead ! If only the first victims had a gun
.@POTUS @repjohnlewis thank you for inspiring others to do something.
stay forever King
@WhiteHouse @repjohnlewis as well as ignorance to the real issue affecting not only Americans but Canadians as well.
you should thank emma  and get her a job as president one day. you are my hero BO and you too emma. Lets make it happen
@PressSec @repjohnlewis 5th Amendment geniouses. Without due process, Hillary would already be in prison.
@WhiteHouse @repjohnlewis employment health care and quality of life for the average person are top priorities in there life.
Two Idiots.
...because calling out Radical Islam is far too uncomfortable, right?
did you know that whites have caused more violence than radical islamists
@WhiteHouse @repjohnlewis I mean to think you with prevent murders by simply removing guns from the equation is utter idiocy

John Lewis is an hysterical maniac living off the largess of the American taxpayer.  He has no ideas.  He's OVER.
@repjohnlewis what about violence against water protectors at #StandingRock ? Is that okay?
@repjohnlewis Sir, would be great if we give the unborn da right to choose life over death. Respectfully,  Love you & ur family.
JWBrands, Inc.
@repjohnlewis OBAMA IS A FUCK FACE
& @repjohnlewis Thank you. :) #gunviolence...and, so much more.
Guns laws have not solved anything in Puerto Rico than to arm the criminal and disarm the decent citizen,my son is dead because of it
@repjohnlewis And, thank you for everything you've done, POTUS.
What has he done?
"We're calling on the leadership to bring gun control legislation to the House floor. Give us a vote! Let us vote! We came here to do our job, we came here to work!" - John Lewis  (50:22)
Injustice and inaction? Who said that?
@repjohnlewis We need gun control!! If everyone word outfits like NASCAR drivers, we would see who the @NationalRifleAs has bought!
All you libs have a contagious disease. It's called "gun control".
Yes we all have the right to voice our opinion even yours which is sadly wrong. It just proves you are trying to help the criminals
@repjohnlewis OBAMA CAN MANIPULATE OUR DREAMS WITH QUANTUM SUPER COMPUTERS THAT PROGRAM NEURAL NANOBOTS THROUGH EMR WAVES!
we have reached out to John Lewis also. No reply.
@repjohnlewis
@repjohnlewis
@repjohnlewis #Quiters
@repjohnlewis 3 terms pls
As citizen gun ownership has increased (and, it has skyrocketed in the past seven years) violent crime has diminished.
If more guns made the nation safer, this would be the safest nation in the world. But it is not. Why?
Guns are tools; look to the people using the tools for your answer.
@repjohnlewis
The only head at the table is no American leader and his "legacy" soon 2 b erased.
@repjohnlewis can you also fix the illegal weapons sold in the streets of Watts and Chicago???
illegal guns r everywhere, y only Chicago and watts?
I was making a point! It doesn't matter Supreme Court just gave cops full reign to arrest Americans!
and in 2014, court said cops need warrant to search cel phones. Good and bad
@repjohnlewis
noticed when dinner bell rang that 'sit till we get our way' went out the window...
Old Hippies never die.

They just smell that way.
Spot on!
@repjohnlewis
@repjohnlewis  Better, deport the 1500 on the list.
  Better 1500 suspects rights taken away then a whole nations gun rights
@repjohnlewis cult of peace PLEASE YOUR wrong Again
Baltimore?
no future! no future! no future for MEEEE!!!
Dems in Congress sitting around on their asses doing nothing. This is supposed to be different from business as usual? #IDIOTS #TCOT
@repjohnlewis Are you kidding me? Democrat dinosaurs pull prehistoric stunt. LMAO
@repjohnlewis other countries r laughing at how immature & childish Dems r acting. If it were Repubs u'd B slamming them in the dirt
@repjohnlewis thank you thank you John lewis. And potus for the retweet
@repjohnlewis So you clowns are going to hold a sit-in at @TheDemocrats "gun free" paradise of Chicago?
. @POTUS Democrat Anti-Civil Rights Activists Demand we don't solve problems we just DO pointless things
"Don't Tread On Me!"
House Democrats are making history. They're making our voices heard to end gun violence. I'm so proud of them!
"City records 300th homicide with 13 over Father's Day weekend" city run by dems/strict gun laws. Give a sit about chicago
newsflash: 49 killed, another 50 wounded in 1 night by 1 man with an AR-15. End the violence. #GunControl #HouseDemocrats
streets of chicago have been filling w/blood under dem watch for how long? dems held house/senate/POTUS...NOTHING!
you're forgetting G.W. Bush lifted the assault ban in 2004. Want to blame someone for the carnage? Blame Bush. #GunControl
"U.S. Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 that EXPIRED in 2004" Misinformation serves no purpose/confuses the masses on the issues
Bush and his congress allowed the ban to expire which outlawed Uzis, Tech 9s and 17 others. My facts ARE correct.
"allowed the ban to expire" Your current wording requires of me to concur.
how do i fee; about the sit in?
@repjohnlewis Any plans for the Muslim violence? You can't redact that away, dhimmi
the dem hypocrites with MILLIONS of dead babies via abortion on their hands. Doing what they do.. having middle school level tantrums
@repjohnlewis We the people stand with u. Go! Go! I'll give u my pillow. I think somebody  needs 2 send u guys coffee & doughnuts!
.@POTUS, do you know what type of rifle STOPPED THE MUSLIM WACKO BEHEADING PEOPLE AT VAUGHAN FOODS? No? THIS type.
It is NOT about tightening regs, It is about beginning process to gut 2nd. They will NOT be happy till that happens
Exactly.
@repjohnlewis Exactly how is this helping?
Thxs to John Lewis for taking Direct Action to the house, EnoughisEnough! V
@repjohnlewis no questions on Benghazi? You're a coward and we deserve better.
Mass producers & suppliers of arms & ammunition can't prophese against gun violence
@SarahTheRebel @repjohnlewis Easy to say that when you still won't do anything about it.  Cop out.
@repjohnlewis Doing what they do best. Sitting on their rear doing nothing. Dysfunctional.
@MeanGirlTweetz @repjohnlewis Thank you for showing that disdain for the rule of law & democratic process has the support of Prez.
@repjohnlewis the injustice is bringing violence into our country with terrorist masquerading as refugees.
@Bakari_Sellers @repjohnlewis it was a important issue,until there vacation started,lol.more phony outrage.parroted by sellers
@repjohnlewis
@repjohnlewis No thank you to the person tweeting on B-Ho's account. #HillaryClinton still got Trumped today. Everyone knows it.
@repjohnlewis This is leadership. Unlike someone who knows only how to make 'Deals'.
@repjohnlewis Why did the Dems vote down the Cornyn bill? Provided for due process. Dem hacks!
@KimLafreak we are ready have a gun laws!!!! Enforce those first!!!!!

You're all a bunch of clowns. #NoBillNoBreak @HouseDemocrats @repjohnlewis @POTUS

How can you be Christian if you allowing the transgender and gay to join the military?
WE NOT WANT VIOLENCE, WE WAIT GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS.
@repjohnlewis TY John
@repjohnlewis. John Lewis will not solve the gun violence problem.  Laws won't either.  Because guns aren't the problem.  Wake up!
@SuezWillson #NoFlyNoBuy #NoBillNoBreak #NoMoreSilence Amen, standing up for others lives, 60 sec silence does not = a human live
@repjohnlewis so Mr President isn't that your job to do?
@repjohnlewis GET OUT THE OFFICE ALREADY YOUR IGNORANCE IS NOT NEEDED
@repjohnlewis Obama Fails Again: The FBI Admits that they "LOST" the Orlando Shooter's Wife!
@repjohnlewis thank you mr president please carry on and always set our best example as you have done and please continue to ddup
@repjohnlewis never tweeted on social issues before. But time for common sense. Get guns off the streets. Well done leaders!
gun control has nothing to do with mitigating terror attacks.A smoke screen, Ban gun free zones where almost all mass killings occur
Making noise is what got us a country.
@repjohnlewis 
Martin Luther King would be so proud right now!
@repjohnlewis OBAMA DESERVES THE DEATH PENALTY FOR RELEASING NANOBUGS INTO THE AIR!
Good gawd, GROW UP and act like adults instead of sitting like 5 year olds in a tantrum, It's terrorism, you dimwits not gun control.
@justsanaa thx! Really? Charlie Whiteman has this gun thing on lock! If we would just educate the right way this would be a mute!
@repjohnlewis you are doing a great job. Thank you
just a few more months, need help moving?
@repjohnlewis 

You know what evils?
When we think it over,
it's good to have countries
like China,Russia and
N.Korea around?
@repjohnlewis What happened to the #2A. Does it mean nothing to you?
we should be able to prosecute gun sellers, they're responsible for this
@repjohnlewis okniec
@repjohnlewis Thank you, Mr. Lewis & President Obama, for your integrity and courage to stand up to the ignorance in this nation.
@repjohnlewis It's ironic how white Americans have continuosly charged their American race card express in-between your ass cheeks!
@repjohnlewis Let the church say Amen!!!
Finally some courage in Congress.  There is a GOD!
Thank you John Lewis for leading on gun violence where we need it most. https://twitter.com/repjohnlewis/status/745631702186336256 …
Finally someone steps up!
@repjohnlewis what you're pushing for is exactly what our founders feared from our Gov't. You work for ALL of us #BillOfRights #2A
Will this reduce American gun violence in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan?
@repjohnlewis not either one of you is a real man!
@WhiteHouse @repjohnlewis lacrosse stick cricket bat ice skate clothes line ect
THE EU IS GERMANY FINALLY BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT IT FAILED TO DO IN 2 WARS ! CONTROL ALL OF EUROPE.!!
Get down and support these ppl in their sit-in time to say enough gun killings change the law
@repjohnlewis then how about standing up for the right of babies to live & not be murdered out of convenience? #2FacedNoMorals
@repjohnlewis Why didn't strengthening background checks get passed Dems? Because nothing short of stripping rights is what's wanted.
plz you tell your UNFCU 2vacate the illegal occupation of my house in Zambia. They want2displace me for their own fraud.  No colonies
@WhiteHouse @repjohnlewis 5^^^^^^
@repjohnlewis this country was founded on LEGAL immigrants, .... you (POTUS) s omit the importance of the LEGAL word each time.
while ISIS conspires slaughtering of Americans...
@repjohnlewis يا إبن ايري اتصل علي بافهم عارك ايش المطلوب
