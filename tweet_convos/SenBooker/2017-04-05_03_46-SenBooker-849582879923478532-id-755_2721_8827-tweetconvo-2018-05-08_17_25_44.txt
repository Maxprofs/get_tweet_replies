Update: 7yo & I couch sleeping by the TV. Every few hrs she wakes up & says "he's still there!" before rolling back over. You are our hero.
Fwiw, I pulled her out to homeschool TODAY. I've hit so many 1st grade standards b/c of @SenJeffMerkley's courage. 
THREAD. About an unknown reality of poverty. "Good schools" are in areas w/o public transportation. What's a poor mom to do? https://twitter.com/susanemoney/status/849496539957538818 …
Why not fix the schools that are bad? 60 years of Dems and unions have destroyed public education
Overfunding military at the expense of public works like education. Have destroyed education. Don't get it twisted.
We spend more per student and have underperforming students than other developed countries but you think money is the problem?
I'm afraid my Red state RS are to blame for our underperforming schools...47 or 48 in spending, 47 or 48 in performance.
Money isn't the ONLY problem, but it def is one. Misappropriation is also. My HS theatre Dept was cut to overpay the football coach...
And our team lost 49 in a row... And the coach left before the season was over. But the theatre was profitable...Who needs art. Or education
@ryrysven Thanks man!
THANK YOU

Feel the Bern! Sen. Sanders SLAMS ‘nuclear option’ (but look what he said in 2013) http://twitchy.com/dougp-3137/2017/04/06/feel-the-bern-sen-sanders-slams-nuclear-option-but-look-what-he-said-in-2013/ …
Great work, Senator Merkley. Thank you & whether or not it made a tactical difference, the Symbolism is important and worth your efforts.
Congratulations Justice Gorsuch.  Nicely done:
Thank you for standing up against this extreme nominee.
thank you for your leadership!
#Leadership? How is being an #obstructionist leadership? Pls do tell #scotus #GiftToTrump #GOPReset #filibuster
Did you enjoy Cruz reading Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs & Ham?
No - I felt like he was over doing it with the voices - kind of botched a great book
But you were ok with his filibuster & Rand Paul's filibuster.
#JustWondering @jdickerson do u think this will come down to a @vp #tiebreaker? @markknoller @CNN @DavidCornDC cc @mitchellreports @latimes
Respect to you. Thank you for holding the floor for those of us who believe in the average American over corporations, & 4 women's rights
Thank you Sen. Merkley for shining light on this horrble pick for a stolen seat. Have to remember to not play fair with unfair republicans.
I'll be back to celebrate with you on Gorsuch's confirmation!
Donald needs to stop telling us woman what to do and stop noleating breast like summers with satellites
You are just as scary as Bernie
Thank you from Australia, for your tenacity and integrity Sir. We applaud you. This isn't just about the US.
#holdthefloor
We greatly need and appreciate your support! Thank you. (And our politicians need to see it too!!!)
Pouting like a little baby for 12 hours. And tweeting about it. Good example 
@BernieSanders thank you senator you a rock star I appreciate you
They had to go nuclear because they know dems like you are a force to be reckoned with.  Thank you Senator! Keep fighting, we're with you! 
Awesome job!
Thank you for supporting the people!
Thank you for resisting on our behalf! We cannot let him have a #StolenSeat for life. #solidarity #holdthefloor #StopGorsuch #Resist
Thank you Senator Merkley you are one of my heroes and my own Senator friend @tomudall

Good work.  Greatly appreciated!
You are just making fools of yourselves
You are an American Hero. Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley. We will take you out to dinner anytime you head up to Seattle.
Way to go. Keep up the good work #StopGorsuch
Keep up the good work!!
Thank you
Keep at it!!!!
Thank you.
we love you and appreciate every thing you do #AMERICANHERO #HoldTheFloor
@NewtownAction Hold firm Senator. We are behind you and believe in your stance against #gorsuch

Thank you!
Stay strong and thank you for working for the constituents that voted you in! You are their voice not an individual. You stand for America!
Thank you it really is meaning a lot to the Americans you are fighting for! We need to be united! You are not alone we are behind you 100%
Thank you!
Hypocrites with short memories of VZp Biden and the Dems past. Losers Gorsuch is next Justice 
Thanks you for your effort, Senator!
@SenSchumer Good for you! Don't you guys get tired of fighting and losing? What's that definition of insanity?
Great job! #resist
.so what happened?
Thank you for all your hard work!!!
I hope that when you are up for reelection that you are also booted out!!
@azalben Why is Gorsuch bad now, when he got 100% vote in favor in the past. Did he get a lobotomy? IS Ideology ur god?

Wow! Impressed with holding the floor for 14 hours!!! Your the man!!
Gorsuch is a barrier to socialist nullifying The Constitution through the courts. Look to Venezuela as the end result of judicial overreach
Senator, the Dems are energized, I haven't seen this amount of energy in awhile. Trump needs to be removed not credible or trustworthy.....
Senator, I appreciate you standing up to Trump & the Republicans. Most (not all), aren't tuned in to their constituents. Seem to be haters..
Senator, thank you for your message to Trump with your very long speech. Senator Mitchell McConnell is an evildoer, he's a hater of the ppl.
Thank you for your hard work to keep democracy alive!  #resist
Stay strong.
Good luck!
@SenSchumer Keep going! We are with you!
Thank you! Thank you! #holdthefloor I applaud and admire your tenacity!
So, you oppose an eminently qualified nominee because he will make decisions based on Constitutional grounds?
Teach Sean spicer how to make a statement in public
@BernieSanders Stupid is as Stupid does. LOL
You are a bunch of kook liberal hacks.  You oppose anyone who is not a Marxist.
Shut up already!  You're embarrassing decent Oregonians.
THANK YOU #holdthefloor
You are not any sort of hero to me.  Just an obstructionist that refuses to work across the aisle with some communist agenda
You are AMAZING Senator. Thank you! #holdthefloor
So much gratitude!
Maybe if they worked this hard to get something done....now that would be Amazing!!
Good on you. Proud to see a Democrat with spine and principle. Jealous of Oregonians.
Thank you, Senator. Your efforts are recognized and much appreciated!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Gorsuch MUST BE selected as he respects and loves our Constitution.... we MUST have an honest SCOTUS back again.
You are amazing! Thank you for standing up and speaking out.
Thank you for your valiant effort!
#holdthefloor
So impressed and happy!! I'll never forget it. My grandchildren will hear from me that you did this- for them
Thank you!!
Merkley even better than jimmy stewart!  Boomers understand

Thank you Senator!! You Rock
Perhaps they'll make ur speech into a book like @SenSanders :) #KeepFighting
You the man! Corperate sympathizers out of our judical system because they've eroded our democracy.
you are an embarrassment #defeatMerkley
Thank you Senator Merkely! You are much appreciated. #StolenSeat #holdthefloor
Well done all of you! What can be done about Sessions though?
thank you 
SCOTUS = * SCOTUS

A crisis created by MITCH the BITCH
Thank you!!!
Thank you for this
Not bad for a SENATOR who once introduced legislation to end the filibuster. You must be so proud.
NoScotusRobeUntilWeFinishRussianProbe
Thank you! As the grandmother of a child on the autism spectrum I cannot support Gorsuch.
Go!!
What a waste of time. Don't dems have better things to do?. Gorsuch WILL be confirmed. Thank you Dingy Harry Reid.
You wackos have lost your minds.....
Thank you Senator!  So proud!
Thank you, Senator!
I'm not one of your constituents (wish I was!) but I wanted to thank you for what you did over the last 16 hours...you guys are incredible!
You ain't changing anything. With the nuclear option you just wasted 15 hours. gorsuch is going to be confirmed no matter how bitchy you get
Let's cut the theatrics and do some work. Gorsuch is closed and because you comedians invoked nuclear option RBG replacement is also a lock
Go get them!! #TheResistance
A very rare strong democrat
THANK YOU! 
Thanks Senator!
Thanks for your courage and integrity. Keep fighting the good fight! 
Bravo! We object w an extreme right winger for Scotus. #StopGorsuch #HoldTheFloor #impeachtrump #stolenseat

Wish I still lived in Or so I could vote for you again.
So proud of my Senator!
Will it be another senator or a member of Merkley's staff that gets to tell him that the actual filibuster is on Thursday?
Crybaby
Thank you for doing the right thing!

You are wasting oxygen. With all the brain-damaged folks in DC, you could very well cause a (hopefully liberal) death.
So grateful to you and the Dems for taking a stand. #StopGorsuch #resist
