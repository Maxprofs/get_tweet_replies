Watching you now, and just had to stop and tell you how inspiring you always are. Keep up the great work!
Thank you Tommy
Senator Booker you gave a masterful explanation of the importance of 9th ruling.Welcome to 2020
@JJohnson2u @HardballChris you killed it as usual sir!  Sen. Booker, your representation of NJ makes me so proud Keep talking
Keep up the great work representing us.
Wasn't a Muslim ban please explain how you think so.
not a Muslim ban once again your lying
Should be an interesting show. A half-wit & a crook. Take your pick.
Enjoy while it lasts. Won't stick!
explain your sellout vote on prescription drug pricing traitor.  We will remove you along with GOP mafia. Same
great interview Cory.  Looking forward to supporting you in 2020.
Great Job!!!
Deliberately mislabeling the #travelban decreases your credibility.
- except that it is not a Muslim ban.  #FakeNews
Mayb U can explain praising @SenSessions B4 U called him a racist LYING out both sides of your mouth
Not a Muslim band Sharia law ban as this law is not compatible with our laws.
Great interview! Keep speaking out against what is unjust and wrong!
Now back to Russian Ties and Conflicts-Of-Interest. Keep eye on  #Impeach
Senator Booker, it is a pleasure to listen to you speak.  I'm proud of you. I'm withU all the way. God bless You
"Today is a good day for the United States of America!"
no it's not the rufugees are all on welfare,why your taxes r so high.wake up folks
yeah, not true. #StepAwayFromTheEchoChamber #StudyEconomics
for all those dreaming you'll be honest about 9th Circuit ruling on @HardballChris ..  hahahahahahahahaha.
#NotAMuslimBan
ought to be a brilliant in depth interview not  lol #shiverdownmyleg
I am worried that Trump is a traitor with a Russian agenda. Nothing in his behavior suggests loyalty to the USA.
You did amazing as always!
@TrumpDefined @HardballChris  will you also talk about being in #BigPharmas pocket? We need you #StonesInGlassHouses
why do U have black Islamic domestic terrorist racists like Booker on your show @realDonaldTrump @CNN @FoxNews
thank you!
Great interview - Trump taking focus off white supremists.  Need more reporting on this.  Bannon strategy.
just heard you! Great job!!
@SenBookerOffice @HardballChris I'll be watching. Thank you 9th circuit!
Great job as always, Senator! Thanks for speaking up for this country's true founding principles.
Nice work pointing out that we should see "alt-right" for what it is: white supremacy and hatred
great discussion with CM. Esp. Trump is trying to get us to look the wrong way. My question is why?
watched it! So true what you said about hate crimes! Keep fighting
I like your reasoning, common sense & knowledge!
Keep rising up Senator Booker!
Outstanding!  Perfect summation of the issues at hand.  Thank you!
This man speaks so eloquently. Only words trump knows is see you in court
totally proud of you!  Great answers!!
Great job Senator Booker!
win for the good guys!
@SenBookerOffice @HardballChris Great interview!
great job Senator!
@hardball great job tonight calling it as it is. Need you out there front and center
Booker! Talk to @howardfineman about doing @ThisShowStinks podcast, they're local
Thank you for standing up for us! Thanks so much! Please keep pushing!
It's Obama's list of Countries, not Trumps. What would you do to keep Americans safe?
Cory is on the right track
All Dems should be bringing up Russia
& Trump defending #WhiteTerrorism 
Good job!!
Exclusive: Syria’s Assad tells Yahoo some refugees are ‘definitely’ terrorists. Cory how do you reconcile this?
Trump will be tweeting and whining about the decision for the next few weeks.
Great interview with Chris Matthews--thx for representing the Democrats well.
@realDonaldTrump HA! A complete and utter rejection of you. This will help move along you losing your mind
What his eyes  Cory look oks like he is on Crack
happy to have you as the voice of nj. We at @Action2getherNJ want a town hall meeting
when are going to run for president Cory??
made excellent points
seems like the 9th circuit just put any possible attack on the laps of the DNC for the next couple of years
as eloquent and passionate as ever. Thank you for being our voice and fighting the good fight. We appreciate you!
@SenBookerOffice @HardballChris @timkaine the moment of this ruling, feels like the America we love, let's never stop fighting !
Thank you Mr. Booker
Way to go.

Follow  Russian influence on election
Great! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
you are a sellout to the pharmaceutical industry and I don't give a shit about ur good guy act
you're on point! Sorry u were interrupted
changing channel!  trying to catch both you and @JoaquinCastrotx on CNN.  Politics is sucking away my life
POTUS doesn't seem to understand is that this job doesn't require "common sense". It requires exraordinary sense.
@SenBookerOffice @HardballChris Values??!! Over Safety-lost your mind-Lies!!!!
hey Senator, I like you but you should read Section IV of the opinion before going on
it doesn't look like they made any real decision as to whether this had discriminatory intent
were you born in the State of New Jersey yes or no?
keep fiting Cory. u make us proud
lol he ain't for America only foreigners
bust out shine, it's not a muslim ban.
Who cares what you have to say.
It's obvious you don't know the constitution. #incompetent
Blame these judges and the press if an attack happens! Blame CORY TOO!
even when it's a trump supporting white Christian? #LetsBeReal #QuebecMosqueAttack #RefugeesWelcome
Senator Booker sir, you should consider alignment with President Trump on a few of his policies. Why? For U.S.A.
WTG Cory. Thank you for your thoroughly clear explanation
tuned in, thank you Senator for standing up!
Watching right now.
Watching now and Thanks.  #StayVigilantAmerica #HoldTrumpAccountable #Resist #Indivisible
anything happens don't blame Trump
@Hardball Chris. Dems need to defend status quo vetting more. Schumer just conceded half of  DT argument. Ain't  broke don't fix
u know who is vetting rufugees the UN
@realdonaldtrump must be MAD WITH ALL CAPITALS watch the nuclear codes please
lol thank God we got someone with balls and no more black Muslim ass.
will be watching Cory!
I will be listening.
totally against our constitution. All democrats have been for a long time TREASON !!!!
Do not hold back on the truth:  Exec. Order unconstitutional. Trump cannot bully to get his way.
You should do another show- where you will not be interrupted. He seems to be a closet #trumpster now.
yeah I've noticed that too!
Looking forward to it!! Keep up the great work for all of us guys both in the media and in the justice world!!
Booker didn't have anything to do with that wake up America
The ninth circuit was wrong but we knew they were going to vote that way and it's not a Muslim ban
Checks & balances. Democracy works.  If he doesn't like it he can take to SCOTUS or another worded EO
Aren't you a Newark Slum Lord???
a little more heads-up next time, huh?
you need to go get a real job
Democrats r only for rufugees and Muslim not us citizens.
Totally changed the channel to watch! Thank you for continuing to stand up for the people!
he rocks
No one watches!
$10 bucks if you drop the word "LOSER" to describe Trump somewhere in your segment.
9th circuit to Trump.
Why don't you discuss the real reasons why you voted no on the importation bill$$$$$$
#3Zero!!!
