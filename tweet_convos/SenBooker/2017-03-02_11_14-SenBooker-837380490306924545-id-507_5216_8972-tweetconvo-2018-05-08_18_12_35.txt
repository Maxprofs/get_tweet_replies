. 100% truth. Thank you.
Stay on them like a pit bull with a pork chop!
I am certain you are not only nasty you also stink
As well, it is time to push for investigation into Trump's business violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
I couldn't agree more, but my question is: how many cabinet people have to lie about contacting Russians before we act?

No, Attorney General Jeff Sessions DID NOT lie under oath http://bit.ly/2mPaW3p  #Sessions #Hannity
Yes, thank you Senator Booker. I am one of your constituents in NJ. I fully support you.
The thing that will tie it all up is Tax Returns. Needs to come from the IRS so cannot be altered.
Proof is in the pudding! Need to see Bannon's, Flynn's, Kushner, Manafort's, Tollerson's, Ivanka's, Conway's too!
I think @CoryBooker @SenBookerOffice has the best response to #Session wearing-different-hats defense:  "Don't try to parse this right now!"
Mr Booker is exactly right - don't give Sessions an out! He lied, Period! #SessionsMustResign
He's a little racist bigot who is in sync with the other crazies in admin #DonTheCon
YouArePathetic.
As your constituent (07960), thanks for calling for Sessions' resignation! Keep America safe and secure!
I want to work for you!
I think its time NJ makes changes to who represents us in DC! Sick of you & your BS! You fell right into the cesspool!
#Senatorbooker4president2020
And we must reinstate the true winner of the November 2016 election: President Hillary Clinton.
#delusional
Thanks Senator!
Lynch and bill
bravo! Make it so!
just thrilled that you are following me I truly have the highest respect and fondness for you you're on love trumps hate
I quite agree. After @RepAdamSchiff's comments today, Trump must also quit.
#resist #ImpeachTrump
I won't be happy until President Hillary Clinton is in The White House!

@CoryBooker Thank you Senator Booker for your leadership on this! You are doing an amazing job, kind sir! #LoveTrumpsHate

Agree. How can we focus on #Trump team's links to #Russia & upcoming #immigrationorder & not #ObamaGate? #ResistTrump
The real question Corey, one that inquiring minds want to know: Do YOU even believe what you are saying?
@CoryBooker Selective outrage again. What a waste of talent.
I'm with you Senator!! I just joined my Democratic precinct today. The resistance is here! The room was full!
@CoryBooker That's my Senator Jersey Shore
we need to see trump tax returns

Shut up that is not happening
Can't he be prosecuted like Martha Stewart???
@CoryBooker no way.. be did his job like all members before him . As I see it you should if he does. He has done nothing .
@danspence2006 Now trump is accusing Obama of wiretapping OMG smokescreen trying to cover Sessions BS! We're wise dt!
and an investigation into the president spying on political rivals!
@CoryBooker thank you Senator for turning up the heat.
No we need a thorough change in political representative, journalist & the way we do business with each other
Go Sen. Booker!
Never should've been confirmed, along with most of #Pussygrabber's swamp creature nominees.
No doubt about it! I'm behind you 100% We must NEVER back down from the ReTrumplicanism that's happening &we CAN stop them!
pharma drugs. U stopped cheaper drugs from competing with big pharma. U suck
You're not telling the whole story and it's a disservice to your constituents.  Wasting time on a witch hunt.
sessions must step down
@CoryBooker You my dawg and all but Russia didn't make the DNC do everything to make sure Hillary beat Bernie in the prim
2Parties that Both Never Do much of anything.. But bailouts for the wealthy or themselves.. It's, A GO!  #StayWoke

@fangpusskins
Thank You! Keep the pressure on for full bipartisan investigation of #45 Russia connections!
watch FX series The Americans all 4 seasons n you'll know #TrumpPresident is 2nd gen directorate S
He's a spy
Who cares what @SenBookerOffice says?
Booker & @VanJones68 are yesterdays news are 3 days late to board the anti-tRump train!
Trump & Russians use exact same words to describe investigations "Witch Hunt". They are reading from the same exact script
@NoNoNotNormal Hell yea
Sir, please focus on the investigation of the entire corrupt regime.  They are all dirty and need to held accountable
schumer needs to resign as well as Pelosi for ties to Russia, dems are ridiculous Americans are sick of games
@LisaKBromley Would this be perjury and possibly obstruction?
#perjury #swamp#
please continue to stand up for US!
ABSOLUTELY  Bye  #Sessions
@CoryBooker I'm sure Sessions just discussed golf and grandkids just like you said Lynch did. #Phony Cory
@DebunkRacistH8 #Russia #Taxes #GOPCowards
@1954Astro ...And Russian links to all parties, including yours.
It's not just Sessions. It's this whole administration of kleptocrats, nepotism, sycophants & the just plain inept.
@CoryBooker on Point!
powerful,
It looks to me like Trump and the Tea Partiers  can keep anything from being done about this legally.
he put all his chest pieces in the right places to win the game. ashame for the American ppl
ASAP
...making a fool of yourself.. You are exposed for your foolishness. Watch. The next leak will explain the crazy libs
great job!!!
But we had the Russia reset and Obama saying he can do more after the election. His watch? What did he do or not do?
Please elaborate on these attacks. If true, that would mean they happened on POTUS Obama's watch.
I honestly believe such obvious inbreeding should have disqualified him right off the bat.
Hey @SenBookerOffice are you sure you want to side with the #PedoFiles ? Are you one? We'll soon find out won't we
Thank you.  Please continue to stand up for the constitution and against Trump.
pelosi schumer all members of congress have had contact with the Russian ambassador its BS..you ran a candidate Who SUCKED
You're crooked too man
attacks on what? Podesta emails are critical infrastructure
should never ever ever been confirmed this is s waste of time just fire him on behalf of the American People
Sessions, (the most racist of the Keebler elves) is or will be hiding his tax returns too. Send the IRS to his tree house he's buryin' cash.
@debbyrne52 well palosi needs to resign also.
? Sorry, the thought process u r displaying is hard to follow in a logical manner. Just can't follow you. Take care.
you and your party live in a fantasy world that no one get hurt or killed. Open your eyes because others hate us and our ways.
That has not been my experience. I lived in many counties (those I mentioned) & in Europe. Did not experience the hatred u hav
I don't have any hatred look at the angry thug demacrats. Protest yes destroying property and burning property is thug behavior.
Plez send links abt burning & destroying property. I wld appreciate. Can u also send me info abt them being registerd dems?
Get Trumps tax returns.That mofo (for sure) hasn't been paying his fair share in taxes. He's getting paid under the table/on the nightstand
How do we get an investigation on Russia and how do we get Jeff Sessions to resign as citizens of the United States?
@TeresaHutson1 Cory you are absolutely right! He shouldn't have been confirmed! We can thank traitor Joe Mandchin for this!
Awesome. ..time to expose the Russian agents and. ..
Thank you for your continued fight for justice!
keep pounding the message Senator Booker, you are a bright spot in our government.  #resist
@Politics_PR Ok. Now work on getting us UR same health plan. Bet you like it a lot. Oh and WHO pays for urs again you hack?
How can he possibly stay? The top law enforcement official in the United States committed perjury. He's fatally compromised
What about Pence? 
And NO MORE Kushner! the sieve 
And Bannon needs alcohol rehab and a mental institution/jail.
@CoryBooker What can I do to assist you in any capacity?
Please call for an independent counsel. It’s impossible for this to be handled by Sessions’ subordinates at Justice.
Yes, thank you Senator Booker!
That man-baby has to go. He's a racist liar.
you have my support!
thank you!
These videos are so good Senator! It is so refreshing to get live feedback and know our voices are heard also!
@CoryBooker  And u must come out of the closet. Did lynch resign after meeting Clinton on the tarmac?
will investigation include:Trump and Family's meetings with Putin/Russians; long suspicious history of Trump ties to PUTIN?
Have you rethought your stance on big Pharma??
thought you a smart man. Obviously not. Biased yes, prejudice yes, fair and open minded, nope. You let Lynch slide but now?
Russia would help a Sleazy Liar who Calls the American people -"Paid Protesters".#ImpeachDump #Jail4Sessions
What attacks and interference?
Breaking news: source of T***p Regime forgetfulness:
and if you Clinton shills had respected Senator Sanders we would not have #Twitler goosestepping with his Nazis
Please keep at it! Don't let up. our constitution, safety, freedoms, ideals, way of life depend on it.
and indeed this one too : https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/us-billionaire-mercer-helped-back-brexit …  You see, Cory, it is not just Russia - they have other US friends
Hey Booker, include in your investigation Ukraine who worked to sabotage our election & democracy by supporting Hillary.
Seen this one, Cory
The court of public opinion is in #Sessions
He must resign
.@SenBookerOffice .@CoryBooker Expand the investigat'n incldg all Dems who met w/ the Russian ambassador. Show transcript of all meetings.
Investigate Dems who secretly met w/ the Russian ambassador. They must explain what transpired in the meetings?
Resign ?!?!   He should be put on trial !!!

Overthrowing Liberal World Order and replacing it with R-Wing authoritarianism is the goal. #Mercer #Bannon http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/to-block-trump-play-a-bigger-game_us_589c03bce4b02bbb1816c330 … 
he's flaunting his blatant disregard 4 the institution's of USA govt! USPS is direct conflict of interest.
Cory 'progressives actually vote' Booker
this admin is corrupted to the bone! It's time 2 "cut the head of the snake"! Why aren't ya'll going after Trump?
Trump's continuation of profits from USPS & Mar-a-Largo in addition 2 other interests should b exposed & stopped!
Alabama Supreme Court should disbar him.  He should be prosecuted for perjury.
@nschim  I wish @FaceTheNation @MeetThePress @CNNPolitics  would invite you on Sunday shows
@GavinNewsom  I'm someone terribly important , a voter, & I'd like to see the two of you run 4 President 2020.
& not just because of your pretty faces!!!!
Why not go ahead and ask everyone to resign? You will find some misstep worthy. Resign yourselves - you're all tainted.
I keep hearing this but I don't see or hear anything happening. We're citizens we're fighting how WE can now it's up to you
Thank you.  Sessions must resign and we need independent investigation into Russian ties to Washington.

For a brief moment I thought this was from @SenCoryGardner and I cheered then reality hit #Trumprussia
ur constituents are paying attention you will be voted out!
THX @Good: https://twitter.com/sumware/status/837663319452450816 … @MaxineWaters 
https://twitter.com/mic/status/837714215616016385 … & Tru funny video
He's definitely telling the truth. #Sessions 
Make it happen Book. Time for Ds to step it up
@tuckertoml @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr if I told a lie under oath I would get 5 years in jail WHY IS SESSIONS DIFFERENT?
The irony is if anyone had done that in a job interview they had a few weeks ago, they'd be escorted off the premises..
waiting for you to resign over withholding affordable medication from constituents bc of donor ties
@DarthNader77 I agree! Let's make the TREASON CHARGES STICK! Enough video evidence to prosecute them all! They LOVED PRESS!
you probably need a committee to do that. You know,  one to look into UnAmerican activities and shit
not just thorough but special independent prosecutor. No exceptions we need to know whats in his taxes too
Get a court order/legislation to see his Taxes - it would answer MANY of the questions. GOP will pay in 2018
I still want to see Obozo's falsified birth cert
LMAO @ "falsified". Well, fucko, there is this thing called "google". The "REAL" one is on it.
u cant reason with idiots Tommy

@gullsimpression cory2020
I agree, but when so many cabinet members have lied under oath why stop at this one?
You're the best! #SessionsResignNOW #trumprussia #StrongerTogether
No more confirmation hearings on ANY position until #russiagate has been investigated. If AG lied why believe any nominee
GET TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS!
please move to FL!! We need you!
Whoever decided that was the font to use for this message should be fired. Use something blocky, aggressive, and sans-serif
GO CORY!!!
Who actually has the authority to appoint a Special Prosecutor into Trump and Russia?
@YourCatButtFace
according to recent WaPo article it would be Sessions or acting AG who would appoint the Sp.Pros.
To be more clear, Sessions unless he resigns before the decision to do an indep. investigation.
Thanks @YourCatButtFace I knew there are contingencies but I wasn't sure where they fell when the AG is implicated @SenBookerOffice
Thank you @CoryBooker
thank you!!!
I sincerely hope that perjury holds a stiffer penalty than just being forced to resign.
#Booker2020
HyperPartisanRhetoric is why I am not a Democrat, but vote progressive.  @Eradona
@TruthEqualsFact THANK YOU CORY BOOKER!!!!!!. HE MUST GO TODAY!
Majority agrees! Has to be independent, they've shown their hand!
Yaaawwwnnn. Fake news from somebody ho's gonna lose big in 2020.
thank you #Trumprussia
Sessions only took himself out of the T-Russian connection. Bigger issue of election tampering, he's staying. Unacceptabld.
I got a better idea take your Obama shadow government and resign yourself
@beachbumdoll The Entire Trump Administration should RESIGN!
Absolutely! Like, YESTERDAY!
I am behind your stance 100% Senator!!!!!! Signed a NJ voter.
@marieinal i am grateful for your voice. Trump & bannon must resign! They are source of infectious disease.
@CoryBooker another video mr booker!Really! Where's your video when we need good jobs,welfare reform, etc.Guess u were buzy
Before his resignation is accepted, #ProsecuteSessions!
While we're doing that, let's also investigate your ties to Big Pharma. @jimmy_dore @DrJillStein
Senaror, Sir: Who's going ti make him?!!!!
Thank you for your honesty, courage, and willingness to fight for us. Very impressed with this statement.
You have no credibility. Your antics aren't a strategy that produces results 4 the ppl.  DO YOUR JOB or GO!
