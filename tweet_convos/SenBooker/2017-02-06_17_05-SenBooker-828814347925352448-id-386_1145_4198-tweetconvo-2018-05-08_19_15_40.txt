@james_vulcano
Saw your floor speech on national news - made me proud to be from Jersey.  #resist
do u ever work? Only when u need votes. U destroyed NJ and lined ur pockets. #termlimits #crook
Thanks for standing up for education! We need it now more than ever.
Thank you, Senator Booker, for holding the floor and opposing DeVos. She is not right for job.
@AATRHF @SenateDems @CoryBooker Will Betty bring a picnic basket and blanket to sit on the house floor?
sure filled with twinkles 
Talk about artificial sweetness, eh?  Haha.
oh god yes, this one scares me as a mother
I was actually speaking of Betty Warren. 
not a fan of hers 
I'm with you.
the dems are stalling.Im a dem,and leaving the party.This is nonsense.This is why we lost!@
Totally real, actual Dem
@sumash10
but ur really opposing trump cuz he will probably arrest/fire all of u.
Why are you always AGAINST something? Bring something, non race related, that is positive to NJ.
she must be stopped...
This is @CoryBooker Theatrics. Sad! We demand real action. Schooled by GOP for years #fightback #spineless @SenateDems
Spam bot used for hating on Dems even when they hold the floor. Block. @stonesteps350
so sad you couldn't convince one more opponent to have a heart.
thank you for speaking up for ALL children #holdthefloor #DeVos
grateful for a grace filled speech recognizing education's place in affirming our children
Boring, Fruitless, Delusional, Pandering, Carnival Barker, Misleading,Whiners, Liberal party,Liars!
Thank you for continuing to challenge DeVos.  Please vote NO!
Thank you Democrats. Well done 
Too bad you couldn't get one more Republican to say no. Now our education system is screwed!
@SenateDemsTrump is a master of deceptive actions.

I'm so proud of all of you!!!
Thank you Senator #holdthefloor
I've been watching the live feed. You people rock! Thanks for hanging in there.
Glad you're standing for the people (for a change... instead of for Big Pharma) Keep it up!
He's always standing up for the people. Sad you can't give thanks without backbiting.
@atomicxblue
I would watch but CSPAN on cable here in N Texas has been unwatchable (packet loss) for weeks.
The link to watch live at http://www.senate.gov/floor/  is dead, too.
Ah, http://democrats.senate.gov/video/live/  works if you override your browser for mixed security.
But that one (different from the first I mentioned) auto-refreshes, interrupting the stream.
Starting to think someone doesn't want people to watch.
You can listen on @cspanradio I think. @TcpProtocol @SenBookerOffice @SenateDems @CoryBooker
What a fraud.
Here is a fantastic Cory Booker speech in favor of school choice and charter schools. Venue is Betsy DeVos’s group. https://youtu.be/6pHqWDqdkSM 
Thank you for the fight. We can't win them all but we will win some.
Thank you for fighting for what's right. Public education is at stake.
Thank you for your determination!
Thank you for standing up against DeVos- from a HS Special Ed Science teacher
@lauratron1000 @SenateDems @CoryBooker We thank you and the @SenateDems for showing integrity and spine.
thank you sir!
thank you!
Stop protecting the teachers unions! Don't u care that a child in the inner city wd have a chance?
States that have strong teacher's unions score higher on tests than weak union states. Google it!!!
Schools r failing in inner cities.Kids deserve school choice. It cud make a huge difference to succeed.
Thank you. We're grateful.
.@SenBookerOffice @SenateDems @CoryBooker keep it up! We are counting on you!!!
thank you!!

The only people pushing the false narrative of ending Public Schools are Unions.
IDEA is a failed policy.  IEP program should be expanded by the state's. Equity =/= all learn equal
