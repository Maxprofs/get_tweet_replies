RED ALERT
THREAD: GOP HEALTH CARE REPEAL IS BACK 
Danger real • Activism needed
…
They are killing ACA anyways and blaming it on Obama. They have such shit ideas, it's like they don't want it too pass so they can
Obamacare was designed to be self sustaining by 2016. It wasn't. The States could not afford it. It's imploding. Must be fixed.
Then they should work on fixing it instead of killing it along with millions of Americans! This is selfish and pompous.
The problem is, no one wants Trump to succeed in fixing it. That includes McCain! Dems want it to fail. They want USA to fail too!
Not true.  Trump is and always has been a failure. Everything he touches fails. He doesn't care about anything but HIM, and undoing 1/
I wish he'd touch himself more often.
I bet @FLOTUS thinks the same thing though!

Just left messages for all my senators and my house representative. Will be sending faxes and emails as well.  We do NOT want this bill!
GOP PLEASE STOP THIS REPEAL OBAMA CARE CRAP!  Tweak it and MOVE ON! And to SANDERS..this is WRONG time for Single Payer rhetoric! Fix ACL!
GOP let's try something different let's be historic. Make Obama care better. Do the opposite of whatever you want to do make people well
They won't, doing so would show that they have hearts, souls & feelings for someone other then their campaign donors. GOP=Guard Our Pennies!
@SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski I hope once again yon will come to the rescue of the American people. Health care is a right.
No it isn't. It is your right to work and purchase insurance but you are not entitled to Govt funded healthcare at expense of taxpayers
Under this bill, people with metastatic cancer will pay $142,650 more a year to get treatment. I find this really sad
How do you know that?  Did you read the bill?  First time I've heard this
Hey Carolyn - I found the info here.     https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/09/18/439091/graham-cassidy-aca-repeal-bill-cause-huge-premium-increases-people-pre-existing-conditions/ …
Please bare in mind; That Mr; Trump, and his Machiavellian team, do not  care if the poor have healthcare or not!! It's part of the plan!

Obamacare will implode. Must be overhauled.
Why are people so impossibly stupid? The GOP wants you ridiculous #TRUMP supporters poor, sick, and helpless. Wise up!
You are too far gone to waste time on!
great thread, but what you should understand with doing threads like this your average person isn't going to understand let alone read it
this needs to be broken down into layman's terms if you really want your average reader to pay attention
Direct lines to key Senators:

ACA aka Romneycare is not enough. Medicare for all. Now.
@SenDeanHeller: Greatly looking forward to your imminent defeat. You sold out your constituents & all Americans for craven $$$ grab.
Me too, my parents live in Nevada and will be voting you out.
Trust me. My senators don't care.  They wrote it.
Try calling your governor. This plan will devastate their budget.
If trump accomplishes NOTHING ELSE,come HELL or high waters,he WILL DESTROY OUR AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARESO MALEVOLENT
There's nothing affordable about the ACA. My premium was $740/mo. Medicare for all.
Did anyone expect them to give up? NO Saw this horse & pony over 70 times in 8 yrs.Doing same thing expecting different result. GOP INSANITY
GOP do the right thing make America well
THEY NEVER HAVE AND THEY NEVER WILL. Check healthcare history in this country the truth hurts.

It is apparent that Republicans are like advanced Syphilis and will not go away.  Join the movement to end this.
There needs to be another demonstration against repeal and replace Obamacare care (ACA)
Prefer to email them?  Use the link below.  Better yet, do both!

@RBReich

Called both of my republican senators to voice my opposition to Cassidy-Graham
Why aren't people paying attention this time?
Too busy reading Clinton's book.
Left messages for Flake & McCain and Gov. Ducey. I'm fighting this all the way
Ben is a freaking real life honest to god HERO!  

Thank You Ben!!
Repeal. Now!

@amyklobuchar @alfranken I know you will do right by us and work to stop this repeal attempt #SaveACA
Thanks for all the work you do Ben. Working the phone!
.Pressing forward for #TrumpCare and against @MoveOn & their bearded chimp on a leash, Reich!
ObamaCare is Unaffordable.  Not only that,  many Americans only have  1 option,
under ObamaCare.

TROOPS U KNOW WHAT 2 DO! GET GOING! NOW! AND DO IT NOW!!!
Just called Alexander's office. Got a resounding "he has not taken a public position" on G-C.  Even though he supposedly has his own plan?
Everyone here, don't forget to call your state governors as well as your senators.

We need all hands to denounce this.
I just used http://5calls.org  to do so.
My 1st time using it. I LOVE that it dials for you and even suggests a script. Even reminded me to leave my address! A+
do u have a video like this http://bit.ly/SSmith4Health 
Are they using a renewed effort as a distraction from something big? Feels strategic in a non-health care kinda way...
I'd like to ask @GOP (who get FREE health care) WHY they r so AGAINST ALL Americans  having GOOD AFFORDABLE health care? Pls RT
"TreasonousGOPers" hope to get what they want by plainly & repeatedly tiring out everyone who is trying to save ObamaCare
Was able to reach both senators to tell them to end #ACA
Done 
Looks like the Prez & Mitch tricked #Nancy&Chuck to buy some time for Senate GOP to work on healthcare instead of working on Debt Ceiling?
Week ahead: Senators near deal to stabilize ObamaCare markets
Was able to reach BOTH Senators in minutes-   Folks PLEASE  call!   .#VoteNoGrahamCassidy !!!  Worst, meaner version of repeals
@womensmarch why not fight against FGM instead? Oh yeah because it doesn't make you look like a hero?
Watch @HonorDiaries
What Senators? I'm from DC. #DCStatehood
@womensmarch okaa
I'm NOT calling I live in CA. Have sensible MOC's. Want to leave lines open for other states reps. CALL PLEASE.
Oh yeah. I have them on favorites list. But don't want to block the main lines

I'm out of the country and can't call. Is there anything I can do aside from encourage others to call?
Thank you for your work on this.
As a DC resident, I don't have a Senator.
I'm with you on this friend.
Was Alexander bipartisanship w Murray a smokescreen 2 lull American people while GOP working behind scenes against them? Has he rolled over?
My state's senators are both Dems.  Is there something I should be doing?
Call them and tell them to use every tool they have to keep this from passing.
Let's do this #SaveACA #SaveMedicaid
