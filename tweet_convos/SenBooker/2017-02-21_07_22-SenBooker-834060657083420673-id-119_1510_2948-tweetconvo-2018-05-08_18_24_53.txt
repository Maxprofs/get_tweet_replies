@beaglefreedom @CoryBooker @USDA 
@altusda  animals can't speak we need to be good stewards of the earth and look out for them
Sounds good. Now vote for lower drug prices. Thanks.

They love to hide all of their dirtiness behind closed doors, let's stay alert on the net!
@altusda @CoryBooker I am an wthical vegan.  WHere do we call to get records restored to the USAD site?
Which methods are most effective? Phone? Email? Petition? Other?
Please provide details to make it easy.
Great  speaker !

This doesn't make up for your No vote on reimporting drugs from Canada.
If it's the law - sue them to force it.
wish you said the same for people & said yes to import drugs, saddened, how big donors kill us..
@uniguide @CoryBooker @USDA Thank you for having the heart and courage to stand up for animals.
I wish I could like this twice! 
@hondo750 @CoryBooker @USDA the Horse Protection Act violation records are crucial, too. Please restore them!
Thank you sir!
Thank you! Can you put a link in tweet so people know what they can sign or call & we can get the word out?
Why did they change? Who is benefiting? Meat industry?

Thank you @CoryBooker for using your voice for the voiceless.  Much respect & to you.

Wow, Booker is starting well with his future Presidential Campaign.
Far too many disastrous policies affecting humans for me to get worked up over this. Sorry
Treatment of animals indicates treatment of people.  It's one barometer for empathy.
Tho not as good a test as actual treatment of people.Am against animal cruelty but priorities!

@Alyssa_Milano @CoryBooker @USDA What was the reason? Frivolous costly suits or investigations? Cost cutting? Duplication?
Thank you sir!
It's clear, along with many people, animals are not important to this administration.
along with the HPA violations which were also removed. Thank you, Sen Booker.

Thank you @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker for striving to restore @USDA accountability!
