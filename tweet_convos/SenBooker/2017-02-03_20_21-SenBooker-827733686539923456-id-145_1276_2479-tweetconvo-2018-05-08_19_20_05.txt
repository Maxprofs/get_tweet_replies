Both of my NJ Senators are on board. Do I have standing with out-of-state Senators?Please advise.
@CoryBooker yes, CALL your SENATOR demand a NO vote....
. Please republicans - vote your conscious - not your party so you can live with yourselves.
Just saw on MSNBC 805 of charter school students rank lowest in reading & math! NOT ACCEPTABLE!
Hmmm.. how many votes were we away from passing Bernies Pharma legis. Cory? corporatist sellout dirty blue dog
Can we find one more Senator to support our children??? #holdthefloor
@CoryBooker running for President in 2020 try 2024
come on call in some favors! American children deserve better!  #NoDevos
thank you Alana! I've been hounding @CoryBooker for days saying same thing. He's posting old news!
maybe 1 of them big pharma guys owes him a favor? Come on Cory you need to help Americas children!

Here is a fantastic Cory Booker speech in favor of school choice and charter schools. Venue is Betsy DeVos’s group. https://youtu.be/6pHqWDqdkSM 
Thank you for your efforts @SenBookerOffice, but it's so sad that 71M Americans have to work so hard to get just ONE vote to keep DeVos out.
@LisaOKC What we need is affordable meds & Democrats who act lik Democrats. #feelthebern
do not even have to step forward.  Tell McConnell it is over and let DeVos withdraw
Sen Booker your a smart man. If you want to be POTUS one day get away from Pocahontasand Chucky.
@vvega1008 My GOP Senator, @robportman, doesn't have a spine.
Call @BenSasse  & @marcorubio, GOP Senators showing spine. NO to Sessions as vital DeVos! Putin collusion = treason.
proof that your sen is a partisan hypocrite. She was ok to work w when a mayor, but it's diff when your bought/paid for now
@sacca except if you live in PA. @SenToomey is not interested in hearing from his constituents.
@SaysSheToday @BillCassidy & @JohnKennedyLA of Louisiana won't answer their phones when constituents try to call @LaDemos
@CoryBooker if you need an ed secretary gimme a call... I'm at least qualified.
If you guys get a busy signal, keep trying! I called the next day and was able to get through. Try different times of day.
@CoryBooker thank you! She might actually be more unqualified for public office than trump.
what if that doesn't work; then what's the next step?
Heartbroken. I called, tweeted, talked. I greatly thank you guys for holding the floor last night. We'll get through this:)
Did, and Done.
@CoryBooker pls. urge the 23 Republican Senators who've accepted almost $1M in contributions from #DeVos &family to abstain
@CoryBooker This is sad. Voting for POTUS  not for the educ of children.  Say no Sen Toomey
Thank you Senator
@CoryBooker Fantastic!!
Work on @SenDeanHeller for us Won in 2012 by less than 12,000 votes and in 2016 NV voted for Hillary and @SenCortezMasto
maybe remind Senator Grassley he went after For-Profit higher ed for rising costss AND all Devos stands for!
@CoryBooker Unless you live in Iowa. Our Senators have sold their souls for the Trump delusion.
@CoryBooker who's are best chance? we will flood them with convincing support for our cause! Just point us  in that dir
@CoryBooker please, 1 more Republican senator, come to our senses and vote no on DeVos!
@CoryBooker And you and your Obama and buddies gave UN organizations 9.5 billion of our tax payers money its ours puck Dems
.@SenTedCruz Now's your chance, Senator Cruz. Vote YOUR conscience! @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker
@CoryBooker agree! But what about SESSIONS? Way more dangerous...
Thank you Sen. Booker
@CoryBooker let's see if the same applies when I call in to have Gorsuch confirmed.
@CoryBooker No response from McConnell or Rand Paul. They just don't care.
@CoryBooker What are the @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats doing to make this happen?
can i even call your office, I'm very distraught upon reading this article http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-havent-learned-cory-booker-chooses-wall_us_5879119ee4b077a19d180d45?ncid=engmodushpmg00000003 …
@CoryBooker you pass on good education President
Meanwhile, NC is dealing w/ delusional @ThomTillis & @SenatorBurr who think she has redeeming qualities
@CoryBooker  why can't one male Republican step forward? Too scared of Mr T?
@CoryBooker @JerryMoran It's not too late to be brave Senator Moran
the children who are disabled and use the idea program, will suffer under @BetsyDeVos we need to move forward. NOT BACK
@CoryBooker money really does buy politician's.  How can these senators vote on DeVous.  Conflicts everywhere #VoteNoDevos
we need our military to oust this coupé out of the Peoples House, and soon. Before danger comes
Sir, why are taxpayers paying $98,000 for secret service last week for @EricTrump ?!
This is outrageous and WRONG!!!
@CoryBooker I've been calling mine, but DeVos gave $43K to Burr's campaign so I figure that one is a lost cause.
The @SenateGOP should withdraw DeVos name. They set her up to fail-unfair to her. She's America's punchline now. #NoOnDeVos
Tell us who? It obviously won't be Pat Toomey. He doesn't care what his constituents think.
@CoryBooker Senator do you know which GOP members we should focus our effort?
Call @SenToomey at (202) 224-4254. I left a voicemail today!!! I'm shocked but I did.  #noDevos
how about getting votes for something important? get votes to stop John McCain stealing Oak Flat
@CoryBooker 2020 "never gonna happen, no no no!!!
@CoryBooker GOP is already working to nullify those honest phone calls by paying for opposition. http://theslot.jezebel.com/someone-is-paying-strangers-online-to-beg-for-betsy-dev-1791976320?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=The_Slot_twitter …
@CoryBooker smart people will come out and govern for the benefit of the country
Called @DarrellIssa don't expect much except voting him out next cycle. If facts matter at all...
@CoryBooker Republican Senators get a back bone or go down with Trump
@CoryBooker she's paid well for a seat on trumps cabinet doubt any other Republican will vote against they have all been pd
@CoryBooker vote no like you did on this bill?
#YesDeVos
let's hope it worked!
@CoryBooker I called "Little Marco"
So what. Waste of time as Pence is the tie breaker.
@CoryBooker @ThomTillis please don't let #BetsyDeVos get confirmed
You've needed one more vote for three days. You should be honest and admit that Devos is going be confirmed.
@CoryBooker is there someone you recommend working on the most?
how many times do we need to call ur office before u reverse ur vote on presecription drugs. Don't be corporate
@CoryBooker How about leaving voicemails to these senators I did. #golddiggingelephants
Keep it up! Keep calling and emailing and you need to keep talking to the other senators! NO TO DEVOS!
@CoryBooker tried calling Sen. Rubio and couldn't get through. Sent email and posted on his website though.

OK Sen Inhoff tells those who write/call that, "I vote for who I want to"  Nice.  Serving OK!!  
PLEASE! Make sure there's #noDevos PLEASE
@SenatorEnzi @SenJohnBarrasso @SenatorDurbin @SenBobCasey @SenJeffMerkley @SenatorTomUdall PLEASE LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE!!!!!
We need more like you! America's public schools deserve better.
@SheWhoVotes I just saw a clip of @SenatorBurr & @SenAlexander confirming Devos. They should be ashamed. No concern 4 kids.
@make5calls senator Cornyn and Cruz stopped answering their D.C. Office lines. You have to call local at this point.
Sen. Toomey (R-PA) 610-434-1444, Sen. Heller (R-NV) 775-686-5770 and Sen. Portman (R-OH) 513-684-3265
@judesterworld Maybe Mr ALEXANDER would vote against her if he gets enough input.
@make5calls Not going to be the crooked Senator from Missouri.
of course in CO @SenCoryGardner claims all opposition is paid out of state interests. Maybe you can tell him otherwise!
@make5calls name one or more and I'll call
Americans should be able to USE GO FUND ME to collect $ to become COLLECTIVE DONORS to compete w MEGA DONORS- HOW ABOUT IT?
These Republicans stick like GLUE together - how about introducing a BILL to let us USE go fund me the same as DONORS do ?
@MonsterMarcia ,@Sen Toomey Pat Toomey's office said he is supporting her. He's not listening to the people of PA.
"Hundreds" of calls? I get more in a day asking if I'm happy with my cable provider. . . @SenBookerOffice
call and let them know that 'the people govern'...
Can we urge all Senators to vote against ANY Secretary of Education? Get DC out of our classrooms!
the problem with obstruction  like crying wolf. I doubt if you get one more, may loose one more likely. Been against all DT
.@SenBookerOffice Alexander?   Srsly?  If he votes no I will become a vegan for a month
Yes!  I'm a former professor & I just about had an attack during her hearing-she lacks basic knowledge.  Kids need better!
@cspanwj
Our youth ($1.4T+ loans) are indentured servants to "Education Lobby" & NEA who lavishly fund campaigns.
@cspanwj the NEA pays well, doesn't it @SenBookerOffice ??  We spend more on "Educ" than ever, yet kids can't read effectively.
If you think charters in MI (DeVos) did better-think again.
What we have now is cradle to Public Ed to JAIL.
we've tried calling @SenToddYoung but no answer. I just sent him a tweet. #IDEIA #speced
we have tried calling
Don't say it worked until voted down. Easy to vote no to look good to constituents if you know party still has 50 yes votes
I believe 1 must be quietly hidden. I believe in you to work your magic & find this individual & convince merits of no vote
Thank you for all you are doing for America - Love you!
If sessions didnt have a vote she would not be confirmed.  How is it right for him to have a vote still?
thank goodness you are already on the right side of the fight! Thank you for being my Senator, keep up the good work.
I'm not convinced that calling helps. I've seen reports of people protesting Devos at their Reps office & no response
I've called my FL senator, Rubio, but he's accepted lots of dough from the DeVos family.  Not expecting much.
my reps will be voting yes despite record numbers of calls asking them to vote no. 2018 in OK is going to be interesting.
Block her!!! Cmon people!!! She's completely unfit! Thank you Senator for voting NO on DEVOS!
I can't call my Senators, @SenBookerOffice, because all I get is the fast busy signal. THIS IS ON Y'ALL! Don't let us down! @KristineWyllys
try faxing if you can! I use http://faxzero.com . our voices carry toooons more weight as constituents.
bonus. It emails you to let you know when they got it.
That's bc he rec'd $$$$ from her. She owes OH millions. His phone's now off the hook. Give him hell for us if you see him!
Our senator - @senrobportman has received THOUSANDS & teachers marched on his office today but he doesn't care. #NoDevos 
https://www.change.org/p/press-robportman-com-demand-senator-rob-portman-resigns?recruiter=205171556&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink … tell him!
@SenCoryGardner Colorado deserves better. Vote No.
Someone put out an APB for @SenToomey
Calling nightly. (8-yr old knocked on bathroom door last night, "Calling more senators, Mom?")  Suggestions to call?
These crackerjack picks don't have the AA, BA, MA, PhD or JD degrees for the departments for which they were nominated!
I called @SenToomey office 2day. No answer & I couldn't leave a msg b/c the voicemail was full. He's ignoring us!
what can we boycott to get through to Toomey?
Not sure abt boycotting but 1 idea is 2 take out a full page ad in the local newspaper.
all due respect this is old news! DeVoss already passed a vote today 52-48. We need YOU to call in some favors now
final vote is Monday.  That was a preliminary vote of some sort.
Are there any senators still on the fence?
Joni Ernst from Iowa says she is still undecided.
thanks!
it only works if you can get through to your Senator.  Right @SenToomey?
I was able to get Toomey's voicemail today. I was stunned. He changed his outgoing message too! (202) 224-4254 good luck!
thank you Alice!  I couldn't believe I finally had him "on the phone."  I added a few "and while I have you" there too.
thank you for fighting the good fight. Stand strong sir! You make us proud! #NoonDeVos
Cory not proof at all, just you blowing smoke and grasping at straws.
who is on the fence and can actually be swayed?
if only KS senators listened to all their constituents who want them to vote no. Told my today would be voting yes
