@bluetoes5   Ah, but last go around you voted against it. I have that choice every month. Stop by and I'll go over it w/ U
Not the same bill.
it was a safety issue before. @SenBookerOffice consistently supports Rx import SAFELY to  drug cost.
IMO, from Canada have no, or few issues. We have safe drugs w/ side effects that R worse
I work in healthcare, and FDA has very specific standards of safety, for good reason
I did as well, and I politely disagree. That's why I love America- people can disagree
just to be clear, are you saying the FDA doesn't have rigorous thresholds for safety?
I am saying I am comfortable buying the same med in Canada for less.
@CoryBooker how dare you post this after your vote AGAINST cheaper drugs. What a joke.
Do you know that vote was merely symbolic?
also there was not adequate safety in the previous Act. This one corrects that, hence @SenBookerOffice is supporting it
@CoryBooker I agree with you sir. I am glad you are my senator.
We sure shouldn't have to....thank you Sen Cory Booker
I agree, but I still have concerns about the campaign money you take from pharma. Seems quite hypocritical.
@SenatorMenendez 6 Ways to Put Public Interest Ahead of Big Pharma Profits. Thank you @yesmagazine!
@CoryBooker things must change, thanks for you efforts
@CoryBooker by not clapping for our President you are not clapping for Americas success! Good one Cory! Everyone saw.
lol I highly doubt it. People don't even like to fly in and out of there. Epic failure
It's time for you totaking BigPharma contributions. We're watching your every move.
Then why did you vote against #Bernie's last bill?
Your #DrugSafety excuse is #BS
#Canada has #SaverDrugLaws then #US
@CoryBooker how much did big pharma give to you? Just wondering
Merck drug 65% gross margin (GM), sell to McKesson - 6% GM; sell to CVS 100% GM. See the problem now? It's RETAIL!
I'm glad you learned your lesson from your last pro-pharma vote on similar leg. Next time, get it right the FIRST time.
I'm constantly told med manufacturer doesn't have it or are months behind in sending. It's a common life necessary med.
Yes, fall in line if you want to keep your job. You stay there. The original was to include safety rule so plz.
Senator Cory Booker worth listening to I think he's pretty great
Cory??? Are you turning back from the crazy left? Maybe you should apaulagize to @jeffsessions
Thank you so much for all of your hard work!!
@CoryBooker @JessicaGimeno
Good job!   Clinton/Booker 2020!!
thats why i buy directly from Canada.  Much cheaper!
@CoryBooker Cory Booker, corporate hooker...
inRe:meds 'Do Harm' &help BUT babies dying o epilepsy b4 weed gets2em CHEAP2grow&NO DEATHS :that logics how we lose youth
@CoryBooker 72% voter support prescript import. You represent their interests but campaign donations take precedence right?
Hey @KyleKulinski @dpakman what do you think of this?
@CoryBooker Thank You
@CoryBooker keep on the russia connection!
@CoryBooker we're watching. Timing is everything and you won't fool us with a failed bill that is weeks too late
@CoryBooker are you kidding me. When does his term end ?
I love you immensely
@CoryBooker your a filthy j o . you know nothing about the fda & red tape . your rhetoric will guarantee 8 years of Trump 
Hey Cory,can you say @potus has only been in office 4 weeks? Give it up. U ruined yr chances for 2020, & O ruined it 4 U
@CoryBooker You were a bad choice for Newark and an even worse choice to represent NJ!!
@CoryBooker Really, tell that to the people who stopped their meds due 2 high copays under Obamacare!!
We had the chance to get affordable from Canada but you helped destroy that. Was a big supporter of yours till you did that
@CoryBooker thank you! Please continue to fight for the people of NJ and USA!
why are you sitting every time you should be standing and applauding you're a puppet
Trump sickens me--how about you? Yemen Raid=His First Bengazi. Investigate don't clap.
@CoryBooker hopefully you are listening to president Trump. Lower prescription cost which you voted against.
@CoryBooker Very true!For years our Seniors have struggled with this problem,thank you!Jersey Shore
@CoryBooker 
You finally woke up....People first not Party
@CoryBooker is there NO end on how you disappoint New Jerseyans? UGHHHHH
Bottom line: unmitigated greed of the big pharmas being allowed to manifest ongoing!
disrespectful hater, all if us who despised Obama still had enough dignity. No more. Ur new generation of haters.
You have been in DC for a while.  What took so long to introduce this?
@CoryBooker You should clap for the president.
why so concerned about prescription drugs?
@CoryBooker Why do the people behind him look so nervous? I have an easy theory.HE IS LYING! They should be nervous.Scared?
You are a joke! You now want to do your job! Is that bc your party had a wake up call! Your corrupt party lost the elect.
this man is incredible. I love him!
Canadian drugs are perfectly safe. Stop bullshitting about that. Progressives actually look things up.
I totally agree with you,  Senator Booker !
for too many years big pharmacy soaked the poorest of the American families!  Time to make changes
@CoryBooker are people in Canada dying from these drugs? No, the answer is no
@CoryBooker that is big pharm's narative and you are clearly in their pocket
@CoryBooker kiss ass.. you still shouldn't run in 2020
@CoryBooker maybe a look in the mirror would be the thing to do
Big Pharma has international patents - U line the same companies pockets when you buy there or here. Regulate costs HERE!!!
Agree.  Problem is Big Pharma $ and the answer is campaign finance reform
This isn't the answer- U need to "regulate" the cost of drugs HERE - I buy from "canadian" Pharms -Drugs not made in Canada
@CoryBooker cash them checks!!!
@CoryBooker Your voting record suggests you believe otherwise.
@CoryBooker THANK YOU CORY BOOKER!
YASS!! Rent=$448/mo, rx=$395/mo, util=$175/mo, food $200/mo, ins=$298/mo all on fixed income!!w/pt D the struggle is real!!
As much as so many of us want this, we need to make sure the drugs we get from Canada work properly
@CoryBooker the bigger crisis right now is the President and his white supremacist cohorts. Drug prices are also bad.
@CoryBooker yesssssss say that!!! Now how do we get Trump to understand that???? :-\
Easy, he's not ignorant,or waiting for a rent check.He is more impartial than any I've seen.
@CoryBooker keep fighting! We are with you! #resist
@CoryBooker Big pharma is a huge problem and owns too many politicians. Allow testing on herbs that worked for generations
@CoryBooker Ur putting the cart before the horse. Fix why are real Canadian drugs cheaper than my Medicare part D copay 1st
Cory did you drink the Trump Kool-aid? Your master Obama is not going to like that!
Oh SNAP You called @realDonaldTrump out on his lies! Keep at it. Well done! 
@CoryBooker 
Wow now you are thinking like President Trump
Amazing how so many commenters here seem to think there's only one bill that is correct. Bills are improved all the time.
#bullshit, Don't pretend to care about peoples' health right after you vote against importing Canadian drugs. You're a hack
Why don't you sponsor legislation to bring down the cost of drugs in this country?
@CoryBooker where were you when Obama and Zeke muffled this punt?
@CoryBooker 
@CoryBooker don't you take money from big pharma companies
@CoryBooker I think Canadian drugs were probably pretty safe.
no, Canadian drugs marked for "export" don't go through same standards as ones sold in Canada.
@CoryBooker Sen Booker, please run in 2020!
no more African Americans in Washington
@CoryBooker didnt u just vote not to lower prescript costs? Make up ur mind cory bullshiter! Ur in their pockets
And why Sir can't we just cap the retail cost Big Pharma puts on Rxs in the USA??Is it most aren't made in the US anymore?
Nice shot at recovering from your recent pro-pharma/anti-constituent vote.  Get right; stay right.
.@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker if only we would #legalizeIT. MANY prescriptions could be replaced by a flower  #problemsolved
Um no. Some, but not many.
Why'd you vote against the last one, then?
Becuase last one wasn't right. Booker is the shit.
True political brilliance here.
there is my great Senator @SenBobCasey behind you. Thank you!
@CoryBooker cool... now stop taking money from pharmaceutical companies.
u need to wake up and smell the expense in prescipt meds
I really like this guy.
if only you hadn't voted against the last one after taking all that loot.
@cre8ive_juice Yeah I'm sure Senator Booker will make everything better. (Wanking motion)
Free trade.  I like it.
This needs to be said, over and over...And over. By everyone

Until something changes
term limits
