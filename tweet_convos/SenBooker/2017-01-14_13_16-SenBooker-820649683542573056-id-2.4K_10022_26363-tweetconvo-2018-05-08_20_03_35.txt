start your 2020 run the day off the inauguration, please.
why?
someone on the dems need to step up. Why not Booker?
he's a wall street Dem that's why
#'s 3, 17, and 20 are particularly concerning.
not trying to be rude but is that a list of his donors?
No, it's a list of contributions from their employees.
Sure, but the point is that they want something in return.  Notice how there aren't any unions  on this list?
You do realize that your peeps, including myself, are pissed at you for the Canadian drug thing, right? You could have explained
Cara, there's no "explanation." @CoryBooker has a choice to make: Continue on current path or start walking the progressive walk
dont let facts get in the way
Oh my. Do tell. What "facts" do you believe were not considered? Let me guess:
I stand corrected 
I was wrong you were Right
Thanks, but right/wrong doesn't matter - getting neolib corp Dems to be progressive does.
I would say middle of the road governance driven my common sense and not party allegiance
Indeed. & anyone who chooses Big Pharma contributors over Bernie's bill loses legitimacy as well :-(
when did this amendment becomes #Bernie alone
Wasn't Bernie alone. 13 R's crossed to stand with 99%. We were sold out by our own
notice you only drag the black senator where are the white ones
Wow... no one had hopes for Menedez etc, we had hope for @CoryBooker  No extra pass for being black, sorry
Seriously - race card? @CoryBooker being judged on the content of character / votes, not his race
yet you don't harass the other Dems who voted against the amendment
Are you seriously suggesting @CoryBooker gets a pass because he's black? On "judge by character" MLK day? smh
If he wasn't in arrears with his property taxes; I might respect him
Then boycott the Inauguration Booker. Cowboy up.
Well, I mean, #Obama really isn't #BarryDavis' name soooooo... there's that.
uninformed. The drugs could come from anywhere with no regulations. Cheaper isn't always better. Be mad at pharmas
Trump much more legitimate than Lewis and his race baiting friends.
racist michael
Once again, I, an American citizen am asking to have a discussion with you about your drug cost vote.
Are you willing to discuss it in the public forum? I promise to be civil.
This is the sixth time on three different platforms (calling, social media, etc). Please address it.
PLEASE block Tillerson!!! PLEASE!! Thank you
- @corybooker bo delegitimized himself. You spelled delegitimized wrong.
Coming from someone who sold Americans down the river for his pharmaceutical buddies. Shame.
Question: It's okay to attack Trump, though? I mean, this didn't come out of nowhere...
how can a Jewish Group support someone who advocates 4 abusive Sodomy of women, 1 of 3 Cardinal sins
Then PLEASE boycott the inaugural events! Come join us at the #WomensMarch!  #Resist!
So they go low and we promise to go lower. Great example for our children.
remember when he lied about meeting hillary clintion at the march of mlk? Just to deframe bernie.
seems to me John want to dish it out u shouldn't be so thin skinned
because you can critize a whiteman but when a black man gets criticized is racism double standard
Your on the take...And I had so much hope for you. #purge2018 you made the list.
Deflect and blame.  This is also Jonn Lewis:
@StarJonesEsq @repjohnlewis @BarackObama @realsteveharvey Still don't understand why @TheRevAl wasn't asked to meet with Trump?
ur are all an inspiration. Black men my son's can emulate. @CoryBooker u have my vote for president
Yr voice on this matter is admirable, but your vote on prescription drugs this week was disappointing. Hope your stance evolves
Trump still has enough legitimacy to lose some??
Most Americans didn't vote for him. His base is racists, sexists & idiots. Most Americans aren't.
@birdman8272 @GeoffThorne @DRAlNTHESWAMP @scottEweinberg @CoryBooker Since all Republicans are racists = OK, that's a go. What else?
Take me out of this thread please. ty
Take yourself out.
another crybaby Philip @CoryBooker
lewis needs to keep his mouth shut if he doesn't want repercussions
You lost a bit in my eyes with your vote to support big pharma rather than the people who need the meds. Just sayin’
You are so correct...John Lewis is an American Hero that should honored for all he has done.
Is treating people different because of skin color acceptable to you?
John Carruthers Stanly was largest slave owner in North Carolina he was a democrat and he was BLACK
Are you attending the inauguration?
anyone defending $HilLIARy/Votes against lower drug prices has no credibility with ME
anyone that sides with Big Pharma over American people loses legitimacy in my book
The likes of @CoryBooker @repjohnlewis & @BarackObama telling 63 million ppl that we are racists is priceless. #MLKDay
@TrussElise @CoryBooker @repjohnlewis @BarackObama they don't believe it

I hope that means you'll be voting against all his appointments and not attending his inauguration, @CoryBooker. @repjohnlewis @BarackObama
With MLK Day approaching this is the  perfect time to look inside the  of Trump  ... #OriginalBirther #NotMyPresident
#JohnLewis is an American Hero
@realDonaldTrump is human garbage
#illegitimatePresident @seanspicer
@JerryFordJr @repjohnlewis @BarackObama I thought in your mind, u already no legitimacy for #PresidentTrump well?? 
thank you Cory
Total fraud Cory Booker 'honored to partner' with Sessions just last year on civil rights measure.
Cory Booker big pharmacies Mr corporate Hooker! You voted against Obama more than once. In favor of.
Although I am African American i can never vote for you
@tcstephenson1 @repjohnlewis @BarackObama Big pharmaceutical companies tell you to say that? $$$
@rshihadeh @repjohnlewis @BarackObama.CORRECTION: John Lewis attacked the President Elect and got a response.
Trump's ties to Russia don't scare you? They should
At this time the intel is unreliable! The ties to George Soros are far more dangerous!
oh lord! Thank you. Have a good evening.
You as well!
Very good point, Senator! @realDonaldTrump
Booker a Bad LIAR ! U looked like a Clown while telling LIES  on Sen Sessions !
He's being persecuted hurry hurry call the police. Oh they were killed by BLM terrorist group. Look the man has an IQ of a gold fish.
ITS OK FOR LEWIS TO ATTACK AND DEMORALIZE TRUMP BUT IT GOES BOTH WAYS CORY
Racist dividers. U do realize that 8 yrs ago race relations were improving. Soros-Olamo no likey!!
Obama is a war criminal,Lewis is ex black panther Ran over and beat by democrats he then joined=Sellout
@LacyClayMO1 @repjohnlewis @BarackObama DOUBLE STANDARD-  finally a politician that doesn't put up with  your political bullying
Why, oh why, isn't @POTUS declaring martial law, vs handing USA over to known traitor??
Olamo's birth certi. is forged. Why does he lock up his prez papers 4 10 yrs. WTF is he Hiding!!
Mr. Lewis took a Billy club for human rights, he stood for all what many would run. That's a hero!
Please boycott the Inauguration!!! Go to the #WomensMarch on Saturday instead.
I have no sympathy for J Lewis. He should not have called Trump illegit cos of Russia. If u dish it, learn to take it in good faith
are you skipping the inaugural?
because you should skip
Or go, but wearing some HRC campaign swag.
wouldn't that be great?Pipe dream though.
"brazen effort" ???
Then I would beg you to consider #BoycottInauguration
It was in retaliation 4 @repjohnlewis acting in a disgraceful/disrespectful way. Perhaps it was a bit callous, but ALL House shd attend!
correct

Who cares about your two little eyes you smug  -----''.
what had lewis done for civil right since selma nothing!
John Lewis trying to sell a book by attacking Trump   Good enough #libtard to lose legitimacy? He's opportunist.
Trump praised Putin and puts down Mr. Lewis.  What are we in for.
- I think your confused and have things backwards, most liberals do
This is not about liberal/conservative-this is about a man totally unfit 4 office.
-unfit by your opinion, sorry but we dis agree- be tolerant and give the man a chance
I see so many red flags that reminds one of the Nazis .  We will see how it goes.
Nice try to save yourself. You tanked this week when you voted against americans and sided with #bigpharma #careersuicide
so you want cheap pills from China with no idea what's in them? Research.blame Pfizer et al for putting profit over people
@mcmullenforus @repjohnlewis @BarackObama the same @CoryBooker who sponsored a bill with Sessions, praised him, now bashes him.
that bill was to give the Selma marchers the congressional gold medal
correct.
another case of #liberalhypocrisy from Mr Booker.
Please nullify this vote!
No one cares #MAGA
Anyone who takes money from pharmaceutical lobbyist, loses legitimacy, in my eyes
Lewis is a POS racist against the white man
@Amy_Siskind @repjohnlewis @BarackObama agreed. we DO need peace & change. Both are actions he thinks are just words.#Imscared
“To say you won’t respect the result of the election, that is a direct threat to our democracy.” Hillary Clinton
Liberals are in bed with big Pharma & look who is at the top of the list
Trump obviously was speaking about here and now. Like in business..."What are you doing for me today, not in the past"
Can't change the subject, Corey. YOU SCREWED US ON HEALTH CARE by voting against Bernie's amendment.
Says you'll lose legitimacy in his eyes by attacking @repjohnlewis for his questioning @realDonaldTrump legitimacy
u sir will NEVER b a leader yet alone #POTUS @repjohnlewis @BarackObama U R DIVIDERS OF R COUNTRY & ur liberal BS is killing us
Perhaps, sir, you can reconsider voting on the side of the people, in the upcoming affordable meds bill.
I used to have respect for John Lewis not anymore no different than bobblehead Sharpton lying Barry
Lol. Considering the sources here, I'd say that's an eighth of a teaspoon worth of value in a bucket of measuring cups
@Jehmu @repjohnlewis @BarackObama anyone who attacks my president loses all credibility!!!
You're both illegitimate in my eyes. You represent American citizens & values, not your own pettiness
@Jehmu @repjohnlewis @BarackObama words, all you have Booker.
Trump spoke about how terrible Obama was as president, but Lewis questions the Democratic process!
But then again you testified against a fellow senator to help you run for POTUS in 2020
What a 2 faced individual. After what he did to Sen Sessions... Back stabbed
recommend John Stay away from you shifty Booker.Lying about Sessions='smiling faces tell lies'
@SenBookerOffice @repjohnlewis @BarackObama https://goo.gl/IhpHpX  via
Cory&John&others, you all took steps back&downward as Afro-Americans.  MLK, a great American.
Boycott inauguration w/ other @HouseDemocrats&@SenateDems on 01/20 if you feel he is illegitimate.
Call! u r reps join the boycott
but only cause there's no pharma $$ involved right Cory!
< Fraud
great job on voting to allow big Pharma to keep robbing us blind.
He's a fucking sell out like all the rest of the democratic party.  They're all about $$$$
Lol. @CoryBooker certainly knows "craven" but "legitimacy" = stranger unmet #fakeviews
Anyone who attacks @repjohnlewis loses legitimacy in my eyes, especially someone who made such a craven effort to delegitmize @BarackObama
you and Menedez lost legitimacy lost creditibility with your allegiance to pharma
Obama delegitimized himself.  Way to do a 360 on your friend Jeff Sessions.
Rep John Lewis & Rep Maxine Waters both boycotted Bush Inauguration in '01, as well. nothin new! NIGS
@SenBookerOffice - it's good to know you haven't completely sold your soul.
YOU lost me when you voted against lower drug prices. You are no longer relevant. Say good bye now...
Agreed, & anyone who votes w/ donors against public interest also loses legitimacy- that's you, brother! Don't bother in 2020.
Agreed. He's got nothing coming.
You can try to position yourself as a candidate for a presidential run in 2020. But your another 
honey, you've already ruined yourself for 2020. Let it go. Btw, didn't you praise Sessions prior?
@SenBookerOffice #Resistance
I intend to vote for you one day for President. #InaugurationBoycott be the first senator to stand up
you do realize that you lost any hope to be a viable candidate in 2020 by stabbing Sen. Sessions in the back...
@Jehmu @repjohnlewis Bahahahaha. Lewis is a shell of his former self. His great 60's accomplishments are 2010's puppet moves
GREAT! BEST RESPONSE YOU CAN MAKE!!!
Booker, you are the racist here.
CB why did you vote to Not put pressure on pharmaceuticals to control costs as this would support the need for lower ins..premiums?
Lewis started it saying Trump not legitimate
look into this deeper. Sanders set him up.
his vote was not a buyoff from big pharmA
Go to work we want change get busy. people that arent doing anything start dissension #tooboard
everyone should be held accountable for their actions
I don't care what I look like in your eyes booker
video of Trump wishing Obama well after his last win. Trump is more gracious than Lewis http://video.foxnews.com/v/2108211360001/?#sp=show-clips …
- Fortunately the majority doesn't care about legitimacy in your eyes. @repjohnlewis lied about Tea Party. @BarackObama lied ACA
Easy Cory. Just because ur black doesn't mean ur immune from the light of truth. Prepare. It's on the way.Drugs!
So why are you still attending #thefuneral? Gonna explain to our NJ communities why that's ok?#InaugurationBoycott
Are you going to go to that and come back to Newark, Irvington, Asbury and be like heyyyy, it's cool? Hypocrite.
I live in the south and I have seen some Iconic moments but I dont get patted on the back.

I hope you choose not to attend the Inauguration.
Just like yourself Lewis is playing The race card , The race card isn't working anymore.MAGA
You can be great one thing & an asshole in others.This "not legitimate" crap is garbage & s/b called out as such
Anyone who attacks Jeff Sessions who you praised b4 loses all legitimacy to be future Pres candidate.
criminals like you better start looking for a job about now!  
Amen!!!!
maybe ppl need to stop attacking each other. Both are wrong in this issue.
Each of you could have helped the healing but chose hate.  Praying for you.
You are always on the wrong side, your future is not looking bright.
Same as well ! For a person that walked in the foot steps of MLK !!
Lewis is a divider of this country! Needs to make his house in order !!
Stand for what is right. America was not built on division. What happened to pride in country.
Lewis accused McCain/palin of racism.  That is not honorable.  He is not above criticism
I am not happy with Russian hack, but it was your party that got hacked and it simply showed how crooked your leadership was.
if there was any illigitamcy, it was Hilary's nomination.  You lost due to your corrupt party leadership.  Deal with it
@Jehmu @repjohnlewis @BarackObama You're all three disgusting!!!!!
he isn't a senator...but you are right he is illegitimate.
@JSavoly @repjohnlewis @BarackObama #PrezBO please investigate jadon@chavetz and comey something really@off@
why did you not vote for affordable prescriptions?
13 Dems voted NAY to lower prescription drug prices. Between 2010 - 2016 @CoryBooker received $267,338 
http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/314949/democratic-senators-vote-down-canada-pharmaceutical-amendment/ …

Not Barack Obama. Not cute enough, not smart enough & doggone it people don't like you.
So typical, liberal democrat do as I say not as I do. What happened to you dude?
Mad at @realDonaldTrump maybe because he's going after BIG pharmaceutical Companies cost of drugs ?

none of you need any help deligitimizing your selves. You're doing great. Keep it up, please.
Hey @CoryBooker Did big pharma approve your tweet about @repjohnlewis  ?
Not too illegitimate or craven for you to sit out his inauguration though, eh bud?
Anyone who attacks Jeff Sessions losses legitimacy with those of us who know better.
cory your desire to be president has brought out ur true colors u lack loyalty & honesty
you're a fake too
.@CoryBooker @repjohnlewis @BarackObama great. Now explain why you're against cheaper prescription drugs?
.@CoryBooker @repjohnlewis @BarackObama Who are you and why do you think your relevant? two public servants and an ex wiz? hmm #TermLimits
And anyone that votes down drug imports from Canada because he was lobbied by Pharm companies loses legitimacy in my eyes.
This doesn't smell right Mr. Senator @CoryBooker.
You Cory Booker, but LIE!! 2 months ago you praised Sessions, now that you have become a RACIST
You sold out your Morals & Soul, just to make a name for yourself! And that name is a "Racist!!"
Cory...you and your kind are fooling noone, except willing brainwashed fools ..eternal victimization
anyone who votes against making prescription drugs cheaper for the American people disgusts me.
please so he says pres-elect is illegitimate Pres. So how would u expect someone to respond?
better check what big Pharma wants you to do!
I see you all have one thing in common. Racist black people.
@realDonaldTrump...you are a hypocrite Booker and nobody is buying your racist rhetoric towards Trump
