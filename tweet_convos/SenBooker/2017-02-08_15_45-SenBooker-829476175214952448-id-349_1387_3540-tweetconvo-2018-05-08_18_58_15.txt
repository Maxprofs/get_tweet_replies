He could win if he changed his strategy360...otherwise he is just another puppet.
thank you!  Very well said!
@CoryBooker glad to hear some bipartisan agreement on Russia in #foreign #relations committee
just need to flip 3 seats in 2018 for a whole new ballgame. Sen Dems need to endorse new Dem candidates soon as possible.
@CoryBooker A call to arms! Right on!
thought you were against arms in schools.....or in the publics hands..better rethink your words
guess you didn't have enough schooling to understand the metaphor in @a call to arms".
Guess you don't have enough inteligence to understand sarcasm
We will keep fighting and focusing! Thanks #TheResistance We need to know that you are fighting too!!
perfectly said! Thank you, Sen. Booker.
@CoryBooker EVERY DAY ALL DAY ESPECIALLY US BLACK FOLKS WE DEF GOT TO PROTECT US FO SHO

@CoryBooker This has to apply to Fed Court as well. Speaking out against Trump tweets was/is smoke and mirrors! His record?
@CoryBooker boo hoo get over it. Now u know how paralyzed & sick many of us felt for 8 yrs. Suck it up like we did.
Yeah, y'all didn't "suck it up", you ground the country to a halt with a six year temper tantrum entering its seventh year.
you know she can't intelligently respond to this!
@CoryBooker Thank you Senator Booker, I really need to hear this message. I am with you.
@DaShanneStokes we cannot allow trump to keep destroying out country bit by bit, day by day. REMOVE TRUMP25th amendment
the fight????? Get over it
this is a marathon..very proud of my fellow citizens.  Let's remember to vote!
. Thank you, what you said is so true
Thanks defending SenWarren! I am one of your NJ constituents. We're counting on you! Don't let them control the dialogue
More like your infinite Commitment to your self,& your agenda of More Government,He will not be a puppet like Holder &Lynch
Commit to the people.  The infrastructure is  in shambles and corporations own ALL OUR POLITICIANS.  Reality TV AMERICA
@MichaelSkolnik We need to integrate Millennial Progressive strategists into the Party infrastructure if we want to win
At this point, it looks like Cory may get primaried at earliest convenience for his pharma-interests.
@CoryBooker what good is complaining about republicans when democrats like you have no backbone and no ethics...
you suck

@CoryBooker where were you democrats when millions of Americans lost their homes during financial crisis???
they were passing legislation to let unqualified buyers purchase homes....
and they end up giving money to crook bankers??
#I concur that the fight continues#why hasn't impeachment proceedingsbeenstarted?#getridof Dumpy#hewillneverbemypresident.
preach Senator Booker!
And the new AG not being a puppet of the DNC is what really scares you and other democrats And it should
instead of fighting against the nominees find out why scientist have been fixing reports on climate change
What did Obama do for the people who voted for him 2x? I didnt see the same energy when he sold america out to the U.N.
..only to the next election.
I so needed to hear this today!  I am worn out from the daily barrage of beyond belief actions from Trump & cronies.
@CoryBooker our fight goes on until we prevail. They may have won the recent battles but this Scump won't win the war!
@CoryBooker I feel so demoralized that Dems can't tow the line. For example @Sen_JoeManchin. What can we do Sen Booker?
Thank you Senator Booker. I need to hear this.
Black men and women invented most things used in the world today. Google Granville T. Woods
please starting talking about #impeachment  everything  else is BS
You should run for President, I fully understand what it is that you are saying, I'm behind you in our fight.
>@SenBookerOffice It really is all about #NotLosingHope Depending on #Gov officials like yourself to #SpeakOut PLZ don't stop
@SenWarren
Thank you for inspiring everyone to continue this bizarre fight!
Senator Booker, I am glad you are representing me!
@CoryBooker Love you! One of the good guys! 
You are a George Soros puppet .
@TheDemocrats Democrats don't share the American values...Dems completely have no values..Vote All Dems out of office, NOW.
@CoryBooker this guy needs to leaveHe turned Newark into a mess and now in Congress he doesn't want progress.just loudmouth

@CoryBooker This was what I needed to hear today.I want to focus on issues not his behavior. Thanks for your hard work!
: Democratic pawn. Let the left keep using your blackness! We sure don't care.
Brilliant! YES, YES, YES! Thank you!
I'm with U.
I'm with U
@CoryBooker When are you fools going to learn? Look at history. Socialism dose not work. It's been tried over and over. BAD
@CoryBooker We need a clear strategic plan to harness the energy progressives are expressing
Then fight harder. Surely to God not all GOP agrees with their party. They're destroying the US so find a way to stop them.
that's all Dems do. Fight, accuse, cry, encourage thuggery/violence, spend everyone's $, if u cont., losses not temporary.
Temporary losses??? The Presidency, both houses in Congress, 1000 seats nationwide. You and your party are a joke!
"Our fight continues"? You think you're Bernie now? Forget it honey, you'll never step foot in the oval office
Thank you!
Thank you Senator Booker. Many Americans are supporting your efforts. Thank you for fighting for us.
Thank you.  Needed that.
YES! Donald Trump thinks he is God, but like God got Saul he will get Trump! Trump you better do right by God's people!
So Right!!!
#CoryBooker2020

So in the 8 years that Obama's pick was in the Education Dept what got better for kids, schools.....get a grip

I watched you and appreciate what you and others tried to do thank you for having a conscience and being our voice #resist
If @realDonaldTrump tweet is "outrageous" what about this "tweet" by Prez Harry Truman to a critic of his daughter?
Thank you for the encouraging talk!

@CoryBooker You're Outrageous! ! You,  could not stand the pressure @realDonaldTrump has been put under during campaign.
@CoryBooker please stop pretending that you give a shit - you only care about the donations you get from drug companies
@CoryBooker 2/2 You would be hunting down every Republican.  It's time to MAKE GOV WORK/ work with our @POTUS OR GET OUT!!!
@DanielLBerek what fight? Your job is compromise & work 4 the  people. I want progress & improvements.

That would be a great thing to do if I even had A VOTING REP IN CONGRESS.  I was born in D.C. and live in it now.
Take a look at the nearest district to you.  that you can help turn
@SaraJBenincasa 
Yea, Yea, Yea, all talk, no action, Big Pharma Booker. Put the money, where your mouth is.
I JUST FOR THE LIFE OF ME REMEMBER THE NAME OF THAT RUSSIAN WHO PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD AND MADE ME VOTE TRUMP
Thank you! Keep fighting for us. I needed this message right now.
You Thinking President!! fagetaboutit. you don't have a snowballs chance in hell.
does this mean you will stop voting with big pharma over we the people?
just resting for a night. Shifting gears,so to speak. As for me, McConnell's treatment of Sen Warren fires me up to resist!
don't worry too much #Senator ur time will come 2 b #voted #out #WeThePeople #voted #nomoreexcuses #DoYourJob #MAGA 
@UncleRUSH Booker may be the biggest fraud in the Senate today. No one contradicts himself more!!!
I know it must me taxing on you, but I know, without a shadow of a doubt, that you've been raised for such a time as this.
Thanks for all you and @SenateDems are doing & for the inspiration "do not let your soul be silenced..." #persist #resist
@DemsTalk Thanks Corey Booker. I fight on many fronts and teach. So, a few weeks in and already exhausted.
As a chronically ill NJ resident, I'm so glad to have leadership like you. This broken body will keep fighting.
Senator Booker, these are NOT temp losses, nor are these ordinary times. Please figure a plan of attack for the midterms
Thank you, please keep voting the proper way and fighting.
Ty for the pep talk. What's up with investigations into Russian ties/election interfence? Want to support.
thank you, I almost face-planted into my pizza (but, I was just too hungry).
# Never give up.
Vote American Solidarity Party - a party with Catholic values!
Sen. Booker. Please focus on the real issues. Stop wasting time.

@darrylw1971 thank you for your support of Jeff sessions the n-double-acp does not give Awards of Excellence for no reason
Thank you for the reaffirmation, it helps, particularly since it will get worse before it gets better.
if it had not been for good citizens and officials like now US AG Sessions you wouldn't have a staff or be on the floor.
