Blame Obama and the Libtards for this disaster not Trump!! ACA is done for! find a way to cope you Libtard!!!! Trump will fix it
but his ass don't GAF
Well, here are your hashtags: #PullingThePlugOnGrandma and #DeathPanel
Premiums have already doubled for most of my friends.
@CoryBooker @thinkprogress they don't care. Gonna do it anyway.
@ChrisMurphyCT @thinkprogress sure thing written by a liberal pundit with an agenda
So, what's the alternative? Leaving the current debacle in place? If we do, most will lose our healthcare coverage.
man, how many creepy pictures of these guys laughing  *are* there?
The nonpartisan CBO also projected Obamacare would only cost $940 billion in the first 10yrs. Oops...
you're right. It's cost less.
$1.76T > $940B... unless you're using Common Core math.
oh my that is great!!!!!
I'll send my medical bills straight on to Trump if I lose my coverage.
What do they care? Not at all,  their concerns are for the elite,  millionaires,  billionaires.  Lower their taxes.  Have us carry the US!
@CoryBooker @thinkprogress I hope I'm not one of them. Literally, MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.
@SenBookerOffice @thinkprogress (think disaster)
So in otherwords....it makes it about 10x better than ACA right out the gate.
They didn't elect themselves. This cry of reach out to the willful evil and dumb is a time waster.
Well our company provided insurance premiums tripled under Obamacare, so there's that. . . . .
who gains something from the higher premiums?
Ryan: "the funniest part is Obamacare was a Republican plan bt Obama got it passed first! thats why we never bothered with a replacement!"
@gkketch @thinkprogress I'm non bias.  But premiums have already more then doubled since Obamacare.  Hope there is a solution.
@ChrisMurphyCT @thinkprogress @GValickis
@CoryBooker if we went to a free market system premiums would plummet by 2026
@CoryBooker @thinkprogress didn't premiums go up 4x since it started so only doubling in 4 years would be great
they dont care all they care about is themselves
@CoryBooker And GOP wallets get fatter & fatter while  suffer and die. I have never been so ashamed of our govt.
I was always told the one that laughs last laughs best!
Fight for the life of Nation. Legitimate healthcare pricing is the one unifying American issue.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence that @newtgingrich recently called for the CBO to be eliminated.
no it probably coincides with their complete ineptitude and dismal track record for years
that's horseshit and you know it. CBO is admired for its professionalism by both parties.
Yes the CBO is non-partisan.  http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-30/cbo-warns-coming-fiscal-crisis-result-exponential-us-debt-growth …  When can I stop laughing?
Cory lamenting Obamacare repeal, but kills bill that would make affordable medicine available to millions. #SadIrony
How fast will they double if we keep it? Kasich's right:"The prob w/ O'care is that it doesn't reduce costs."
@Solutioneer72 @thinkprogress 

3. Every Baby Boomer will be on Meow Mix.
GOP mantra is fk the poor & undereducated.
#fakenews
Eformed Breeder is s clueless stooge.
@mrsweid @thinkprogress "non-partisan CBO"
How is not being forced to buy something you didn't want the same as "losing" something?
I thought Congress passed measure prohibiting the CBO from doing any ACA cost estimates. Or is that still in comm?
@MelindaThinker @thinkprogress DJT hides fact that without competitive demands/mechanisms of the ACA, Ins. Cos. Will raise rates
The nonpartisan CBO said first year rates will rise 25% and even higher by 2026
they will go back 2 their untethered prices to fund CEO bonuses;ACA capped limit on these salaries
.@JuddLegum @mrsweid better we dismantle #Obamacare now before cancer surgeries canceled as are happening in #UK
Cory now you are tweeting half stories,and half factsWhy are you being obnoxious If you choose to ink this low it will also sink your career
For me, these pictures don't match article. Are the good old boys gleeful?  About ramifications of repeal of ACA?
The 400 richest Americans get a $7 MILLION tax break

Who do you think the GOP will choose?
screw 2026, mine went up 500% last year....
@gkketch @thinkprogress lol. This has already happened to me since the law started.
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress Hey, Trump Voters now crying abt your healthcare going away? Why're you cryin'? You voted for that.
and these clowns are proud of themselves!
Gleefully taking away people's ability to be healthy. SMH
My premium tripled in 3 years with the ACA...so It's an improvement.
FACT: I lost my health insurance twice. Once before O-care implemented & then after 1st year of O-care. Premium 380 to 655.00/mo.
"What are you going to do with your tax savings from the ACA repeal?"  "Invest in caskets - it'll be a growth market!"
Trump will start tweeting about how the approval rating of the CBO is low and how its "sad".  Attack the source and misdirect.
Evil GOP!
They also did a budget analysis, 350 billion added to the deficit.
@chrislhayes pure SOBs-take their health ins. & pensions away!!
Heartening to see them yukking it up too.  I am one of the 18 million. Scared to death out here.  Do these 4 get to keep theirs?

- But they have theirs. That's why they laugh. The joke is that we're paying for theirs.
My $1500 savings never materialized and my premium is jumping big this year. Oh...my Dr. retired too, up and left.

and these aholes get to keep their insurance.@GOP
Well theyre right on point number 2.
My premiums have doubled in just the last 3 yrs txs to you
And I predict GoFundMe pages asking for help with uninsured medical expenses will more than quadruple!
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress well I guess that's what Republicans might call collateral damage, right?
"nonpartisan"
@chrislhayes The replacement plan hasn't even been divulged. How exactly can the CBO project these changes?
CBO has to accept the lies Congress puts in the bills about funding and costs. I don't. Only people who do are partisan hacks.
Premiums have already gone up by 60% since ACA.
nothing in DC is nonpartisan anymore
Senator Rand on CNN re health care replacement and insuring everybody 'we're trying to figure it out...'
why are they ok with this? They didn't have a replacement first. But they love. America just not the ppl
Meanwhile, this evil bag of dickweeds are laughing it up, cuz the peasants can just eat cake.
'pubs can deny truth, but can't hide it, any longer.

@VedehiMajumdar @thinkprogress AND what total cost to repeal it? Millions? Or billions? #morons
"it's what the people want" @SpeakerRyan
Paul Ryan w/one of group that met Jan. 20,2009 to adopt plan t/block everything that President Obama wanted to do
no one can afford it now.  Non APTC or CSR recipients pay over $1300 per month in premiums today with 10K deductib
That's why the GOP neutered the CBO: they don't want truthful reports
and their analysis on the replacement? Oh wait, they jumped the gun and only did half the equation #partisanhack
@chrislhayes these jerks are not Christian
You must be talking about the people who already werent able to keep their doctor/plan, premiums skyrocketed in 2016. @JuddLegum
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress 6 MILLION list first year. Premiums tripled in 5 yrs. deductible up 4 fold. Great idea
they doubled with Obama care and that's with 10k deductibles
@puppymnkey @thinkprogress. GOP leaders celebrate further victory in their war on poor & working people.
So much for the nonpartisan BS.
Non-partisan CBO..hahahaha!  That was debunked a long time ago.  How many will gain insurance? Did CBO ask that?
LOL

Premiums double relative to what they would be with ACA in place? Premiums were going up regardless
R U OK if he secures our border, brings jobs back as he's doing now and fixes health care? Are you looking for handouts?
just like he needs the magic wand to bring jobs back. #fakenews
that picture of them laughing sends shivers down my spine
more #fakenews here...nothing to see...#libtards
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress More fake news.
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress isn't this the reason why Newt Gingrich is calling for the repeal of the CBO?
Well, if the predicts are as accurate as the ones about ObamaCare saving us money, keeping Doctors, etc., will probably be great.
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress No 1 wil Lose coz therez a REPLACEMENT plan. Y Distort news & Provoke ppl which DIVIDES us further?
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress do you think this report was given to, read by the gop?
How many people will Repubs sacrifice for a win? When will they realize the win WILL cost them seats in next election?
But the wealthy get their tax breaks, so, win?
#fakenews
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress 12 million of us lost our coverage and doctors when the ACA was passed , where was your outrage then?
@QwanZone @thinkprogress http://thinkprogress.org  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
so, next on the republican agenda, eliminate CBO right?
@SpeakerRyan Let's not forget 2 include that many could possibly die, including children, because they do not have healthcare 4 treatments
@chrislhayes @imillhiser laugh out loud boys. D backlash is very real. Weather that storm.
bwahaha. Yes. Excellent. #ThanksHillary and #Hillbots
All these reports should include that the CBO has had a tough time with Obamacare
@nate510 @thinkprogress Man you have a problem listening
That's one way to handle the immigration problem: make America a place no one would want to live.
oh but the wealthy will get a tax break. That's all @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @GOP @SenateGOP CARE ABOUT $not 
Hey there's like three and a half CLOWNS in this photo !!
All very well & good, but how much would the top 0.1% save in taxes by 2026 after repeal? Doesn't that balance out?
.@JuddLegum serious question. What has CBO correctly predicted in the last 20 years?
And the number of dead from lack of medical care by then?
Even a Republican could not turn a blind eye to this, right? Lolololol
@JoyLightIN @thinkprogress  It's not OBAMACARE. It's the Affordable Care Act.  The word Obama is why they are repealing it.
Obama care afordable care act I don't care how you spin it it doesn't work
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress Same ones that said savings would be $2500/yr?
3. "38,500 people will die every year who otherwise would have lived"
these clowns won't be laughing for long -
1/21/17 they will have to TRY to govern
disgusting
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress    The Republicans are a joke regarding this repeal!
Republicans are positively giddy with greed as they anticipate huge payoffs from big pharma & the insurance industry.
I hear the GOP is buying KY Jelly like crazy ... because we're all about to get fucked.
@chrislhayes even tho this is assuming no replacement..doesn't make sense unless Medicaid expansion is repealed also
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress My diabetic daughter can well be one of those casualties b
God, please stop using these photos of greedy heartless Repubs. glowing with the thought of ppl not havng insurance.
Trump will be long gone by then, so he doesn't care
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress 
Phony 2 faced repub politics
Nothing more
Nothing less
Well republicans what are doing about it. You are going to hurt that many people? Good luck on your re-election in less than 2 years. Watch!
@gkketch  more BS from the the left
*sigh*
But 156 MILLION get heath insurance through their employer, SO THEY DON'T CARE (about your measly 18mm)
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress BTW, my premiums have already doubled. Just saying.
@chrislhayes Fake news.Or incapable CBO. To rate this you have to add the replacement. Then considering both =net
what replacement?
At a minimum, now 4 complete write ups! We don't release them then vote on them then pass them then readem
Do you have links to those detailed write-ups?
Watch TV. 2 Representatives, and two senators (One being Paul).
I have. No links to these 4 detailed write ups. Republicans TALK, about them, but don't provide.
You will get it when the other 325,000,000 American get it. Nothing special about you (3)
EXACTLY the problem. Repeal with no plan to replace, except talking points.
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress not for nothing, but is that the same CBO that originally said ACA was going to be less expensive?
2026 sounds REALLY optimistic on time-frame for premium doublage.
They could care less. And w/Dem's like Booker they will succeed! Off with Bookers head. Need I add the Repug's?
That why they're laughing?
We sure pulled one over on the American people?
@chrislhayes @thinkprogress The same CBO that completely screwed up their Obamacare numbers before it passed. Lol @ this tweet.
Get those facts outta here! Freedom! #MAGA!! /s
