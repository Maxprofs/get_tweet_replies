This is what happens with corporations buy politicians. You should stop taking corporate cash, too.
Joe, FIRST lets just try to keep the Russians buyout then we can tackle the corporations....know what I'm sayin???? LOL
Nope. I don't know what you're saying. Walk and chew gum. Also corporations have been a problems for decades. Bigger problem.

Wait did I miss the sarcasm in your first reply? If so, apologies.

I get redirected to http://FCC.GOV  & have no idea where I'm supposed to go to leave a comment. Help!
Try using http://BattleForTheNet.com  instead.
Will do, thanks!!!!
Otherwise you have to dig to find right place to comment. URL was started by comedian John Oliver. Glad to see it's getting such good use!

What do we do once on the site? I see we have to fill in personal data data, but there's another section that I'm unsure of.
Dont really no just no this is important so plz tell me when your done
I don't see a comments section for this website. Am I suppose to submit a filing as my comments?

Yes, click on +express and add your comment. It fills in the proceeding number for you automatically.
Thank you!

@FCC @SenateGOP  @AjitPaiFCC
https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings/express … unable to insert comments online FIX THIS please!
You can add it if you go to the site and click on +express. It is an official form so you have to fill it in yourself.
I filled properly but it won't review or provide confirmation!
@AjitPaiFCC represented @verizon when they sued the FCC wanting #NetNeutrality. Now the is guarding the hen house... Support #GoFCCYourself
Tech/other companies continue net neutraility as business core no matter what GOP does! Focus on collab polices/practices that thwart them
shut your big mouth, and take care of your blindness. Where is your wife, where are children.
Corporate Democrat. DINO. Please don't run again.
tried submitting won't allow filled express but doesn't move on to review and confirm!!!
I just did mine and it worked. Try it again.
TY!
@jwilli52 great presentation!
But Cory is even more concerned about saving big Pharma profits.
Thank you Cory!
I feel silly but cannot figure out where to submit a comment on the site. Doesn't seem to be a space for that. Anybody?
No no no please dont take something else away and make more money...they already took insurance for millions...wow ...we have to stand up
Bwah!  I love that URL. Perfect!
Cory Booker is a fraud.
Capitalism: Make resources rare and/or difficult to access so you can make people pay more for them.
You're a riot!  Thank You!
Corey booker is on rowdy powder in this video for sure. @SarahKSilverman
The two of you need to go out on the road together -- you're a great comedy duo *and* great Senators.

Is there a way to do this without using my address? It says my address will be publicly viewable but I want to comment.
Just sent an email!!
Good! If I see another Power Point I'm gonna find a bridge
I'm in love with Cory, and don't care who knows. He's the best...
This just re directs to FCC homepage?....
Some heard promises but may not understand how government works, some Rep won't even answer legislative question.
some just angry &care4 justice&safety all ,we love the law mad because DT no charges,we pay. Ustudy&log make pics4 future rep
Schoolboard was charged &public school teachers demand rights 2advocate 4stdent ability 2excel 2write academ plans look N2 it
I just did it, but your video should explain process for filing FCC complaint a bit more thoroughly if you really want lots of participants.
Done! #NetNeutrality
Thanks Cory, some voters from 1970 were cheated out of high school dipolmas, cinsumers changed score, kids didn't graduate.
Hate this clown. You'll never be President.
100 percent behind you, Senators! #NetNeutrality
If you support #NetNeutrality like you supported importing cheap pharmaceuticals from Canada, then we can kiss that goodbye too. #sellout
More details please on how to file!
Relevant
I went to website but couldn't locate where to file the complaint.  Please advise @Cory

Please watch this video and then join the fight for net neutrality.

Today we battle for the net!…
Keep our freedoms
u 2 r the best.
This is the type of messaging that works. Stay strong! Appreciate the leadership!
Thank you for this information!  I just submitted my comment of support & the numbers are past 6 million as of 8:43 pm   #netneutrality
Thank you for breaking it down so even I can understand.
Done!
THE END of Net Neutrality?Save the Internet.Send comments to the FCC  #notmypresident  #TheResistance  #WeThePeople
Verizon Sprint AT&T & cableTV providers>enemies of #netneutrality It limits their power over content & consumers
Thank you for posting this - done!
YouTube was only letting most of the videos I watched download at 64 kb/s from about 2009-2013. Tens of thousands complained, no results.
Submitted my comments.  Any throttling by the FCC seems tantamount to suppression of free speech and control of the media. 
We all need #NetNeutrality Thank you Sir for standing up for us. Your awesome.
Government getting involved with anything we all lose
When you hear Booker take a progressive position, it's really him saying GIVE ME MONEY TO CORPORATIONS THAT WILL PAY HIM TO VOTE THEIR WAY.
The F site is not exactly user friendly.  Need help?  See --https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/how-to-comment-on-the-fccs-proposal-to-revoke-net-neutrality/ …

If I submitted something before they pulled it previously, do I need to do it again, or is that info still around?
Good question. I would resubmit.
Done!
I sent a comment to the FCC. I just hope it works. It would be a terrible thing if we lost net neutrality.
Thanks guys! I'm going there now!
awful
I tried and there is a confusing website. Help me out
Please do more white board explanations. VERY informative!
Thanks for your hard work to keep net neutrality.
Yep, bald is beautiful! Keep up the good work. Although you're not my senator, you keep me informed. I appreciate you and your staff!
That's net NEUTRALITY!!
@davidcicilline @JimLangevin @SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse @FCC  SAVE NET MEUTRALITY!!!!

@SenSchumer 
Save the net! My students need it. All of us do!
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you, sir!
Do as Cory Says!
He's too much! Lol 
Thank you @CoryBooker @CoryBooker Your energy and commitment for #NetNeutrality  is everthing!
no more clearance for jared and impeach that idiot in the whitehouse
and jail his clan
Thank you Mr. Booker. You Rock!
Go to the http://gofccyourself.com  website and then what?
Love you Cory!
I would like to file a protest but that site is extremely complicated. I think you need another vid showing what needs to be filled in.
Try using the ACLU's website or http://BattleForTheNet.com  instead
Hey Cory, you support @ALALibrary astroturfing for #NetNeutrality? http://safelibraries.blogspot.com/2010/12/ala-pushes-net-neutrality-on-wikipedia.html …
Thank you...great information!
What are those dreaded comments on the FCC website?! Talking about Obama? Looks like a bunch of ignorant people or Russians?
Thanks guys me & @PoorLivesMatt3r & @FreedomPleaseOr All thank you for telling us,but do doubt they will listen b/c were already so manpul8d
Love you @CoryBooker !  Thanks for talking directly to "we the people" about things that are important to both you and us.
Senator Booker also posted on Facebook if you'd like to share: https://www.facebook.com/corybooker/videos/vb.36872302227/10157039803142228/?type=3&theater …

Thank you.
Great video, essential, vital message and great stick figures!
Thank you for your support of #netneutrality
#DNCFraudLawsuit goodbye Cory
cory, just tweeted to FCC. at least for me i had to go to the Twitter icon to connect and send. might me good info to add or present
done! Save #netneutrality
please rt #NetNeutrality
Did big Pharma ask you to do this?
Thank you for speaking out about this, Senator! #NetNeutrality
I call bullshit! @CoryBooker will flip like a switch as soon as he gets enough corporate bribes. He is another corporate establishment Dem!
Thank you, Senator!
Once again you make the point easy, loud & clear! Thank You @CoryBooker!!
I feel like the cause should really be called the "Free Internet" or "Open Internet". The term Net Neutrality intimidates & confuses people.
That is how the Gov't labeled it. Its how they get people to ignore important things. Use confusing context.
This is very misleading and as with most of Bookers beliefs, is based on the philosophy that all people are bad
This isn't about people being bad, its corporations that are bad. While I do not agree with him often, this issue I do.

I LOVE the way you explained this!
Thanks for the RT, sending to my friends, what's next? 
Love this!
Thanks @CoryBooker & @brianschatz !
good job you guys!
I'm guessing Comcast forgot to bribe you?
Done  Save #NetNeutrality
Thank you!
@CoryBooker draws the hash before the s when he makes $ Diff folks, diff strokes...literally anyway, thanks for highlighting other issues
Done.
This is EASILY the best thing on the internet today!

Love it! You are the man! Thanks for all that you do for the American people!
It's great to hear you talk about this! Its monumentally important. You must not take $ from ISPs like you do with Wall Street + Big Pharma
We're launching a Twitter chat tonight at 8pm EST to discuss how we might teach K12 students about #EthicalCS. Looking fwd to more videos!
You could call it a minimalist approach but it gets the job done!
Thank you, @CoryBooker for fighting the good fight!!!
#NetNeutrality helps low SES students have access, education needs to be available to all children, please do not suppress democracy!
That's why they want to be able to throttle certain sites.
Educated public won't fall for their .
this is great and people need to know more about this. And thank you Mr. booker for being on the right side of history for this!
