MLK jr was a conservative.
@pokie3154 We're pretty loud. It's not working. This gov'ment doesn't represent #WeThePeople

Why is the RT button not Working?
@CoryBooker what a great speech last night. You make NJ proud.
yes, you could learn a lot from Senator Gillibrand.
"There is nothing more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity."  (M.L. King, Jr.)
@RepSenators The Republicans have become silent on many things that matter; racism, misogyny, bigotry, Healthcare, climate
apparently that means you didn't think big pharma was an issue...#BELIKEBERNIE
@POTUS raid #Yemen wont even allow US operations there anymore! Btw the botched raid & #MuslimBan this is NOT #MAGA
no excuses for not allowing @SenWarren to speak! #LetLizTalk
just wait. Cory u will.  Be proved wrong u will eat your words
2020 is a long way Corey. Don't get in a tweet war wt the @realDonaldTrump you"ll lose!
@CoryBooker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xtZ0fEzi3s …. Why aren't you Republican. Please stop going the MLK route when u take corporate  $$$$
Thank you for not sitting idly by and allow this injustice to fester. You made us proud, incl @repjohnlewis and @SenWarren
Then they came for MLK & Coretta Scott King in the Senate. #resist racism @SenWarren @SenateMajLdr http://youtube.com/embed/HVyq6kAN …
@CoryBooker MLK was a conservative & is rolling N his grave over racist domestic terrorist such as yourself BLM & U R Ajoke
@CoryBooker @SenatorTimScott Encouraging race baiters like Warren makes you just as bad as the racists attacking Tim Scott.
@CoryBooker At this point, as other times, it's about social economics as much as it is about race.
Desperate Losers 
@CoryBookerletter was 52 yrs. ago! U r just assuring 8 yrs not 4! Deplorable r a force! All this nonsense assuring growth
@CoryBooker yr acting will not get u any where! The left r out of control! U need 2 grow up! Enough of this childish banter
@tidallife Fauxcohantas wasn't quoting CSKing, she was quoting far-left deceased Ted Kennedy. Get ur story correct Cory!!
@CoryBooker #readtheletter
@JuddApatow like the cost of prescription drugs
@CoryBooker Support Elizabeth Warren! There is power in solidarity. We are counting on you. #jerseystrong
@CoryBooker Senator - please keep reading the letter where Warren left off.
but did you see how they silenced Liz ?? I will stand with you , but I am scared for my America
I agree but what matters to you may not to me and visa versa, we all have lost respect for differences inc u & yr office.
@CoryBooker you are an inspiration to me. I wish you were my senator!  #Booker4President!!!
You know Sessions is not a racist. What is wrong with you? You are betraying what you claim to stand for. EVIL!
@SophiaBush Amen!! So proud to be a Booker!!! You are an inspiration.
like affordable pharmaceuticals for the ill?
@CoryBooker great speech last night.  Thank you.  #holdthefloor

@CoryBooker or the day you start voting with Republicans - against the interest of the American ppl. #DINO #DumpBooker2020

@CoryBooker oh poor dems
@CoryBooker Cory lets see what we can dig up on you and find out things u said before you got into public office live4 2day
Silence is betrayal!
@CoryBooker
@CoryBooker @elizabethforma #LetLizSpeak
impeach Trump and invalidate his picks already.  People are infuriated!
@SophiaBush So true It's important to stand up for what we believe in
thank you for this powerful reminder.  I needed this today.  #dontgiveup
@CoryBooker
A choir of Americans is behind you.  They don't get to do this to my country  #HateHasNoHomeHere #resist
@CoryBooker and that's exactly what Donald Trump won by such a landslide!! To the God Of Israel all the glory!!
Obama dropped 26,000 BOMBS last year

Mostly on innocent Muslims

Where was the Democrats protest

@CoryBooker you stand for nothing and fall for everything... not a leader for me
@CoryBooker you'll stand against our president & fight for refugees, but forget our homeless/poor & that situation.
@CoryBooker we are behind you Dems and two GOP with ethics
@CoryBooker we don't have to do great things to be heros, just the right things
@CoryBooker respect
@SophiaBush MLK would be embarrassed of you  book
WELL you did NOT hold the floor with #DeVos she will be a disaster for public education.
@SilArt2 the resistance will never be silenced. We are just getting started. Bet Trump never figured on us. Ha!
What have you done about the pharmaceutical companies money you have been taking? Did you stop?
@FoxyOlivier MLK didn't PREACH violence. U let it happen & ignore source as it suits party's purpose. HOLD FLOOR/FALLS OUT.
yeah @SenWarren was very violently reading #CorettaScottKing 's letter. You got a point here?
warren got shut down  sit down cry baby...
they did not shut down Warren!! Looked up the King Letter#beinformed
90% of Congresses work is meaningless, & it leaves little time for the 10% that is, nor effort to succeed at it
In that case most of the Democrat caucus started dying years ago.  (not that the GOP caucus was far behind....)
@eddyrogerparker WHY OBSESSION TO CONFIRM DE VOS HURT KIDS EDUCATION.  WHO WILL CLEAN CONGRESS.  ALL THIEVES CORRUPT
#letlizspeak
. He is nuts!
Republicans silencing  Elizabeth Warren's voice is silencing Americans  voice. #RESIST
Just get this man out of here before we all start dying! Im going to bed scared at night!
You make me proud. Keep fighting, thank you! 
Do Dr. MLK Jr proud!
