It seems to be taking so long to get momentum going on this. Everyone should be outraged and calling for investigation NOW.
we've only just begun.
I hear you! Thank you.
Thank you. But also bring Congress 2 a halt until investigative hearings are held & impeachment charges are filed? #resist
Yes, because obstructing the rule of law is fine when my candidate didn't win. 10/10
65M TO 62M & WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE VOTES CAME FROM HACKED VOTING MACHINES OR USSR 
I'm sorry, but I won't accept a "Russia of the Gaps" Arguement.

lol doesn't have anything to do with the Russians mate.
By the way, the rule of law is the Constitution of the United States of America, not a rapist
I am aware of the constitution my friend. But there is more law than just that. Lots of laws.
I've been PUSHING, and HOPEFULLY we'll find something that will WORK to get GOP to work w/Democrats
wackos
Some folks want you to deflect from the russia influence. Keep doing what you're doing Senator.  This is important! #resist
This is not normal. The Russians hacked this election. @JeffGordinier
If you believe that you have drunk the kook aid
If there's no problem here, it should be easy enough to disprove. The actions of this administration are not consistent with that premise.
Are you just as interested in the Obama admin conducting surveillance and then illegally, criminally unmasking the name of a private citizen
"The other side did it too" is weaksauce. If that's all you got, be off with you.
Ahh! The mark of a true fascist, no discussion of actual data and facts, only your own unsupported conclusions.
@DemsTalk calling leaks illegal is funny weren't Wikileaks obtained illegally?
"They" say Flynn lied to @VP Looks more like Trump Pence & Flynn all knew the truth coming out soon What an appalling mess
absolutely agree! Pence, Trump, and Bannon ARE the COVER UP!
Thank you.
@CoryBooker @SenatorMenendez @RepSires 

We demand answers! I will be calling your offices later today.
Good Work!
There is no no evidence get that through your  wing nut heads liberals
It not being unearthed yet doesn't mean it does not exist. Why stonewall the oversight committee then?

#PresidentBabyHands is guilty.
I want to see Trump's tax returns.  It's important to me.  Will be grateful for anything you can do to make this happen.
I think most of us do know what happened. It's pretty obvious. Russia interfered in our election & Trump won because of it.
What actual evidence do you have besides the leftist media telling you this?
.@SenBookerOffice
Put ur U.S. Rep & 2 Sens' local district phone #s on ur speed dial. Find them here:

Americans also deserve affordable prescription drugs but I guess your bank account is more important?
@CoryBooker Thank you to continue to fight for answers and transparency in this admin. #resist #wedemandanswers
Would you like him to investigate the illegal criminal unmasking of an American citizen by the Obama Administration as it surveilled Trump
Competing with our natural gas against Gazprom's worldwide interests definitely seems like cozying up to Russians. Lol.
you're promoting fake news. If any should be investigated it is Democrats.
@DemsTalk America and Americans or political party? Which is the master and priority of our politicians? For most, party.
You are absolutely correct. #russia is now working inside the US through #trump Is @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr in on it?
Make this your full-time job, sir. Now's good.
hey @RepCarbajal you listening? What about you @KamalaHarris?
We stand with you in demanding answers!
@AmyAtwood2  still true two weeks later . Every day is another day of normalizing treason and fascism.
full support from the MAJORITY of the population. Keep going!
please get to the bottom of this.
please no more confirmations, no bills, no votes until this matter is fully investigated!
Amen Sentor
Go schill for the Pharma companies Booker. You're a failure and a traitor to your people & Party. #ShameOnYou #CoryIsAFool
Please run in 2020! Hillary should have picked you as her VP!
after watching him at the cpac meetings we need your help more than ever. Stay strong sir and please think about 2020.
@GeorgeTakei  we the people demand accountability and will not tolerate anything less *says majority of Americans
Informed Americans already do know the truth: that this is a BS witchhunt cooked up by Dems, Neocons, and the Deep State.
also..what of the Russian Spy ship off the east coast Delaware.. and the Russian planes flying over our battle ship. OMG!?!
I'd also like to know the truth about your BIG PHARM $$..   and why you sold your people out
-NJ Voter
Been given hundreds of thousands of reasons to sell us all out. They own him.
We need to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help us God.
Oh, weknow. Need proof. All roads leads to T. God help us. Need our free press! Need HRC at helm. Scared in VT.
She lost! Americans spoke. Get over it.
@DemsTalk also the @GOP is concerned more about the fact there was a leak rather than its contents. Which is more important
@SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris Yes! I want answers. I expect a thorough Congressional investigation
Thank you Sen Booker!  All hearings & appoint must b halted immediately until special  investigative committee convenes
YOU are a fraud who puts before your constituents! ! Reverse course! Bloviate & Blather but you have no impact on the base
@realDonaldTrump
RT!
DON'T BE DISTRACTED!
TRUMP = RUSSIA
#TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump #TheResistance #TrumpLeaks #RussiaGate
@DemsTalk You do what you do!!! Haters gonna hate & we just ignore them!
I'm with you, Senator.  Let's see som action on this.
What about the real news of the illegal electronic surveillance by the Obama administration.
@TrumpsDailyCon 
@SulakCourtney we have been demanding this, but they aren't listening! Now states are trying to criminalize protests!
@therealzanetta Persist. Persist. Persist. #TheResistance #Russiagate
@CoryBooker yes we need an independent investigation!
Republicans KNOW what the American People want but refuse to uphold their oaths. Meanwhile, *45 defends "wonderful" Flynn 
yes absolutely, nothing less is acceptable
sell out
show me some evidence that you don't work for Russia , then show me evidence that trump does ! Bunch of brainwashed loons
He is an illegitimate president and should be impeached for colluding with Putin. He should not be president, he cheated.
@CoryBooker  
Investigating foreign influence on the US is a GREAT idea. When will you start?

Russian spy thought to be source of info found dead in car!!! Cmon people, some are dying for our democracy
Or, it's not the truth.
Democratic Primaries
Start there
#WeDemandAnswers
@SenBookerOffice
The American people need to know who criminally released the name of an American citizen while conducting illegal surveillance on Trump
Why did you vote against cheaper prescription drugs? #WeDemandAnswers
Because he is the rep for NJ and we would have fired him if he voted against our state's best interests. We good?
So pharma profits  over the common good?
Pharma is one of the largest employers and industries in NJ. Hurting our industry is bad for NJ.
You're not wrong. But people in NJ who would lose their jobs would blame Booker for it.
Point is that he worked for the people in his state. I may not agree with it, but I understand it.
you sir lost my support when you sided with big pharma over citizens.
He's my state rep. We would have fired him if he voted against our state interests.
@RachelAzzara @SenGillibrand @SenatorLeahy
Putin and world peace lulz.
I'm not sure that's how zombi-ism works.
Trump is on the way out but he didn't get there by votes, he got there by cheating and collusion with Russians...
thank you. Keep up the good fight!
your candidate lost badly her rallies were barely attended
@therealLAVALLEE I email my two Republican Senators every day pleading for their bipartisan support of investigation.
it's ppl like you that will ultimately make all the difference. Thank you. 
Yes we do!
@CoryBooker we will get them and more. #theuniverserules Trump's shelf life quickly reaching its "good until" date
Love you Cory- keep digging. We do need to know about this Russian connection - don't stop.
@NJTrumpWarrior look at this bald ass nightmare
How do we demand action. Twitter? Call disconnected phone numbers.
THANK YOU ! #WeDemandAnswers
@CoryBooker thank you Senator Booker for demanding that we the people deserve the  TRUTH! Ur the leader NJ needs right now!
Talk to @jasoninthehouse @SpeakerRyan
answers are good, but it's also a rather convenient distraction, allowing the DNC to ignore their culpability for this mess
anyone who thinks the Flynn situation was ok is a traitor 2 this country! We want a full investigation...
look at his tax returns and his wife! Follow the money and it will show u his business affairs w/ Russia and Putin!
agreed! But still want to know the truth about you and big pharma.
Hillary Clinton would have won minus Russia's influence, trump know it too. Answers and a whole new election, only fair.
@RedHourBen no we dont.
I agree, this should have Bipartisan support.Anyone opposed should be voted out. Trump can't buy America and commit treason
how about you go after the person that leaked the information as well. Where was your concern over the hacking from 2012?
@RedHourBen stop with the fake outrage already
one minute its Hillary next all Democrats, Russia, Nordstrom's, Media ,they the government with this conspiracy theories 
Invaka really must still B upset every1 needs yo-yo s 2 play wth at least U can C the toy going up &down or walking the Dog
Dropped close to $8K on #IvankaTrump in last week. Because of your tweet, ordering more now. THANKS!
thank you, Senator Booker! This is exactly what we need our Congress to be fighting for right now.
you voted against cheaper drugs from Canada. Pharma stooge. Take their money. Sell your vote.
And you need to do this lickety split bc Trump shouldn't be in his position.
... #FakeNews With NO EVIDENCE. @jeffsessions Should Convene Grand Jury To PROSECUTE ILLEGAL LEAKERS NOW! You Got NOTHING!
Do you mean like this full truth? Where were you then? Funny, you were quiet as a mouse.
@DanaRohrabacher I am your constituent and I demand answers. Thank you. 

#WeDemandAnswers

Sir, Europe calling. GO, GO, GO! We support you!

You know that I am there yesterday
I want a full investigation. Our democracy is being jeopardized by foreign & domestic influences.
Stop acting like you care @SenBookerOffice what is Daddy not tipping as good as big pharma?
@VanJones68 Sen. Booker's recent votes are troubling.
YES!
True.  We also deserve to know the full truth of lobbyist influences on you.  I'm all ears...
Don't stop
Keep our FOCUS on the connection btwn Trump/Russia/Flynn

Don't let them change the subject to investigating IC
no. It must be an independent investigation
good job (again) this is a serous priority. Shut Congress down until we get answers on Russian envolement.
How about some other answers: like how much are you being paid by your corporate lobbyists?
Thank you so much for your blunt statement regarding this serious issue. We cannot afford to let this go any longer.
Absolutely!  We The People WANT TO KNOW.  & see his taxes.  Thank you Corey Booker!!!
Read the Russian news online with Google Translate. This is about Crimea. Putin wants assimilate Ukraine with Trump.
please investigate as a Senator.  Don't let this go!  You are our voice! #Flynnleak #enoughoftrump
I called my Congresswoman yesterday. This must not be swept under the rug.

@SenBookerOffice @drjackiet
Demand a Independent commission with a special prosecutor.
We the American people wants a full impartial review of the President ties to Putin and Russia.
@SenSherrodBrown @senrobportman @RepJimRenacci Ohio voters deserve to know.
yes!! #WeDemandAnswers
Thank you Senator. 
#BOOKERFORDNC
what can we even do though? We can't overcome the GOP majority, SO WHAT CAN WE FUCKING DO????
just followed you back and saw this post. Not much other than we have to give them hell starting 2018.
if this baboon is still in office and we grab control of the house. We can go after him tooth and nail
still chasing that fantasy? Didnt u take money from big pharma to deny Americans cheaper drugs? You know..a real issue..
lol unless they pay you then you can forget all about it right lmao you f'n hypocrite!!!  term limits now!!!!!
the GOP will never investigate one of their own.  They value Party over country.  They are a cult.
I support you from 98368. Pls. Proceed Swiftly.
do some critical thinking for a change. As a former analyst you are the problem not the solution
@VanJones68 agreed. Also don't support big pharma
Maybe your friends the Rethuglicans can check into Benghazi again. Russia is their friend.
Please, what the hell are they waiting for? TRUMP is Literally Mentally DISTURBED and destroying the Democracy of America!!
@Maddow @KateBolduan if you don't think you'll be president you'd also not need to set stage for diplomatic relationships
#JusticeDemocrats Americans deserve to know the full truth on Big Pharma influence in the Booker camp.
question is will u be man enough to apologize if there is no guilt. Remember this is ALL speculation with NO proof.
I, like so many others are in full agreeance with you on very serious issue. However, I can't help to think is there anyone
@mn_haben you are a #VeryFakeNews clown
Refuse to cooperate on ANY business until we get an independent investigation.
give it up!! You lost!!!

.@SenBookerOffice you are all hot about this bogus issue and yet you remained silent on Hillary Clinton selling uranium to Russia?  wow.
if people think @MikePenceVP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS didn't know about these conversations they are out of their mind!
@CoryBooker @RepLoBiondo @RepChaffetz   @WeDemandAnswers. #DoYourJob
@CoryBooker I will keep repeating this. WE NEED MORE CORY BOOKER's. Thank you!
new also need affordable medicine and prescription drugs too Cory
@CoryBooker  PLEASE get away from big pharma. We need you.
@BeauWillimon 
Sorry Cory..you lost your street cred when 
YOU voted for Big Pharma!!!  Your done!
.. we are behind you.Do not let GOP investigate GOP
lies lies lies
I have been calling for this since Monday. None of my representatives have gotten back with me.
@GeorgeTakei does this qualify as "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors?" Article II section 4 #impeach
An Independent (not by anyone he knows) investigation needs to happen asap. The man is mentally deranged-we are in danger!
keep the pressure on to get answers!!
we sure do Cory!
@CoryBooker We all must be outraged as Americans and be villugent and demand from the GOP to investigate this corruption.
Good message even though I'm sure he's just doing it to throw his name in for the presidential campaign in 2020. #Impeach
Thank you for standing up for justice. Hopefully ur words are more than just a mere idle boast. #Resist #Hope
.@SenBookerOffice Cory's message needs to be heard around the nation.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE RT his message ! #WeDemandAnswers
but yeah, let's keep your ties to Big Pharma lowkey 
exactly, big pharma owns him. More than $300,000 in donations to him
amen sir.  So please tell us specifically what exactly is your plan so we can help.  It needs a plan, what is it?
@CoryBooker right !!!!just like we got all the answers on Hillary!!!
Why? There's no Russian influence. Democrats throw mud until some sticks & are showing how nasty they really are.
@CoryBooker Great debates, but they fall on deaf ears. GOP has the power and are doing everything they can to deregulate.
love the outrage. Geez. How about begahzi? Don't we deserve the truth there too?
@Planelady1  Sen. Cory don't forget what Our First Lady said, everything that goes UP will come DOWN. So far two came DOWN
Yes we do!
@TrueBlueLiberal #DemocratParty need to stand and yell in unison YOU LIE during State of Union speech.
.@SenBookerOffice Thank you! This is what needs to be addressed at every Town Hall meeting during the February Recess! #WeDemandAnswers
Americans also deserve more affordable prescription drugs. Can you help with that? Oh that's right, you voted no!
Keep the heat on Senator Booker. As a disaffected ex-Republican, we are behind you.
There was no hacking. Patriots leaked incriminating emails to public. #wikileaks #SethRich. You a traitor Cory.
