How do we get investigation started when repubs in control want to protect@realdonaldtrump?
How do you get a health care bill pulled with Republicans in control? Demand it...they work for us.
Just worried because this cover-up goes so deep.
Pressure must be applied to keep digging. We must demand an independent prosecutor & the press must be relentless.
I agree @SenBookerOffice,  so what will you do to make this happen? Who's got the sack to get it done? @decaro_nick @realDonaldTrump
we must all flood the phones in Washington demanding Nunes resign
I agree, but our elected officials need you get in the game too.
I've called @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn Rep Edie Johnson demanding Nunes resign
@Innrdreams @realDonaldTrump actually he should report to jail.
@dumptrump33 @realDonaldTrump If Repubs think Trump and peeps so innocent then why not have indep council to prove it
Yes we do!!!!
Yes Nunes should recuse himself from the HIC. This is an easy one.
call (844) 872-0234 demand Nunes resign
@TomWellborn @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes should be arrested for Obstruction of Justice. #NunesMustResign
You said it!  Keep saying it@senbookeroffice
Horrific when another country has influence, but okay to manipulate your own people. #bullshit
call (844) 872-0234 demand Nunes resign and independent investigation
Omg! Just stop! Women just lost more healthcare rights and you're bitching about Russia! But, then again, you don't care about RX prices...
One would think, that if as Trump claims it's all a hoax, that HE would be the loudest voice calling for a special counsel.
Yeah, bt that wd require COMMON sense.. which is in short supply these days in the west wing!
a council or a reply to a sub- committee in Egg Harbor City?  Donald Trump needs to be aware as Head of State.  Obama and Bush buried it
independent investigation #Trumprussia
Trump has too many Russians in his orbit for it to be coincidences!
call (844) 872-0234 demand Nunes resign and independent investigation
We need to stop this secret crap mr POTUS!! Please don't u want people to like u? Why are u doing awful things to hurt the weak?? Bully u r!
@Balthier28 m if @gop wants 2save last crumbs of credibility they'll remove @DevinNunes Or @SpeakerRyan etclike traitors
Got after them all @SenBookerOffice #ImpeachTrump remove Trump family from WH #kremlingate
thank you Sen Booker!!
patriotic American, tax paying citizens #DEMAND an investigation!!!! My  @DevinNunes @GOP
call (844) 872-0234 demand Nunes resign and independent investigation
By that logic shouldn't @RepAdamSchiff recuse himself, as well? For biased in other direction? Or are you being biased?
Nunes needs to be arrested, not recused.
Is the investigation getting too close to Clinton and Obama colluding with the Russians?
It is getting so corrupted. I love the colors of the setting, chair and tie, Senator Cory Booker.
Eventually he will be gone, but I pray for sooner than later!
How?? How do we speak up?? What do we do?? I'll do anything!!!
I agree and yes we do.   Thank you for speaking up.  Look at the children  growing up listening to this horrible man running the country.
Absolutely! An independent council is needed to investigate, Trump loyalist should not be involved!
PLEASE Keep it up!
Thank U to my #Senator @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker 4 leading the charge - #independentcounsel on #trumprussia. You've got my vote, again!
Proceed with the independent investigation now.
Thank you, @SenBookerOffice! What does @realDonaldTrump have to hide? Smoke? Fire. @Donnapo12
Bullshit!!
Every 1 need 2 Protest n get a Petition 2 get a Special Counsel 2 Investigate Trump on Russian Ties..ASAP
Investigate this Lier.
Dems shld vote no on all DJT noms including Gorsuch + all Rep legislation until verdict from spec prosecut
#Democrats don't believe in nor do they practice recusal themselves. Asking @GOP to do it is hypocrisy.

#DrainTheDemocrats
#Trump
#MAGA
Special Counsel or Independent Commision, ASAP.
Be patient Cory
CIA & NSA Whistleblower says Obama Administration had Trump under https://mainefirstmedia.wordpress.com/2017/03/23/cia-nsa-whistleblower-says-obama-administration-had-supreme-court-and-trump-under-surveillance/ …
Wow.i am defiantly awake now.
Can anyone call House Speaker's office? Calling campaign needed for Nunes recusal + begin independent investigation  ASAP
Why can't there be more good repugs like bud Dwyer?
Not recusal. Removal.
You want a special prosecutor for Trump when there is no evidence but not for Hillary in spite of all the evidence. #BookerDoubleStandard
We need a 9/11 style commission. A prosector may not be able to disclose what they find and the public needs all the details.
You should run for president someday!  Maybe '20?
Since you have never spoken up about Hillary's connections with Saudi Arabia, this seems like pathetic partisanship.
But he won't and until we convince enough of the GOP to pay country before party, we can't make him.
There is no question that we need a special investigation! We have seen what happened in the House and this needs to be independent!
We need to stop asking and start forcing them. Asking republicans to help is like asking criminals to work on an honor system.
I want Senator Cory Booker for POTUS 2020!!!
Let the FBI do its job and do your job. How about this: https://twitter.com/nandorvila/status/847177254996262916 …
Need a counselor to investigate Nunes
And you need to return all that kaisch to big pharma or move out of that big glass house you live in!
Absolutely. No one tied to the WH though. No one they could elect to do it "right"
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump When you're done with your witch hunt we can wipe our asses with your findings.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump A special council to investigate bullshit and drain millions.
#Nunes is working on new position with Dump#Nunes is a Rat for Dump#Dont trust Nunes
We presented a petition to @JeffFlake's office on Tuesday asking for an  independent investigation. His office didn't respond. #ShakeFlake
@DevinNunes gets intel from WH sources but doesn't think this is a conflict? What world does he live in? #NunesMustRecuse
Trump is POTUS, so Republicans don't care what happens to the country they represent in Congress -- giving Putin easy victory? It is treason
Nunes doesn't need to recuse himself. REMOVE HIM!
NO! Not 'recuse'. Devin Nunes must resign. He discredited the committee he chairs and the process. In fact, Nunes must be investigated!
Why not use the British MI5 or MI6? Just a thought!
Ok Sen. What do I need to do?
Open and honest government. #potus45 be presidential
Agreed so do it
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump about like we needed one for Clinton and y'all said no.hypocrites
agree 110% all need to go from trump to v.p. and all who trump put in there even his family
Can you furnish any evidence that there are ties to Russia?
no one cares corey... trump supporters and most gop members don't care... this never ends...
Thank you Senator. Keep pushing for this or it will never be resolved on behalf of the country's security.
@CoryBooker all I can focus on when you when you speak - 
Yeah. Let Jared or Ivanka handle it.
Absolutely! The sooner, the better!  #NunesMustRecuse or hashtag becomes #NunesMustResign
get rid of them both. DO something!
@thecorpmex @realDonaldTrump OLD NEWS !!!  Find a new platform cuz this ain't gonna happen
Thank you, Sen. Booker. This lying & obstruction of justice must stop NOW. Americans deserve the truth.
@McTestaInc @realDonaldTrump Can anyone explain to me why what @DevinNunes is doing is not considered Obstruction?
only to be replaced with another crony trying to cover up the CON MAN!
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump nunes should stay. He did nothing wrong just like the dems did for obucket head
Nunes "investigation" presents alternative "facts" to cast doubt on Senate's-obvious ploy! Sad!
CORY, WE WRITE, WE CALL, WE YELL  but trump has so much crap on each of them. what else can we do
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump so you are saying the I-comm is incompetent to perform its duty. Be pros & do your jobs.
@RepAdamSchiff @TomRooney @SenBillNelson @SenSchumer I am #TheResistance #NunesMustResign #SpecialProsecutor #TrumpRussia
If i could send a $1 to help with this i would. Hey, I did bc @TomPerez_DNC asked me nicely! With ya CB!
the narrative should change from @realDonaldTrump campaign to include current administration
keep going @SenBookerOffice keep the fight going for our country
And Nuñez needs to be added to investigation for alleged treasonous behavior.
Oh, for crying out loud. Its all politics. Russia didn't change anyone's mind about Hillary.
Don't overlook Ryan's part in this. He told Nunes to go to Trump. Very fishy. They torpedoed this together
Nunes and Ryan are traitors obstructing the look at Acts of War and a threat to National Security.
@itsgabrielleu @realDonaldTrump. Please don't give up....
@simpsonrob39 @realDonaldTrump 
So sick of the lefts made up BS  U freakin lost fair and square.
Get over it & Help #MAGA
LOL, yeah may I add, BENGHAAAAAZI! PIZZAAAAGAAAAATE!! 
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Who cares.The Russians. I'm sorry ck of it
@grebnehtordb @realDonaldTrump also a special council to investigate the Clintons. Let a broad based witch hunt begin
term witch hunt = a lack of concern about Russian interference in US functions? Help me see what you see.
He's doing his job which is the bidding of the WH. We can't touch Nunes.altered the scope to leaks!!!
RUN CORY RUN!!!
@bergmanoft @realDonaldTrump THE CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE GONE AND TRUMP GETS HIS WAY LIKE HITLER IN  OVERTHROWING THE U.S!?
@bergmanofthree @realDonaldTrump WERE BEING TAKEN OVER BY RUSSIA AND REPUBLICANS ARE HELL-BENT ON AXING PLANNED PARENTHOOD?
Nunes needs to be investigated for obstruction of justice & violating his oath of office. He lied 4 Trump
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Thank you Senator!  Keep up the fight.He's the wolf watching the hen house. We need the truth
The Russians didn't put trump in office,  we did.  Time for some accountability america
@rposey42 Thank U,Sen Cory 4 your support. DJT should hve already asked him 2 do this. What is he hiding from Gov /
@DevinNunes should be charged with obstruction of justice
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump agree 100%
This is the clown that said Canadian drugs are inferior to the US.
@Amyk6801 @realDonaldTrump Both sides are playing political cards. GOP has to make @Rep_DevinNunes divulge to his committee
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Don't wait to long. This is serious business. We can't say for certain who is  Intel info.
why can't Democrats make a concerted group effort? Blitz the media. Every Dem needs 2b on local news. WEAK
Is Schiff compromised? He is barely objecting. Something is wrong here and Schiff isn't supporting truth!
yes, INVESTIGATE, JUST LIKE TRUMP DID ABOUT THE BIRTHERISM . EXCEPT WE KNOW TRUMP IS A CONMAN.
@CoryBooker Sen intel is not even looking into quid pro quo. There will b no justice when all we have is questionable FBI
@jaytay777 @realDonaldTrump
ah the man who voted to keep prescription drug prices high. No credibility anymore Cory
#booker2020
@bagglo hang tough Sen Booker.
@CherylCmooreart @realDonaldTrump you guys are truly sick!
@CoryBooker What more can citizens do to make Nunes recuse?
nothing you can do liberals we had 8 years of liberal dictatorship and now we love President 
Trump
Nunes may should become part of the investigated. #Dems #NoMoreMrNiceGuy
Nunes staying on the bipartisan committee makes it partisan, and therefore illogical, says Spock
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump How about a special council to investigate Hillary's ties to Russia. 20 percent of uranium!!!!

@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump the #Democrats continue to become unhinged. #delusional #Vault7 #Wikileaks #ObamaGate
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Did you just retweet your own tweet.  You guys are burnt with this Russia story. Give it up
@CoryBooker I like you as a person but you come across being very weak. You can't become president acting this way.
@bhsnitzer @realDonaldTrump and to include investigating Rep. Nunes too.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump I totally agree
Trump sees Nunes as his last blockade before everyone uncovers his illegal activities and then comes JAIL
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump I told Putin on twitter that people are sick and tired of this Russian connection.
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump why do all chairs in DC look so big and ridiculous?
So you are saying @AdamSchiffCA and @MarkWarner are stumble bums?
@ThomasB00001 @realDonaldTrump Tell em about it Future POTUS Cory Booker!#Resistance
With ALL due Respect, we ABSO-DAMN-LUTELY do need an independent investigation!
Agree
@wazberry @realDonaldTrump all and you know...one thing leads to another...soooooo
@wazberry @realDonaldTrump anything. But he's done so much other shit out there that he can't hide it
How can @DevinNunes b impartial?
@wazberry @realDonaldTrump because what ever there is to be gained now may not be real, nor worth
@wazberry @realDonaldTrump killing, abducting etc. this shit IS a wrap. No faith IN an investigation,
@wazberry @realDonaldTrump Nunes has all of the connections to start deleting, erasing, shredding,
@wazberry @realDonaldTrump Nunes IS in charge. Nunes put shit on hold. Nunes won't share info.
hey Cory, NO , your not in charge. U step down?

@wazberry @realDonaldTrump we do, but it's taking too long and evidence is being destroyed...NOW
@wazberry @realDonaldTrump my former Mayor
He's a fucking loony stooge. Just like the rest of them.
Is not about the party anymore, the people, deserve a fair investigation, Nunes you need to leave!
@SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris We need a special counsel for an independent investigation.
@k_hanges @realDonaldTrump Nunes = no no negative

MY Senator, Cory Booker. SO proud! He has our backs. Hes respected, respectful, a true leader & 4 ALL ppl.
I agree
@summerbrennan @realDonaldTrump Nunes must go. He is an embarrassment!
Submit OCE complaint against Nunes. He'll not recuse & must b FORCED. Howhttps://oce.house.gov/ 
 

has one of the most popular tweets to @realDonaldTrump today - via http://PolitiTrends.com 
@summerbrennan @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't trust these idiots to run an Applebee's
...... No Recusal....We want him to Resign his Chairmanship!
then Adam Schiff should also, he's been blabbing abt committee for weeks
Agreed. What do u want us 2 do? U r the Senator. Should we get pitchforks or do you have a better idea? @SenBookerOffice @realDonaldTrump
Stop saying "should" and kick his ass out! @SenBookerOffice @realDonaldTrump
Where's Ken Starr when you need him? There has got to be a stained dress on here somewhere.
Don't look like it's going to happen
@itsgabrielleu @realDonaldTrump this is getting really old. Find away to stop it!
McConnell and Ryan are in this up to their chicken necks too..or turtle neck..which ever
Hehehe...turtle necks!

Senator, please use your voice to champion voters discouraged, the 61% unhappy w/Trump! @Africanfighter @realDonaldTrump
.@SenBookerOffice @MAK7591 @realDonaldTrump Nunes should recuse himself and we don't need an investigation to see your ties to big pharma!
To Hell With Congress Investigating! The FBI Just Have To Come With Warrants! How Bout A Trial Instead!
Keep up the good work, Cory Booker.
has he broke the law? He is going to find out who is unmasking that's important.
