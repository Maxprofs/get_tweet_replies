3 GOP Senators are heroes tonight because they chose the country over party. Thank you McCain, Collins, and Murkowski.
48 Democrats & 3 GOP saved the ACA my Mom, Aunt & I thank them all.
Thanks for staying united and opposing. Glad to be from New Jersey, stay Jersey Strong.
time to do some non-partisan work...you guys can do it. Take the lead...time to work for all Americans
they can't work together they want single payer hell no
Hopefully Tom, they can work together. Everyone is going to have to give some, and compromise. No one can have it only their way. #hopeful
time will tell
make it easy give the American people same plan you have
The entire lot of them are ridiculous as well as their leader
I can now go to bed in peace thank God!
Thank you!
Great news. Now let's work to reduce the costs.
celebrating really pathetic
Meanwhile, as you celebrate, the exchanges are folding like cheap suits and premiums are rising exponentially, great work? Hardly party 1st
Thank you and @SenJohnMcCain
Sir, you're usually spot on, but this time I think you fell short by not recognizing the three Republicans who voted against the repeal.
I prayed everyday they didn't pass this no good bill great win for the good american people

Indebted to you & @SenatorMenendez.  Yes, the fight will continue & we will be there with you.

Thank you for your passionate fight to save healthcare for millions of Americans. Much appreciation!
I want the entire speech on you tube @CoreyBooker
And today will be a victory for New Jersey with your resignation. Thank you in advance for recognizing you serve yourself, not constituents.
Thank you Senator Booker!
thank you senator! Finally some good news to wake up to!
Who cares what this idiot thinks?
Proud of the Senators from NJ @CoryBooker and @RobertMwnendez
Did you whisper something in McCain's ear during that hug? I bet you did. Thank you, Senator.
U will never be president Biased Booker
YOUR the one I have to thank for MY high premiums and shit deductibles. NJ will have a say when your election comes up.
Healthcare is a right. If it's not a right, then repeal EMTALA such that unfunded patients with emergencies in the ER are no longer treated.
Thank you!
Thank you Senator for all your hard work on defeating this. The people of New Jersey and the country thank you.
Thank you for your steadfast leadership. You represent the American people and stand up for us when @GOP won't. #trueleadership
Now on to drug price reform.  You pay the HIGHEST in the world.  How are YOU going to vote Senator??  FOR or AGAINST the People? #Resistance
@CoryBooker how will you fight 45s sabotage of the ACA? He is currently cutting off help for those who need it.
Your speech tonight was very eloquent. There's been so much crazy that when you hear something civil and eloquent it is quite moving. Thanks
You talk a good game Cory but will you vote for #HR676 #MEDICARE4ALL.... I think not!!  I thought that you were a good guy!!
Thank you for your hard work.
Pls run for president.
Thank you Cory, but the fight isn't over. Stay strong, the American people need people of integrity to stand with them!
Thank you Senator Booker 4 ur leadership & passion on this issue. Now, please chase Russian Rat out of WH.
Thank you Cory you are our fighter 
the chance for the democrats to come up with concrete ideas for a way forward. enough resistance, action NOW!
Ask extremists to take a seat (Congress & voters). Moderates can make this happen. Take the best from all ideas. Compromise and consensus.
Thank you.

How you didn't gain more "NO" votes after your speech opposing the "skinny repeal" is beyond me!! You are a genuine man of the people!

Get to work fixing it together now...well soon
