what a waste of time it does nothing but harm
Just like alcohol right? Or does that get a free pass?
i dont really like alcohol just gin and sometimes wine (tonight is wine night so we are on the porch with the ipad)
Roy here doesn't understand that wine contains alcohol, as does gin.
alcohol isnt gin its what they put in beer. one comes from grapes and one from wheat go back to school
Gin consists of neutral alcohol and botanicals.  Drink enough over an extended period of time and see what happens to your liver.
Margaret is bedding in her third liver and she has never complained
Please clarify exactly what you mean by "bedding in her third liver".
Why is he making it a race thing?
Because the majority of pot smokers are white, but the majority of people in prison for pot are not white
But that shouldn't even matter, it should be legal without any other motives...regardless of how noble or righteous those motives are
Marijuana was scheduled as a class 1 drug under the Nixon administration, his war on drugs was targeted towards hippies and blacks.
Not saying Nixon didn't start the war on drugs, and specifically marijuana. But that's isn't when or why it became illegal
You're right, it first became illegal in the 1930s to target Mexican immigrants, so it's always been based off of racism & xenophobia.
Great idea.  Smoking pot is a great way to better anyone's situation in life.
NOT locking innocent people up and NOT branding them as criminals for life is however a great way to better their situation.
Just make sure there's plenty of weed
Not one more person should be imprisoned for marijuana use, possession or cultivation.
It one thing if someone needs it because cancer, medical but 
Not everyone!
If this passes, hopefully "offenders" already in prison get released too. 
a bigger issue than just pot it is racial incarceration
Bravo!
Well done @senbookeroffice @CoryBooker ... that's what REAL leadership looks like. Well past time. Thank you.

Proud of New Jersey's Cory Booker; he's been pro-plants for years starting with his vegan diet. Make pot legal!
Keep up the fight Cory or I'm moving to Canada!

The people who have a prob w pot need to research. Alcohol destroys millions of lives every year.
And putting smoke into your lungs is a good idea, like cigs!
CoryBooker2020 ....there you go! I believe this man has great potential to be our next President! He won't be absent-minded like someone!
Whole-heartedly agree with senator booker.  The opioid crisis is swallowing up towns and resources must be re-allocated

I'm sure the GOP senate will pass this bill  foh! Cory is a fraud. What did he do when Dems had power? It's too late now
Let's be real. Cory's bill wouldn't pass even if the Dem had majority.
Cory is drafting a bunch of progressive bills to look good for his 2020 run. He doesn't believe in this shit. He's a fraud
He's padding his political resume for a losing run at the White House.
If this is such a bad choice how is it padding for a white house run?
Just what we need!  He truly is not the sharpest tool in the shed!
Stop with the identity politics.Let's do what's safe for ALL Americans based on science and experience in Colorado.

Have you any idea how many lives & families have been ruined by the government's & the Judicial System's making marijuana illegal?
Millions of lives destroyed -- long-lasting destruction with punitive money sentencing that can never be paid off! Especial shame to Judges
Even in Clatsop County, Oregon!
Only about 20 years too late...that's like betting on a sporting event in the 4th quarter.
Anyone who has a chronically ill kid knows the benefits of marijuana. Do your homework before judging his attempt to do whats right!

The DEA's own judge (Francis L. Young) recommended the relegalization of medical #marijuana.

DEA's F. Young:  "There is no record in the extensive medical literature describing a proven, documented cannabis-induced fatality."

In the words of the DEA's Francis L. Young, #marijuana is "one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man."

Senator, ANYONE arrested for marijuana use did so by their own CHOICE. Do not conflate race and individual choice in your narrative.
We should legalized all drugs. Allow dumbasses to OD and increase the level of common sense in this country.
I mean alcohol harms no one smh
That was the ONLY pain med relieved my sis ovarian cancer pain. That other stuff messed up her bowels foam at the mouth loose appetite
That's it? The great plan into the next gen. of Democrat leadership...pot smoking? ... that's all you got?... perhaps N.Korea needs that? 
What's his angle though? HE gets so much money from big pharma. I'm skeptical
The good news is, the potheads are winning.  #marijuanaGoodForSocie...zzzzzz
@POTUS can't withhold $ from sanctuary cities but #CoreyBooker wants to pave way for home grown dope slingers.  Perfect.
Seems pretty racist to me...
It will never pass
I see Booker is trying to win over progressives. I see you,sir. I see you.
Come on @POTUS do something right for the people!! #legalizeit
Get the non violent offenders Out of Jail Now! This legislation, will HELP...Lots of GOOD Folks! Thank YOU,CORY! Whoot! Shoot!
Imagine if the worst drug on the planet,alcohol was a class 1 drug.
If @POTUS @realDonaldTrump & the #Republican party don't support this legislation they'll lose main sets & Trump could lose #2020
So now hes a high priced drug pusher AND race baiter. So glad he has time for nonsense like this. Yaknow he shoveled a driveway? Empty suit.
About time, all of America believes it's time, I will back it , all of America will back it. @CoryBooker will make history.
@ShaunKing What would they do with the people in jail for marijuana possession?
It sucks that you're doing it when Repubs are majority. It'll never get anywhere
Probably because his Big Pharma bosses finally realized how profitable marijuana can be.
Rock n Roll
Racist drug war is organized crime. Jeff Sessions is part of the #corrupt prison-industry-complex mafia. Expel #racists from US government.
How about prison reform first for those related crimes? Omg
EXPEL Trump/GOP for organized CRIMES of climate denial, fossil fuel pollution, racism, misogyny, bigotry, lies, CORRUPTION
Oh yeah
He clearly knows that it's not going to pass. Don't be fooled.  Cory will sell us out in an heartbeat.
Go Senator Booker
Anyone else think that was key from key and peele?
Real story here is nonviolent offenders would have their records retroactively expunged. Mass emancipation + a huge hit to #ForProfitPrisons
It's going to take a lot of POSITIVE COMMENTS & COMMUNICATIONS with our CONGRESSPEOPLE to get this much needed legislation passed!
Liberals are all about crime
Cognitive dissonance at its finest
So
yeah, because only black people smoke weed.
#JeffersonBeauregardSessions is GRANDFATHERLY toward White Heartland #OpioidEpidemic compared to his #ReeferMadness crusading.
@CoryBooker
Take Sessions down!
Instead of more laws that give special treatments for different groups we just have laws that everyone must obey. Wouldn't that be justice?
As a person that lives in pain, good
,,ykfo
Senator Brooker's Bill to address what he believes is racial injustice (& many cases are so) is way over the top. It's "notice me" politics.
This is warped @CoryBooker 
What POT lobbyist paid you
I http://heard.you , many people were harshly sentenced for minor drug offenses. States have been correcting this. However, Senator...
Terrible idea.  Who would fill those prisons and keep the money train rolling?
After freeing those convicted of illegal drug charges, we should free those who stole to support their illegal drug habit. So on & so on!
Legalize all drugs, Not just marijuana! That way you could release even more inmates convicted on illegal drug charges. Freeing jail space.
I knew I liked him.
Since you are aiming legalize marijuana nationally, why just legalize all substances? Just because we have an opiates CRISIS, why stop here?
It's about time!!!
The effort is appreciated, but with this racist "just say no to drugs" ridiculous administration it's a longshot, but worth a try.
Ironic since New York and his state of New Jersey have the most draconian and arcane marijuana laws.
So when somebody asks "what is he smoking"..they really have a plausible question?
More ways for us black folk to be distracted is exactly what we need
When did Cory become Smokey? "Cause it's Friday, you ain't got no job, and you ain't got shit to do" lol
End Nixon's war agst the black community and 60's anti-war movement. rfl
@_cingraham shocker-a dem wants to separate a group of people
That's still not going to be enough to win over progressives that see him as a Corporate Dem.
You are so wrong!
Well... he just won the love of the progressive wing.
I hope the progressive wing doesn't fall for this act. He had to do something "big" since his pocketing Big Pharmaceuticals money
They're just like the Trump supporters. They'll believe whatever agrees with them, regardless of whether it's true or not.

If it's clearly less legally hazardous to carry marijuana than opioids, then opioid related problems go down.
I don't see how they are related at all. There would still be an opiod issue
@CoryBooker takes tons of pharma/insurance $. He either doesn't really want this, or has plans 2 monetize for his big donors. #peoplesparty
once marijuana is legal, it won't be gangster enough. They'll just step up their game.
