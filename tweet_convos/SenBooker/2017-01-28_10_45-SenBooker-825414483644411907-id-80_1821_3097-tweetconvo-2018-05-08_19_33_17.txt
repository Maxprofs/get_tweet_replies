Don't think he represented much of a security risk mind you. @SenBookerOffice @webmink
@CoryBooker senator if these refugees were from Germany I would not have an issue with it but radical Islam I do
@MarthaLynneOwe1
@CoryBooker I am certain you could be a refugee too since you like that ideal so much. How a bout Sryia. Need a ticket?
Excellent!
Steve Jobs Dad was a Syrian refugee.
He was also a Christian, the kind that Muslims in Syria loved to murder. He was a victim of Syrian Islam.

Times have changed.
Albert Einstein wasn't trying to kill us you political hack! You care more about partisan politics than you do the country!

@CoryBooker you really aren't qualified to be in office, Einstein came here LEGALY!
Was Mr. Einstein a terrorist threat Mr. Booker?
@CoryBooker not belonging to the targeted community though..@realDonaldTrump @iamshalabhkumar
@CoryBooker And He was a non violent jew, not an American hating Islamic radical terrorist...
@CoryBooker  Refugee islamic ?
@CoryBooker Lets face it, @realDonaldTrump is no Einstein
@CoryBooker Trump supporter reply: "Einstein thought he was SO smart! I hate elites!"
@CoryBooker do you see him taking the citizenship oath. He was not illegal.  Booker, we all see your campaign shaping up.
@CoryBooker There have been presidents that I didn't vote for, but always respected. This is not one of those times.
where were you to save us when Obama was doing it, Cory?
They goin HAM on the Breitbart FB https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart/photos/a.10152968700630354.1073741830.95475020353/10158534328230354/?type=3&theater … 
@JakeLaperruque Einstein was only a single refugee- exceptionalism should not be the argument for basic human decency
the argument of exceptionalism will not convince fascists, or racists, and diminishes value of ordinary ppl
screaming racists and fascists diminishes the legitimate concerns of Americans for their country
@CoryBooker how is it that one man has hijacked our democracy in one week. Now court orders are not being followed.
Sure. Let's equate the Nazi pogrom against Jews with Trump. You're not very smart are you, Cory.
@CoryBooker and then legally became a citizen, legally, he was old too, not fighting age or affiliated,  right?
oh yeah, he was a brilliant scientist too, before he became a refugee
we need to help them improve their own countries,  wouldn't that help the planet not just mindless votes
for politicians
don't you care about the planet or their cultures?
@CoryBooker a legal refugee without terrorists ties
@CoryBooker So were Henry Kissinger and Madeline Albright
what can we do to most effectively show up & stand up to this right now?
vote?  Oh wait, we already did that and gave all 3 branches and most states 2 party of America 1st
The greatest refugee. And America surely got the historic bargain.
he was selected by the government because he was a German scientist.... get your facts straight!
@CoryBooker If there were an anti-refugee lobby, you'd have a different stance you sellout.  All you care about is money
Exactly, and 
He was not a rapist
.@SenBookerOffice Agree. That said, how come you took $$$ from big pharma while GOP tried to suppress healthcare in a political power play?
Yes But Albert Einstein Wasn't A USA Hating Killer #RadicalIslam Muslim Terrorist Out To Destroy American Citizens  E=mc2
was vetted properly........not from countries where killing American are encouraged....big difference.....
.@SenBookerOffice @frenchcori Einstein became a U.S. citizen BEFORE America went to war with Germany. Crucial point!
Even donal trump's grandfather was German
Albert Einstein was RECRUITED renounced his German Citizenship and PACIFISM embraced by the scientific community no refugee
, Sen. You seem to be a well educated person. Impressive resume, why is it with you, and your party, you can't learn LEGAL!
@PrincessBravato - why is Booker tweeting? You lost all credibility when you voted against the people.
@PrincessBravato
@PrincessBravato He also defined insanity as doing the same thing over & over & expecting a different outcome. Smart man.
..and a iPhone; #SteveJobs was a Son of #syrianrefugee @Apple OK @realDonaldTrump uses #android PS: #android  is MiUSA
...ahhh, but, more importantly: he wasn't muslim

that seems to be the decider today
Yes and the FBI tracked everything he did, how would you like to fund those investigations? http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/science/new-details-emerge-einstein-files-fbi-tracked-his-phone-calls-his-trash.html …
@nataliemorales so was one of the San Bernardino shooters...
start running for Pres. Now,look what you could run on,Putting America Back Together After Trump
@LeslieLee327 the vast majority of us come from refugees in one form or another: political, economical, religious, etc
