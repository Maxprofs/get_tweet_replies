Please listen 2Senator Cory Booker a man of love strength & honesty striving to help mankind Cory Booker for President 2020
So food is more than fine it's the priority
Forget Organic food ppl need food  period there's not a place in the World that doesn't need medical care food
Bernie's done so is HRC unfortunately we've got to IMPEACH tRump he's just plainly no good
Starvation cannot be ignored.  Problems here give us no excuse to ignore the desperate plight of others.
#ForiegnAid #UnitedNations #Unicef
Why wasn't this urgent when Obama was in office? We have black people starving in here in the US
No, sorry, tired of sending support overseas when our own citizens need help.
Leave it to the UN. Not our problem.
@CoryBooker South Sudan.   How about downtown Los Angeles.   Our own First.
just watched a report on this on @60Minutes ! It's horrifying that in 2017, these people have no food and clean water!
Humanity Before Politics - thank you for drawing attention to the needs of Southern Sudanese!
@CoryBooker if only we had more Senators like you. We are scared but proud of you! #resist
@CoryBooker we got people here in America homeless on the streets dude.
Looks like we might be next . . .
@CoryBooker Thank you!!
@CoryBooker while I'm sympathetic, there are too many starving people right in our own neighborhoods. We need to fix this
And how many in the US don't have jobs living on food stamps? You care for them, bring them here, put them on welfare. We're rich!!!
@CoryBooker Where do we send best utilized donations?
That's the problem. When people send $ there's often corruption. I have sympathy but no solution.
we have missing girls in dc. Focus.
NO!
LIFT THE SANCTIONS & ALL THE PEOPLE EAT!
ITS SANCTIONS THAT CAUSE GOVTS TO REBEL IN GREED
&STARVE THEIR OWN
I can see the focus of this man to deal with a greater picture . 2020 here we come ( may be earlier!)
We've been sending trillions in aid to Africa since the 40's
Time to end it, and feed our own
@SenBookerOffice
#MAGA
One million people are on the brink of starvation in #SouthSudan â€“ this crisis demands our urgent action: 
how many votes did you get in #SouthSudan? 0 that's how many. Take care of Americans. #makeamericagreatagain!!
@CoryBooker this is again not our problem we have over 1million here that need help. Move to Sudan if you want to help!
has the trump admin spoken about helping at all?
Too busy sending 100M to help #Flint.
We need to cut our deficit, the govt needs to save, but America is the most giving country & people will give. Use media.
@SenBookerOffice
Ask Clinton Foundation for aide
@e EMSar thlasMtE  A self inflicted tragedy.  Very sad for the victims
@RedRose3b Senator Booker, you are a good person.
Mr. Booker, what about the ones starving in OUR country? Vets and non-vets alike
@CoryBooker Very sad. What can we do to make sure food gets to people and does not get stolen?  Contribute to?
indeed Is a test of humanity in a time humanity is diminishing
With so much else going on, thank you for taking the time to shine a ligth on this.
Feed them yourself. I'd rather feed America's hungry and give our vets what was promised first. Give yours, not mine.
.@SenBookerOffice Venezuelans are also starving and probably on their way here right now. Obama sure left the world in a mess, didn't he?
they have oil, diamonds,copper etc. and you want to help them?
we also have homeless in US, one in 6 kids live in poverty. Do you not worry about that?
What the fuck was Obama doing the last 8 years? Oh yeah, golfing.

@CoryBooker 3 innocent people died today in Westminster die to muzzie terrorist.be strong
Let the UN dictators provide for them.  We have other things to do. Tell T-Bone to stop giving you shitty advice
Thank you for being that reassurance there is still good people in our government.  Your messages are where we need to be.
thank you.
@CoryBooker where can an individual donate
@christinacooks caring for those who have less or are staving shouldn't be a charity but a global priority
Please care about the NJ starving, poor, homeless, ill, forgotten. They need you more. And we are your job. Right?
I like our Lady Liberty extending a loving hand. Again, hope to vote for you someday. #hero
@CoryBooker I cannot tell you how much I admire you for sticking to important issues in the midst of this blazing madness!
@CoryBooker Nope can't help them. Can't help any1 in Trump's America! Let them starve bc they don't contribute to America.
@CoryBooker ask Mulveny maybe he'll help
@CoryBooker how many Americans are starving right now, let's take care of them frist
@CoryBooker  take a walk thru camden. ..charity begins at home
@CoryBooker maybe you can foot the bill you dummy! There are plenty of starving AMERICANS that need help more!
@CoryBooker 20 million starving in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria
@CoryBooker people. It's a great goal but I think your heart is too big.Fix DC please.I will give what I can though to help
@CoryBooker keep doing you Bruh.... We more like you
@CoryBooker You politicians can't even work together to accomplish anything and now you want to feed millions of hungry
@CoryBooker apparently the us is busy trying to find money for a trip to mars and a long wall. Crazy.
@CoryBooker they are suffering and will continue to suffer due to land grabbers
@CoryBooker 42million people are suffering from hunger in the USA, what about that?
@boldandworthy what will the US do? This is urgent
What about the homeless and starving and the underfed in this country? Crickets?
I'm sure they would welcome your help. When are you leaving?
in other news secret service asked for AN EXTRA $60 Mil a year to protect Trump's clan. ski trips, golf, melania in NYC
thank you for all of your hard work!
actually listening until you brought partisan politics into it. So little political shot of my own "big pharma Booker"
I can't hear you...  what crisis?  Sudan?  really?
Trump/GOP won't do anything that doesn't increase their power, make the rich richer, or exact revenge on political enemies.
And this crisis LITERALLY HAPPENED OVER A 70 day period? You are a fool.
