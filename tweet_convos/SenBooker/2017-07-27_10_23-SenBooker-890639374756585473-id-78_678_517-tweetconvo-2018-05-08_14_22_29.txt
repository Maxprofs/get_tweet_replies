Smart lawmakers would improve on the existing plan. That's how we got a Tesla from a Model T.
TheReasonThe #ACA IsUnstable&Liable2AttackBy #Trumpublicans IsBecauseThereAreNoPriceControls&CostsHaveSkyrocketed! ItIsTime4 #Medicare4ALL!
Ask me about the Awans .

why?
isn't it time to call #SkinnyRepeal  for what it is: a sneaky way to defund #aca & up the premiums? let's get #MedicareForAll now!
Does anyone think GOP is trying to help us? No. We all know they're out to screw us all except filthy ultra rich.POTUS not fooling us either
Sounds just like Obama care consequences
Just like your #obstruction does now.
And KILL MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. If a diabetic can't afford insulin, they will DIE. August 1st, people could lose insurance - THIS TUESDAY.
We conservatives are not fooled. Bring on that full repeal, open the market back up to regulation-free competition, free market=lower prices
Another Democratic chart of how good we take it up the rectom.
Don't b fooled by Democrats fancy Bullshit charts
Isnt this what is happening now?
where did that information come from? r these estimates or true hard facts? CBO wasnt right with ACA so if thats who dont put much stock in
"FULL REPEAL .....With NO REPLACEMENT !! .....
@SenMikeLee @senorrinhatch Senators, I am your constituent & I want you to Vote NO on #SkinnyRepeal. It would cause my premium to SKYROCKET!
"Skinny Repeal" is one of the dumbest Washington phrases I've heard in years. And that's saying something.
Hey, #Dems..you do know costs, premiums and deductibles are skyrocketing-right? #Obamacare is terrible; but you want to control #WeThePeople
Can GOP guarantee their bill won't have rising premiums & deductibles?
#GOP can't guarantee a darn thing. It was screwed up in '09 with #ACA & will remain screwed up. #WeThePeople are the losers.
@robportman 561,300 Ohioans will lose coverage. I'm one of them. Don't do this to us. Be smart and stop this terrible "skinny" bill.
This chart is not entirely true. Iowa for instance is about to have no ACA insurers. That has nothing to do w GOP, new plans; only Obamacare
YOU MEAN LIKE OBAMACARE
When People in mass drop dead from the lackluster empty BILL, the administration won"t give a shit!  That is as plain on your face!
This is McConnell's con-job. This is the pathway for basically adopting the original House bill. Bullshit aside, it's a tax cut for wealthy.
I'm one Kentuckian who plans to hold that POS responsible come election time. I can't wait to campaign against him!

Why are you voting for this @SenToomey?
Who do Republicans think will end up paying for uncompensated care costs to hospitals? Hint: consumers
@ocrfa Check this out.
. thank you. this bill will not work, and will drive up premium costs. #indivisible
Get out of bed with the pacs and the insurance rates will drop
@SenToomey how can you do this to PA?
Because he's beholden to money and not the citizens he represents. He's a sell out.
A full repeal is what we want. #highdeductibles #highpremiums and #nochoice plus loosing our doctors was the result of ACA. #healthfreedom
who is "we?" a bare minority of nitwits that don't understand the issues or economics? you people believe anything and fall for everything
They must be heath insurance market sympathizers
@GOP @tedcruz don't do this to Americans and Texans please
If he pulls this shit, @BetoORourke will save the day!
Yepper. #VoteLocal2018
There's always hope. Ted Cruz is a horrible human being!
Not good. No wonder some GOP Senators voted No!
This is all a waste of time, energy, & money. None of the GOP plans address the health care problems that the ACA did far better.
#FakeNewsDemocrats
We've been in streets since Feb and Blunt's office every week w/ constituents and their stories, family's biggest threat is no healthcare.
You mean the individual market that's already failing on its own? And cries about people losing insurance they don't want? Idiots
