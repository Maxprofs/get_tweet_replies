Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this event and for advocating for us.
Imperative that you vote against Gorsuch-Senator Booker
much like with trump. Ivanka should not have security clearance, especially as a volunteer. Trump and friends are traitors
many of our "reps" do not listen or send back form letters.
You got it!
vote NO on this deplorable legislation. #resist #reject #NoTrumpCare
- as RN & Attorney, I say keep fighting for Justice & Compassion.
#Trumpcare = #WEDONTCARE
president Clunton stated that #Obamacare is "craziest thing in the World".What's your take on his comment?
FF @SenBookerOffice for info-> Friday is the Day #Trump & Ryan will try to pass #TrumpCare. Stay awake to #SaveTheAcA #SaveACA
@CoryBooker force us to buy unaffordable health care is not the solution.
vote yes get obamacare out

@kimmoore0184 thank you @senBookerOffice from Ohio, and for America!
If I call you would you consider allowing the import of Canadian pharmaceuticals?Or do your pharma masters not want that

Thank you for working to protect my medically fragile daughter's life! @fragilekidsNC #ProtectOurCare #MedicaidMatters

Thank you for all you do! We appreciate you!
Speaking to wrong ppl, we know what this does to us. Speak to Republicans/ stop the assault on constituents. R jobs gone.
Thank you Senator this horrible bill must be defeated.
My rep, @RepTomMacArthur , won't clear out his VM, which is always full, and I often get no ans at all in his DC office.
it's been RT. My rep is @SenWarren @RepLynch
I called but--Republican senators.  I doubt they care.  In fact, not caring is their whole m.o.
are you part of the Senate Democrats that are going to confirm the Supreme Court Judge?
It's mentally draining engaging my DC representation. I can't imagine your level of exhaustion. Keep fighting!
@SensiblySecular Done!!
Tried calling 2day-MacArthur won't clear out voicemail box--he's hiding/finding excuses not to listen to his constituents!
#Just called#Stop the American sabotage of our democracy with these billionaires cover ups#HELP all Americans not just rich
Senator Booker, real American heroes look out for the voiceless. Thank you!
#TrumpCare is bad for Americans.
we're all with you!
wake up folks. This plan will hurt low income families. Republicans could care less about that though
@USRepRodney listen to the Senator, Rodney.
keep up the good fight for all of us taking care of kids with disabilities
What's really going on? Why the fast rush to screw up the #affordablehealthcare we have in stead of fixing the problems?
SAY NO TODAY TO AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REFORM BILL! The word affordable isn't in the word America -- not much is.
Thank you! Well stated
Thank you, Senator Booker.
@CoryBooker thank you for your leadership in this battle to stop Trumpcare, Senator. This cannot become law.

@VABVOX Senator, thank you for all you do.
I've never been more proud on you.
The GOP doesn't care. They would like to see all minorities and sick people die. Call it what it is....

@CoryBooker Proposed Trump/Ryan healthcare bill is as cruel, callous, creepy, crazy & criminal as #Trump! 
#CreatesCadavers

Please don't let Comrad Donnie & his heartless cronies like Paul Ryan murder kids the sick & old & handicapped & VETS 
My story is here also as many of yours are I use respiratory medications & insulin without Medicaid I will die please
@TheZenPuppy Sounds good, but would have been better if you gave the $ back and stood up to big pharmacy. We need that, too
@decaro_nick I have spoken to @SecPriceMD on FB in Feb.He deleted his promises once put on Trumps team. Sad !!He lies alot!
I screenshot red out conversation and when the time is right it will go public!
Hey sexy. How are you doing?
I wish the republicans would leave Obamacare alone and let it fall apart like it will. Then see how proud you are of it.
we would be proud. Take away the mandatea- restrict corporate bonuses & limit overpricing by
the corporations, hospitals and.doctors.that would fix the program
 We need routine exams. If
you pay the
Is high price they say won't come down for employer plans you deserve a yearly √up
the new plan also will keep the same high deductible/out of pocket. The tax credit is not 4
the high priced employer plans
 Why don't hard working.people get crwdit. It cost the middle
class a.third of their checks for insurance add the deductibles it's crazy.They have to cap
why don't you talk about your views on what happened in Maryland w/ the 14 year old girl being rapped by illegal immigrants
maintain and improve Aca, impartial Russian investigation. no confirmation of Supreme Court justice until Russia done
@ItsMariawith2Rs Well daid. Thanks for standing up for what's right!

@CoryBooker Yo Senator! Ur Team signed A Law Before Ur Team Read It! You Conned US ONCE!! Goodbye!
. Nothing like being specific. (Sarcasm)
@CoryBooker Dump ACA it hasn't never worked and it never will unless your at the poverty level
Can anyone be more articulate and truthful as @CoryBooker? No.
@CoryBooker I'm calling to make sure you are blocked from anything to do with anything.
thank you so much for all of your hard work!!
And thank you for fighting for us!!!
First thing people have to do is stop equating third party reimbursement as "health care"
We've been calling Chris Smith, but he's avoiding. Time to send him back to Virginia!
We don't need you running for president. Just do your job to our standards and then get out.
Good Luck. I'm sure Trump is threatening a lot of Representatives tonight.
Alright, then listen to this, Senator: don't take money from big pharma. Instead, fight for what's right then step aside.
Do you hear yourself? @EWuebbels @SenBookerOffice
Well, I can't exactly hear what I type unless I read it aloud, can I?
@CoryBooker Are you fighting as a team against this demonic bill?
@CoryBooker amen
Booker 2020
We've got to jam the lines and make them listen!
@CoryBooker America can't afford Obamacare. We need a free market solution.
I just left voicemails for Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson in Florida.
@CoryBooker Why is it ok to cut programs like Medicd &  meal prog for children yet NOT be outraged at tax $s spent on golf?
it is okay to kill unborn by fracking poison,healthcare unaffordable,cutting cancer research- but
they condemn abortion however it's a political front,they don't mind killing those less fortunate
@CoryBooker "you gotta make then listen"... Key flaw in your parties ideology... Others are not subservient to your views.
if anyone can make them listen you can
when u have a bad message - people just don't care
@CoryBooker   These people must be stopped!  My family has served in three wars!  We do not deserve TrumpRyan care!
Leave. @Pkgkansas @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @FoxNews @greggutfeld @oreillyfactor
@CoryBooker I live in no. #notmysenator
the Democrats didn't listen either.
@CoryBooker how bout I call you and tell you "Dont bother running in 2020, we don't want you" 
Big pharma sellout hack
@CoryBooker Republicans aren't interested in protecting our care they're only interested in protecting their own selves
@CoryBooker I don't want to hear b/c Dems sold us a bill of goods on Obamacare which hasn't worked for us. Sorry no cred!
I hear the Dandy Don song. "Turn out the lights,  the partys over."
@CoryBooker can you get  Newark Bear Stadium open for season Rutgers and NJIT are supposed to play there. Owners locked it.
they had no notice, no field now.
no ones answering the phones-voice mai boxes full.
@MichiganDems Here are the Michigan reps..
@CoryBooker Three NJ congressmen are definite no's
@CoryBooker A Clintonesque argument structure. He was always the best at explaining and humanizing complex ideas
@CoryBooker repel it ,it's only good for non working people and working people are paying for them
@CoryBooker when are you going to start listening to people telling you to stop taking corporate donations?
@CoryBooker your colleague @USRepRodney’s voicemail is full and disconnected me
@rdsx2007 @SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker @USRepRodney make your case on his Twitter feed!
