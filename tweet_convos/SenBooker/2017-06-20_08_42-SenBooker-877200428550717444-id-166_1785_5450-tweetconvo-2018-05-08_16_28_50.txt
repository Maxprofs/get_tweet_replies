Wouldn't count on Booker. He may go collude with Rand Paul on how to get dems to support it.
I would've tagged along to find the #ACHA but I've got more pressing needs. The #President of my country (Nigeria) is missing!
@NGRPresident
This is what Dems need to talk about screw Russia for now it is all about healthcare and how kids and Grandma will die with Medicaid cuts
And how about that end of life counseling in the ACA?
B4 the Rep. House stopped it, there were provisions in the ACA to pay doctors to talk to elderly about dying options as opposed to treatment
You mean paying doctors for their time while discussing DNR's with elderly patients?
As in "if you are too sick to speak for yourself do you want us to keep you alive on machines"? Thats bee around for a long time...
i.e.....less people on Medicare equals controlling costs, which is what the IPAB is designed for.
No. End of life counseling does not meant you don't get treatment, you can have treatment until the day you die. End of life counseling
allows patients who don't want treatment to make their wishes known in case they fall too ill to speak for themselves. The board you
Would you guys mind explaining to me and the rest of America how this statement from @USCBO re: GOP hc bill is OK?? #chronicillness #spoonie
Sure:

You go to school, graduate, and get a job or go get more school and then get a job.  Once you get a job, you buy insurance.  Life 101
I was referring to a lot more than people being "contributing members of society.." but I forgot, trolls don't have comprehension skills.
Right...

I must have missed your well-formed, thoughtful argument
You misread my entire tweet, actually. I had no "argument" bc I was asking a question. Go bother someone else who cares to argue.
Your question specifically dealt with non-group insurance. Those policies used to apply to only a very small subset of people before the ACA
After the ACA, many of the previous non-employer groups such as farm bureaus, SBAs, etc. stopped offering insurance at all.
With their absence from the market, which will inevitably be temporary, your option for a group policy remains your employer.

This is the headline of the century...it would hilarious if it weren't true. It has actually come to this
LOL publicity stunt #sad.
A democracy where something like this is a secret. You just got to shake your head in bewilderment
well, who needs an actual bill, right? Or an actual hearing? Or vote? Or Senate?
so west wing of you guys
It's all a game and you are all sheep
It's in the same place Hillary hid her emails. Just make sure not to ask Comey about it, then it would be just a matter
McConnell has it stashed under his paperwork entitled, "Coal~America's Best Energy Source" @McConnellPress
I love this. Wish it had worked!
In other news Senate Democrats fail to find their ass with both hands and a map
Stunting. Stupid. Eho cares where it is?
"We Have to Pass the Bill So That You Can Find Out What Is In It."
Interesting mental image of you guys banging your heads to Queen like Wayne's World.  Love you guys!
I hope they get lost on the way
Go get it!!!!! Please our lives depends on you.
Yes!!!
 Just another bill in the wind
Maybe you could give the Senator some grammar lessons.
Just looking for something to waste time doing while at work. Instead of doing what you're supposed to be doing.
Mahalo nui loa for your work on this. @SenateMajLdr must be stopped in his blatant and appalling attempt to take away so many's healthcare!
Godspeed
Its under a new name look for it as "deathcare"
Woe the case of the bill went missing

Ohhhhhhh myyyyyyy a threeway!!
Great, how about you all also do something besides tweet, like grind senate biz to a halt. Allowing this to be voted upon is UNFORGIVABLE.
Perhaps calling it "health care" is the underlying problem?  ;)
Man this government is more entertaining than a soap opera!!!
I think it was sent to Obama presidential library. Along with Rice unmasking records. Be 5 years b4 yaw can see it.
This was so much more dignified than Rand Paul running around with a copy machine. Thank you, sirs, for the effort.
Check the microwave.
This is alarming to me. Why secrecy? Why hide the bill? Is this democracy? A handful of Republicans decides for an entire nation???
Silly Stunt... Rand Paul called and wants it back.
Cory got to make sure it doesn't affect big pharmacy
Never understood why you have a right to a lawyer because its your life but no right to a doctor even though its YOUR LIFE!
I get the feeling their healthcare bill is worded something like
"We'll choose our own adventure and decide on things as they pop up"?
Please post it when u find it!
@SenBobCasey @SenToomey #PHILLY wants to see the bill #pa And let's #Flipthe5th #FlipItBlue
This is some crazy level sh@t right here!!
Thank you for working diligently to save my care and my life.  #SaveTheACA #NoAHCA #NoTrumpCare
Anyone who aided and abetted this 45 administration should be kicked out of the country for UnAmerican activity.
I think it's a myth. No way 13 white men came up with a genuine healthcare bill
How very covert of you
Please do everything in your power to find out. The American people deserve better treatment from the GOP
Why? They didn't read the ACA, just wanted to find out whats in it by passing it first and sitting back and waiting for something to happen
Y bother u don't care if it's passed ur simply grand standing
What a charade!
Kick ass and take names.  And thank you.
Publicity stunt. If the Dems wanted us all to have healthcare - WE WOULD. When CORPORATIONS fund your campaign, YOU WORK FOR THEM, not us.
do you make the same critique of republican legislators?
Hahaha. You idiots.
go get 'em boys! #SavetheACA
No healthcare will be affordable anyway ever! Big Pharm and greedy insurance companies will make sure if it.
#Heroes
Yay! Keep us posted. A shame my rep @RepMimiWalters doesn't.
This my level of petty and I love it
Good luck! And thank you
Get them coach
It's like a fun adventure, except it's really not.
Mission of fools.
How long do we wait before sending search party?
Thank you @brianschatz @CoryBooker @ChrisMurphyCT you guys rock! Here's hoping more follow your lead.
I'm sure you will let us know what you find? #ShowUsTheBill
Pelosi on the ACA "“we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.” Yeah that.
I love this!
This is great. Thank you for fighting for transparency and fairness!
I'd pay your cab fare
Please take pics with your phone!
 thank you for fighting for us.  Proud to be a jersey girl! Go @CoryBooker!!
Thanks so much for your hard work on this, Senator. Sincerely, one of your constituents. 
Feels like we are living in a goddamn banana republic now. I hope the Banana Republican Party loses a lot of seats next year.
Thank you for your hard work, Senators!
It's probably where Nancy Pelosi hid it when she needed to pass it to know what was in it. Oh, I didn't get to keep my doctor,either. Thx
Go get them, guys!
Booker is gonna help his big pharma friends with it. Boot him at the next light.
They know where it is! Mitch is hiding it!!!
You cant Uber?
This is it @DNC no f*cking around! #findthebill #SavetheACA
Many thanks!
Way to go Dems!
Awesome.  Mahalo!!!!
Please post video of this
The 3 Stooges!
@RiseUpAbove @CoryBooker @ChrisMurphyCT Thanks senators for doing your job.
Happy hunting, Senator! Glad you guys are on the job.
Yes! You go, guys!
Thanks for all that you're doing, @SenBrianSchatz! Even when it's governmental Where's Waldo...
I like how their solution was so simple. CBO has the text, so we're going to the CBO to get a copy.
@SenBookerOffice is streaming it live on fb right now - you go, guys!
Go, guys, go!

Live tweet and film as much as you can. Get it on record. They can run, but they cannot hide forever.
Dream team
Look in the couch cushions.
Keep fighting for us! Thank you from all the people whose lives u will save!
Thank you! Go get 'em boys! 
Fight for us!! Bring a copy machine!!

@ChrisMurphyCT post video 
If it's there can you kill it before it's unleashed on the masses?  Asking for a friend.
 Good for y'all!!! Warriors on a mission, I like that.
you know you can take people off of your comments, right? i forget to do it often, but it's a nice feature. :)
Go on periscope or FB live. Need video to feed TV coverage
Awesome.  
THANK YOU!
It's some weird dimension treasure hunt. One where Biff is @POTUS
Pics!
I think I found a copy of the bill. Seems straightforward... @brianschatz
We need color blind GOP senators. Literally and figuratively.
Don't let up 
Thank you for doing your part, Senators!
GET IT!!! Then tweet it so the rest of us can see it!!
Hell, yeah!
Thank you!
Pelosi never turned tha ACA loose before a vote
the final bill was posted online for all to see 72 hours before the vote
No one told Murphy and Booker
You all couldn't car pool in one of your cars lol? Fb live it pls!
Please tell me one of you has a GoPro on and ready.  Love this!
Best of luck to you … #QuestForLegislation … & if your #quest is successful, please #ShowUsTheBill
No way!! You're actually in a car!! I thought it was a joke!
You should wear gps trackers so we faithful dems can folliw along.
Great. Keep us posted
Senator can I tag along
It's being streamed here: https://www.facebook.com/corybooker/videos/10156957967967228/ …
Make it bipartisan,  bring @RandPaul with you. He sure wanted to find the House version not to long ago.
Livestream please
You guys rock!
Careful, don't give them time to hear they should refuse you
I love this....
Omg this is amazing
Thank you! All @SenateDems, please fight for us, please join @ChrisMurphyCT and @brianschatz at CBO to find the mystery health bill.

Yes! Periscope it and put it live on Facebook!
Excellent. #FindTheBill

Where's Waldo?  Except in this version of the book he's nowhere to be found.
Good luck!!
