thank you as usual for sharing the facts for all to see! Bravo!
Stand strong for NJ!! #MedicareForAllCitizens # Healthcare=HumanRights
@CoryBooker why do you talk about being addicted to Bug Pharma cash.  Your an expert, Traitor!
Doomed If #Trump applies a low incorrect Medicaid factor to  basic living services at places such as Misericordia
When will this nonsense stop? The HC plan is degrading, insinuating children, elderly, disabled do not matter.
cuts to Medicaid while the costs to protect Trump on his trips to FL are really revealing, he doesn't care!
I see it now. I see it clear as day. If @SenSanders cannot make it and I really hope he does, I believe in Cory Booker! :)
I have been following Sen Cory Booker for a while + he shows one thing which amazes me in the US - intellect.
Disgusted GOP wants citizens to carry all the burden paying more for health while Trump and his neighbors save millions.
Is it not collusion when Trump called out @ rally for  putin to get Hillary's emails.  Then they arrived.  Whts diff /phone/tv/computer.
I thought Medicaid was just for people whom contributed into the program from our wages from working.
I think you are thinking of medicare.
- no he isn't.  Kids, lower income seniors & those temp disabled. I am disabled, I PAY for my own Medicare.
That was helpful, thank you. I already knew the difference, but not in such detail.

I agree 100%! The HC plan is gut wrenching. Unfathomable that our Govnt brought it forth. Tks for being steadfast !
OMG Cory, your head is so shiny! I bet you office can save so much money on electric bill if we properly utilize your head!
you could watch @WalkingDead_AMC and see their version of #AHCA which is a chest of aspirin!
@CoryBooker Thank you! Disabled children in military families also rely on medicaid, along w/Tricare. My son is one of them
Thank you for taking the time to truly care about our citizens and children welfare. Keep fighting the good fight.
wrong! I'm a RN that serves on Medicaid board!!!! Try again!
Fear monger much! Liar!
@CoryBooker ask the judge about Hobby lobby   Separation church and state
Thank you senator... but lose the sweater. They have a bad precedence... for democratic leaders. You need a @GQStyle guide
@CoryBooker Thank You for fighting for Medicaid for our country.
@CoryBooker It's sad that you have to explain why caring for the poor, disabled, and elderly is the right thing to do.
@CoryBooker thank you for explaining this. My son is on Medicaid with a disability! I am scared!
I can assure you my son's illness is not fraud! That would be a blessing!

@CoryBooker #rejectgorsuch
@LaVerneWright13 #medicare4all we already treat our ppl terrible, #GoPISStealing wealthiest country in world OMB you lie
Where is our country going. Let 's find that.
@CoryBooker tired of the D vs R work together for the people Obama care does not work
@CoryBooker , u lyin. Cutting and gutting are very different things. You are my senator and u must be ready for 2020.
@CoryBooker I respected you !!you are a poppet!so sad I thought you had a great future!My big mistake!
My mother worked 2-3 jobs until she was 80- needed Medicaid in the last few years only out of dire need.
@gjlos24 You make me proud to be a New Jersian
@CoryBooker bloat bloat bloat.  Calculate and implement a negative income tax.
@MarkWarner vote NO on AHCA...bad plan for everyone
@RepGwenMoore @RepRonKind @MaxineWaters @NancyPelosi @DarrellIssa vote NO on AHCA @SpeakerRyan is pushing #heartless plan
@SenFeinstein @alfranken @repjohnlewis @AustinScottGA08 @JacksonLeeTX18 @RepHensarling vote NO on AHCA...#heartless plan
thank you for the explanation...it's important for people to know if they're not directly affected, someone they know will
@CoryBooker I though that Obamacare is different from Medicaid? Isn't Obamacare being replace by new healthcare?
That is a great presentation Cory and its true. I'm behind you all the way
@CoryBooker I heard that medicaid will not be touch by the new healthcare. Did you lie?
Thank you Senator Booker for dispelling the myth that Medicaid is somehow welfare.
Sen Booker can you let #MarcoRubio know that close to 50% of children in #FL are on #Medicaid. He has children.
@CoryBooker you lying corporate sellout!!!!
@kikilala1 
@CoryBooker  Thank you so much Senator, for explaining how Medicaid benefits so many. We ARE better than this. Keep it up!
@CoryBooker Thanks for breaking it down for everyone!
BRAVO. Thank you Mr. Future President Booker!!
I think NJ needs to rethink the budget. A lot of money via taxes is going into NJ and the same old problems remain.
and why does companies like the port authority of NY and NJ do not extend medical coverage to employee's  stepchildren?
this makes me scared. My son is 10 has a medical disability and is on medicaid. Is it possible he would loose his coverage?
I agree. Trumpcare is a welfare program for the wealthy.
him into office he is not Obama he knows we have his back and will support him through rough time and good time
by the way he never named this plan at all cause you know it is not about him it is about the people that elect
hey cory you are trying to smear our POTUS but you know what we the people elected him no matter what you do!!!
@CoryBooker if people cared soo much  why are we still doing the same thing & expecting a different result
@CoryBooker I know its just ur dream, but can we all just be taken care of by govt? Responsibilities are not fair
they don't care
@CoryBooker Be accurate, its Disabled people mid-late 20's &under. Thanks for putting us 20 TRILLION in debt
Medicaid is primary source of funding for children with & more so adults with IDD's and VP celebrates special olympics  odd
@CoryBooker not even a finalized plan...we have to pass it to find out what's in it...
@CoryBooker All of American need Co-pay $20 Med-acid??????!!!
More Fear Mongering from a loser on the left!
@CoryBooker Thank you for creating this video & the one about prison detainee quota.
@CoryBooker NJ needs to talk to their congressional reps who are going to vote in block blindly w Trump
@CoryBooker how about you worry on voting for bills that allow importing of pharmaceuticals from neighboring countries.
@CoryBooker#Senator do it, Trump believes we're all talk# USA Senators stand up for all Americans#Not just billionaires
Thank you to my @CoreyBooker my senator in NJ
The Big problem is that it is a Republican Rich Trump Love Government and we as citizens no longer have a voice- #Hopeless
A voice is an illusion.. we the people.. dont get to decide how our "tax $$" are spent nor how much we pay
@CoryBooker it's so sad that as a nation we have come to this!
This gentleman embodies my hope for our future.  Intelligence. Compassion.  Ability to understand laws and protocols.
@CoryBooker thanks Senator. That was an exceptionally clear description of Medicaid & a great argument on why we shld save
@CoryBooker You sir voted against lower costing prescription drugs. You are talking out of both sides of your mouth.
Please tell me I can cast my ballot for you in the next Presidental election, please.
Thank you @CoryBooker I am one of your constituents living with and writing for those with #disabilities
@CoryBooker That you do to the least of my brothers....
@CoryBooker
@CoryBooker I agree however, we also need to fix Medicaid abuse to save $$!  Have many examples to offer
President2020?
@CoryBooker - 1 of the kids covered by NJ KidCare (Medicaid). Nat'l Honor Society, future Med School. Paying it forward.
Ryan Care.
@CoryBooker go get him cory!
@CoryBooker well said senator
@CoryBooker how about getting involved in legislation and working to craft a bill to replace Obamacare
@CoryBooker Well it's not working as is it's failing and no one has fixed it so you dropped the ball and others have to now
Senator, please explain how Fed funds help disabled children- and remind the @SpeakerRyan how he benefits from them.
he doesn't care! If it doesn't affect him, he simply doesn't care. No empathy, that man!!!
@CoryBooker  $1300/mo & $30k deductible for my family!  How will you help us? We cannot afford medicine
that is Obama care for you
@CoryBooker
The moment you knew @realDonaldTrump was going to be 180 degree change from Obama.
Obama played 306 rounds in 8 yrs.
@CoryBooker  Keep it up!!!
@CoryBooker No Medicaid,means most of America won't have insurance! FactJersey Shore,know the system 
oh you men that medicare covers ll those people that Obamacare was to cover!
Thank you for that video. Very clear, very impassioned, very true.
Liberals like Booker are cowards who think future generations should pay for our inability to deal with our own problems.
@CoryBooker Dems have no right to preach to Americans regarding HC. Just remember all of the lies used to sell Obamacare
Medicaid is for the truly needy not for able bodied freeloaders Obamacare is bankrupting Medicaid.
@CoryBooker Why don't you meet with Reps and try to come up with compromise? My deductible is 8k w/ Ocare & I can't afford.
stop spreading lies
more lies
@CoryBooker love your passion. Please help stop this man. He is dismantling our country.
ever think about what it will be like if the dollar hs no value world wide?
Senator, I agree with you about this. Could you explain why did you vote against lowering prescription drugs? It contradicts this.
I'd hate to find out that you'd be right about that. I support many of his positions, but that particular one kills me.
@CoryBooker No "can't" in your vocabulary #resist
@CoryBooker First of all:Fake statement. 2)It needs to be reduced!
@CoryBooker stop giving free care to illegals
I hope this guy never plans on running for president LOL
@CoryBooker RESIGN Fool
.@SenBookerOffice @CoryBooker #Trumpcare is for the wealthiest,it won't help children,seniors, families. Rather #savemedicaid than #MaraLago
@CoryBooker Why is no one highlighting the tax breaks for the wealthy? That's what this mess of a so-called plan is about.
what about the fact that individuals will recieve the same  tax breaks as corporation do now.
Even @Sen_JoeManchin is looking into single-payer now.
@CoryBooker really you would disagree with anything Republican!  So words are meaningless
@CoryBooker TY Sen Booker. You r one of the politicians that really do represent the people and their best interests.
Cory one date.  That is all I ask
@CoryBooker I love the enthusiasm! Plz consider calling it #republicare instead-- Ryan and co will happily sink trump
@CoryBooker Fake News. You should look into ICD 10 coding and take a course on medical billing.
Medicaid gives health care to millions. GOP doesn't care about those millions.
Your flag says it all. Go back to #faux and #infowars you low-information #sheeple. Dems gave insurance to even people like you.
@CoryBooker thank you for these
awesome video.  Informative and persuasive.
