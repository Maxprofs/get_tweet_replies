how about starting with allowing import of prescription drugs from Canada?
Get over yourself. Let's start with the people Booker is fighting for.
it sure ain't sick people
Your purist attitude is what got us into this mess.
Dems taking money and direction from the likes of Wall St and Big Pharma is what got us into this mess
That literally isn't why we are in this mess. I thank goddess every day for Dem's like Cory Booker. Grow up.
that was a nice defense of Bookers vote to withhold affordable meds from sick Americans
Again, not the issue 2day. But keep being an elitist about every damn vote and see how that helps others in need
Thank you for using your voice to fight for what's right! You and @ChelseaClinton are after my heart.  #DemLove
@shuggah21 no disrespect but didn't trump just reload the swamp with wall street? They destroyed the banking industry. Fact
who said anything about Trump? Booker is no champion of the people.
Stop spending tax payer time on adding and abetting illegal aliens that have a voice  for freedom in their homeland.
@CoryBooker You made all the points that I've been sharing with friends and family on this topic. TY for the strong voice!
@Jim_B60 I'm an immigrant. This country was built by immigrants and it's ridiculous to imagine America as anything else
Legal immigrants,  right. Plus greated vetted immigrants.  The world has changed.
@Nike has headlined a tag line #Equality to promote everyone matters. Certainly in America that should apply!
These families should have thought about the consequences when they knowingly entered & remained in the USA illegally!!
@HRCNJVolunteers Relax @SenBookerOffice To early to start campaigning for president. You need to #ImpeachTrump first.
@GetWisdomDude Cory, you are outstanding. Keep up the good work, the zealous fight against the ongoing atrocities.
So, my tax $$$ shud continue to support illegals who siphon resources intended for US citizens? Sorry but NO.
Thanks for speaking up for those of us smart enough to see that these illegals CHOSE to break the law!
@CoryBooker Thank you for this message.We need national leader to organize The Resistance. We are so strong together.Resist
Yes resist against demonstrations that destroy property, right?
@kathy12985 I demand America's ,Vets ,hungry and homeless 1st
@n8trlover need to be relentless on getting to the bottom of his ties to Russia.
Absolutely #TrumpRussia 
     Then start over with #NewElection
Deporting someone is like execution. It destroys lives, families, children. Stop all deportations. @pontifex @SenSchumer  @SenBookerOffice
families R not being torn apart by us!! If they want to stay together, take entire family!!
@Timmbarton123T Can't preach compassion when enslaved to Big Money and Corporate Elites. Dem Party needs to purge the greed
Thank you Sen. Booker. We need you to continue to speak up and speak out.
THANKS for making it SO EASY to #block U SAY hi to the others in my #TRumpTroll GULAG! >>@so_R_you @SenBookerOffice
@CoryBooker Muslims must be vetted
@RachelAzzara Got to be tough in today's chaotic world. What do you think?
Elections have consequences. You should have been fighting before we were crushed the last election.DNCdead
ok Cory what is your PLAN to deal with the ILLEGAL immigration. Also provide FACTS to accusations in this vid not bullshit
@Dar_Thatcher  If you believe in Democracy, America is da land of Immigrants, stand against trumps policies on immigration
Why? Immigrants must be throughly vetted. World has changed.
I demand that current laws be enforced & that Americans living in poverty be given priority over people who don't belong here. #ObeyTheLaw
@CoryBooker The president is right you are wrong
Alice, I just saw the documentary "Night Will Fall". Reminds me of what ppl like you & Trump do.
They do have voice. It is just not on our homeland. Their plight is with their Government not ours. USA 1st or quit
Thank you Cory Booker! American hero. Profile in Courage.
voiceless and vulnerable so when did you take up interest in the unborn? Or are you selectively grandstanding again?
Indeed, @GOP Congress condoning outlandish behavior against peaceful families is depicable & bad for nation.
@dmspeech you're a good man with great courage and integrity!
We demand a @DNC @SenBookerOffice  that listens to the people that you want our votes 2018
2020 is not too far off!  "President Booker" sounds amazing, doesn't it?
Democracy must defeat Trump before Trump destroys democracy
@CoryBooker hey how about you worry about enforcing our laws instead of hurting people feelings
@CoryBooker 
Cory Booker is way to left to be an asset.  Get ride of him.
Seems EVERYBODY is being voiced drowned by the Trump Team ruining America for the 1st time. Yes you know it
Aren't you the guy that lied to the American people about the quality of Canadian pharmaceuticals?
@CoryBooker Amen and hope you will be our next Potus....we love you!
What's the matter, Booker, not getting enough MSM Camera in ur face, so U make a personal vid? So sick of Ur Hypocrisy
My Senator is Ted Cruz, Texas gov already fining sanctuary cities. They do not care. I'll keep calling and emailing l!
@RitaDentino
I demand compassion & Truth. I demand your Truth Senator. Will u help the Dems rid themselves of corporate hacks?
You have the ear of the two people closest to PotUS.  A little pressure from you maybe?
compassion for all vulnerable human beings
Well said Cory Booker.  Trump is on a rampage, flexing his muscles & acting like he knows what the U.S. needs. Wrong Trump!
An plans to break more Unions
I hope that you are getting your ducks in a row for your run in 2020 Cory Booker- smells like the future (street fight)
Corey; Why did you say Canadian drugs aren't safe for Americans when Canadians aren't dying from them?
you're our only hope in the Democratic party. God bless your soul for being outspoken about this crazy Immigration policy!♡
If the issue is documentation, then document them and fix the policy that all other prez's failed to do to date!
Thank you, Cory Booker
NPR said the new rules - if you previously committed crime, are accused, or they just THINK you did. That is UNAMERICAN.
@janedmunds 4. to immigrants and their plight.
@janedmunds 3. side with the fascist policies of Trump, as opposed to adopting the teachings of Jesus himself, with regard
@janedmunds 2. immigration. Might we add that it's disturbing & extremely disheartening to see so many so-called Christians
@janedmunds 1. We stand in solidarity w/ you, as we too believe there needs to be a more compassionate approach to
NOOO!!!
@MoveOn so where in the constitution dies it say to pick & chose which laws to enforce & which ones we can ignore?
Save it. You are in big pharma pocket.
I agree that he is.  But, his voice matters when it comes to immigration matters
Free TOOLS FOR RESISTANCE:
@SusanHathcock1 
And all need to go home and stop being chicken shits and fight for their own home and freedom!
Thanks for your compassionate voice!  Will share this!
Nicely said. Thank you!
stop voting to help big pharma and I might listen to you
.@SenBookerOffice we've got twitter - need you to say this on the floor of the senate
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=491735811215194&id=100011363399197 …
How about awareness about where our tax dollars are going? Footing the bill for services to illegals while they send out $$
You sound like our president that we are celebrating today. I miss you @BarackObama  & @MichelleObama !
@liv2cr8t. Empathy!  US policy has been beyond empathetic for past 30 years. Undocumented? Go get documented & come back!!
Why do i drop way down the list when I'm the most recent comment? BTW- These raids have been occuring for years
get on record that @realDonaldTrump "policy" terrorized some #refugee into #LosingFingers http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/news/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/i-knew-trump-was-going-to-deport-me-losing-hope-in-u-s-migrants-make-icy-crossing-to-canada&pubdate=2017-02-11 …
Glad you're speaking out, but you also should have voted for the cheaper pharmaceuticals.  You let people down....
Thank you, Cory!! Time to make some calls. Time for a nationwide protest for immigrants even bigger than the Women's March
from My side of the wall sounds like what happened to the Jewish people in Europe, sad!
@jlmrbk stand for the voiceless, y'all shod be standing up for an Omega Mullet comeback! #takemehome #returntothering
@CoryBooker I think Trump is a lunatic. GOP doesn't care what we think. I feel like we're toast.
@MoveOn The voiceless?  You mean unborn children?!?!
I commend your firm stance on this issue.  Let us know specifically what, when and how we can help stop this.
Stop telling 1/2 truths to meet your narrative. Americans deserve better. Didn't work for Dems in past Elctns

same policy Obama had. The dif is Trump is putting the Children sent alone to the bottom for later cnsideration
@MoveOn Resist Soros
disappointed u voted against affordable prescription drugs u must stand w workers on ALL votes not just convenince
MY safety is a civil right. Do not think for a moment that I consider illegals "vulnerable." @senbookeroffice
A powerful statement on how new immigration enforcement actually makes us LESS safe by driving people into shadows.
If they came here illegally, they are criminals.  #ROUNDTHEMUP and #SENDTHEMBACK
@MoveOn you should have signed that RX bill but you are worried about donors for 2020. FOOL
You're a corporate Democrat, sad but true.
I'm all for being humanitarian, but Congress has failed to do its job and this is the result! #DoYourDamnJob @Potus
are you a part of OFA too?
, Thank you. A reminder of why you are one of my favorite pols! Keep speaking out.
This is great Mr. Booker & I agree. But we are not forgetting you sided with big pharma. Not ever.
@puppymnkey Ground game & much more effective PR necessary now. Stop talking & get on with it. Millions of us r marching!
@puppymnkey Amen! Preach that truth!!!
@puppymnkey @Tufftruth Stop talking and do something!  We're getting disgusted!
I wish you had not sold out to big pharma. Had high hopes for you. Please redeem yourself! We need someone sane
@kathy12985 scarry times for the worlds vulnerable. Showing compassion is what got us to where we are.
please investigate trumps Russia issues. He's probably being blackmailed
Please stop ice from doing raids
@pathe48 I agree and support your message. I appreciate that you don't make personal attacks w/your remarks.
I'd like to know how many undocumented immigrants work in TRUMP HOTELS most likely w/fake social security numbers
Feeling hopeless. 
Help us in Georgia win the senate seat send the DNC reps to Ga and to every State that will be holding elect.
I'm listening, please don't leave us. We're worried about our country and the meaness that's taking over. Stick together!!
@CoryBooker maybe you don't follow laws sir and that's fine. You live is full of choices and consequences. Chose wisely.
@CoryBooker I'm tired of the double standard by people like you. It's against the law!! There's a reason we have laws!!!
@CoryBooker no one made them come. I have to follow laws or lose my green card and be deported. Illegal is illegal.
@CoryBooker I came here legally. If you make a choice as a parent to illegally bring your child that's your choice.
@CoryBooker this President is trying to protect theU.S.The previous one was all about destabilising the U.S. As are you.
locking our borders is not the way to protect us.. isolation will make us a target..
controlling WHO comes in to the U S is a great Security strategy and will save the taxpayers
you will never understand. It is NEVER that simple
You are right it is more complicated than that,but  securing who comes in is one component .
we already have a complex, complicated process, the next step is isolation. Pls study!
@CoryBooker  I am more okay with a compassionate legal policy, but it is the illegal immigration which is the problem.
@carolannblank Yes. Keep standing up and fight for our sovereignty, our lands, and all who seek shelter in our country
, thanks, because I am not used to the level of hate being thrown around so "virtuously" these days. @SenBookerOffice
Sadly I've been a hate target 4 a long time. Stand proud & just last one day longer than the other bastard
This is where the privileged contribute to the civil rights discourse in true and (hopefully) meaningful ways.
We must always stand up for and with those without privilege and share our power
@CoryBooker  "Illegal" immigrants have killed Americans. Where is your compassion for them. Protect Americans!!  2020 NOT
; Thank you for speaking out as this policy is a disaster for our country but then again so is this president & his Admin..
shut up! Sell out
@CoryBooker we want immigration laws update I don't want Open borders or illegal immigrants in my country
Cory, how about a policy that works to solve the intercity madness created by the Dems!
@mfrost11 How about the voiceless & vulnerable who can't afford prescription drugs?
Nice words, now if only I believed your hypocrisy.  Speaking for the poor voting against affordable drugs. Actions matter!
@skennison wow, Cory, you sound like trump with your listening to the FORGOTTEN.
When 1 in 20 workers are undocumented, wages are depressed for entire working class. Whose side are you on? @RepHuffman
Dear Sir, I support you 100%.My husband legal perm resident and we are scared! We need to establish network to block ICE
You disdain hardworking Americans, demanding they continue in unfair competition with exploitable illegal immigrants.
@Sunnysgrl62 Underground Railroad, if the Danes could smuggle 7000 Jews to safety,let's do this.
You sir, are an American Hero
I demand ZERO exploitable, wage-depressing illegal immigrants in America. If u don't like Trump's plan, pass urs. DO IT!!!
will only RT if US Senate will stand up and start impeachment procedings against @potus. Hold him accountable or go home.
thank you for your encouragement.
@CoryBooker Here the people Cory. America 1st!!!
Stay strong, be honeat and don't BS or sugar coat things. Know there are games to play just try not to get too caught up.
@SenatorMenendez Please help the FEC & fighter Voter Suppression/Gerrymandering. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/opinion/dysfunction-and-deadlock-at-the-federal-election-commission.html?ref=todayspaper …
Somebody tell this fool to shut up, he is not trust worthy as a peoples representative !
Thank You!
Anyone who is Irish-American should relate to this. To Trumps of the 1850s, Irish Catholic refugees were the target.

is there a legal option to fight this
my senators in Illinois are on this as we have asked them but we need more
agree and it breaks my heart to see this what can we do to help?
@harleygirl64200 sure
@CoryBooker
BUT WHY CAN'T WE SHARE THE SPACE OF THE USA ?
Voted against importing RX meds from Canada and praises Betsy DeVos. You suck! @WineDiverGirl This guy's a no-good phoney
IMMIGRATE WERE blamed FOR BRINGING  DRUGS IN  !
WHY CAN'T WE SHARE
we can they just need to be legal and pay taxes and so on. Why is this so hard?
@CoryBooker I'd rather demand a more compassionate health care system.
@MissVanessaF I mean im all for people coming over here to have a better life but theres rules to go and doing that
@MissVanessaF i understand these immigrants came here for a better life but there are rules to being an american
2020
@TheDailyEdge Sen. Booker-We DEMAND the Democrats start FIGHTING! Enough of the weak rhetoric! Their silence is WEAKNESS!!
@CoryBooker Was it compassion that moved you to vote against access to cheaper drugs? Or the $200k+ from big pharm? Jackass
we must be decent and do the right thing now. Targeting the "least"in our society right now is just a means to a larger end
@marstu67 I am #TheResistance
when do they get Friday's Comey briefing?
@MitchFurman -Cory you need to fix your cities because you know you gonna put the refugees in the ghetto.
You make me proud to be an American &, most of all, a New Jerseyan!  #JerseyGirl #ResistTrump #RefugeesWelcome #notrump
Yes for Compassion
we can't be silent. We each must do as much as we can to fight harm from evil and protect those who can't.

thank you for standing for all of us because all Americans are #immigrants
@CoryBooker Your words are inspirational. We MUST stand up to hatred and bigotry! The soul of our nation depends on this!
Thank you Sen Booker.
@igob4u2 scary guy. But from a seer point of view you will never be close to what u truly are seeking here between lines.
@CoryBooker  You have your terms incorrect. Immigrants are legal, illegal aliens are not legal.  Enforce the law!
@letat_lechat Getting rid of Rump, McConnell, Ryan,Bannon, Gorsuch would help a LOT
Thank you 4 this message.These mass deportations must stop.Families & ethno/racial communities torn apart w/out due process
I will call my senators tomorrow. I am already on a list to go and protect immigrants that ICE is trying to arrest.
Thank you so much for your kindness and compassion.
@cgallegos3 I demand an immigration policy that shot the damn foreigners as soon as they started building
these can be trying times. But don't get discouraged. You're doing a great job!
Compassion for their plight is admirable, but that's no excuse for not holding someone accountable for their actions.
This is the core of what tge United States of America stood for, from the very beginning.
sets a high standards in due process. Lower the bar and it is a  to the bottom. Resist, insist on due process.
I'm fine with removing immigrants that are criminals. I'd also like to see hate groups removed for making us less safe too!
illegal aliens know they are in violation of law they expect deportation, stop giving them false hope
Cory Booker
2018
Let's face it......
IF he makes it that long you still gotta be ready. With a voice of sanity
Calm
@CoryBooker i demand you shut up!
