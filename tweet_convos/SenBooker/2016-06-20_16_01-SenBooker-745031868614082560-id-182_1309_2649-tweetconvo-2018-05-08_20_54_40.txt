Respectfully, I with those in the government would put the same energy into defeating terrorism
This country is waking up to the fact that MORE LAWS, do not stop criminals. Too bad Dems want to destroy the US Const. !
We Know! We see the inroads for Socialism you have made through Indoctrination in Education!
man, if we could only get this kind of passion out of you about the sanctity of life
Really did you introduce a bill to help out Chicago?#NeedAdultSupervision
.@ChrisMurphyCT @becison58
@Doctor_Vic The cowardly GOP has struck a cord!  They have unleashed a boulder!  They shall be crushed!
#CommonSenseGunLaws #UnitedStates
just keep lying like your party does. How about reading the constitution for once in your life.
@PC0101 ...and those speaking out are supported by millions around the world :)
And millions know that you are a fool, liar, hypocrite and ill-equipped to be a leader.
Thanks idiot, for the exponential guns sales chart.
Thank you for Daring Greatly. You speak for the majority of us.
Orlando shooter Mateen was INTERVIEWED 3x by the FBI? Boston Marathon bombers too. What did FBI miss? Why ? Inquire please.
They are speaking out against cons like you! They are saying enough is enough with you politicizing tragedies to push agendas
fyi.. Killing people is against the law. But peeps still do it. Strict gun laws affect law abiding peeps. Not criminals
funny shit have you seen gun sales in last week? #dumbass
Provide laws we cant/won't enforce? How about we hold people accountable for their actions and stop blaming inanimate objects
@kathleenwattle: $ of NRA bribes more important than nearly 90% Americans=time dump GOP Nov=zip work 1/3 yr+on Vaca soon>Sept
The country is rising up to the Constitution.  Only Democrats are "rising up" to shred the Constitution.  We're not the USSA!
but you obviously have no problem trying to silence gun owners.
If you mean speaking out in the form of record gun sales, they yeah. Let's go with that.
no it's not.  It's demanding a sealed border & enforcement of our laws
@HlLLARY Thank you for the work you have done, sir. Don't give up; this is too big an issue to be ignored by the GOP/NRA.
in November we will scream!
next time you're on the floor ask to remove metal detectors and cut out  security for the capitol bldg see how they vote then
There are millions more of us that demand we keep our #GunRights! @NRA @realDonaldTrump #BadGuysDontFollowLaws #2A #tcot
@RealLucasNeff lets fucking hope so! The rest of the world is watching, jaws on the floor...
The Republican's r a total disgrace. We must push 4 EVERYONE to get out n vote in November n take back our house. #democrat
@KristinDavis keep fighting America we did it in Australia you have our support
@boxercrew all seats up for grabs better go blue in November. We will accept nothing less! Boots on the ground! #imwithher
@mushroomfeet and who's going to follow the laws in your utopia? the people responsible for 1700 Chicago shootings in 2016?
Not in the mood for your silly rhetoric. Goodnight sir!  #BLOCKED BTW Walter, I blocked you, not the Senator! @ChrisMurphyCT
@HappyOldSoul and we will vote! Thank you Sen Murphy for all your work!
With all due respect & much appreciation, #REPUBS and #DEMS prefer #moneybeforelives. Please keep fighting 4 us! @TwinmomSue
And the NRA will not be silencered!
You have enough laws on the books, try enforcing them before you put useless laws on the books that terrorist ignore! #2A
you can't make us safer with more pieces of paper. We have #enough laws. So many you cannot enforce them all.
Maybe you shouldn't admit on national TV that your proposals would not have stopped a single tragedy.
@helenmag What you do is greatly appreciated by millions of Americans #DisarmHate 
why don't U stop  I'm a hero BS & do some real wrk! Find , stop those actually doing the killings. Hint: it's not the s
Vote them Out! #DisarmHate #ImWithHer
@Clarknt67 Your strong, principled leadership is much appreciated, Senator.
With a Republican Senate feeding on NRA money we'll never get common sense gun laws. #EnoughIsEnough #EnoughGunViolence
keep fighting...PLEASE!!
WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. Thank you!!!!
nothing proposed would have accomplished a damn thing... just another Democrat pre-election Kabuki show... attacking the #2A
thank you for your work on gun control issues.
first round Chris .we  all will be back to Stand up with u Chris
Quit whining and do something about immigration, PC law enforcement and Islamic terrorists and leave the rest of us alone.
We have to vote them out, and retake the Senate.
@KristinDavis today Americans demanded due process. You voted against.
Weren't we silenced today??? Reprehensible.
@Bradybuzz Thank you for your leadership Sen. Murphy. We are with you and will keep fighting for gun laws that keep us safer.
anti constitutional grandstanding
Your continued illogical threats strike fear in women/men raising children on their own & elderly on own. Its repeat bullying
Time for another filibuster sir!
yes, but filibuster at home !
There is more than your side Senator they're Millions of Americans who hold differing views than yours. #Guncontrol #GunSnese
@TUSK81 Murph for VP? @HillaryClinton
When u start labeling people who don't agree with your fucking bill #ISIS supporters, like me, a Fucking Veteran, go 2 hell
No @ChrisMurphyCT. I will not surrender my self defense rights just because another registered democrat who hates my liberty murdered again.
so is that it Do we try again after the next mass shooting How many more have to die We can now hold this senate responsible.
thank you for the work your doing, it's a sad day when our government doesn't put the safety of the people first.
I left CT because of your bias against legal gun owners like myself! First thing I did was buy 30 round magazines for my AR!
That's right. Join us & follow @MomsDemand & @Everytown 3.5 million supporters and growing. #Enough
filibuster again. And don't stop.
Sorry couldn't hear you over the sound of all the money the NRA is buying your colleagues off with.
I hope all those disgusted Americans remember this moment in November.
shut up it was obvious to everyone watching you on television you couldn't make a single valid point
Thank you. You do our alma mater proud.
you are doing a great job.
thank you!!
Thank you for all you are doing.  KEEP UP THE FIGHT! #NEVERTRUMP
@SenatorDurbin We need to turn our focus to winning back #Congress and getting rid of @SenateGOP #VoteThemOut2016 #DisarmHate
the 100,000,000 gun owners won't be silenced either. Try fixing your state first.
@TUSK81 
The GOP controlled Senate just shushed the American people, the NRA holds the power
you can blame your girl @HillaryClinton for selling weapons to ISIS, not the NRA, you should resign
And you won't silence the other side Sugar Britches
at least you know what's right- vote out NRa!
thank you for trying.
dems in both houses shpuld attach gun control amendments to EVERY BILL.  Make them vote em down every single day. Every. Day.
Keep fighting!!
Please don't stop, Senator. Thank you for your efforts.
.@ChrisMurphyCT
@SenBookerOffice Yet you still won't tell what you are doing about the criminals...
that 90% common core math doesn't work. #2A #HandsOffMyGun #NRA #SayNo2MoreGunControl
no it's not.
How about taking on America's real enemy, #RadicalIslamicTerrorism. Not law-abiding, #2A loving Patriots.
so check out Cornyn's proposal.  Way more 'common sense'.
Thank you for fighting! Don't give up! Keep going!
.@ChrisMurphyCT Thank you for your efforts!
The only ones rising up are professional politicians and paid #astroturf.  #2A
The Republicans blocked every measure what now?
Thank you for your efforts!
@MomsRising NO..until this administration learn how to tell the truth... NO.. we have good gun laws...
We know it will pass one day. It's just shameful to witness rn. #wewillremember
maybe we should also consider laws that regulate how lobbyists contribute to our democratic process.
As long as republicans hold both houses they can
.@ChrisMurphyCT  Thank you for what you're doing. You're right. We will not be silenced. #OrlandoUnited
thank you for trying to keep America safer, we will remember those who voted no for #guncontrol  #DisarmHate
thank you for being a voice to what most americans want.
thank you for your efforts though
why is this so difficult and against what we the dans people want ?
Thank you Chris
Tonight's votes by YOU show that you are a phony and are not serious about dealing with guns. http://connecticutcomments.blogspot.com/2016/06/another-purely-political-moment-from.html …
I tried to do my part in contacting @ChuckGrassley  and @SenJoniErnst , et al. Obv they don't care about constituents
Please keep speaking up for the American people! The Senate needs to stop siding with terrorist-enabling NRA against citizens
Chris Murphy your pandering ass has officially become a politician.
keep fighting!
#standwithChris!!
thank u for your tireless work. because of voices like yours, things will change. they can't keep us quiet forever.
#NRAmurderers

Thank you for fighting for us! #WeWillRememberInNovember those who fought for us and not for the @NRA!
when are you going to fight for your constitutional rights as a Senator and end majority party control of the legislature.
I agree
Thank you sir for trying so hard, I have nothing be respect and appreciation for you and your efforts. Please don’t stop.
Mate, you and I both know the US govt doesn't give a damn which policies regular Americans want. As evidenced today.
stop your lying
thank you. Please keep fighting. What you're doing is so important and we need more gun control. Why would they vote it down?
literally did I ask you.
the person sb aware of which senators voted NO for future elections

this is outrageous. We need all of their names.
