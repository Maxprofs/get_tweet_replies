@smidge001 No! He brought more light to them in his attempt to silence!!!!
Thank you @SenBookerOffice for yielding to @SenJeffMerkley to support @SenWarren & the important words of #CorettaScottKing & #Justice
This is not the America in which I was taught to believe.It has been usurped by those who believe in tyranny. 1)
Disgraceful using Ms. King as a reason to oppose Sessions. YOU don't have anything so you go back to 1986?
It's funny how you omitted kings quote about Reagan.
"first they take away the meaning, then they take the words" George Orwell 1984
it was easy for @gop mcconnell to silence a woman since #republicans hate women who speak up.
well what in the hell are y'all gonna do about it?? Why continue allowing GOP to ride roughshod over the floor??
because the GOP won the PEOPLES vote! Get over it or is the Dems gonna cry for 8 years!?
why the fuck did you put people in caps, did you attend Trump tweet university?
back off
And what are. You guys going to do about it ? RESIST
But talking about Ted Kennedy was OK. The men shut up a woman who was quoting a woman.
..our fragile republic, which needs to be cared for by its people, whom it is designed to serve and protect,3)
A certain type of man measures his power in terms of how effectively he can suppress the rights of women.
..all people,&to welcome others who wish to share in our bounty,because we enrich each other, so let us bless 4)
Rules just enforced - of course rules don't matter to liberals! Disgusting behavior!
. @SenateMajLdr arguably committed treason by blocking bipartisan investigation in2 russian hacking in election
DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH!!
I see racial undertones coming out here ....you need to act like anelected public official
Direct discrimination being acted loud and proud on the Senate and House floors. Sadder day in America!
@SenateMajLdr is part of the New World Order, He is The White American Taliban and a White Nationalist.
Special thanks to you and Senator Merkley. This is going to be a four year battle and there is no way around it.
well that makes McConnell's judgment seem suspect, as well.
This will be a watershed moment, fight for your rights or you will lose them No Retreat No Compromise No Surrender

Hey Cory, Guess what. He is getting in and all your rhetoric can't stop it...LOL
Welcome to Trumps America; Hate intolerance, lies and xenophobia rule..
..so brilliantly designed so many years ago.
..each other,give thanks for our country,bless these United States of America, &uphold that which the Founders5)
.. obstruction again, to prevent evil perpetrators again, to prevent those who would attempt to overthrow our3)
..The voices of a few will prevail,as they did so many years ago,but the ? is what do we do to prevent such 2)
WOW, SenateMajLdr opened up that one can of worms by throwing a Molotov cocktail at the memory of MLK
#resist
thank you for doing what's right. Let this administration know they can not bully you or the people u fight for
@wtf_imtooold @SenWarren FEMs represent millions more Americans-act like it! Stand up and fight
@RealGDT @SenWarren I hate that McConnell represents my state.
@RealGDT @SenWarren he silenced civil rights.
@what2hell @SenWarren Huh...bet America didnt realize Republicans were rascist as f^ck. Whole lot more is going to come out
@lizpierce15 @SenWarren   The GOP wants to silence  anyone that's not a REPROBATE republican
great move McConnell and now the entire nation will be talking tomorrow about sessions racist views
hey McConnell thanks for making our point that's sessions is a racist and can't tolerate King's letter
I hope you read the letter during your time too and all the rest of the Democratic senators.
He also silenced warren. I would like to see a male colleague to read it to ease my mind on that point.
@Che_Wua @SenWarren Ted Cruz  wasn't silenced.#letlizspeak  
He had great temerity; yet, Warren's statements and Mrs. King's letter will be a "shot heard round the world!"
Standing with you!
@frankhowell7911 @SenWarren  That's exactly what he did,
.@SenBookerOffice I support you 200%. Don't back down. #NoOnSessions
@cygiant @SenWarren Yes!  Doesn't a senator have the right to say something negative when it's true? She speaks for voters.
The GOP has no respect any longer. I don't even know what country I live in. It's absolutely disgusting
@WWhitness @SenWarren READ THE LETTER.
"They are going to hear from us" (Leonard Cohen)
@YNB @SenWarren let's not forget this is the same Senate where Ted Cruz read Green Eggs & Ham. Shame! #LetLizSpeak
please keep trying for the American people!  Thank you
.@SenBookerOffice : can another senator read that letter?
you know , it would be really nice if y'all would go ahead and confirm POTUS' cabinet so we can #Maga! Thx 
Written like a true automaton. Not ONE of POTUS's picks are in the least bit palatable. Answer is NO!
can we pls turn up voter turnout in Kentucky and vote him out
so I guess you don't like Harry Reid 's rules now that they benefit the other side?  Poor snowflake.
Surprised???
#LetLizSpeak
MItch McConnell's actions this evening are DESPICABLE! He is REPUGNANT!
@SenateGOP every speaker needs to try to get that letter read on floor! The optics of those objections are awful
despicable man that sessions. @JeffFlake @SenJeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain
Every Dem Sen should read the letter on the floor. Make Mitch rule 19 all night!
as I said before little boy/girl running little cory's office twitter u need to get @CoryBooker to @Richzeoli show,SCARED?
you have Senate rules for conduct and Warren failed to follow one of them.
@SenateMajLdr Senator Warren & Coretta Scott King will not b silenced. Donating $$ 2 Sen Warren & NAACP
@NemojZezat @SenWarren Senator stand up and make your presence count! #timetoact
when they go low we go high! #supportingyousupportingus  #letlizspeak #thankyou #keepfighting
@GOP @SenateMajLdr. We need to shut down McConnell. Drain the entire swamp #MitchtheFascist
And all of us, but we won't be silenced. @SenateMajLdr should know that by now.
They cant silence all of you. Please, every dem Senator needs to speak for her & us, continue it #letlizspeak
Their words will b heard. Donating to Senator Warren & NAACP
.@SenBookerOffice @SenWarren Stand up to this! Read the letter for her! Every one of you!
Devos? If it look like a Shill, talks like a Shill, it is a SHILL. #sellout
@senwarren@dacullington.Is Mitch McConnell a racist? When you spoke against Sessions,you made history.Did u violate rule 19
We will not be silenced! #resist
And 50 @SenateGOP voted to sustain this horrific racist action by @SenateMajLdr
Lots of old white men showing who they are.  It's makes the rest of us know we are better.
VERY painful to watch this. I'm incredibly disappointed with these petty, deplorable men. #Resist
Incredible abuse of power!! McConnell needs to be thrown out of office!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott It is past time for you to stand up for civil rights and freedom of speech.
This is unconscionable! And this is not democracy.
