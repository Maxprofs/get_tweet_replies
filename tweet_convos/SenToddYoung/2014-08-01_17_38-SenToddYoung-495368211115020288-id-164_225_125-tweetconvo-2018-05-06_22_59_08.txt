@SpeakerBoehner Pass the voice!!! The house republicans just voted to be bury by the Hispanic vote in 2016.
@JorgeDe36371120 @SpeakerBoehner you mean all the illegals the democrat want to let in? Or the ones already here illegally?
@deojr1965 @SpeakerBoehner No idiot, the 16 million of us which are Citizens and will vote.
@JorgeDe36371120 @SpeakerBoehner are you even legal?
@deojr1965 @SpeakerBoehner Get educated 5 of every 6 of us, Hispanics are either American Citizens or legal residents.
@JorgeDe36371120 @SpeakerBoehner just take a look at the jail and prison populations.
@deojr1965 @SpeakerBoehner Bring the numbers. You are clueless about this issue.
@JorgeDe36371120 @SpeakerBoehner http://washingtonexaminer.com/...illegals-sent …...
@SpeakerBoehner the second bill is all that matters. Stop the lawless president.
@MinneMike @SpeakerBoehner Haha none of this two bills matter at all. The Senate won't pass it and Obama won't sign it.
@JorgeDe36371120 @SpeakerBoehner it does matter. It will be weight heavily when BO tries issuing his EO
@MinneMike @SpeakerBoehner Very unlikely.
@JorgeDe36371120 @SpeakerBoehner obviously, you wouldn’t know. Take a seat
@MinneMike @SpeakerBoehner On the contrary. Now the pro reform pressure is going to be so big that BO will have to act, he like it or not.
@SpeakerBoehner No, you didn't. You voted for less money and no way to actually fix the problem. You are a failure in every way.
@rockytech @SpeakerBoehner fix it by sending all the illegals back and build a wall. Quit allowing them to break the laws of America stupid!
@deojr1965 @SpeakerBoehner Most illegals use a green card and just stay. A fence will not help for these types of illegals.
@SpeakerBoehner Liar. You mixed the dream act in with it knowiing  it won't pass the Senate nor ever be supported by POTUS. Smoke & mirrors.
@LoriCrews @SpeakerBoehner BOEHNER is a drunken thug who lies at the feet of billionaires. His entire clan are drunks.
@WintropeMtheIII @LoriCrews @SpeakerBoehner let's talk about the lame duck fund raising president. That all he is good for. Oh and golfing
.@SpeakerBoehner YOU ARE THE BIGGEST FAKES & FRAUDS & SHOULD ALL BE IN PRISON if there were any JUSTICE. #DISGRACE
@SpeakerBoehner The GOP No Longer Listen To The People They Listen To The Tea Party Cruz. We Will Be VOTING You OUT
@hotzgeor @SpeakerBoehner Cruz part was getting all the money in Perrys hands to distribute & get Repub to screw themselves & it did.
@SpeakerBoehner fuck you GOP
@SpeakerBoehner @SemperFiCop  What "End the Humanitarian Crisis" mean, exactly? And YES, COMPLETELY SECURE BORDER FIRST!!!
@SpeakerBoehner you can't do both. If you shut out the rest of the world you ignore the crises not fix it. We are not stupid.
@SpeakerBoehner You are a liar moon face.  Why don't you cry for us
@SpeakerBoehner lier, traitor For my President Obama!
@SpeakerBoehner After a republican block of the bill. What, you finally drunk enough?
@godlessRachel @SpeakerBoehner Maybe but what got it thru is it is finally cruel enough & puts cash in gov perry's hands, why cruz involved
@SpeakerBoehner @SemperFiCop What's the catch ?
@SpeakerBoehner .@OFA House bill is reprehensible & will exacerbate humanitarian crisis. Should have passed the Senate #CIR bill ages ago!
@SpeakerBoehner THANK YOU CONGRESSMAN!!! We have been so very worried & are rejoicing here!
@SpeakerBoehner @MathewsJeanne No, this was aid (admirable). #TeaParty MADE you support states. How will this STOP infiltrators & usurpers?
MT @SpeakerBoehner: RT to share the news: The House just voted to [deport fucken errrrrrbody]
@DiAnnaHardesty1 @pnerrad @SpeakerBoehner Are you a native american saying that or did your ancestors come as unwanted immig too?
@SpeakerBoehner. Huh? What do you mean "end the humanitarian crisis."?
@SpeakerBoehner It's nice to get this bill passed just in time for Congress to leave and no vote in the SENATE! Good work over there!
@star93022 @SpeakerBoehner bogus bill...look what you hid in it... @SpeakerBoehner u can't lead,@leader is in the WH
@schwaid @star93022 @SpeakerBoehner @leader AMERICA is not as DUMB as the Drunk Boehner thinks, nor will they be fooled, again.

@IanJannetta @SpeakerBoehner Can't tell but sort of looks like a screen grab from @TheSims

@SpeakerBoehner Yoy are an embarrassment to Ohio.
@godlessRachel @SpeakerBoehner yes he is I Agree

@SpeakerBoehner @RepLarryBucshon http://www.witnessforpeace.org/downloads/Fact%20Sheet_Unjust%20Trade%20and%20Forced%20Migration_2010.pdf …
@SpeakerBoehner Perfect! Thank you from the bottom of hearts. These bills that passed make sense for everyone.
@SpeakerBoehner The PROBLEM is Republicans that pull stunts instead of work with the PRESIDENT to solve America's problem.
@SpeakerBoehner 
Good first step.

Now reverse everything obuma has started, and replace all officials who been in DC prior to the internet
@SpeakerBoehner The house just passed a border bill loaded with spite and hate that no decent human being would approve, nice work John.
@SpeakerBoehner Boehner tries to mislead Americans, the border is secure, no one sneaking thru, kids are walking up to the guards. Hypocrite
@SpeakerBoehner 
John Boehner, hang your head in shame. Anything to get mid term election votes.
@SpeakerBoehner If fridays gop only created border bill passed by gop majority is your idea of the 21st century once again gop on wrong side
@SpeakerBoehner Your bill is a sick joke.  You accuse POTUS of being AWOL as you take off for a month, having accomplished nothing.
@SpeakerBoehner and you voted to end DACA you heartless asshole! #latism
TYMT @SpeakerBoehner House vote #SecureTheBorder end #BorderCrisis  http://www.aol.com/article/2014/08/01/house-oks-bill-to-address-border-crisis/20940872/ … @cspanwj @SenatorReid @vj44

@SpeakerBoehner You didn't do shit and you know it.  How in the fuck do you look in the mirror and not see the lying drunk fool we do?
@SpeakerBoehner OMG Boehner, do u think the American people believe U, I think NOT.  Last minute trashing bills.  U did it again.
@SpeakerBoehner http://www.theremembranceproject.org 
@SpeakerBoehner Thank you for acting on the wishes of American tax payers. Its the first glimmer of hope I've had since this insanity began!
@SpeakerBoehner There is no vote worth the damage amnesty will do to our nation and our ppl.
@SpeakerBoehner Any Republican that backs Amnesty will be signing their walking papers, and yes, we track it.
@SpeakerBoehner YOU ARE EVIL. MAY GOD BLESS THE CHILDREN THAT YOU WANT TO TORMENT AND PUNISH. SHAME ON YOU !
@SpeakerBoehner You're kidding right? #SpeakerCruz
@SpeakerBoehner John Boehner: Legislative Trail of Failure.
@SpeakerBoehner ...THANK YOU GOP!
@SpeakerBoehner What An Cruz Ass Kisser This Was All A Show & A Wast Of Tax$$ These Bills Are DOA Just Like The GOP
@SpeakerBoehner If only We the People could sue the House for breach of contract. We are paying you to do absolutely nothing.
@SpeakerBoehner @SpreadButter For some reason I'm highly skeptical.
@Weelittlefishy @SpeakerBoehner me too lmao!
@SpeakerBoehner What a bunch of Bull!You knew the Senate left town & the bill would go nowhere.U want to send these CHILDREN home 2 B killed
@SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner You got spanked by Rafael Cruz. Then you alienated Latinos. Job well done. Keep this up & the Prez will have a dem congress.
@SpeakerBoehner Only after you and GOP leadership got caught with your fraudulent bill from yesterday that didn't pass. You are corrupt
@SpeakerBoehner Passing bills that GOP knows will go nowhere in Senate?Your political stunts r endless & more obvious."The people" r onto u!
@SpeakerBoehner You are an IDIOT!!!
Did you ever even go to a leadership seminar? You fucking suck ass! GOP as whole sucks! Weak ass! @SpeakerBoehner
@WYVeteran @SpeakerBoehner I do believe the speaker is sucking the wrong body part.
@SpeakerBoehner in one bill or can the senate vote against the part they don't like and keep the money?
YOU'RE A COMPLETE SACK OF SAD DOG SHIT! CRUZ TOOK YOUR JOB, RUNS CONGRESS! CONTROLS HOUSE YOU DIMWIT @SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner While you're on vacation, illegals will be coming across border for next 30 days and obama will give amnesty. You RT that!
@SpeakerBoehner You're a delusional sociopath  You are murdering 3.5 million people with a crisis YOU created,  THAT is INhumane. #RenewUI
@SpeakerBoehner @gop @Lawrence  House had POTUS funding request for 3 weeks on humanitarian crisis.  Result is a complete GOP FAILURE.
@SpeakerBoehner Yes, secure our border against terrorism, drug smugglers, and human trafficking. Don't deport without due process  promised.
@SpeakerBoehner You sound as if you want to be congratulated or something.
@SpeakerBoehner you have to be joking! You should be hiding not bragging about your failures.
@TRAVELLMAN @SpeakerBoehner He can't do anything w/o permission from #SpeakerCruz . Without a doubt @SpeakerBoehner is #WorstSpeakerEver
@SpeakerBoehner I'm afraid it's Much Ado About Nothing since Little Harry and his absent cohorts have assured Big O can use pen re illegals
@SpeakerBoehner   Does bill prevent illegals in this country from using coyotes for trafficking children across borders?
“@SpeakerBoehner: RT to share the news: The House just voted to #SecureTheBorder

Speaker Boehner: A profile in cowardice.
@SpeakerBoehner This was a complete waste of the Tax Payers money. Yes, we need a secure border. Does this bill revise the 2008 law?
@SpeakerBoehner #GonadTransplant and #SpineReplacement are in order. #SendThemBack #StandTall #DontWasteTime #IllegalIsIllegal #tcot #ByEBye
@SpeakerBoehner  DOA and you know it.  Do we all look stupid?  Your base may believe this garbage, but liberals can see it for what it is.
@SpeakerBoehner  Again, a hurtful, despicable rider attached to your "fabulous" bill to secure the border.  No one believes a word you say.
@SpeakerBoehner 
Too little too late!
@RepAndyHarrisMD I don't trust @SpeakerBoehner Did anybody read the bill this time?  What's the compromise (payoff) to the USCC?
@SpeakerBoehner Now the battle begins. The Senate democrats were waiting for something too oppose, anything the republicans put out. Tiresom

@SpeakerBoehner why is humanitarian crisis in tiny letters?  Isn't that the issue we need you to fix?  Help the children please
@SpeakerBoehner Now make the senate pass & Obama enforce it or stop funding Obama's vacations, travels & golf. Cut his WH staff if necessary
@SpeakerBoehner When the border is secure and the illegals are sent back from whence they came.  That will end the crisis.
@SpeakerBoehner @local_onthe8

@SpeakerBoehner No, you're trying to win an election with a pretty pic. Here's the result.
@SpeakerBoehner They're children. ..
