Senitor Young,
Remrmber, Trump lies and what he says is meaningless.
@SenToddYoung Confidence won't B restored until a Independent Prosecutor is appointed 2 investigate TrumpRussia. Nation b4 party
It won't as long as Trump appoints the person that is supposed to investigate him. Mr. Young, please call for an independent investigation.
@SenToddYoung is incapable of doing what's best for the country. He blindly follows @POTUS and @GOP. Your constituents are sick of you!
I hope you are going to restore my confidence in the presidency by appointing a special prosecutor.
Sen Young the trump train has derailed, get off while you can. Grow some balls and demand a s prosecutor.
We need an independent investigator for this investigation...why are you not taking a firmer stand for our country's democracy?
Perhaps the senator that replaces you will help restore America's confidence.
History will remember who stood for our democracy-I am a patriot first, republican second-Senator? - Independent investigation now!
You work for US!!!  And we demand an INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION! 
Sincerely,  AN INDIANA VOTER.
How about restoring confidence in the Senate?? Since it appears, everyone in the GOP wants the Russian investation to go away.
@SenToddYoung you know what would restore confidence? A independent prosecutor into Trumps dealing with Russia
@SenToddYoung It is easy to figure out Comey lost the confidence of Shimmer then the White House. He was a drama king anyway
That's as may be, but we need to at LEAST figure out what Flynn was up to.  Bring on the special prosecutor/independent investigation
You have a choice, either your party or your country. So you are saying you choose Party over country? Not a sign of leadership or a Patriot
Party before country means one term Todd. Hoosiers can not support this. He's not even accessible. Town Hall meetings??
Its time to listen to your constituents Senator...
The choice before you Sen Young is country VS party. If you're the patriot you campaigned as then the choice should be easy. Country
@JohnCassidy makes a good case that Comey's firing threatens the Republic. Please support #IndependentInvestigation
We need a special prosecutor to investigate and put this behind us.  Replacing Comey has only muddied the waters.  Speak up for Hoosiers.
@SenToddYoung  Please support an #independentProsecutor for #RussiaInvestigation. That's the only way your constituents will be satisfied.
@SenToddYoung  Confidence will be restored when politicians put aside party politics and do the right thing for our country. Investigate!
This is your stance?!?  If so, your view doesn't reflect mine. You should talk to your constituents.
@SenToddYoung It is time to show Hoosiers who you really are. Call for an independent council immediately. #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
Without integrity, our democracy is a house of cards. You must support an independent investigator. I'm really scared.
Call for a special prosecutor please.
Not enough Todd! To restore confidence need an indep invest w special prosecutor! Put your "intelligence " background to work!
Hoosier common sense is telling me that this firing is part of a cover up.
Fine. We need a special prosecutor to look into Trump's ties to Russia now.
This is our Senator waiting to see which way the wind blows.
Exactly so. He wasn't that great for IN-9, either.
An independent investigation and special prosecutor NOW! #TrumpRussia  #indivisiblenwi #indivisiblehoosiers #
NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Block all judicial and DOJ noms until an independent law enforcement investigator is appointed.
Step up n do something to give Hoosiers confidence in you! Kick Russia out of the Presidency! #SpecialProsecuter
Senator Todd Young NOT saying WTF is destroying my confidence ~ American
It might restore my confidence if you would stand up to this obvious attempt to derail the FBI Russian investigation. Who's side are you on?
like Ur vote on health care, the country is watching how u react 2 Trumps behavior. Stand up 4 ur ppl & country don't be a Trump puppet.
We need an independent investigator now. That is the only way left for us to have any confidence we will uncover what is there, & what isn't
independent investigation is critical. Confidence is low because the president is not being held accountable to the law. Not complicated.
What is WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE????? This is a gigantic COVER UP & not partisan politics as usual. This is CRAZY. TRUMP IS NOT A REPUBLICAN
NO ITS NOT RESTORING CONFIDENCE IT IS SCARING THE SHIT OUT OF EVERYONE!!!!
It's time YOU listen TO THE PEOPLE. Country OVER party!!!
A special prosecutor MUST be appointed at this point.  Be on the right side of history.
Senate Republicans should not confirm any Trump pick for FBI Director until an independent prosecutor is appointed on Russia.
Country over party!Stand up 4 the democracy of our country!This is a abuse of power to cover up his ties to Russia as G.J. subpoenas issued!
The people demand independent prosecutor! GOP failing to provide checks and balances!  Trump must release taxes! #CorruptGOP #corrupttrump
Uh....what? That's terrible
We'll see. New leadership in the WH would also restore Americans' confidence.
Sen.Todd please stand up to the actions of this president. This isn't about restoring the FBI it's about restoring confidence in the govt.
You MUST join in demanding a special prosecutor. Put country before party. It's your job.
New leadership in the White House would go much further towards that goal.
18 days to fire Flynn. Less than a day to fire Comey. This is wrong and you know it. Defend our Country. Independent investigation NOW!
Senator Young, as your constituent, I am urging you to request an independent investigation. Your loyalty should be with your constituents.
Please, @SenToddYoung, to restore Americans' confidence in our federal government, support an independent investigation. Country over party.
You have a simple choice:  party or country. Are you a man of integrity or not?
No. No he's not. He's never done anything the majority of constituents asked of him. This is no different.
The perception is that the GOP cares more about protecting POTUS than protecting our democratic process. Russian hacking must be stopped.
@SenToddYoung The only thing that will restore this Hoosiers confidence is your support of an independent investigation. This is ludicrous
Comey could not be trusted! Should of been fired a long time ago! Drain the swamp!! Prosecute Lynch Hillary Obama.Remember Benghazi
These are not words of a leader. These are the words of a "yes" man.
America's confidence is shaken, not by the FBI, but the president. There must be an independent investigation.
I live in IN-1.Senator, either you choose to be truth seeker or be part of the cover-up (your colleague @SenSchumer 's words). Choose wisely
This is not about “confidence,” but facts grounded in reality—and our democracy. Demand special prosecutor to investigate #TrumpRussia, now.
@SenToddYoung What will it take for you to stand up and put your country first?  Please be a patriot.
An independent prosecutor looking into #TrumpRussia - that's how you restore confidence.
Hoosiers will look to you for leadership in placing an independent investigator. Yates'/Clapper's hearing, Comey's firing - they demand it!!
He fired the person investigating his campaign's collusion with a foreign power to win the presidential election. Put country over party!
I will definitely make sure that all my family and friends vote accordingly when he is up for reelection
No, Senator. Trump appointing an FBI director who would be investigating his own campaign is untenable and will further erode trust.
No. Special prosecutor now. #indivisiblehoosiers @indivisiblenwi
We demand an independent investigation of Trump Russia dealings and election tampering #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #SallyYates #Comey #Flynn
In other words , you don't plan to do anything
Why is it- everyone who stands up against Trump gets fired? Demand independent investigation of Trump & Russia dealings #TrumpRussia #Truth
We must have an independent investigation and special prosecutor. All cred in adm & DOJ is lost. Get on the right side. Country over party!
Hoosiers for an independent investigation of Trump's ties to Russia.
Senator Young. If you truly wish to restore confidence, I implore you to support an independent investigator with subpoena powers.
Independent prosecutor desperately needed. Clear this up. Don't be on wrong side of history
@SenToddYoung we need an independent investigation and we need to NOW!!!
Do the right thing and bring in a special investigator.
Confidence that we must have a soecial prosecutor.
New leadership in the WH is what's needed to restore confidence, Then the House, then the Senate.
@SenToddYoung Restore public trust -support a special prosecutor for Russia. Country over party.
Yes!!!
Senator , Do you support a special prosecutor for the Russia investigation?
Zero confidence without an independent investigator. You owe us that much. If there is nothing there, at least we will know the truth
Sen Young, this would now require nothing less than an independent special prosecutor. DOJ no longer credible either after this.
Will you support a special prosecutor and an Indepedent Commission?  Are you a patriot??
.@DanSpehler @SenToddYoung The only thing that will do that is an independent prosecutor. We the people DEMAND IT.
insisting on a #SpecialProsecutor will help restore our confidence in @GOP - otherwise you are all #complicit in #TrumpRussiaCollusion
But what are YOU gonna do to restore our confidence, @SenToddYoung? INVESTIGATE TRUMP NOW! Save the country.
Independent investigation!
Please. Call for an independent investigation. It's the only way to restore our confidence.
Will you chose party or country? This president is corrupt. Do you work 4 the president or the American ppl? Time 2 take a stand.
Put country before party and support an independent investigation and a special prosecutor, Senator Young.
Not enough. Call for an independent investigation right now Todd.  Be on the right side of history.  Reject the spectacle. #HoosierValues
Special prosecutor or you're complicit with their crimes.
Only a new president will restore confidence. Or, congressional Republicans standing up for our country. That would also help.
There is  NO CONFIDENCE with this administration. Just a travesty of justice and obstruction of Russian investigation.  PARTY OR COUNTRY?
I'm a hoosier. I demand that you push for an independent investigation and a special prosecutor. I'll call your office tomorrow.
@SenToddYoung  An independent investigation would go a long way towards restoring faith.
EXACTLY
An independent investigation is the only thing that will restore confidence. Please lend your support.
Best way to earn trust and learn facts: special prosecutor.
No special prosecutor? @SenToddYoung you are aiding and abetting! Your vote for Sessions confirmation knowing conflicts made this possible!!
