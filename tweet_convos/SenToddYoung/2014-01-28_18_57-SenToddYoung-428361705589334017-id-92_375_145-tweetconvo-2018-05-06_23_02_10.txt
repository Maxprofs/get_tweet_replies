@GOPLeader @kingcharles2016 What else is he gonna mess up! My husband lost his! Maybe he shld have researched a little more!
@GOPLeader How many millions lost their coverage before #ACA? You foul the discussion with your BS.
You mean 'despite his LIES' @GOPLeader @JamieRJN
@GOPLeader Why aren't you talking, in front of cameras, today and EVERY DAY, what befalls Americans when Employer mandate hits? #Dereliction
@GOPLeader you lie
@GOPLeader What are your plans to reinstate specific guidelines/restrictions regarding military dress codes pertaining to beards & turbans?
@GOPLeader Fox news says 56789 lost coverage and 56000 signed on to AAC. Get your facts straight Eric!
@GOPLeader @RepToddYoung then fix the problem instead of complaining. Stop living up to your title Cantor #typicalwhip
@GOPLeader @murphymike and more than 10M have GAINED insurance. And many of the 6.1M are eligible for subsidies for a better cheaper plan.
@lucasfleischer @GOPLeader @murphymike most of 6.1M are NOT eligible for subsidies(Fed freebies)&CBO:31M will still b uninsured-NODiff.thnB4
@GOPLeader @BobEstesPGA also Estes, you could use an entry level college statistics course. You ass-gargling nincompoop.
@BobEstesPGA while you're at it, look into a journalistic ethics course, i.e. Your pathetic retweets of Fox News links.
@GOPLeader where did u pull that number out of? Hmmm?
@GOPLeader @RedLugh .....and Mr. Cantor you and your colleagues have done what......????
@GOPLeader why mot just sit there... n watch BO make a fool out of u.
@GOPLeader How many were renewed?Your such a con,why not work for larger subsidies so more can purchase? larger small business subsidies?
@GOPLeader the HOUSE could have defunded it. You chose to attack the tea party and the American people instead. #defundthegop
@GOPLeader How many #Conservative #GOP members of Congress have you stood with? Have you lost that 'lovin' feeling" toward our country Eric?
“@GOPLeader: Despite the President’s promises, nearly 6 million Americans – to date – have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare.”SAD
@GOPLeader obviously that's what he wanted, pretty easy to see through
@GOPLeader
@GOPLeader how about proposing some improvements rather than time wasting repeal attempts.
And YOU voted to fund it. “@GOPLeader: Despite President’s promises, nearly 6M Americans-to date-have lost their health ins due to O'care.”
@GOPLeader stop tweeting and start paying attention. Maybe you'll learn something.
@GOPLeader Why do you hate America?
@GOPLeader More are uninsured now than before NOBAMACARE was implemented
@GOPLeader @BobEstesPGA way to massage those statistics to fit your rhetoric Cantor, you dishonest schill.
@GOPLeader did you forget your phone this time??
@GOPLeader their health insurance companies were exploiting them and that is unacceptable. #fact #ofaction #SOTU @OFA_MO
@GOPLeader @murphymike no one lost anything, they just had to buy something else that complied with the law. Happens all the time.
“@GOPLeader: Despite the President’s promises, nearly 6 million Americans – to date – have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare.”
@GOPLeader Mr leader that is so not true will you produce the facts and what is your new plan? #ACA #SOTU
@GOPLeader @murphymike but they have the choice to get health insurance back.  Big diff from those that didn't have ANY choices.
WaPo Fact Checker might have something to say about this @murphymike “@GOPLeader: Despite the President’s promises, nearly 6 million ......"
@GOPLeader @BobEstesPGA how many people were able to afford it?
@GOPLeader can you and Bonner find something to do.
@GOPLeader just wait until employers start forcing employees into #obamacare exchanges. My son's company has already notified them
@GOPLeader Potus and Dems need to stop saying how many have signed up and start admitting how many have not paid
@GOPLeader they can go out and get new policy's then
@gopleader @reptoddyoung You're tweeting while at the SOTU?  How about a touch of decorum.
@GOPLeader So what you are saying is that those insurance companies would have honored these plans otherwise?
@GOPLeader @murphymike and 5,999,910. Now have better and cheaper plans. They are not without health care.
@GOPLeader You are an embarrassment.
@GOPLeader @TheRickWilson are you actually trying to imply they can't get health insurance now ?
@GOPLeader You're right Eric!  I can't believe he just made an advertisement for kids to help their Mom's to sign up!
@GOPLeader and who are the "9 million" who the president said has signed up for Obamacare? #obamamath
@GOPLeader PROVE IT ASSHOLE! That's a lie!
@GOPLeader @murphymike baloney
that wasn't 'health ins' it was junk ins & nobody shld hv healthcare as ins anyway, ins corps should be out of anybody's medical @GOPLeader
@GOPLeader What about military retirees who stand to lose COLA and Tricare? #KeepYourPromise
@GOPLeader Is that why you made that face earlier?
@GOPLeader  please get your act together and beat these guys in 14 an 16
Swear to God if you ppl don't grow a spine and get this laundry list of govt taking over our lives under control you'll be out! @GOPLeader
Respectfully, @GOPLeader , you lie
@GOPLeader Funny how you didn't care when insurance companies dropped people with preexisting conditions leaving them with no alternatives
RT “@GOPLeader: Despite the President’s promises, nearly 6 million Americans – to date – have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare.”
@GOPLeader And got coverage again. Tell the truth!
“@GOPLeader: Despite the President’s promises, nearly 6 million Americans – to date – have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare.”

@GOPLeader @murphymike what is your answer... We've been waiting a long time
@GOPLeader How many Americans did you help get health insurance? Just wondering?
@GOPLeader Define "due to".
@GOPLeader @Kim9news So sad!
@GOPLeader because their policy was junk! They now can get better coverage
@gopleader Correction: Lost plans that failed to provide adequate minimum coverage. stop spinning the number for your narrative.
@GOPLeader but how many have lost their patience with a stagnant legislature?

@GOPLeader @DennisBoundsK5 And received better options at cheaper rates. Stop whining and move on.
@GOPLeader Sounds like zero to me.
@GOPLeader and seen massive premium increases, and outrageous deductibles to even have coverage, he neglects to say that also.
“@GOPLeader: Despite the President’s promises, nearly 6 million Americans – to date – have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare.”OMG
@GOPLeader Cantor what have you done to help the 6 million, NOTHING!!!!!!!
