@SpeakerBoehner @RepReneeEllmers Hay GOP Lets Go Back To The 50s When Things Were Good & Lets See Why!
@SpeakerBoehner what in this economy makes u think amnesty will work?
@SpeakerBoehner Yes. Record-breaking stock market highs, record corporate profits, and steady reduction in unemployment are not enough.
How does AMNESTY get Government out of the way? @SpeakerBoehner @UreapWatUsow
@SpeakerBoehner WE NEED SOLUTIONS THAT GET YOU AND YOUR THUGS OUT OF THE WAY.
@SpeakerBoehner Yes, we're hoping another election or two will get you and your deranged compadres out of the way.
@SpeakerBoehner Reduce 2014 Sequester cuts! CBO says big increase in GDP & jobs. Offset by reduction in Tax Expenditures for top 20% income.
@SpeakerBoehner please extend the Bush unemployment law especially at Christmas please
@SpeakerBoehner @RepMikeTurner @Senate_GOPs
@SpeakerBoehner  Yet  the EPA and IRS run wild and you roll over
like a good puppy for POTUS.
@SpeakerBoehner thought Obama care was killing jobs! Check jobs report son?
@SpeakerBoehner - then what is your plan? History shows that govt creates jobs in conjunction with free enterprise-partnerships mr speaker
@SpeakerBoehner If it means getting you out of the way, then I'm all for it.
@SpeakerBoehner Of course we agree. Just do it. Cut the EPA and DOL as a start.
@SpeakerBoehner Oh good!  When are you leaving???  You may be the biggest obstructionist to a growing economy.
@SpeakerBoehner The Pope detailed that Trickle down has never ever proven to work. You are a moral failure.
@SpeakerBoehner No we do not agree.....Gov not helping is the problem...Your refusal to help the poor, unemployed, minorities is offensive.
@SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner Sir, government got out of the way in '02, laying the way open for wall street to screw the pooch. and you want more!

@SpeakerBoehner give us us one of these "solutions" you speak about or should we assume you are drunk tweeting again?
@SpeakerBoehner #smallbiz @GOPLeader  Our economy needs a government that embraces its fiscal responsibility to pay for what it legislates.
@SpeakerBoehner by the way, where are the jobs you ran on?
@SpeakerBoehner start by passing a jobs bill.

@SpeakerBoehner Seeing as our government would rather argue with each other and shut down, I agree. All of you need to go away next election
@SpeakerBoehner Wimp of a concept and is no plan. Jobs are never coming back from offshore. Where was congress 35 years ago? Pathetic.
@SpeakerBoehner Honestly Mr. Speaker, our economy needs your Tea Party wing to get out of the way of bipartisan compromise for us all
