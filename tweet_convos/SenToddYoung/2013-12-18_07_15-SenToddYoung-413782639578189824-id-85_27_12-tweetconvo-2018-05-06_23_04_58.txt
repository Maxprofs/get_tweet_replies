@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader Fact is you didn't even try to pass a jobs bill. Fact is all your focus is on big business and the wealthy.
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader Republicans can't name 1 thing they have done to help poor people. Not one. They are currently cutting foodstamps
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader the GOP House was obsessed with keeping job growth down because of the 2012 pres election. cut it out!
@SpeakerBoehner again you should show some respect for the office you hold. Shame
@SpeakerBoehner @GaRepublicans MR SPEAKER,  U HAVE THE BALLS OF A BURGLAR 2 STAND THERE &COMPLETELY TRY 2 PASS THE BUCK OF UR SORRY CONGRESS
@SpeakerBoehner The empty vessel makes the loudest sound.Talking isn't doing...words are not deeds Shakespeare
@SpeakerBoehner by jobs do you mean shutting down the government  or do you mean voting to repeal the ACA 46 times ?  I'm confused
Speaker Boehner... do you really think that anyone believes this tweet?  For the love of God, please. Stop. @SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner Obama is not trying to do good thinks for America he is trying to bankrupt America, $17 trill debt no privet sector his goal
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader  History will not be kind to republicans who try to hurt the poor & miidleclass but work tirelessly to aid Rich.

@SpeakerBoehner @GaRepublicans Who do u think your fooling, Mr Speaker? Your focus has been on trying to repeal Obamacare!  46 times!
@SpeakerBoehner @GaRepublicans NAME ONE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT'S PASSED THE HOUSE! WHY DID U VOTE DOWN THE PRES "AMER JOBS ACT 2010?
@SpeakerBoehner 

John the house has done absolutely nothing for jobs.  In fact you have done everything you can do not to create more jobs.
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader Anyone else notice how the closer to DC a politician gets, the less you can tell a Dem from a RINO?
@SpeakerBoehner And the sequester and government shut down demonstrated that focus very well. Both were great for jobs!
@SpeakerBoehner lol
@SpeakerBoehner @GaRepublicans - then tell your sponsors to bring back their factories from China and give us jobs where we can make things.
@SpeakerBoehner no one believes this. Show us the evidence you've been about jobs. Laughable!
@SpeakerBoehner Deportation would free up millions of private sector jobs.
@SpeakerBoehner Boehner represents the worse congress in history. House wishes to cut programs to feed the poor, in exchange for jobs.
@SpeakerBoehner You are not!. If you were you would shut down the fed. agencies that are killing jobs. EPA, DOL and IRS.
@SpeakerBoehner "you have been focused on jobs all along"?LMFAO @cspan @msnbc @cnn @cnbc @abc @cbs @nbc

@SpeakerBoehner we are waiting for your dumb ass to be out of office so we can actually get something done for America
@SpeakerBoehner seems your bills focus more on rolling back regulations than jobs.
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader supporting AMNESTY and saying your focus is on jobs doesn't jive, unless you are focusing on jobs for illegals!
@SpeakerBoehner ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Did I see healthcare-bill is passed? You had nothing to do with any of that!
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader I would prefer if YOU, Mr Speaker, would START protecting the promises made to military retirees!
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader Even Bill Clinton knew you do not change the rules on those who have already run the race.
@SpeakerBoehner For pipeline to have chance have it run thru ur neighborhoods. Otherwise forget about it.
@SpeakerBoehner Mr.speaker like the message but didn't the GOP vote to open free trade w/ communist China and ruin our industry & NAFTA.
