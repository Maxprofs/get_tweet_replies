Here's the truth about 529's since @SpeakerBoehner is unable to tell the truth.
@SpeakerBoehner Here's a Great Idea: Rescind pages 982 and 1599 in the CR-bill. Give back your luxury car & Campaign money. PS Volcker too!
@SpeakerBoehner not middle class...you liar!! The one percent !!
.@SpeakerBoehner @kevkid79 Obviously bad. Not so obvious...what will you do to stop it?
@SpeakerBoehner I thought he said the taxes are on the rich. Oh, do you think the middle class is rich?
@keekerdeekers @SpeakerBoehner saying middle class gets hurt by taxing 529's doesn't make it true, 529's benefit those above middle class
@ImeanwhatIsaid @SpeakerBoehner I still mean middle class. Maybe our definitions of that are diff. Rich just get it from 1 of many accts.
@ImeanwhatIsaid @SpeakerBoehner now, tax breaks for leased cars it's totally for Biz and the wealthy who can't have the same car for 2 years
@SpeakerBoehner Disapprove of your alleged private dealings with Obama but I'm with you on this.
@SpeakerBoehner RETWEET IF YOU AGREE. If you are losing your argument, distort your opponent’s position.
@SpeakerBoehner So, is it a good idea to punish those folks who plan ahead and value education?
“@SpeakerBoehner: Please retweet to agree: Raising taxes on #MiddleClass families saving for college is a BAD idea.
@DaleDholc @salgranati7 @SpeakerBoehner He'll do whatever Obama tells him to do.
@SpeakerBoehner Ah, no, Mr Speaker, that's not what Obama proposed. 

Did you blow somebody to get that job, or what?
@SpeakerBoehner I pray that he burns in hell!!!
@SpeakerBoehner wish all of U will get backbone stand up to Obama now what u was elected to do.
@SpeakerBoehner @Chinner0313 it's a sweet, sweet world where we consider middle class 150k+ per year
@SpeakerBoehner @Chinner0313 #marcolife vs #mqtlife
@SpeakerBoehner @IamTheWindowMan coming from a man we don't even know if he graduated from college
@SpeakerBoehner No stupid, He proposed raising taxes on the rich 1 %, and not the middle class. you're an insult to our intelligence
@SpeakerBoehner @TiberiPress @Blairrae is evil rich because she makes more than me! She should pay for this because it's her fair share!
@SpeakerBoehner TiberiPress I think @Blairrae more than too many people, so the limit should be $10K less than she makes! That's fair right?
@SpeakerBoehner Republicans should look at middle class economics.  Trickle down only puts more money into the hands of the 1%.
@SpeakerBoehner Until you actually do some REAL work- you can retweet your own shit. I work for enough people- I'm not working for you too.
@SpeakerBoehner raising taxes on the rich to help the middle class get to college is an awesome idea.
@SpeakerBoehner So are you actually going to do this & not go belly up in the end & give the president what he wants?
@SpeakerBoehner how about you quit shafting the average American so your rich friends can pad their pockets
@SpeakerBoehner  Minimum wage dead & infrastructure dead too if they can find the money, but have no problem getting it from us for Keystone
@SpeakerBoehner @captaincwjensen yes...I agree!
@SpeakerBoehner is a PATHOLOGICAL LIAR @GOP #NUTZ
@SpeakerBoehner Agree
@SpeakerBoehner ..agreed, but what will U do about it? Just talk & posture OR actively rally support 2 make sure it fails? R U 4 The People?
@SpeakerBoehner , what are you talking about? What proposal, the only hike I'm aware of is for the top 1% to provide free community college.
@SpeakerBoehner and the GOP propaganda machine of lies lives on. Do you guy's ever put out completely factual information?
@SpeakerBoehner RT If u agree Americans deserve incorruptible representatives who protect OUR country NOT WORK AGAISNT US #SECURETHEBORDER
@SpeakerBoehner that is not what the President said ur pitching to the stupid. Do something or go home.
@SpeakerBoehner LOL, raising taxes slightly to pay for free community college sounds like a #fairdeal to me.
@SpeakerBoehner @indgop I can"t afford to pay all the taxes I get now! How does he expect us to pay more? Can"t you impeach this idiot?
@SpeakerBoehner middle class don't make enough to put in 529's, 529's were setup to benefit upper class above median incomes tax dodgers
@SpeakerBoehner GOP who wants to keep taxes low for he 1% & neglect the middle class.
@SpeakerBoehner He's bad for America and so are you...You are not listening to the American People
@SpeakerBoehner Sorry you being elected to your position is a mistake.
@SpeakerBoehner Maybe this is how we should hold elections from now on (Retweet if you agree and fav if you don't). 
It could work!
@SpeakerBoehner EVERY ONE THAT BELIEVES GOP WILL SAVE MIDDLE CLASS...STAND ON YOUR HEAD!!
@SpeakerBoehner cheers
@SpeakerBoehner   THE GOP IS NOW IN CHARGE..GOD HELP US ALL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFmYsFNra0k … … from sea to shining sea!
@SpeakerBoehner Haha!  Lie. Rinse. Repeat. You have nothing else to do?  Don't you have an economy to destroy? No tan appointment today?
@SpeakerBoehner It would be a bad ideal if the POTUS had suggested that, but you flat out lie! #Lying Douche Bag
“@SpeakerBoehner: Raising taxes on #MiddleClass families saving for college is a BAD idea. Free community college is GOOD idea.
@SpeakerBoehner @EHeasslerUSNRet Short on facts, let's just make shit up....
@SpeakerBoehner Raising taxes at all is a bad idea.
@SpeakerBoehner The only bad idea is having you remain as speaker.
“@SpeakerBoehner: Please retweet to agree: Raising taxes on #MiddleClass families saving for college is a BAD idea. ”
@SpeakerBoehner WTF??? Raise taxes on middle class plus pay for these lazy asses education??? Fuck them !
@SpeakerBoehner  Mr. Speaker, If the wealthy are the middle class you must think you and your colleagues live in poverty. Good one!
@SpeakerBoehner You would have to be brain dead not to know it would be disastrous! But we know Obama is
@SpeakerBoehner Having U as speaker of that dysfunctional circus is a bad idea. U only work for big business and big money donors
@SpeakerBoehner Of course it is!
@SpeakerBoehner And...do you want to explain this meme? How this is true?
@SpeakerBoehner Did NOT; u freaking LIAR. @edshow @Lawrence
@SpeakerBoehner @AllenEllis14 that son of a bitch emperor said free college never whom would be paying
@rodeorosary @SpeakerBoehner @AllenEllis14 Who pays, I hope the same non productive greedy bastards that crashed the economy in 2008
@SpeakerBoehner 

Very bad hope we can stop him!
@SpeakerBoehner you're a liar and orange
@SpeakerBoehner OBAMA CONTINUES TO RAISE TAXES to fulfill his objective of @BankruptingAm & #AbusedTaxPayers. @SenateFloor @Heritage_Action
@SpeakerBoehner His plan is too Tax the Shit out of the Rich to pay for it you idiot, you should have paid attention!
@SpeakerBoehner Boehner you have approved every Obama spending bill for 6 straight yrs. Stop being a wussy and get a pair
@SpeakerBoehner raise your hand if you think our Congress sucks
.@SpeakerBoehner The only bad idea is you leading a FAILING OBSTRUCTIONIST #Congress. STILL #WorstSpeakerEver
@SpeakerBoehner taxing 529 accts only creates more wealth distribution, and puts more of a burden on middle class #tcot #republicans
@SpeakerBoehner Raise Taxes on the people who do not qualify for assistance to pay for people that do? Not Smart!
@SpeakerBoehner @randadtrade Tech colleges are filled with mostly students from middle class families!?
Small correction @SpeakerBoehner. Paying an existing tax on income is income tax We already do that, except for the wealthy you fight for.
@Blob_Fish @SpeakerBoehner I'd like to hear how this is worse than the massive amounts of $$ already being extracted from student borrowers?
@Blob_Fish @SpeakerBoehner right? Taxing students from low means family? Cool. Taxing parents with means to save for kids' college? Not cool
@SpeakerBoehner get to work.  Quit screwing around on Twitter.  We aren't paying you to tweet.
@SpeakerBoehner If you like your 529 College Savings Account...oh, wait.
@SpeakerBoehner I agree
@SpeakerBoehner it's going to kill me
