@DividendMaster @danalinae @SpeakerBoehner And Obamacare moves on.
@danalinae @SpeakerBoehner 
where's it moving to ? system frozen / useless in NY . Kinda curious to see whats offered
@DividendMaster @SpeakerBoehner It's a shame we must deal with lizard brains who think everyone else is unworthy.  Why don't you just eat us
@danalinae cuz we'd poison ourselves ?
@DividendMaster So the masses should just lay down and die 
and relieve your burden.  Oh how christian.
@SpeakerBoehner when there is no special treatment for oil companies like KOch Bros,then this tweet wouldnt be so laughable Speaker Feckless
@linusesq @SpeakerBoehner So your logic is: Congress & rich corps. get out of compliance with Obamacare but its ok because... Koch Bros. do?
@dmcginity @SpeakerBoehner save the GOP talking points for someone who will be deluded/scared by them. I know what the ACA does/doesnt do.
@linusesq @SpeakerBoehner You are the rare exception then. Why should Congress and rich corporations get out of compliance with Obamacare?
@SassyClassy529 @SpeakerBoehner We had an election last year.  You lost.  Deal with it.
@SpeakerBoehner Stop talking. Just. Stop. Talking. And legislate.
@campbellsl @SpeakerBoehner He Is. Why should Congress and rich corporations get out of compliance with Obamacare?
@dmcginity @SpeakerBoehner That's what we call obfuscation in my neighborhood.
@campbellsl @SpeakerBoehner Yeah politicians that. I seriously wanna know: Why should Congress get out of compliance with Obamacare? #fishy
@dmcginity @SpeakerBoehner I misunderstood. My apologies. I say they get in compliance or the rest of us get their kind of insurance.
@campbellsl @SpeakerBoehner No apology necessary ; ) Congress excludes themselves from most laws they pass. I gotta problem with that.
@dmcginity @SpeakerBoehner You and me both, pal. Let them live with the rest of us, and then maybe they can represent us.
@SpeakerBoehner oh ya, like the republicans really care about any one except their fat wallets and their friends.please.sorry. majority wins
@SpeakerBoehner Amen and don't negotiate less.
@SpeakerBoehner shame on you.
@SpeakerBoehner Why does GOP put employers 1st Amend rts. above employees' 1st Amend. rts? GOP is party of #inequalityinhealth
@SpeakerBoehner Thank you! People that work hard do not want to be ordered to pay more so others could have ins. There should be a choice
@SpeakerBoehner Does that include politicians? will you  and the rest of Congress go on Obamacare.  Save us all some $$$
@SpeakerBoehner Don't back down
@speakerboehner AWESOME!
@SpeakerBoehner you are very bad at what you are paid to do, sir.
@DellaATL @SpeakerBoehner And Congress shouldn't be getting paid if other federal workers aren't getting paid!
@SpeakerBoehner #Fairness means You, Congress, & Senate lose your paychecks like so many Americans untl you do your job!!
@SpeakerBoehner  They think they R above the law. Obama & the dems R so disrespectful.All the name calling against the American people. SAD
@SpeakerBoehner Chuck Todd didn't answer question what's wrong with congress & Pres to be on ACA
Stand strong. Do not stand down. We have your backs. .@SpeakerBoehner @lsferguson
@SpeakerBoehner Nah nah nah nah ... nah nah nah nah..Oh hell yeah good bye #republicancontrolledhouse in 2014
@SpeakerBoehner  good job
@SpeakerBoehner Then why are you working for the Health Insurance Lobby?
@SpeakerBoehner Giving businesses more time for implementation is not special treatment. Individuals need coverage now - not more time.
@SpeakerBoehner majority wins...you all lost the 2016 elections!
@SpeakerBoehner are the House and Senate going to be under the Health Care Law?
#NoSpecialTreatment @SpeakerBoehner Why does Congress exempt themselves from SO MANY laws then? #YouLie
@SpeakerBoehner Oh please. Any special treatment in that bill carved out for big business was carved out by your party & you know it.
@SpeakerBoehner Do you think anyone CAN'T see that all ur bills r designed to stop #ObamaCare ? Do u hope to fund 1 item @ a time xcpt ACA?
@SpeakerBoehner  stop the bullshit. If it not good enought for Congress & and Obama, then its not for us either
@joefuckingbiden @SpeakerBoehner is trying 2 play us. As always. he's working with Reid behind the scenes. http://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-obamacare-subsidies-boehner-exempt-2013-10 …
@SpeakerBoehner Pres & Michelle missed a photo op signin up for his sig healthcare forgot he and congress are exempt not good enough for him
@SpeakerBoehner No special treatment except you lobbied for "special treatment" for Congressional staffers. Confused?Just asking......
There should be no special treatment for big oil either, but we know how you handle them as they line ur pockets. @SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner  thank you  for trying  Sir! The main stream media is corrupt! They will give account in the day of judgement! #StayStrong
@SpeakerBoehner Koch Bros will be mad at this tweet..LOL
@SpeakerBoehner I have 2 kids, $111.00 in the bank till pay day, I can't afford #OBAMACARE I voted for you. don't fund it. It hurts me.
@SpeakerBoehner it's not about fairness it's about you trying not to be primaried
@SpeakerBoehner we also need people who DO their jobs
@SpeakerBoehner @Rockprincess818 Actually, John, we need full repeal. Let Americans control their own lives.
@SpeakerBoehner - Dems forced either govt shutdown or costly, unusable healthcare law - it's a lose - lose situation for Dems in 2014.
@SpeakerBoehner -giving clean bill now & letting public know they  decide if Dems gave them bad law for 2014.
@SpeakerBoehner @Rockprincess818 non legislated #waivers & #extensions should be criminal - & at the moment, wondering why they are not?
@SpeakerBoehner -time to hand #POTUS & Dems what they want. It's a lose-lose deal. Give them clean bill now & not raise debt ceiling later
@SpeakerBoehner @Rockprincess818 I Completely Agree!!
@SpeakerBoehner No special treatment for the mega farm companies? Stop subsidizing the rich and help the poor and middle class- WWJD?
@SpeakerBoehner stay strong Americans don't want OBAMACARE and america can't afford it
@SpeakerBoehner I say bullshit Mr Speaker! You are not one to talk about equality or fairness for all.
@SpeakerBoehner Yeah - fairness for all INCLUDING you!

@SpeakerBoehner @ChartersKim  #ObamaCare #FairnessForAll Screw the Dems who refuse to negotiate. You are negotiating against yourself.
@SpeakerBoehner Mr Speaker practice what you preach. Pass a bill that puts Congress back on the program.
@SpeakerBoehner   #Benghazi Select Committee; IRS Scandal: Fast and Furious.  When is the House gonna get serious about Impeachment?
@SpeakerBoehner @ChartersKim good on ya
@SpeakerBoehner I believe it's illegal what he did, it should be a lawsuit filed and taken all the way to Supreme Court! This is outrageous
@SpeakerBoehner @SuzanSwickert It's fair to apply the law equally, but I'm sick and tired of the "fairness" of class warfare...
@SpeakerBoehner This Independent supports fairness for all enact Obamacare as it was written. No special deals for anyone

@SpeakerBoehner 

You take an oath of office to uphold and protect the Constitution, NOT pledge allegiance to Harry Reed.
Mr.JohnAdams

@StarVet56 @GOPBlackChick @SpeakerBoehner Tell Congress you want your Obamacare exemption too. https://www.facebook.com/exemptme?skip_nax_wizard=true …
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPBlackChick Thank you.
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPBlackChick too late john you all dropped the ball, now grow some and impeach the bastard.
@SpeakerBoehner  why are you guys trying to exempt yourself from the employer mandate by not providing insurance to staff? #FairnessForAll
@SpeakerBoehner politicians are the only ones getting special treatment by getting paid during the shutdown..and putting 800k out of jobs.
@SpeakerBoehner 
A law can't be constitutional if it doesn't apply to every citizen.
@SpeakerBoehner 
Speaker Boehner, Thank you, please don't back down !
@SpeakerBoehner did the house pass the farm bill?  That will cost more jobs than health care legislation.
@SpeakerBoehner Hypocrites! You would all be dismissed or fired for all the problems you've caused this country!
@SpeakerBoehner Then why do you support corporations having "moral objections" to women's healthcare? Doesn't sound like #FairnessForAll.
@SpeakerBoehner start acting like an adult and pass CR.  #ACA is the law.  In Vermont we're ready to go to our exchange tomorrow.
@SpeakerBoehner Get ur bronze-ass 2 AA. Stop taking drunk manias out on ppl who simply need HEALTHCARE #Obamacare's better than GOP FAIL
@SpeakerBoehner I agree, sir.
@SpeakerBoehner please stand strong! Do not cave! Reiterate the imbalance of the applicability of the law.
@SpeakerBoehner please stand your ground against Obamacare. Don't give one inch! Be unmovable
@SpeakerBoehner @lsferguson Then no caving!!!
.@SpeakerBoehner It seems disingenuous at best when you make no mention of preventing your own exclusion from #Obamacare. >:( #PutUpOrShutUp
@SpeakerBoehner The good patriots left MUST go on TV & tell what you know. TOO MANY DEAD BODIES.  http://www.nachumlist.com/deadpool.htm  TIME TO EXPOSE ALL.
@SpeakerBoehner Your crying jags were because you realized how impossible it would be to undo the corruption & destruction put in place.
@SpeakerBoehner @fogslifting Speaker, you already admitted on video that you have sinned -as have many in DC. You are being blackmailed.TELL
@SpeakerBoehner If you defund the entire thing, everyone can fairly decide what healthcare they want. #TodaysHelpfulHint
.@SpeakerBoehner Would that be no special tax treatment for medical device corporations?? http://www.healthcare.gov  #GOPshutdown #WarOnWomen
@speakerboehner Shut the fuck up! Because of you, my mom can't work. You lame asshole!
@SpeakerBoehner @BettinaVLA Please don't cave!
@SpeakerBoehner who exactly do you think you're punishing by not passing the budget? Big business or patriot families like mine.#MORONS!!!!!
@SpeakerBoehner now? Really?
@SpeakerBoehner No compromise on takeover of 1/7th of our economy & socialized medicine!
@SpeakerBoehner lol
@SpeakerBoehner 'RWNJ'here to remind you there are millions of us 'small number of extremists','TeaPartyTerrorists' who are watching!#ORPUW
@SpeakerBoehner - I think we know GOP is in bed with big business/Koch bros/insurance co. This game GOP plays is a disgrace and hurts all.
@SpeakerBoehner Agree, including house and senate members. What's forced for some, should be forced to those who actually pass the law
@SpeakerBoehner fairness begins someplace but shutting down gov't is not the answer & is only being used against Rep. Tea party are not Rep.
@SpeakerBoehner HA HA HA Look who is calling for #NoSpecialTreatment for big businesses, Mr. Corporate Welfare himself.
@SpeakerBoehner #FairnessForAll You think it's fair for you to have health care when we don't? You on welfare for not working? What planet..
@SpeakerBoehner stand by it. But don't fund it anyway. We don't need to continue the mistake of a bad law.
@SpeakerBoehner Give it up Pinocchio.  We see thru you.
@SpeakerBoehner #FairnessForAll This coming from you?? When can I expect the rich to pay the % I pay in taxes? Yep! That's what I thought!

This tweet really pisses me off! The #GOP is just as guilty as the Dems for excluding themselves from every inane law. @SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner You had your chance to lead the GOP but caved to the #Wingnut faction. The GOP will pay dearly come election time.
@SpeakerBoehner @SenatorReid ObamacareTriples Family's Insurance Overnight http://shar.es/Kq63z  CBO Report #ObamacareIsUSAFinancialSuicide
@SpeakerBoehner Yet I think those in Congress who voted or stood by when the law was past should not be exempt either.#tcot
@SpeakerBoehner -  laughable. The depth of your Hypocrisy is unfathomable. Big business favors are all you know. Shut up and do your job.
@SpeakerBoehner I'm with you.
@SpeakerBoehner No special treatment for big business says the corporate whore.

@diogeron @SpeakerBoehner @RepToddYoung They need to play on the freeway all of them
@SpeakerBoehner Stop lying.  There is NO exemption for Congress. Stand up to the 20% population minority represented by Teabag GOP.

@SpeakerBoehner give them the entire obamacare bill, with no exceptions and move forward with cuts to budget on debt ceiling
@SpeakerBoehner Trying to shut down the govt over birth control is NOT fair or responsible  Grow up and negotiate a deal.
@SpeakerBoehner Yea right...will Congress be on ObamaCare. I think not. You are all hypocritical bastards. Every one of you!
@SpeakerBoehner HOLD OBAMA TO HIS PROMISE NOT TO RAISE DEFICIT SPENDING WITH OBAMACARE:
@SpeakerBoehner @blackandgold43 WE NEED NO OBAMACARE PERIOD! STOP IT NOW! #ShutItDown
@SpeakerBoehner We haven't been getting "#FairnessForAll.
@SpeakerBoehner Be prepared for Obowma to tell the Fed to stop QE3 to crash the US economy if he doesn't get his way.  Then blame the @GOP.
@SpeakerBoehner agreed! Stand firm
@SpeakerBoehner so take @GrassleyOffice amendment that included congress and aides, NOT the original POTUS ACA given to you, out of the law
@SpeakerBoehner biggest liars belong to the Republican Party.
@SpeakerBoehner Get in front of the mic! Get tough on a message! Your messaging has been horrible!
@SpeakerBoehner Well, remember Hillary's Hell-th care act - 9 month mutilation (abortion) reduced to 7 months... Big break for businesses...
@SpeakerBoehner The way tings are going We wont have to worry about Gov either. We the People will take it BACK!
@SpeakerBoehner Indeed. Extortion is illegal!
@SpeakerBoehner no special treatment for big business?  Are you hearing your self boehner?  Republicans are all about special interest
@SpeakerBoehner   You are as evil as your leader @SenTedCruz
@Bellalindafox @SpeakerBoehner @SenTedCruz another profound statement from a progressive
@SpeakerBoehner Put it in writing and send it to the Senate along with the current CR... Let them defend the exemptions or Gov Shut Down.
@SpeakerBoehner Why?? Nothing else you pass is fair!!

@SpeakerBoehner  Thank you for all that you are doing. I am proud of you. Obamacare needs to be stopped.
@SpeakerBoehner The GOP leadership needs to stop believing your own propaganda, the Majority of Americans are NOT in agreement with you
Frame it as "Until we can repeal it we will make sure to ease its destructiveness" @SpeakerBoehner
There should be no Obamacare. I realize you can't repeal it yet but you're framing it as if it's here to stay. NONONO @SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner Just don't cave to the Democrats. Fight these bums hard.
@SpeakerBoehner stand strong and don't cave in to these socialist !!!!
@SpeakerBoehner You're an idiot. Thanks for all you do for America.
@SpeakerBoehner Please stick to that statement.
@SpeakerBoehner Obama cannot sell screwing 300million to supposedly help 30million. Stand strong. He doesn't want it. Neither do we.
@SpeakerBoehner You are the problem in DC. You are whats wrong with our government. Pass the budget. You lost the last election. Get over it
@SpeakerBoehner Make ALL benefits Individual purchase, especially @HarryReid #EatYourPoison if it's so good.
@SpeakerBoehner Potus promised a grand bargain instead gave us another entitlement prgm costing $1.3 Trillion while offering no smart cuts
@SpeakerBoehner Fairness? You're going to shutdown the govt and kill my 401k at the same time. #awesome
@SpeakerBoehner Are you including Congress in that #NoSpecialTreatment? You should not be exempt from laws you pass.
@SpeakerBoehner  @msnbc Shame on you and your extortion and anti-American behavior. You Sir, are no leader.
@SpeakerBoehner American taxpayers deserve YOUR healthcare plan...we PAY for yours!
@SpeakerBoehner @GOP @gopconference  rescind ALL exemptions and put ALL federal employees in exchanges.  Make DNC own the ACA for 2014.
Gosh, @SpeakerBoehner , I guess that means you'll be repealing the Congressional Accountability Act, won't you? #FairnessForAll
@SpeakerBoehner cnn polls shows only 10% of the country thinks congress is doing a good job #fail
@SpeakerBoehner No special treatment but u give tax breaks to Koch? Get out of here! We voted for Obama. He won! Stop actin like a hoe?
@SpeakerBoehner Really? You Pickled, Pompous Ass...the #GOP Has Been Giving Big Business Break After Break for Years. #Subsidies #LoopHoles
@SpeakerBoehner Then agree not to be paid during a #shutdown
@SpeakerBoehner 
..Fairness for all with a settlement of painful pasts would be appropriate.
Define "Fairness" before you use the big word, Mr. Speaker.
