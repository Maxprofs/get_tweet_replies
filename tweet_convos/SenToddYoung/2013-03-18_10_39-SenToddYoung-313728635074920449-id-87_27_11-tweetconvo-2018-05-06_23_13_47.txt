@SpeakerBoehner A paid-for Jobs Bill has been sitting on your desk since October 2011. When will it see the House floor for a vote?
@SpeakerBoehner You voted "yes" on every spending bill under Bush, 5 "yes" votes to raise the #debtceiling $4T. You unbalanced that budget.
@SpeakerBoehner boneheaded again
@SpeakerBoehner What does it matter?  It's not like we have a debt crisis or anything.

@SpeakerBoehner 1st you need to quit saying HOW GREAT YOU THINK OBAMA IS! You know like the rest of us conservatives that he is not good
@SpeakerBoehner But we must oppose Ocare to the death!We must never give up if we love America as a free country.
@SpeakerBoehner YOU need to resign. You have failed your constituents & your party with your comments about debt & your trust of Obama.
@SpeakerBoehner Maybe not all, since some people are already pretty happy with where they are?
.@SpeakerBoehner You and your whole party are delusional if you think your "budget" will grow anything besides your own wealth.

@SpeakerBoehner The Ryan budget should have stated a goal to retool Obamacare not eliminate, it is agreed that it it needs work/change.
