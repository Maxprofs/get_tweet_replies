#Military @realDonaldTrump #WeThePeople paid a price for The United States of America! Freedom on American soil is not cheap! #MAGA 
offensive irony that cowardly @KeithRothfus who can't face constituents-ie do his job-has audacity 2 put self in same tweet w brave @usmc
Everyone should read Flags of our Fathers. Then watch the movie. If you don't cry reading about those heroes you have no soul!!!!
we make history SEMPER FI!!
- on this day, Senator Todd Young continued to exhibit "uncommon cowardice" in facing his constituents.
And, we have sickos living under this flag who are traitors to it and the event it represents.
Sorry sobs.
@connie56
@BillSpadea thanks for remembering what is important
.@USMC With LTG Snowden on Guam post 70th Reunion of Honor on Iwo Jima. I will not let their deeds be forgotten.
God bless you all.
.@USMC Interviewed some of these heroes at the Iwo Jima symposium last week
Real heroes. Read about them everyone. Schools should be compelled to teach about these heroes.
Most immigrants have no clue about the battle of Iwo Jima.Yet we continue to erase ourselves to be replaced by them.
most wasn't born back then, but that's why we have historians
what we as veterans would be talking about is getting rid of the red tape for funds that's set a side for us.
Respect 4 active military & vets is back in the WH. Expect & insist on better. Confident.
I served with immigrants and Muslims when I was active duty in the 90's.
Semper Fi to all our Brothers who fought this battle! God rest their souls!
Bravo Zulú Dévil Dogs!!
oooooh frickin rah!!!!!! Semper Fi Devil Dogs!!!!!
These guys had no safe spaces. This generation is doomed.
@BeladonnaRogers now we have gender neutral people!
@DeptofDefense  Thank you Dad!
Corps sustained 18K cas & thousands died many Medals of Honor, young men who threw themselves into slaughter watching each others back
ironically Trump wants more nuks disgraceful
Words cannot adequately express our gratitude for all who have served and sacrificed all for our liberty Semper Fi , Marines
MAGA!
check out my video about Marine Chaplain/Medal of Honor recipient Fr Capodanno
Ooh Rah! Thank you! Glad and Proud my daughter and son in law are both serving in the Marines!!
God please bless our Marines in Jesus name I pray. Amen
great job
@HouseGOP  we still have one of your guys here, he's 96-97. Still wears his cap with pride!
I asked everyone just what if these people do what they've been doing and other countries
@HouseGOP My friend was there but he never talks about it! He's a kindly older Marine!
and they damn sure didn't do it just to give away the rest of the country
Thank you for all you do! God Bless the USMC & God Bless America! 
@jockowillink God bless America,  and our servicemen.
#SemperFi

God Bless America!
Below the runway of Iwo Jima(硫黄島). There're still sleeping many many Spirits of the war deads…

@DeptofDefense Without this generations selfless service, their wouldn't be selfless generations thereafter! My abundant gratitude!
God Bless the US Marines
@DeptofDefense Marines and one Soldier, nevertheless, WHOA!
@RepKinzinger could also show his Valor by hosting a #townhallmeeting with his constituents.
In honor of my husband, a USMC Vietnam Vet 69-73. The Marines are everything. We keep a statue of the Iwo flag raising in our home.
Semper Fi to all my fellow Marines!
God bless our troops!
God bless our Marines. God bless!
@LaCivitaC Semper Fi
Semper Fi!
Honored to know a man personally that saw the flag go up twice on Iwo.
now that is my kind of safe space...
@ClintBartlett75 
DOO RAH! 
GBA!
@veteransunited http://kck.st/2kOxkJy  #HealingVietnam Please share. One more veteran suicide is one too many.
A great historic day for the Marines and the US and the world but the @GOP can't take credit and avoid fixing the ACA
These were young boys, avg age 19. The "greatest generation". A far cry from those of today who need safe spaces. Blah!
Pussified these days!
We are greatful for your sacrifices you made for us the American people, protecting our country, our freedom and our way of life.
Semper Fi
America
All right. Go Marine Corps
Gong Ho! What men and women we had, that they gave their last once of devotion so that we could be free today! God Bless the Marines!
@DeptofDefense Of the six soldiers , three were killed serving their country within a week.
. GOD bless our troops!!
I feel honored to have seen this in person. The Marine protecting this flag said it was the most prized object in the museum.
So shameful that @realDonaldTrump pretended to raise money for Vets groups, then didn't follow thru on donation. Sad!
@davidwebbshow I hope that valor will return with President Trump.
@Op_Homefront Grateful on this day
@dodsonusn #GodBlessOurTroops I stand for #TheFlag

Thank you for your service and sacrifice. Imagine we'd be speaking German or Japanese if #snowflake were in Corps.
Semper Fi Devil Dogs!
When it was his turn to serve, @realDonaldTrump dodged, choosing fake heelspurs and a letter from a quack
All these loafers and protesters should be made to serve. They could appreciate freedom &a the great USA
Keep fighting the good fight Devildogs!
@DeptofDefense grateful!
I worked with Homer Hendron. He was on Iwo Jima. It was an honor to know him, to talk with him. #UnsungHeroes
Harilngen #texas SKUM.
20 miles of tunnels and these men let them make my mom blind by cooking from those tunnels 65 feet down and murder the DUNNS and more.
and these men at the #harlingen #texas zipcode 78550 #MarneMilitaryAcademy allow Garcia go MURDER #Americans as they refuse to defend.
Thank you to everyone who has, and is serving our military. We appreciate all of you.
AND TODAY AT THE #IWOJIMA STATUE IN #HARLINGEN #TEXAS #HRL hanger #airport Garcia has drug tunnels 65 feet under running to 7th street
Thank God for our military. As a veteran myself, I know the sacrifice and what it takes to be free.
@DeptofDefense God bless the military's

The planting of US Flag at Mt Suribachi in Iwojima on this day in 1945 will always remain the legendary folklore of the #USMarines!
Here is an amazing reproduction of that iconic moment made with (Legos) @LEGO_Group in the @MarineMuseum gift shop.
God Bless the United States Marines!
semper fi
so proud of all our arm forces, thank you all for your service, may God bless you all. Proud to be an American
Thank you! 
The raising of that flag on Suribachi means a Marine Corps for the next five hundred years！
If it wasn't for these brave Americans back then, we wouldn't have the freesoms of today. Thank You for your service.
