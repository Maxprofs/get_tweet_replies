@SpeakerBoehner and by "fairness" you mean uninsured due to pre-existing conditions and poverty?  #EpicDick
@Kaore @SpeakerBoehner ACA Pre Exist Plan BROKE/CLOSED 3/2013 after $5Bil spent & only 135,000 people signed up. 80% of US have INS.
@ignorancecosts @SpeakerBoehner even republicans went on record to say that it was not funded adequately.  You want to kill the whole thing?
@Kaore @SpeakerBoehner $5billion spent on 135,000 people in 2 1/2 yrs?  LOL.  could have set up an account for those w pre-exist forLess
@ignorancecosts @SpeakerBoehner Bullshit, even republicans went on record saying the funding was too low.
@Kaore @SpeakerBoehner They are fools too.
@ignorancecosts So everyone who doesn't agree with you and the tea party freaks are fools?
@Kaore As much as those who dont agree w Obama are terrorists, anarchists, obstructionists, tea baggers, neanderthals, hostage takers..lol
@SpeakerBoehner How dare U even bring up fairness when you give Corp welfare while waging war on  poor, minorities, women, etc. @GOPLeader
@mdcolli @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader Melinda he is fighting for us on the mandate. Its Obama that let corporations off the hook. Read silly
@Digem11 @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader  I am well aware of the mandate. Rep are working to keep us one illness from bankruptcy.
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader @RepPaulRyan - You do not have the right to illegally practice extortion. @BarackObama @pfeiffer44  @SenatorReid

@SpeakerBoehner Hey Boehner - If you had even an ounce of decency you would sit your TP extremists down and teach them=People come 1st.
@mdcolli @SpeakerBoehner how about Obama stop playing golf long enough to sit at the table with GOp! No, he would rather meet with terrorist

@SpeakerBoehner How difficult is it to tell UR TP extortionists that they are out of line????? All of you need to be fired. #ShutdownTheGOP
@mdcolli @Solutioneer72 @SpeakerBoehner The Speaker can't really tell the members anything. The Speaker is accountable to the members.
@barryfreed2013 @Solutioneer72 @SpeakerBoehner I disagree..He has an obligation 2 instruct his underlings. This is about his lack of ethics.
@mdcolli @Solutioneer72 @SpeakerBoehner Are members of the congress underlings of The Speaker?
@SpeakerBoehner You just like all the elected officials were elected to stand for all of citizens of America,

@SpeakerBoehner You Do NOT represent the PEOPLE! We don't want your representation. YOU ARE WEAK.
@SpeakerBoehner If the votes were there to pass the clean CR and you didn't bring it to a vote, you are a stronger Republican than American.
@SpeakerBoehner Stick to your guns. Ignore the selfish and entitled. The only thing they understand is themselves.
@SpeakerBoehner Looks like you're too fucking stupid even for that. Go suck a teabag dick, asshole.
@Pro_Freedom_ @SpeakerBoehner You fought a presidential election over #Obamacare and lost big time. (cont) http://tl.gd/mok91r

@SpeakerBoehner The spin on this changes by the hour. This is disgraceful to our country. And you are to blame.
@SpeakerBoehner The only reason that Republicans have the majority in the House is because of the game of gerrymandering.
@SpeakerBoehner Word games!  I pay you $172,000 per year and get an advertising agency!
@SpeakerBoehner Shame on the GOP. There's nothing fair about blackmailing our country.
@SpeakerBoehner Mr. Speaker Please Shut Down the Government. We can't afford #obamacare
@SpeakerBoehner LET DEMS DO A SHUTDOWN! STAND STRONG! THEY R COUNTING ON REP'S GIVING IN. DON'T GIVE IN...................
@SpeakerBoehner Stand and fight, the majority of Americans oppose Obamacare. There has never been a better time to shut it down! #shutdown

@SpeakerBoehner grow up! Tea bagger terrorists are nuts like the ilk of Michelle - bimbo -Bachman.
@SpeakerBoehner it's disingenuous to say you want fairness when you have voted 43 times to deny american's affordable healthcare. #stop
@SpeakerBoehner: 5. Also, if I were you, you'd take a pay cut to show you want to compromise.
@SpeakerBoehner: 4. that's the only path you have.  otherwise you will be hated by EVERYONE.  and Obama will be seen as  hero.
@SpeakerBoehner: 3. so get with the picture and do the right thing, the INTELLIGENT thing, and the BRIGHT thing and fund the government
@SpeakerBoehner: 2. if you continue on this path, you are ensuring your political career will be ended.  Compromise is nescessary.
@SpeakerBoehner: 1.  Mr. Boehner, what gives you the right to be an idiot?  do you really want to be seen as an uncompromising twat?
@SpeakerBoehner Don't cave!
@SpeakerBoehner WE DON'T WANT OBAMACARE AND GOP BETTER NOT CAVE AND GIVE THE LYING LIBERALS WHAT THEY WANT LIBERALS HAVE DONE SO MUCH DAMAGE
@carrietony35 @SpeakerBoehner liberals did damage? Duh, Cheney/bush crippled us with 2 wars. What is wring with you people???
@SpeakerBoehner The House will pass another bill to keep the gov't running. The gov't should b funded in timely matter. #FairnessForAll
@SpeakerBoehner Bust the bill up.
Send the Senate parts of the bill to be voted on individually ignore the Obama care part of the bill.
@SpeakerBoehner Lies! You don't care about fairness. You only care about your wealthy donors!
@SpeakerBoehner congratulations on your consistent commitment to utterly failing to represent the people of America.
