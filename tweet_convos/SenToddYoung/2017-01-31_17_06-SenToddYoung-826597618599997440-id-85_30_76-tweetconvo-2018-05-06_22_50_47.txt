You are going to hear from me a lot. No on Devos and no on Gorsuch
Lots of luck with that! His staffers keep telling me that he "does not share your views". Who does he work for?
I can't even get through and I've called a lot
Call his Indiana office. D.C. office has been un-reachable for 6 days
really are YOU ALL reading the same cue cards
Can you put together a video addressing my concerns about Gorsuch and autism? I've left detailed messages at all your offices.
-good luck because his views are not that of his constituents.When elected leaders go Rogue he 4got by ppl 4ppl
Government for & by the people only works if the people get involved. So let's call his offices & remind him.
.@SenToddYoung I DON'T support this guy; your constituency is diverse; his rulings are too conservative! Find someone closer to center!
it's about time we hear about the president's SCOTUS nominee. Merrick Garland has always seemed... oh, not that nominee
forgot to mention senate blocked all hearings on Garland. That is last precedent Senate Reps set. Is it Double Standard Day ?!
So did Obama.  His name was Garland.  Your party refused to have hearings.
, is he mainstream or a faithful constitutionist? Can't be both. Times change--SCOTUS is there to interpret the law.

Vote against Devos! She is not good for Indiana public schools, but I'm sure you said yes when you accepted her donation.
I am disappointed with your comments
Let me remind you what Republicans had planned for any SC nominee from a Clinton Presidency.
this candidate does not represent the majority of American's views.
so what are your thoughts on why you voted to confirm DeVos. Your constituents are waiting!
Sorry but your word is about as trustworthy as @ToddRokita @marcorubio @MitchMcConell and @SpeakerRyan
No to Sessions No to Bannon
you must vote no on Betsy DeVos
"Mainstream"? Are you out of your mind? Apparently, you care nothing about his history of stated discrimination. #RESISTANCE
Vote No DeVos No to Sessions No to Pruitt
Per @GOP orders we cannot confirm @SCOTUSnom during a campaign. #Trump already filed to run #2020
I think your "main" stream runs off the edge. Judge Garland was respected by both parties, and was not given a hearing. INSULT
so trump gives a fuck about the Constitution now? Like, in a historical sense. Doubt it. #sad
yes this statement about last Nov = hilarious. Trump not a constitutionalist.
"protect our most fundamental freedoms" apparently doesn't include access to contraception,healthcare, or public education
vote no on Devos.
I think you're a being a bit generous when you say "the people of Indiana."
yes. I agree you aren't speaking for me. Here is me talking: no on Devos. no on Sessions.
please vote no to DeVos, take away her money and she's no more qualified than I am to hold this position
- thanks for your faith in the Constitution. Too bad you don't value pub education or professional expertise among educators.
I can not claim ignorance to accommodate your lie.Fact is,  Gorsuch is a respected judge but is outside the mainstream.

well he isn't for women's rights so white males are happy
I am happy with President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the U.S. Supreme Court. Please support this nomination.
https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2016&cid=N00030670&type=I&newmem=N … for a full list of who bought our senator including Amway (ponzi scheme) and Blackstone - mercenaries
clueless!
your nose is a little brown there, sen todd. I suggest you pull back from the trump buttocks and start using your brain.
because temperament doesn't seem to matter to the republicans. See @realDonaldTrump for examples of what temperament isn't.
sir I had to stop the video tape once you got to the part where you thought the nominee had the right temperament
how about u put in Garland. this guy can get the next spot, seems right to me. Wonder what this constitutionalist wld think?
it's been 322 days since Obama nominated Garland.  Trump's been in office for 12.  How's that work?
didn't vote correctly on Devos; watched committee hearings. Stop following & lead Think for yourself!
I am a constituent and I have serious concerns about this nominee.He rulings on religion and women's rights are not mainstream
why are you ignoring your constituents?  #NoOnDevos #NoOnSessions
Thank you for your vote to confirm #SCOTUSnominee Judge Gorsuch.
I completly disagree with you and as a voter in Indiana I will NOT forget your faithful following the corrupt GOP cult!
I second that Todd.
why don't you answer your phones? Why can't people get thru?  Local media is watching
how much has this pick "donated" to your campaign? Going rate is what again? Should we ask DeVos?
I believe it's upwards of $20,000...
mainstream? Mainstream = supporting women's rights. He doesn't.
Gorsuch sided w/ religious employers limiting employees’ rights to birth control coverage. How does that protect freedom?
it's been a long time since I've looked forward to anything as much as I look forward to voting against you in 6 yrs
NO BETSY DEVOS! ! NO JEFF SESSIONS!
last count 32 comments against #gorsuch and 1 for in this thread. So what is your vote senator?? #SCOTUS #StandUpToTrump
we know that all of this is just lip service. His vote is in the bag. Leaves him more time to sniff after Paul Ryan.
thank you for FINALLY taking a stance as a party play thing. I appreciate this honesty. Sincerely, your constituent.
no he has not we want Merrick Garland he won't win another election
Hold on, Todd! I'll be the judge of that!
With only 1381 days until the next election, it would be irresponsible to bring Gorsuch up. Let the people decide #karma
you mention historic nominations but dont have issue w one year of blocking Obama pick #youaredishonest #yourenotarealman
Fellow Hoosier here Please confirm #NeilGorsuch for #SCOTUS
Will you make sure he gets the same fair treatment afforded Merrick Garland?
Merrick Garland is a mainstream and faithful constitutionalist also. Don't complain when Gorsuch is treated the same way.
I would love to say take the high road but that is what Republicans anticipate we will do. Not this time.
do you envision our republic becoming a theocracy, like Iran only christian? Yes or No. #biblewritersdidntknowwhatbacteriawas
You've already proven you can't be trusted to represent your constituents. Your "initial reaction" means nothing.
You should vote no on Betsy DeVos. Totally unqualified to lead anything related to education.
as a constituent of Indiana educators vote no on Devos, remember Bennett and his charter school grades! Turned F's to A's!
at the beginning of their terms, but not the end eh eh?
just like you have Garland an "up or down" vote?  Oh yeah, you didn't!
What about Merrick Garland
Sorry Todd. As long as you back this president. I do not back you or any of your decisions or thoughts.
he nominated Merrick Garland?
do you think our kids should be taught the earth is 6000 years old?
why are you ignoring your constituents?
because he knows he's guaranteed six years.  Doesn't need to pretend to care for atleast five.
What about at the end of President Obama's term?
are you kidding me? This should have been @BarackObama pick. Do not support any #Trump policies or nominees #SCOTUS
You approved someone who plagiarized their application to be Secretary of Education. Your opinion means nothing
when is the next senate vote for DeVos?
