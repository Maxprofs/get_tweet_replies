@Sherry09 @SpeakerBoehner dems useless? Like taking care of ur toofers. TG Obama was in there, Romney would sunk USA like he did w/MA
@SpeakerBoehner good, then raise the minimum wage, invest in our infrastructure, pass a good immigration bill.  let's get started.
@judyhess2 @SpeakerBoehner More important than raising minimum wage is to limit maximum of bankers etc.
@SpeakerBoehner  A far bigger problem than having a stronger economy is to address rising inequaliies
@SpeakerBoehner A way out of inequalities is here http://someitemshave.blogspot.in/2014/05/why-raising-and-fixing-minimum-wage-is.html …
