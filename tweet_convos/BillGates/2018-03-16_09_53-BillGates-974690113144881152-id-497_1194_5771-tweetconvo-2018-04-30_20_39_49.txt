Poverty is not a technological problem.
Yes, it could be. Technologically we can solve poverty problems. It’s possible anywhere in the world.
Poverty isn't created by lack of ingenuity. It's a product of political systems. These systems do not go away because you've figured out how grow food better.

Well, I can consider GREEN REVOLUTION a failure not because of it's superiority or productivity but after that the Poor farmers get into the vicious circle of POVERTY by becoming the easy scrap goats of some AGRICULTURE based BUSINESS MODELS
Same is applicable to any new RESEARCH
Wao.
 So nice to hear something INNOVATIVE in AGRICULTURE.
Developing some hybrid varieties of crops to reduce water consumption.
But do you really think that it will serve the poors. 
Green Revolution also have the same purpose but I can say a Failure in a country like INDIA
@Ibrothedon
Lol I read Rip project.

You cannot support agriculture by also supporting #Geoengineering, #SolarRadiationManagement, they don't mix, coward.
I'm guessing you're going to fund this too? Because it's just another way to alter our planet and humanity.  Go do something useful with your money man, stop being criminal!

As a student of Agricultural Engineering, I am eager to know whether do you have any vision regarding this important sector.
Check out @TERRA_MEPP to find out how agricultural engineers are transforming the way we monitor crops. We are going to use these ag robots to evaluate our crops in real-world field trials. https://terra-mepp.illinois.edu/ 
Thank you very much for your kind information. It is a great pleasure for me to learn about your teams contribution. Hope it will achieve its desired goal.

I have a question, how much is the most cost-effective for windows licenses to sell, 10 people need. I think 3. And can be transferred. So when you leave Microsoft, they are going downhill,do you think?

@Google I didn't receive my monthly payments for LICENCE fees from Google from 2015. I must attend to the meetings as major stakeholder as Google doesn't have LICENCE. GDPR & Data Protection Act is serious issue.
