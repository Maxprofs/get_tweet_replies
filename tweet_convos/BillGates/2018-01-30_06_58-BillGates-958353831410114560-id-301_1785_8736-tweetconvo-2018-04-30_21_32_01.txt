Since my early days as a programmer, I’ve been fascinated by computers. I was thrilled when @codeorg asked me to help them create a video series about how they work.

Do you know too much #technology and #ArtificialIntelligence could end human race?
Computer programmers and computer hacks are taught not to like Microsoft disk operating system and it's my favorite. I also think it's notable that I cannot afford a 2017 Apple iMac Pro.
My sister had a commodore Mac and Apple when I was 10. I was obsessed with the binary alphabet. The teachers at the Lutheran grade school I went to bought the student computers.
WORK IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND ORGANISE INALL THE WORLD. OUR HUMAN CIVILISATION LOOKS LIKE ANTS SOCIETY WHERE ACTIVITY ENSURES NEEDS SATISFACTION. DATA PROCESSING IS WONDERFUL

Good morning Sir
Thank you, Bill. I am looking forward to learning from the master!
I’m just thankful that we, and I’m sure I speak for most people in the world, have Bill Gates!
One of my biggest regrets is not learning to code in undergrad

Great Mr.Gates.U r an inspiration for ordinary people like me.

Good
God is smiling unto you. You're blessed.
DOPE
Disappointed that the geniuses at Microsoft store (Century City, CA) are not a bit more humble given Apple Store is full of guests (buyers & prospects) and MS store had less than a handful during same hour. Pls create a welcoming experience for ppl who have supported MS for yrs.
Awesome...

You Invented today's feature?  Bless you
Now I'm "thinking different!".  I'm sending these messages from my Apple iPad.
You are Wonderful?
Dear Bill, My first experience using a computer was professionally as a pharmacist.  And the software was Microsoft's MS-DOS.  Gradually I moved up to WindowsNT.  Then I purchased a personal computer system with the WindowsXP software.  Finally I moved up to Windows10.
Sir you’re a true inspiration for the world.
Please buy me a house Mr Gates. I'm here in South Africa
Gracias Bill, es muy importante que alguien que a los 14 año debug sistemas operativos y a los 15 diseñaba dispositivos basados en microprocesador haga este aporte.
An inspiration   ....for many programmers
Bill Gates,, 
You literally invented the future.
The greatest man on Earth. Thanks, Bill!

This is all great Bill but we have very important issues our country needs help with right now! Our Government is killing us! Please get involved !! You owe it to all of us!!
Did you have some scolarship like Bezos do? I mean maybe not of 33mlns, coz you are less rich now, but of couple mlns then. And not for DREAMers, maybe for all over the world than. Of course there will be  hysterical screeching all around like in his comments, but it can be fun.
thanks Bill
@BillGates 
#BillGate
Thank you for your innovation, you really an admired innovator.
@BillGates I have just coded a program which helps calculate they expenses and the income of a house. I would be delighted if you helped me and promoted me.
Better make some videos, maybe interviews abt people working until they have normal salary from zero. Like "I was intern and start with salary enough for rice, then I buy rod and catch frog, and than we go to ICO/IPO/C3PO/ETC & I get normal money". This kind of video I can watch.
You know yourself has been specially created and assigned job by the Almighty to spread the knowledge of computers on this planet.
@BillGates  my senior most father  please lend me $50,000 to start my tile cement industry.send me Vodafone mobile money on +233200791807
Your  knowledge, effort, dedication and Windows operating system made computers accessible to everyone. Which is made our life better.
niceeeeeeeeeeeee                               hi   Dear  SIR   ;  I DIDDEN REQUSET  TO YOU  FOR HELP      AT  YOUR  PERSONAL   ID   billg..............       frome        pervaizakhtar95@gmail.com          pls   accept  it       thans  a lot    with best   wishes
How do you feel about how awful windows 10 is? It's a big middle finger to longtime users. Why not have an option of one like 7 for those who like it?
I can't stop asking you Mr. Gates no matter what. Even if you ignore more 100 times. I will find 1000times not to give up. I will still hold the hope that you will help me. Am just raising money for tuition fee and accomodation. Here is my link once again https://gogetfunding.com/InternationalFoundationProgrammeAndLawdegree/ …
Total boring and absolutely unnecessary infos. Some video-shots was nice, but you can tell the same infos in couple sentences. And forget mentionet the main part - how to get job. Loose 5 years in college it's easy, but get normal salary not only for rice after this is real task.

You desire better sir.......but I think you are not satisfied. ...
That must be one mighty great experience&thrill!
We in africa, we shall forever be grateful for the great work you have done in africa.
God bless Africa
You are an inspiration!!!  #babyboomer
Hello bill Gates sir
You, the real hero in life
The biggest problem that the hi-tech industry refuses to acknowledge, is that computer code is wasted on inducing consumerism. We are marketed to death on the internet, & all those ads of buying & selling are killing the planet. Programming would be better-served designing a #RBE
hi Mr Billgates. you are very lukyman. i really want to be like you. but we have not any facilities because we learn in developing countries,
luky you,
i do love you
I have learnt alot using codeorg as a self taught programmer
