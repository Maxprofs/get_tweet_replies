You should read Turtles All The Way Down.
Good ???
You should donate to their Youtube channel, CrashCourse. They’re producing Youtube’s greatest educational content!
He already does. :) Its partially funded by the Bill Gates Foundation.
金をだすけど、やり過ぎない、方法として、思うに、自分達でやらせるべきなんでないかと思う。方法の一つとして、医大を造ったり、現地法人を造り自分達でやらしてはいかがと、そうすれば永く援助になるし、大量の金が一度に流れ込むわけでないため、みような金の動きが少なくなるのではないかな
Very good
Thanks for the review.
Also emphasises the importance of holistic care.
Treat the person not the disease!
My favorites God bless you two

how so sweet..  Books was always from the start a huge part of my son (now in heaven's life)  to memories of Jared
On topic the best novel I have ever read in my life so far was Ash A Secret History by Mary Gentle it's a big old book but one that was impossible to put down. Also had a huge impact on how I see women in my life and the wider world. Just a suggestion. Might give your book a go.
Lovely people
Hi Bill you should have a look at superhero therapy. It's a very good cause, and you seem to like good causes
