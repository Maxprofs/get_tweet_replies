@PrincessBravato @MarkWarner good  please dont let up until trump is gone
. What is the precident or legality of the Senate Intelligence Committee requesting Nunes come testify with them?
@PrincessBravato @MarkWarner hey it right, but get on with it. This could lead to a revolution against our Govt if not fixed
Your most important work will be unveiling Obama's spy network. You are lying and we know it.
Someone should let real Cherry know that her account has been hijacked.
.@MeetThePress @MarkWarner We must know w/o uncertainty the truth of the matter. What does the Prez know and when did he know it?
 @ILAttyGeneral @ChicagosMayor land trust equity theft! 95 pieces of properties for rent! Noel is migrant worker in @DeptofDefense unfit©™®
to look at Cherry's profile you'd think she was on the campaign trail with Trump. Trump troll. Block her.
We got that.  Bringing the president of the USA is your priority.  Maybe you should concentrate on work.
*in my life, there I fixed it for you
Are you going to pursue the truth no matter where it leads?
@AprilFDoss @MarkWarner Warner is no leftie he's centrist like Schiff. Don't be stupid GOP-just DONT.
yeah, he gave us Owe-bamaScam masquerading as health care law. No lefty? #joke
We stand with you in VA Senator!
This is a JOKE... Do your think Americans were persuaded by the RUSSIANS not to vote for @HillaryClinton 
That's besides the point.
thank you for doing this investigation on behalf of all Americans.
Flynn was on obummers team
Pathetic.
if this is true, you aren't doing your job very well and you're using this fraud as a smoke screen.
Really?  Just can't accept that 65 million WANTED Trump to be elected.  I wouldn't have voted HRC regardless.
It is also your biggest waste of time in your life.
your not going to get an independent commission. Pretty sure you've figured that out by now
We'll see.  You are probably right since the GOP doesn't want the truth to come out.
Sad for him, because the whole thing is a sham. Were not that stupid
Pretty sure you are.
go figure this out. People aren't believing news, they need hearings & findings from you! #TrumpisabadAmerican.
@POTUS unfortunately shows irrelevancy &partisanship of his tenure. No focus on what's most important to Americans
@page_8965 @MarkWarner Hope the Intel they're giving Trump isn't "COMPLETE" and the briefcase is empty.
I'll bet it is. Like chasing your tail!
then lets continue to find out the truth

Hey Warner looks like you're not very important, NO PROOF.
Exactly. So, why is Jeff Sessions still AG instead of gone? He is just a seat warmer.
@snowrose2222 @MarkWarner 
Tim Russert was real news. Meet the press currently is FAKE NEWS. Tabloid Journalism at its worst.
Dems have no ideas, period. One good thing about fake Russian story is you haven't called anyone a racist lately.
- TWITCHY LIAR MARK WARNER.
it's getting real folks!
#ColdWars? Oil & Communism Threat?—Near 2014 CIA admits role in 1953 Iranian coup http://bit.ly/2nCUy9A 
I'm guessing this might be one of those tweets you hope no one brings up in three months...

trusting in you to do it right Sen Warner
Warner is a silly sycophant. The sooner Warner, Kaine, & McAuliffe are gone, the better for Virginia.
.@MeetThePress @msnbc @MarkWarner How Many Decades Before We Learn @FBI /Party[s] Paint #ColdWar Picture? FBI & MLK
@MaryECosenza @MarkWarner let's hope honesty and truth are his guide.  And...if they are, please get him a food taster!
And, Mark Warner has lost it.
Oh contraire.  Mark Warner is FINDING it.  Good work Sen. Warner! We Virginians love you!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @MarkWarner Poor Warren. Another Dramacrat suffering from Jan Brady Syndrome (Russia,Russia,Russia!)
let's hope we all find out the truth, fight the clause no matter how long it takes, that is what justice is about
You betcha!
Warner for 2020? Stop licking your tongue! Yuk
Appoint an independent commission, that will be the most important thing you can do for this investigation.
Go Mark! Be our voice! And no Gorsuch confirmation til investigation is complete!
thank you Mr Warner
@AprilFDoss @MarkWarner Stay strong and alert. You're opposed by a filthy rich, devious, vindictive man. Also, Trump.
@SpeakerRyan @Rep_DevinNunes already proved that Congress can not be trusted. independent commission & prosecutor!
for President
Senator, we no longer trust #GOP. Plz support #US #MartialLaw & military tribunal to try #Treason & #HangTraitors
House Intel has Trump shills  Nunes & Gowdy, but Senate has straight shooter Susan Collins & "Little Marco" Rubio
NUNES has Russian partner getting money for wine distribution in Russia INVESTIGATE NUNES
he's right. smart man. Go get the truth @MarkWarner
What have you found??? We need to know!
keep up the good fight sir.  Counting on you
Keep the pressure on!  #Trumprussia
Maybe my letter (and call) to Sen. Warner played a role in shaping his views. We're closely aligned now.
Do not forget the harm that Gorsuch can do for generations to come.The future is not negotiable.Why reward Mitch?
Thank you Senator. Keep working for an independent commission. We need to know the truth.
This is of the utmost importance. We are a nation of Americans, not Russians. @MeetThePress @MarkWarner
Thank you Sen Warner, Independent Commission required.
Called office once re Russia & man said "You know he spends all day&night on this." I didn't.Tx SenWarner
Great stuff, @MarkWarner
most important thing should be fighting for working class rather than blaming Russians for corrupt HRC losing
Corrupt Corporation Fake News Boycott Boycott Boycott.
rusian bot! Sad!
I agree, Republicans & all conservatives are taking this hack and influence in our election to lightly. We forget!
so yo can talk about but when Nunen talks about it your party cries he can.t say anything. you are a fool
And for the past 8 years u had been doing nothing.
Nunez has to go, no question
But per, the 45th...Everyone will have health care Immediately! Lies as usual....
Mark the Nark thinks he's on to something. We'll see
the Republicans tried to Democrats the importance of Hilary opening up her email for the world to see-
thank you Mark Warner for all you are doing to get to the truth.
If Hilary & Podesta had not opened up their emails for the world to see half of this would not be a story
So sad you are getting your information from a con man.
OMG Warner is terrible on television. If Dems have any sense at all (which they don't) they will keep him off TV
@realDonaldTrump #PizzaGate is just one of many #fakenews stories that caused huge damage. #Election2016Sabotaged
Uh oh, another one that only watches Fox News.
The time is NOW to take back our country
Too bad it isn't going to change a thing Nark
What the hell has the entire intelligence community, ALL elected politicians been doing for the last 20 years?
Every G/D one of you act like this is brand new news. Or you all have had your heads up your asses for 20 years
when he goes on vacation does he look for BigFoot and other things that are figments of imagination or myth?
After Den. lost the election by cheating, news manipulation, big money. They believe Trump had to cheat to win.
do not believe the Dems -Hillary opened up her server-was easy for Russians to see-also Podesta
Too much DRAMA w/ no substance. Be careful when you arrive atcoclusion before u have gathered evidence. Witch hunt
Ruskigate is going to make Watergate look like a picnic in the park...follow the rubles
Well, @MarkWarner your life is very sad then.
Politics Politics. Where were you when Russia was hacking us during Obama admin? They did nothing.
It's of utmost important to us too Sen. Warner. You're doing a great job.
