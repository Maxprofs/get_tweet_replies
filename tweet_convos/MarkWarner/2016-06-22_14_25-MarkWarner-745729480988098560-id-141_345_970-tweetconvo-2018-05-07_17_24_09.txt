Senate voted and lost. Whatever happened to due process? Who regulates the watch list anyway??
You really do think we are all idiots.
So you want no due process? Dems are lying to you. Anyone can be on this list for arbitrary reason.
#NoBillNoBreak No thanks to Speaker Ryan. My husband and I are behind you!!
FBI removed Mateen from the KST list per Obama rules, which flags sale to known terrorist. So....
Why did you vote down the bill supported by NRA and gop that included due process for no fly? #sitin
For the same reason they supply people who commit genocide with weapons. #Hypocrisy
Bravo, Senator...
Revoke Dickey!!!
Some do not know when SHAME is appropriate. I blame their parents.
I'm a voter in VA...thank you for your support of increased gun legislation

I'm sure this will be rectified @MarkWarner @HouseDemocrats @ThomTillis & work to make America great again.

Sen. Warner: Sir, you have forgotten the issues Sen. T Kennedy had w No Fly. http://www.factcheck.org/2015/12/ted-kennedy-and-the-no-fly-list-myth/ …
how you get on that watch list is the issue.
Instead fighting the second amendment we declare war on Radical Muslim!
A reasonable response would be stopping Syrian refugees. Most Americans agree.
age 44 was too young to stop exercising and wearing heels for whatever looks good enough for work.

Thank you all for representing 90% of Americans!
Yea - our Senator from VA
You guys rock! Thank you!! #NoBillNoBreak
Thank you Mark! Tell the Republicans if they don't like your solutions, at least bring *something* to the table.
He voted against two of the four gun reform proposals.  He's equally responsible for none of them passing.
Yes, Lets sitin until the 5th Amendment is repealed and burned! Constitution is in the way!
