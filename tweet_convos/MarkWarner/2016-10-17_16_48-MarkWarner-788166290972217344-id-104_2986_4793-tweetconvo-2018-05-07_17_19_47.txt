Awesome view from 150 miles away! Congrats to launch team.....
I thought only the Russian rocket sent stuff up
we saw it from our state and it was amazing. Clear sky and it was only 90 seconds.
Congratulations! We paused our @GSCNC @girlscouts meeting to watch, had a great view from Bowie, Maryland!
It feels like this has been twenty years in the making @NASA @MikeWatson_VA @OrbitalATK @Space_Station but see seemless future integration.
. Watched from out local park
will you be docking on Sun with the @Space_Station  using the new universal docking ring that @SpaceX delivered this year?
