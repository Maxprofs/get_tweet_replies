Nunes should NOT be allowed in the closed session. He is a leaker & cant be trusted w/ classified info. If he's there Trump might as well b
Nunes is in the house, and I think he has recused himself from all things Russia!
Nunes is in the house but he hasn't truly recused himself,unfortunately.   Why we need an independent commission.
Yes - I tweeted my correction :) Yes, or if @GOP would get on board with country over party. They all know everything already.
This was confirmed from a reliable source in R politics.
Are we going to raise the standards to be eligible for president? This Trump bozo is proof the bar is too low.
Yeaaa, right when I thought I didnt know enough 2B President, well, Trump has inspired me. Wait, I have MORALS, CAN'T LIE & LOVE OUR COUNTRY
Great. What's this BS of repots that the @WhiteHouse is telling Fed Agencies to refuse to comply with Dem Oversight requests?
Thank you Mark Warner for having a backbone.  Hope this is the path to impeachment
Your honesty and hard work is so appreciated around the world. A good man fighting for democracy. Thank you, Sen Warner.

CANNOT WAIT. IMPEACH TRUMP.
Thank you both for all your hard, extremely challenging work. I so appreciate it and both of you! Looking foward to hearing Comey very much!
The House IC is going after the leaking and Obama domestic espionage program.  What is the Senate IC doing on that?
Good. But dingy side step questions! Don't try to ask unrelated questions you don't want answers to. See how it worked out for Gowdy.
Don't*

WOW

Kush has $1.2billion due in 2yrs on NYC tower w/o enough rent $$met Gorkov #Russiabank under sanctions

â€¦
I hope we get some answers and some resolution soon! @KeithOlbermann
I wish you would run for president in 2020.
Awesome, when Comey lies and he will, we can lock him up! Next we need to lock Hillary, Rice and Obama up! Hell, lock all Obama admins up!
I can't wait!  Please let it happen, don't let Trump stop this.  AMERICA NEEDS TO KNOW.
@SenatorBurr @MarkWarner If Comey is enjoined from testifying due to Executive Privilege, what happens next?
donnie!!! @realDonaldTrump they're coming for you, Ivanka & Jared..... we need to make the PRESIDENCY GREAT AGAIN, you have to go dear
I'm praying for this country that Comey takes Trump down by obstruction of justice and whatever else he has on him about Russian collusion.
They better move this along so we can impeach the whole lot of them. They are destroying America
Remember Comey isn't the enemy He will tell us, I truly believe, which the Americans are enemies! #COMEY #traitors #Countrybeforeparty
As a North Carolinian, I am particularly interested in whether @SenatorBurr will be inquiring about the assault on our democracy or leaks.
Thank you for your leadership.
@MarkWarner @SenatorBurr Thank you so much for going forward in earnest re Russian investigation. We're depending on you. God bless you both
As Trump allows Russian embassies to reopen!
I don't trust GOP (Government of Putin) They are attempting to help Trump cover up here: Russia hacked our election! They need to pay price.
Thank you protecting the Constitution and democracy!   
Ask him why he withheld information about the memo?
Let it happen. But Dems probably won't like what find. The left is far more entangled with Mosco (& Peking) than the Trump admin.
Congrads, can hardly wait.
Thank you!
Is this open to the public?? I live in the D.C. area; how do I get tickets to this?? Serious question #PleaseRespond
Joint statement with @SenatorBurr: Former FBI Director Comey to Testify at Senate Intel Committee Next Week 
Thank you Senator!
Bet you ten bucks it never happens
#ComeyDay
(2/2) He is doing ZERO to enhance the credibility of the entire committee and it's offensive to those of you actually trying to do something
can not believe there have been no arrests so far.gees they have 2 have enough info to hang trump and his goons
Senator, if you aren't swinging Nunes around by his tie (metaphorically speaking of course) then I'm concerned for the whole committee.(1/2)
Hell never testify. Sacrificial lamb will fall. Dem/gop  backroom shady deal..so we can come together and heal....I smell it, dont you Mark?
Lol
#MSNBC most of what Comey knows of significant substance, is classified, & can't be said in open. So how's this not just a media spectacle?
Comey to Commit PERJURY!!  Testilying??  Will Senate charge him with Perjury??
thank you!!!
Thank you, Mark.
Clearing my schedule!
Awesome!
That gives you and your cronies time to get your lies straight. You will probably still screw it up. @realDonaldTrump

Hey Warner-who really gives a damn?
Please don't let this be another Dems asking questions at the heart of the matter and Republicans about leaks or attacking the messenger.
It says the topic is Russian efforts to interfere in election.  This means he won't take questions about the firing.
Please keep him safe in the meantime.
What about Burr? Can we trust him?

#ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow collusion corruption obstruction of justice! @anticorruption
And you have proof of any of those how exactly?
Need to get more popcorn & beer!  #ComeyDay
@GOP, take note......That's MY SENATOR @markwarner doing his JOB!  Sincerely thank you Senator, a TRUE PATRIOT, so grateful to have u!!!
Thank you both for the bipartisanship between you on this very important matter.history will not forget who stood up for the American people
Too early2 praise bipartisanship
Reps put party b4 country.If bur finds the silver bullet, I'll hide it
I agree with you I'm just giving praise for what we have seen from them so far that could change at any moment if Burr starts acting shady
Thank you get these Russians out of our White House.
A big thank you from MA being a true American senator and also thank you to senator Burr for putting country over party
@FBI"15'I Sent Certified Letter @VAChair @SenBlumenthal that Senator @MartinHeinrich Let #VA Clinic Deny Care&got NO Reply=Clinic Banned Me"
@TheJusticeDept So My Aunt(Nun)Wrote #SenBlumenthal &He had #MarkWarner Tell her Me Contact My Senator who I Reported?=#ObstructionOfJustice
Traitor trump Benedict Arnold trump . He sold the untied States out ...
Thank you! You are a true patriot, Senator
You need the tax returns
@MarkWarner Thanks! I wonder if this will be a "teachable moment" in integrity, discipline and respect.
Is Sen Burr going to be first Republican to put country before party?
Applaud the fast action!
