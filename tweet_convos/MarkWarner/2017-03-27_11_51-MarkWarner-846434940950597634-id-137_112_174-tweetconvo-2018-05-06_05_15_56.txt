, During Trump's campaign you stated "There is no separation between Trump & myself." Do you still feel this way? @MarkWarner
I'm nervous about this and the fact that Trump team reached out to Burr to squash the NYTimes story.
Me too, @emilysumiko.  Most people are saying the Senate will be more bipartisan than the House, but GOP keeps acting like it has one brain
they definitely would like to use the massive amount of power they have to enact legislation. So many aren't calling out Trump...
I've only heard McCain and Graham not speak in GOP-Groupthink. I wonder if the rest realize how compromised they all sound.
How many are you hearing clear Trump of wrongdoing? I'm mainly hearing silence from GOP Congress. Not weighing in.
It's all the nonsense with Nunes this week.  Paul Ryan sees no reason for him to recuse. Chaffetz said he had "integrity".
chaffetz also demanded 7 Benghazi hearings. He couldn't find integrity if it slapped him.
will he be under oath? Or is this another attempt at Dog and Pony parade pretending cooperation
We the people demand an open hearing & that jared kushner testify UNDER OATH! #trumpRussia @CNN @MSNBC
If this had to do with @HillaryClinton trump would we whining 24/7 how behind closed doors is #corrupt
can't wait to you get to Podesta & Clinton speeches for the defunct foundation.  What about Hillary's uranium sale?
Why are you holding up the enquiry by failing to sign off on  requests and subpoena of documents? Why are you protecting traitors in the WH?
Mark Warner is leading you around like a blind man.Get a backbone...
I don't care if the Russians had any influence, I want you to start working as a team, get tax reform & repeal ACA
Says the #RussianBot. Go eat your #borscht - we aren't falling for your crap anymore.
We American people have right to hear if not will add more fuel distrust our nation. Those who hate USA like it.
lots of info re Russia from @Khanoisseur he's been researching and writing for months
Hysterical that now Liberal's care about breaking the law. Fast N Furious, Libya, IRS scandal and HRC? Not a word
Enough time to scrub-a-dub his files, phone, emails, etc. We need a #selectcommittee and #IndependentCommission
.@SenatorBurr .@MarkWarner This is great...good job....will we get to hear more on the Uranium deal and the Clinton family?
your NC #RedState #illegalVotingLaws suppressed democrat votes: #TRUST to investigate #REPUBLICAN #CORRUPTION? #HUGERISK for US
Hold a Town Hall for your contiturents , get some backbone from Lindsey Graham !
.@SenatorBurr @MarkWarner What about @PodestaGroup? They worked for Sberbank in 2016 while under sanctions. https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1826611150924572&id=1823893357863018 …
Why waste taxpayer's money.  Hillary people satisfy Congress by pleading the fifth.
Just put Trump under oath, ask him pertinent questions, watch him squirm and listen to his lies!
#2 Free market solution for healthcare. Get Gov't out of business of healthcare all together. Not a citizen's right
our debt of gratitude for this investigation into Russia/Putin US interference! Thank you sirs-
you and McCain should join the Dems. Podesda ? No comment huh?
- Under oath, yes? Please televise. We need some information.
I believe @jaredkushner impulse to volunteer testimony reflected his realization of SSCI's subpoena power.
These investigations will be useless unless you are willing to follow the money!
.Voluntary? U think we are stupid? Please, rethink. We are usually way ahead of you, way, way, ahead
To be aboveboard, all testimony should be #underoath & #televised
If televised then the whole story won't come out anyway, just the unclassified information.
Senators on behalf of my state, Calif. I ask you to fulfill this duty without party conflict-TY
Jarad is well crafted learned from his father. Corrupt him in WH dirty gloves we Americans know. Trump 4 family.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Sen Burr & Sen Warner !!!!!!
hardly joint when Warrner is already saying poor clinton lost because of russians
Kushner met with rep of SANCTIONED bank w/ties to Putin and KGB. Needs to be UNDER OATH #Russiagate #Trumprussia
We the people demand an open hearing & that Jared Kushner testify UNDER OATH!! #TrumpRussia #Russiagate
@funder
all questioning needs to be under oath. I am hoping that is the case.
the longer the Senate waits, the more damage occurs.  Your Country need a hearing ASAP. Trump is a bad American.
THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A WITCH HUNT.I WLD CHK INTO OBAMA ILLEGALLY GATHERING INFO ON TRUMP. THAT HAS PROVEN TRUE
I hope you will chair your committee with integrity, unlike Nunes.  We, the taxpayers, want answers!
NC voter who would like to say: Don't pull a Nunes Senator Burr!
, I think you know the FBI is closing in on  Trump/Russia.  Please do not end up on the wrong side of this. 
@MarkWarner
.@SenatorBurr Many of us are very concerned that you may "pull a Nunes" on this. This article shows why http://ln.is/www.politico.com/sto/exY4Y …
@MarkWarner
Please do a full inv of #TrumpRussia. The House has failed, so it's up to the adults in the Senate to find out what's going on.
Walter Jones is making NC proud. You should do that too.
please swear him in. Can you also get Yates seeing the other committee is obviously not going to be able to
End the coverup. This is bullshit.
Productive? I know that there is no limit to greed & lies to con all of voting power in the US. You're a lame duck.
- Thank you! Country before party for once!! Get them all under oath.
RICO law is far reaching. Please let your Republican parts know. No one is above the law.
the Kushner's were vacationing in Colorado same week as billionaire Russian was vacationing at the same time...
did you notice that @jaredkushner #DELETED all of his tweets???  HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
#Russia
So he can lie because he will not be under oath.
Under oath?  You & your party are compromised puppets with no credibility. #treason
Thanks Chair & Ranking Member
Please put country before party, please

Who will file #obstructionOfJustice against @POTUS @presssec @DevinNunes? @NATO @UN @GCHQ
@NATO @UN @GCHQ Trump's @EPA action today is the first of many to come blows against all humanity. #HelpTheUSA #CrimesAgainstHumanity https://twitter.com/damejemarshall/status/846124746081165312 …
We haven't witnessed such tom fuckery from one party as we are seeing by Republicans since Watergate 
#TrumpRussia
Reince let Nunes in WH
We need a criminal investigation
& OPEN PUBLIC HEARINGS

This is the USA NOT RUSSIA
Excellent progress, Senators. How and when will the findings be relayed to the public? Please don't #Nunes this.
Please do not put party before country. That is unforgivable.
WE WANT AN INDEPENDENT PUBLIC INVESTIGATION NOW
Never Forget 

@SenatorBurr & @DevinNunes called Reporters to try to get them to stop writing about Trumps Russian Connections
@MarkWarner
Kushner's voluntary participation is like someone showing up at a police station voluntarily as arrest warrant is being issued.
will any part of his testimony be public?
humm https://twitter.com/marcusc22973194/status/844591780637085696 …
Great, sell to the highest bidder burr will take care of vetting... good grief
@scyeatts @MarkWarner Why does the meeting need to be "productive for all sides"? Isn't Putin one of the sides? Or Dem vs GOP?
Burr, we're waiting to see if you pull a Nunes.
Senator you openly remarked about putting a bullseye on HRC during campaign Americans can trust you 

you are my senator -(zip 27606).  I am watching you.  Please do your country proud.  This is the time to be a hero
who authorized Nunes at wh gate? Who authorized the SCIF?
a lot about that came out tonight
Thank you for your efforts on this. Also, it appears that @jaredkushner is cleaning up his twitter feed. Sad.
Thank you
Burr muat recuse himself or put Kushner under oath. Hold accountable for lies unlike Sessions who lies under oath
Where's your statement about calling the press on behalf of the WH to ask them to suppress coverage and their investigations?
if not under oath then why bother? Counting on you to dig deep or Special committee is in order.
OK. Thanks. Seems like he's being handed w/ kid gloves. Trump-Kushner crime family should get no special treatment.
Burr, your little run to press with #Nunes, on behalf of #POTUS, puts you in the same boat as #Nunes. Indep Invest
Can I testify? I will confess. The Russians drove me to the library and made me fill in the circle for Trump.
Under oath, if he lies he must be subject to criminal charges! If not, forget it Buryakov out in 10 months? Not 30?
AFTER JFK US Code 3110-Employment of Relative&Restriction Pub.114-38. Trump doesn't think he has to F our laws!
We don't know WHO is President any more! Kershner/Bannon or Ivanka! what happen to U.S Code 3114 NO RELATIVES?
Burr, you proved you can't be trusted just like Nunes. We need an independent investigation
interview needs to be conducted under oath by an independent committeeYou have already proven you can't be trusted.
should only be done under oath or it will be useless
please make this an open forum not hidden behind closed doors! I feel an independent investigation is called for!
If everyone is not under oath, then just stop now with this charade.
You're  1 of my Senators and can I no longer trust you.  You're far too much Trump/Bannon's man.  Independent commission now!
I that's like letting the fox guard the hen house. How about an INDEPENDENT investigation
hope you have corroboration. Nobody in that administration deals in truth so far.
party over country = you're fired
under oath?
put him under oath
I believe we must have an independent commission looking into all this.
voluntary doesn't mean volunteer
@WomenSaveUSA @MarkWarner Wondering if you @SenatorBurr ,can be trusted!?!
Senators, we are depending on your intergrity and your honesty.
Am I supposed to be impressed that he complied with a criminal investigation?
Will these "volunteers" be under oath?
Can you just ask all WH staff if they have connection to, or interests in, Russia instead of doing it piecemeal?
*connections*


Fri-3 & Sat-4 before elec. are 2 very notable days. Note the timing of FBI/Comey #TrumpRussia investigation events: http://bit.ly/2lZQX1Q  
https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/ …
We need an independent investigation. You and your colleagues in the House have proven you cannot be trusted.
if he was hiding anything do you think he would just voluntarily talk to you? I don't think so get over this shit
You better look into what hes trying to hide by deleting all his information....pretty sure that's gotta be illegal?
I'm hopeful that senate committee doesn't make same horrendous gaffe that Nunes pulled. Terrible stunt
Of course he will comply.  Did you really need a PR to indicate he volunteered?
He should be under oath for this.
So the Shadow Government includes a bunch of RINOs like yourself too? Shove it where the sun don't shine!
Why did @jaredkushner delete all his tweats??
unless it's under oath, it's worthless, of course.
Televised? under oath?  Would prefer an independent investigation that won't be bought like you will
Rich and Mark, NC and Virginia tell me that they Like Jared. Treat him nice. #Tatiana
Thank you for demonstrating to your House colleagues how to operate in a bipartisan way.
You're a nothing and always have been!
are you going to interview him under oath?
Need special committee....but go ahead and obstruct justice.
Why did Nunes go 2 Ryan before going 2 WH? Doesn't this mean Ryan knows details of Nunes' "secret" info?
So did he volunteer or was he called? You're saying both
