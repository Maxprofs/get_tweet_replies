TODAY: Senate Intel Cmmte press conference w/@SenatorBurr on #Russia. Follow livestream at 2:30 PM on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/markrwarner 
@SenatorBurr Senate Intel Cmte is a stabilizing voice of reason in perilous times for our nation. Good job gentlemen.
There you go already..IMPARTIAL?? BS..first words..should release tax returns!! You're nothing but another partisan DEM CLOWN.
Republicans blocked it yesterday. Go to them. They are aiding & abetting Trumps conflicts & possible corruption
Nice try..but completely UNTRUE. Period.
obviously you don't follow our government so you are a troll.
Obviously you have an IQ just under 70...but I'n glad you found a 3rd grader to spell 'TROLL' for you.
The simple truth: without Russia's help we cannot win the war against Islamic terrorism.
Ur a terrible & unpatriotic person. Accept the election results. Hillary benefited from non-indictment of felonies & media bias
Russian troll.
Stop projecting
Proud you're our senator! A true "Statesman"  So nice to see in comparison with GOP congress...

Using politics to try to bring down our President.  Investigate Clintons,  Podesta & others w/ Russia con. @realDonaldTrump
Retire! Your red face shows that u HATE @realDonaldTrump! You know @Rep_DevinNunes has good intel! Dems r scared...
We knew all along! #SusanRice
You sir are a hack. Keep searching. For those Russians. There in the Dems. Party. NBC. Did more to sway votes than Russia
I second that. You sound as bipartisan as sheppard smith sounds conservative. We know Russia is a BS cover up
everything is russia. Who made money on Russia. Podesta. Who ok. Russian deal. Hillary. Shep smith is an ass
John McCain also has Russian friends in high places
both sides in government are tainted along with intelligence agencies. 
Wasn't the Bush regime republicans
Poppy Bush = GrandDaddy of deep state. Recruited WJC while in school. Party brand names veil the truth
Great job on this important matter. Putin's destabilizing efforts against democracy are a global threat not just US
Of course, YOU are the primary voice of reason. You've always been able to work across party lines.
The only person I trust on that committee right now is @DevinNunes esp given the breaking news about Farkas.
Russia influencing the election is like the Grinch stealing Christmas! It's a myth! Now go replace OCare & build my wall.
Please vote to confirm Gorsuch
please don't investigate hillary or podesta because we  love them cuz they like to give us free stuff, please, please, mommy.
thank you!!! #resist
Try to control your palpable anti-Trump bias during hearing. You showed bias today saying Trump's allegations unfounded. Really?
Who un masked the names? Why did Obama spy on Trump team? Why are you pushing a Russian story when all know USA interfered in Israel?
I don't know who paid for your Education but they should DEMAND A REFUND! You are not that smart! #TCOT #WakeUpAmerica
#Congrats @MarkWarner for wasting time, energy & tax $ to investigate the #Russia narrative... NEXT will be #China. #Clueless #Dupe
You are just so, so happy in your anticipation of bringing Trump down.  So Russia thought Hillary a better candidate?? Really?
Russian trolls are out
Months and months of this same stupid and some still think it's valid & original. Heh.
Start Investigating the Corruption Obama/Hillary heaped upon our doorstep not some fantasy Russian boogeymen•ENOUGH wasting time
how come your not investigating the Clintons and Podesta's relationship with Russia we have more proof on them then on president
#IMPEACHTRUMP
what are you going to do when it turns out to have been the dems own IT guys that hacked in for pos obama?
Thank you Sir! #GodblessAmerica America first-Russia last!!!
Mark, the world is about see in you what we in Virginia already know. Which is your integrity, smarts & toughness is first class
RE_LITIGATING the election..is EXACTLY what you want to do! STOP acting like you're an impartial participant You're anything BUT
I no longer trust that you, the Senate, or the House can conduct an honest, real #TrumpRussia investigation. Independence now!
Warner just made that painfully obvious.He just said that Russia meddled with intent to favor Trump. NO PROOF!
Umm...the PROOF that Russia tried to win election for Trump came from the analysis of 16 American Intelligence agencies. Period.
Lynn, save your breath. These are Putin bots.

@Pamela_Moore13  Freedom Watch is a Political hack org that  supported Bush & WMD. SMH.
100% disgusting with NO facts to substantiate Ur witch hunt. #Globalist shills R testifying to cover up all the criminality Dems engaged in.
I wish you thought of the #ACA as serious and maybe you would not have to brag that it needs fixing
Intresting. Will this include investigating the Clinton ties as well?
Thank you for putting country before party.
LOCK CROOKED HILLARY UP!!
nice to see a statesman like approach in the Senate. Your occasionally bi-partisan.
Thank you Sen. Warner and all members of the Senate intelligence committee for coming together and putting Country above party.
@SenatorBurr Thank you for doing your job as elected officials should, we need more people like you. Appreciate your hard work!
Bet you make it partisan.
Russia? #WTF pres Candidate Sell #Uranium 2 #Russia n Return 4 #MILLIONS that #Finance #Canidate YET NO #ClintonEmails 2 Show
an investigation on these guys?
Same hoods that didn't prosecute HC on Benghazi, so....don't trust these two. Maybe going to make stuff up? We should assign 1/2
@senatorburr Thank you for being independent, responsible adults.  Good luck to your Intel Committee.
I have held you in higher esteem than you now deserve.  ARE you talking about the release of the HILLARY E mails?

Thank you, Mr. Warner.
SickObama ordered CIA interfering French election,but this time people of #France won't be so stupid #Marine2017 #AuNomDuPeuple
#factsmatter
.@devingnunes: "I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the President-elect and his team were, I guess, at least monitored…" 
@SenatorBurr I have not seen either of you before but today's news conference was impressive: decent, clear as possible, 1/
...bipartisan. After listening twice, I am currently more confident your committee is going to live up to its duty. Thank you for your work.
Why won't you investigate a 'real' crime?
BREAKING New Huma Abedin Emails Reveal Clinton Emailing Classified Info & Talk of Special Favors for Clinton Donors http://jwatch.us/mJANeK 
As a concerned citizen I demand Hillary be investigated for any ties to Russia.

Ur parties inability to except Trump as president is a sad reason to burn ur country to the ground and the ppl in it! #NeverDem
Very clear u r smoke screen for something... this behavior from adult leadership for a country is pathetic and irresponsible!
Thank you Senator Warner!
TY Sir for your continued perseverance to get to the truth. This isn't about party. It's about our freedoms/country. Patriot!
...thank you sir for saying that this is the most important thing that u have ever taken on in ur public life! We r counting on u
@FoxNews @mitchellvii @SenatorBurr  @realDonaldTrump Bias showing @MARKWARNER ! Trying to counter how Dems feel about @Rep_DevinNunes ? 
thank you for advancing your committees objectives America needs to know who the real Donald Trump is and who  his friends are !
#wednesdaywisdom #factsmatter
BREAKING: Nunes says "The American people would not be comfortable reading what I have read re: Surveillance on Donald Trump " #ObamaGate 
.@MarkWarner Good job at press conference....get a good look at that Uranium deal and the Clintons & Russia...that concerns most Americans
Disgusting! Pushing fake conspiracy theories! The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming! You sorry PO
great work!
thank you for conducting a cooperative bipartisan inverstigation
@SenatorBurr Thank you for restoring my ability to believe that democracy can survive this.
Will they be under oath?
@SenatorBurr Thank you for helping restore faith in Congress to conduct critical objective investigation! Setting the standard
Pathetic... I have less faith than ever! You ppl are joke! This is the crap that got Trump elected!
Why would they favor Trump when they got EVERYTHING THEY WANTED WITH OBAMA AND HILLARY? STRAWMAN WILL BITE YOU! #OutDems2018
Mr Warner certainly hope your words of being committed to finding the truth also included democrats ties to Russia as well
We already know Clinton has ties to Russia. Took money from them. Sold uranium to them. #wednesdaywisdom
shhh you'll scare them away, they don't like facts
oh snap...here come facts.,.quick take shelter in a campus safe space!
Something isn't adding up #Hillar #Obama #Podesta started this mess with #Russia #Uranium now Russia sells Uranium to Iran? WTH
If Putin wanted a weaker America after the election, he would have wanted Obama's policies to continue and Hillary elected.
Can't wait to hear Sally Yates' testimony!
And speaking of investigations, how's the investigation of Obama's interference in Israel's elections coming along?
Excellent  press conference -- reassuring. Thank you for your openness and integrity.
I am concerned over liberal propaganda. The influence on our elections and daily lives.
Thank you, Senators, for promising to get to the bottom of this.
It's evident by your answers you are just like Adam. This is a witch hunt because Hillary lost the election!
Eva, Hillary is never going to be President.
you wear you contempt for @realDonaldTrump openly, it's the one transparency democrats maintain. #russianinfluence #MAGA
Your words would carry  more weight, had  they also been said, about the Hillary/Podesta Uranium one deal.
talk about Obama interfering with Israels elections your pathetic excuse for a Senator.
Just funny.
@SenatorBurr 
This would be so much more credible had Obama not interfered in Israeli election  trying to oust Netanyahu
Don't forget his input into Brexit.
The arrogance of Obama making speech in another country telling citizens of said country how to vote
And what do we do in the meantime? Let Trump tear the USA apart? No more new legislation until we know who Trump works for!
Trump works for we the people. It was Killary who sold uranium to Russia! Russia had NOTHING to do with my vote!
thank you senator , we need investigation in trump / Russia ties
@SenatorBurr Disappointed that your remarks didn't mention that investigation includes potential #TrumpRussia collusion. Sad.
Burr spoke to reporters from a call that the White House arranged to say that there was no evidence. NOT credible.
You people are completely insane.  This is all political and we are paying for this asinine waste of time.
I would like the liberal media and it's influence on Americans look in to.  I call it propaganda on steroids.
Just CAN'T wait until you've wasted our TAX PAYER money...and come up with NOTHING when all has been investigated!
That was Benghazi troll
this was a Hillary troll
#wednesdaywisdom
BREAKING : FBI's #2 Andrew McCabe who's wife was given 700K by Clinton/McAuliffe may be one of the wrong doers in Donald Trump unmasking etc 
Get back to school sweetie. You're gonna miss Science class!  #WednesdayWisdom
#Chesapeake Virginia: Mark @timkaine @TerryMcAuliffe are doing money laundering here in Peake for their PACs. STOP Them! Tatiana
