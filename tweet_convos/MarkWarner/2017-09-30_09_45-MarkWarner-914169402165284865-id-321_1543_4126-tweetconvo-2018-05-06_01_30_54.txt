Trump attacks mayor of San Juan: 'They want everything to be done for them' http://politi.co/2fyw24i  
Do you think that letting trump know what EMPATHY is that he'll actually become EMPATHETIC?
HAHAHA
HAHAHA
HAHAHA
Ka Trina Trump seems an appropriate moniker.
Thank you for recognizing how most of the country feels.
That sums up what we all need. #DemsForgingFuture
Yes. We are now witnessing a public dereliction of duty by @potus45 - and all who serve him, not their country @whitehouse / #TrumpfailedPuertoRico
-
@ezlusztig / @NYMag / @MarkHarrisNYC / @MelissaJPeltier / @GovHowardDean
Sometimes doing as little as possible makes the big bucks. #45isaDomesticTerrorist #Capitalism #Kleptocrats
Economics: shift relief efforts to the people & they buy at retail prices. 

The effort is uncoordinated so more gets sent than…
what are you doing to help mark?  you never respond to me why are you so afraid?
#Trump lacks empathy and social graces!!
Mr. Dump on everyone that doesn't serve him is incabable of empathy.  IMPEACH!!!
Say it Mark ..but he’ll NEVER have it! #ImpeachTrumpNow
Ian calling  all Americans for Donald Trump impeachment
All these liberal whinners who just like hollyweird hasn't done a dam thing but criticize others.
Truly disrespectful!  So, our president says “G_d bless America, EXCEPT for Purrto Rico.”
Word of the day: stupidity the opposite of smart
I refer to Trump as the accidental human.

YESSS, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is "worthy of full protest"! https://twitter.com/theironfront1/status/914094302711750656 …
Zero empathy.  Zero compassion.  Black heart.  Would love to be a dictator.
He is a P of S!
She's a political hack embarrassing herself while trying to make Trump look bad.
Port is filled to capacity with needed supplies. Problem - No Drivers to deliver thanks to " "Teamsters" striking in PR!
He so pathetic!
You can't teach empathy to a narcissist.
Thank you! I tweet that word at least once a day. Only a heartless bigot misusing his position for personal gain wouldn't be able to go so
Sen, there is no people-helping-people news coming from the PR, vice recent disasters elsewhere. I'm not where @potus is, but not far behind
'Empathy' word got deleted in his lexicon -the day he got elected as POTUS
He never had it. He's only about himself. Not about Republicans nor Dems, nor 3rd party. He's the Party of One. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Your word of the day should be HYPOCRITE.
@politico Sir I believe while our President is working on empathy you also could use a lesson and not just where convenient.
"Ipathy" is how Cray Cray pronounces it!
@politico @realDonaldTrump Brains=noun. Abilty 2 comprehnd what hurricns & floods r, what no food/watr mns, what PPL R DYNG MNS!
Trump has once again undermined the Sec of State and threatened North Korea. What are YOU doing about this?
#invokethe25thamendment  NOW!
I truly believe that @realdonaldtrump has a problem w/his brain--I think he should be committed for a complete physical/mental evaluation
He is a disgrace to all that is good and right in this country: https://teachwellnow.blogspot.com/2017/09/trump-marks-turning-point.html …
Empathy would be a foreign word to Trump!
Empathy = something Trump doesn't have and could never buy with all if his money.
You mean Putin's money?
Sorry, but Trump only uses adjectives/or made up words, bigly.
Word of the year. The word, the act this nation should focus, meditate, and pray on. Without empathy, we're toast.
He is devoid of anything but feelings for himself. Rs elected a pure narcissist
Word of day for Warner is obstruction and continuing the division of OBAMA at any cost to country
Second word of the day: Narcissism -   @realDonaldTrump
Hard to feel when "empathy " with a narcissistic personality disorder. Just sayin
With respect Senator it is past time to begin impeachment proceedings in the House followed by removal in the Senate.  Pick your charges...
So u are feeling what OJ is feeling: you have just left the darkness of a locked up idea
Wow , she had time from all the devastation to have tee shirts made up ..get lost with your left liberal bias
Congress needs to act & help PR. How can u stand back & not take action. Ppl r dying. T is irrelevant, we have no leadership there.
Narcissistic personality disorder, ppl with an inflated sense of their own importance a deep need 4 admiration & a lack of empathy 4 others
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @CNN Narcissists r incapable of empathy. If there's nothing in it 4 POTUS he does NOTHING #DerilictionOfDuty #Failure
Or "sympathy." Regardless, he's incapable (and uninterested) in expressing either emotion.
#Trump strategy - discredit ANYONE who dare criticizes him. But even supporters are wising up to his total lack of character & credibility
Word of the day: Dotard!
Don't expect anything good to come from this president he is unable and knows nothing about empathy we need to get him out. Focus on 2018
Respectfully sir, I am going to take the day off and enjoy the show, when you tweet " word of the day: impeachment. "
Hahaha : sound made when laughing into the abyss that is a Trump soul
Please do everything you can to get this clean out of office ego bastard #LiarInChief #russia #fraud #corruption #WhiteSupremacist
People who are incapable of empathy are sociopaths and never developed emotionally beyond 3 years of age.
He is bereft of that emotion. A fact which he displays over and over again.
He has no ability to empathize understand or govern! There has to be a way to get him out of our Whitehouse
Probably not good that he spent the day golfing
Did he not just break the news that #PuertoRico is an island? Where else are they supposed to get their food, if not from others?
Where are GOP?
Inability to feel empathy= severe pathology often related to criminal and violent behavior
Real smart.. bad talk the guy that's saving your ass
Only good natured animals understand empathy. Trump is a monster so he doesn't qualify.
Trump is incapable of empathy, as are many of his supporters. It's just not in their DNA...quite literally.
Definition of tone deaf..see @realDonaldTrump tweets statements and breathing..
Sir, while i understand PR is our first priority, I struggling to understand why the Russian sanctions have not been imposed.
He's incapable...
Lack of empathy is the disease, everything else is just a symptom.

Word of the day, #impeach #resign #evil #narcissistic 
#25ththe45th 
So many and none good.
While he is playing golf! Let them eat cake!
Sociopaths don't possess this quality.
Sad!
Skip one trip to @Starbucks this week & donate that money  to our Americans in Peurto Rico. That $5 will help!
Have any GOP pols responded to his narcissistic paranoia this weekend?
It's not something that Trump has the ability to feel, EVER
trump: I live by three words. Money, Power and Racism. That’s it nothing more.
 Awesome. TY Mr. Warner.
You are spot on with empathy.  Maturity is also fitting for Trump.  Although it's a little too late for Trump to grow beyond toddler stage.
Empathy: the one thing of which a narcissist is incapable.
He has a different dictionary
I know, just brutal, Mark? https://youtu.be/98drMIow4Rg  When you guys come back to reality a great opportunity w/ Semprius, $SSNI $Cree and Jim?
Unfortunately, his being a narcissist and possible sociopath,he is incapable of empathizing with people.
It's foreign to trump.
I kinda like the new snarky @MarkWarner more than the old geeky one. 
Trump Side Story...
Mayor of SJ: "Puerto Rico, my heart's devotion..."
DJT: "Let it sink back in the ocean"
As a fellow American is there anything U can do to help all Puerto Rico & t Caribbean Islands; Can't more military manpower be sent? PLEASE
Can we get an impeachment yet?
Empathy, sympathy , we're voting you sorry butts out when your turn comes around ! understand?
#25thamendment
Narcissists have no empathy.
I agree
@SenSchumer @SenWarren @maddow  Possessing empathy requires a heart.  Instead of a heart, DJT has a void. #ImpeachTrump #resist #PRStrong
Narcissism : a mental defect that prevents one from experiencing empathy
He doesn't know they are Americans.
He's dangerously unfit; pathological liar 
I thought the word of the day was "misleading" seems to be what you are doing
Narcissists are incapable of empathy. Clueless since only they matter
Trump has a terminal #empathydeficit
Also something Trump will never have. He is a heartless soul less shell of a human being. #StandWithCarmen #PuertoRicoReliefNOW #PuertoRicanLivesMatter #PuertoRicoStrong #PuertoRicansAreAmericans
That word is not part of his vocabulary.
Very proud of my senator. This is the man the Democrats should run in the 2020 election. Bring dignity back to the office.
Perhaps you worry about Russia Russia Russia

Trump's word of the day is always "me"
Trump is right. The Mayor is a left wing tool
You didn't have any "empathy" when you passed Obamacare and hurt the finances of millions. To make things worse, you and your democrat colleagues doubled down on failure.
So does he. Somebody tell me one thing he's done on his own except golf. Even then I'm sure he has a caddy.
obtuse-noun meaning not quick or alert in perception, feeling, or intellect; not sensitive or observant. Defines our government.

Says the man who has never had to lift a finger for himself in his life.
Which is something BLM cannot do, it is a selfserving color coded club, just like the KKK.
No..the word of the day is "impeachment"...the Amer ppl are tired of being held hostage by this little man in the WH!
Sadly, the word that I find myself using way too much since the beginning of Dystopia is the eff word and I can't help it!!
He has no empathy because he is a sociopath.
Nudnik - noun - A pestering, nagging, or irritating person; a bore. (See @MarkWarner )
Trump doesn't have a command of the English language such that he would understand the meaning. He needs to be removed now.
More and more obvious it's time for the #25thAmendmentNow
Frome the fake doctor?
This @potus is not what the founding fathers envisioned this has gone on far too long it’s time for him to go.
Hurry up get his sorry ASS out
Agree Sir! #ImpeachTrump  please get a rally going! @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats
I thought you were hunting Russians?  Seems like you're only good at criticizing the President.  You and Kaine are useless!
What kind of person is Donald Trump. I have never heard such a self centered cold "Son of a Bitch" such as him.
POTUS needs to be shortened to POS for this guy
Trump has none!!!
It's fruitless to tell a powerful person to have empathy when they have never exhibited empathy. Just cut off their power. #Impeach
Trump: synonym for lack of empathy.
Thank You.
Why can't you do something about Trump. He thinks this is all about him. For the love of God take his phone away.
So true Senator. Thanks for your outlook.
Twitter allowed the Russians to blocked and deleted my account 3 times during election because I supported Hillary Clinton.@MichaelEDyson
@MarkWarner we need him out. He does not deserve the office. My heart hurts seeing what is happening on all fronts. TY 4 all u do.
It sure seems like trump moving forward w/ his Ethnic Cleansing plan by hiding in Bedminster last weekend, then distracting w/ NFL rankling.
@politico not to be flippant, but also a good episode of the original Star Trek
Word of the day ‘sociopath’
President Trump, How much help would you be if you had NO FOOD & NO WATER for 10 days! You're pretty useless even very well fed!!!
Our President has NO empathy
He has none because he has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He needs to be removed by the 25th amendment or impeachment.
Let's focus on what truly matters. The lives of 2.5 million Americans
He always attacks as a distraction.. sounds like he's doing it again but for what? He's not avoiding the subject wants to distract from
Not the photo I would have chosen to go with the Word of the Day - unless we are doing antonyms!
"Empathy", noun: a quality totally lacking in the sitting POTUS.
Is that also another island in middle of Ocean  he knows nothing about?
He's empathetic minus the em.
When is @POTUS going to pay PR back for the $300mm bond for the golf course he & his son BANKRUPTED in 2015?  That would help their debt...
He just needs the “a” and the “h”. So close!
I see the lack of empathy is spreading with Trump supporters. He has a particularly toxic form of narcissism and sadly it is contagious.
Can you please try to rally some @GOP allies to get this human excrement out of the white house?! Please!?
Is this idiot warner critisizing Trumps handling of disasters? Trump has been brilliant at it! Best weve ever seen! And he knows it!
Narcissistic behavior has no feelings but for they self. Pity party for him
Keep with your hate and lies and never win again! MAGA or get out of our way! Obstruction isn’t working anymore! No solutions! Just hate!!
Phrase of the day. Potus has chunks of guys like warner in his stool! Warner has no clue what a speck he is compared to Trump!
It is in neither his vocabulary or personality, I'm afraid.
Enough of the words!! What can we do to work around this asshole!? People are going to die with every minute wasted with his whining!
"Word of the Day: “empathy” — noun — the ability to understand and share the feelings of another."
Get him out! Fire Trump!
A sociopath doesn't have empathy. Trump is a sociopath! He could care less. #25thAmendmentNow
#impeachTrumpnow
I thought it was sociopath
Btw @POTUS 2 see poor leadership look in the MIRROR.  Just when we think surely u can't get any worse u do Can always count on UgettingWORSE
Remember he only has limited vocabulary
Trump has none and never will. He has no morals. He is unsuited to rule America
Are you going to perpetuate this Bullshit or be a leader ?
How about IMPEACHMENT
He is 71. He has been a narcissist his entire life, not going to change. He is a contagious disease on this country lowering morals.

Sociopaths have a diminished capacity for empathy and remorse, just consult the DSM-5.  I'm surprised Trump's picture isn't included.
"Them" 
Trump is not human, he is a bottom feeder, a maggot and cares for no one but himself and his family of traitors!
Racist sociopaths are unable to feel empathy.
A true narcissist with antisocial tendencies is unable 2 feel empathy. Serious insight deficit keeps him blind to his own impairment.
I have a different word when referencing him.......
Daily word: "racist" - noun- a person who promulgates and supports negative stereotypes, such as people of color are lazy and want handouts.
Has anyone asked him why Texas is different? Why he had no problem w allocating funds for rebuilding..
and the opposite of empathy is apathy, void of emotion.
Are GOP deaf and mute on trump's bullying?
#sociopath#
a person with a personality disorder evidencing extreme antisocial behavior and a lack of conscience.
This man is unfit to be President.  Impeach him.
@politico America voted him in
@realDonaldTrump the emptiness of he who has NO EMPATHY
Love my Senator!
Trump has no real empathy, just empty words trying to make you think he does, then 2seconds later he is back to his own real self.
He has plenty of empathy BUT here is another word "ENABLER" that he is not The mayor was very happy until yesterday I wonder what changed
Yesterday, hospital was getting back up electricity was being established food distribution were being given out. So what happened?
@MarkWarner - I am shocked that with all the checks and balances in our democracy, no one can do anything about this cancer?!
Thank you for your integrity. Not all politicians are morally corrupt.
Worse he's dogwhistling to his Nazis to maintain notion that hispanics are free loaders.
Look away, children! Our president deserves no respect or has any redeeming qualities. Small, vile, miserable man.
When is an article of impeachment starting
Words of the day: "Mentally unfit" for the office of potus. Please, senator, please rally congress to remove him from office, any way u can.
As you know Narcissists are unable to feel empathy. It's part of what enables their cruelty
You expect Trump to have empathy? If it doesn't line his pockets or make him feel like he is the king of the world he does not care.
PR needs actions, not words.. from everyone.  
If Ds can't get him to act they need to find someone who will. Maybe Gen Kelly?
