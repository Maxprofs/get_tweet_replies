why didn't you stand with senate dems to pass amendment allowing for cheaper Rx for sick ppl??!
So your opposed to #ChildSupport Payments

@MarkWarner @minotauresse @SenateDems @PPFA
NOT YOUR JOB
.@MarkWarner @SenateDems @PPFA @SenSchumer The only thing Dems did w #MakeAmericaSickAgain was admit  failure. http://TinyURL.com/OneInTwo  
I stand for women's health but not for killing babies.
none of the $ from the govt is used for 'killing babies' -- but you knew that.
we donate Millions to Planned Parenthood with our tax dollars.
@crazylary51 @SenateDems @PPFA 

Absolutely agree
@Ward4Anderson @SenateDems @PPFA Dems it's time to take the gloves off and FIGHT!!!!!!!!!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @PPFA #keepamericabrokewithHCprem
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @PPFA Dem passed HC didn't fix increasing prem problem over last 4 yrs.Dems made ZERO effort 2 fix
ACA covers everything that PP offers.  Should have used funds to make ACA affordable, now you may lose both.
Still a shill who sold out American interests for Pharma money. Sad to be represented by such a coward.
. Losers don't make policy, winners do, do wait in line, and shut up.
amend  not repeal affordable health care!!
@LisaHauser8 @SenateDems @PPFA heck no, I want republicans to do all this and more, remember democrats lost for a reason!
@AdamsFlaFan @SenateDems @PPFA
Especially in Virginia, where people were being treated in animal stalls .
Been to PP..could get my same services from my local health dept!
@DonaldFartWatch @SenateDems @PPFA Thank you Senator Warner for being a great Senator for us Virginians!
@puppymnkey @SenateDems @PPFA 

FOR ONCE:

Let "GOOD ENOUGH " aLone!
~ So, tell the same people who ran their campaigns on a pledge 2 ELIMINATE #PP & the #ACA NOT 2 do it? Yeh, that'll work!
Hyperbole is for visceral manipulation when there is no cogent intellectual case to be made.
Thank you for support of pp and hopefully womens rights!
@Karoli @SenateDems @PPFA over by the special interest
@Karoli @SenateDems @PPFA if I had a college degree I would run for Congress because I'm tired of seeing the people screwed
if you like it so much why don't you get on it? Repeal Obamacare nobody can afford to see the DR anymore
You do understand that more people come in to @PPFA than leave, right?
I have a better idea! Don't re-elect Mark Warner!
You are an immoral person who should be voted-out ASAP!
WTH do you need to Standup & Fight for America? #USINTEL  #ElectionHacked #Treason #TheResistance
WTH @SenateDems did not standup with @HouseDemocrats to oppose @ElectoralCollege vote for Trump. #ElectionHacked #USINTELreport.
just a reminder...tearing babies limb from limb is #nothealthcare.
@PPact @SenateDems @PPFA would have been great to stand with the 65 m people who could have used you today.
@TrumpIsCrooked @SenateDems @PPFA
@SenSchumer You are the party who made America sick. Now please a breath of fresh Air.
you might as well be talking to a brick wall.
Thank you @MarkWarner. Proud that you are representing me in the Senate - for this and many other reasons.

I stand with making elections fair.  End superdelegates and let the people vote
unless every child is sacred no ones child is safe !
planned parenthood is for eugenics. You should rethink that
planned parenthood depopulates ppl of color you should rethink that
planned parenthood sells baby body parts. You should rethink that !
why are taxpayers funding peoples sexual decisions. Of course it should be defunded
You should have stood with our country today & signed to get the illegitimate EC votes voided
too bad you didn't stand with the brave House Dems who objected to EC vote confirmation.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @PPFA I stand with removing you hateful people outta office. Work with republicans or get the HELL OUT!!
No you don't - you did not object or sign any objection for the House Dems to use
@freespeak3 @SenateDems @PPFA So proud of my senator!
Thank you! Proud of both my VA Senators!
why will one senator not help the house challenge the ec vote?
They had to do Fixes to Social Security Medicare  Medicaid  They did Not Repeal just because they need a Fix
we must resist, tell employer to only take FICA fed taxes out for one month starting Jan 20th say no to trump
And don't boar us with your canned propaganda.
"Boar"us?  A boar is a wild pig.  To bore indicates something is tedious, uninteresting.  Please learn use of basic grammar.
Ok thanks, but ya know what I meant.
Nice to see you finally take a position on something. Now how about ACA, SS & Medicare??? #IStandWithPP
A democratic senator needs to object to certification of electoral vote and stand up for the ppl
thank you for your support
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @PPFA
Thank you Mr. Warner!!!!

let's please not defund an entire organization over 3% of their business
why? ACA civers everything they offer?
