#TrumpBudget also cuts billions from #Medicaid, shifts more costs & responsibility to states. As a fmr governor, this is bad news for states
The entire #TrumpBudget is based on unrealistic growth estimates that have already been rejected by leading economists. It's just fantasy.
I will strongly oppose the #TrumpBudget. We need a comprehensive, long-range plan to responsibly fix our nation’s balance sheet.
Since when has any democrat ever wanted to fix the budget sheet?  Hypocrite
Safety net?? You mean like a wall? And NOTHING ABOUT #Manchester  terror attack ? I'll say it prayers for U.K.
My apologies to you for the lack of respect of my Senators related to Manchester travesty.
Thank you
How does @POTUS think ppl can avoid/get off public assistance if he cuts supports for job trng, ed, healthcare, & #digital inclusion?
We don't need to go backward. We need to go forward.
Cuts nothing. Only slows the rate of increase. There you go again. You are a risk to society. Quit representing Virginia.
Most wouldn't need any benefits if they weren't robbed like Peter so you guys can pay Paul.
Don't follow the lead of everyone else.  Offer to sit at the table and compromise once is comes to the Senate.

hahaha love this
I don't agree! The budget will give more responsibility back to the states which is good.
Why, after 8 years of Obama, are families still suffering?
AWESOME!  Make them get off the dole!  PERFECT!  @realDonaldTrump IS MAGA!  AWESOME! They will need to GET a JOB that @POTUS is creating!
GOP calls it mercy
Food Stamps lift 4.6 million individuals out of poverty including 2 million children. #trumpbudget could change that http://econofact.org/in-battle-over-2018-farm-bill-anti-poverty-program-at-stake …

#TrumpBudget would cause death of disabled & elderly that rely on #Medicaid #Medicare #SocialSecurity VOTE NO #TrumpCare NO #TrumpBudget PLZ
YOU ARE A DOOFUS. How could anybody in their "right mind" vote for a fool like you?
How can we as people who value the health and well-being of others help fight this horrific budget?
What are we going to do with interest on the debt is our biggest budget item? A lot of things get cut and become moot at that point.
That's why we need you to fight for us....
the budget isn’t being cut. Trump is proposing that federal spending increase from $4.06 trillion this year to $5.71 trillion in 2027.
You lie the budget isn’t being cut. Trump is proposing that federal spending increase fr $4.06 trillion this year to $5.71 trillion in 2027.
By safety net for working people I assume you really mean the lazy who professionally vote Democrat. #trumpbudget
#Trumpbudget If u really cared @MarkWarner u would down size & donate your millions to these causes -oh but no u would rather use OUR tax $
You're gonna lose that seat senatwhore
And that's what Mulvaney loves about it!
#ShareYourWealth
You actually saying you want to protect people here illegally, your not worried about Americans.  With all your welfare you discourage work
America wasn't designed to be a safety net for life...wasn't even designed as a temporary safety net. Where in Constitution is that?
Why don't you distribute your 80 million dollar wealth amongst the poor that need it??? WHERE, is the SOCIAL JUSTICE here??
How does a politician, on that salary, accumulate a net worth of 257 million?

Tell us again about "the struggle"
It's things like this that remind us that Trump and his admin have no care for the American people at all. #trumpbudget
Just gotta keep funding those "safety net" programs no matter what, right?
Stupid....working people don't get to use the safety net anyways. Lol, STFU.
Are you familiar with concept of #BasicIncome?
Keep up the fight, sir
That "safety  net" has evolved into a hammock. Time to wake the sleeping beauties up- for work.
There are no real cuts! Just less growth-liar. We need real cuts! #liar
These are the most vulnerable, which he will destroy in a heartbeat!
As a nation, we have to sacrifice to get the debt down that YOU have accrued. I bet you won't sacrifice, will you Mark? Life as usual in DC.

Governments are not in the business of safety nets, Mr. Warner. Your twisted view of this is why you won't be re elected.
Thank you.  Your views on the #TrumpBudget are right on target.  I support you all the way.
people are struggling because of failed liberal policies YOU supported.
Help us Mark. Many of us work hard and are not getting anywhere already. We feel we have been lied to.
Then don't rely on the government. Do for you. Mark Warner sure isn't going to help. I know this FIRST hand.
Please help see that "budget," full of errors and fraud, not to mention its enrkchment of the rich while decimating the vulnerable, dies.
Right out of the MSM page book. Word for word? The government is not here to "keep you up". That's YOUR job Susan.
Never benefited from any "safety net" because they require you to be extremely poor for over a calendar year to even qualify.
you didn't seem to care when Obamacare doubled my insurance premiums and the premiums and deductibles of people who were forced to sign up.
Sen. Warner: Automation is taking jobs from anyone working. You can't tax robots. You also can't print money continuously.
