@HispanicCaucus Democrat policies enabled #Orlando, and then Democrats USE the dead to take away our rights. #LGBT #Shootback
Supreme court allowed Orlando in 2004. Check your facts!
False. You want to USE #Orlando dead to take rights. Obama admin FORCED FBI to leave killer alone. @repjohnlewis @HispanicCaucus
Not false. Check the ruling or don't respond with pontifications!
You're repeating yourself, drone. SOP insatiable totalitarian left. @repjohnlewis @HispanicCaucus Learn:
@CR I believe in common sense and decency for ALL people. Unlike your extreme right idiocy!!
"common sense" "extreme right wing" but you aren't leftist. Piss off lying egg.
Nope not lying. You just can't see past your narrow-minded myopic sight. I won't resort to your degradation language. Grow up
@mcgregor_ewan I cant see trailer on my phone :(
@RepKClark It would probly work if GOP Senators like @robportman werent n the lobby collecting @NRA money #MillionsOfDollars
Dems had super majorities in both House & Senate for 2 yrs under Obama. They didn't pass Gun Control. Why? Did not need GOP.
Ever heard of "Blue Dogs?" http://downwithtyranny.blogspot.com/2012/12/why-didnt-democrats-pass-gun-control.html â€¦
Pretty heavy accusation of bribes.
Time to Occupy Congress and the Senate and the White House on voter fraud too.
@NoGOPNo @GetWisdomDude @JasonLouMiller @marstu67 @jca10c9 Wouldn't it be great if a lot of folk converge on DC for the sit-in
they're sitting outside right now on Capitol steps
Democracy (in)action!
No. MOB RULE in action. enormous difference.
answer is simple make murder illegal.....wait...
@MarkWarner @timkaine @repjohnlewis HYPOCRITES: ALL 26 DEMONRATS IN GUN-CONTROL SIT IN ARE GUN OWNERS! https://youtu.be/sgWBhVi7940 
yay
@RepZoeLofgren action to kick u all out of
@mcgregor_ewan too long! Dead first graders weren't even enough 
Forever... we send legislators to DC specifically to expand gun rights, not infringe on them.. Throw another tantrum

Dems had super majorities in both House & Senate for 2 yrs under Obama. They didn't pass Gun Control. Why? Did not need GOP.
The GOP could care less they have been sucking the tit of the NRA for years!
Politicians are mostly it for the cash and could care less
If this isn't a bunch of grown ass immature people acting like little children then I don't know what is.
Your speech yesterday was truly wonderful. God bless you. #NoFlyNoBuy
.@repjohnlewis YOU HAVE TO BREAK UP THE NRA
Go after Wayne LaPierre 
Like GOP went after abortion

DISMANTLE NRA any way possible
What will it take~The murder of their children/loved ones? Would they learn even then? Can they feel the pain of such loss?
@SaraBareilles Till we vote out Drumpf and his Nazis THIS NOVEMBER!
@repjohnlewis
hope you clowns remember how to order a pizza
last, not least, would stricter gun laws have saved these people? And should we be use this aweful tragedy to push an agenda?
... And although hunting sucks, factory farming is far worse. We need to outlaw that.
... But criminals always manage to get arms, so will we just be taking more guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens?
.... Yet on the other hand I'm not even a fan of hunting, and my son almost got into a cousins closet with a unlocked gun....
....And when I already have so little trust in my government , that gave us the Patriot Act, how can we prevent worse tyranny?
.... But then I think of the victims... Then I think it could have just as likely been a suicide vest, this is their Jihad...
..but if the British were successful in taking our guns we wouldn't even be the U.S.A. right now,.." no gunpowder no freedom"?
I'm really torn on this issue. I live in a neighborhood I fear I will be shot at any moment by criminals with illegal guns...
How can the NRA call John Lewis a terrorist for doing everything to stop terror in America? NRA like KKK  are real terrorist
are you guys done yet? Hows the floor treating you? Ridiculous excuse for politicians..
@MarkWarner you shouldn't get paid while sitting on your rears....oh wait that's all you "elected" officials do
Wrong when you had house and wrong now. Which constituents are you doing this for?
Thank you.
. @repjohnlewis @sarabareilles voting to banned gun must b the most democratic means. what gun industry must obey
Thank you for sitting down and standing up AGAIN.

@soapfanfiction You are still, and always will be, A HERO.

@mcgregor_ewan Yes! Action! I demand to know why a terrorist had a gov license to carry - which exempted him from backgrd chks
you are already OCCUPYING WALL STREET you Communist scumbag.... How did it go there?   Lmao. You are a joke
By this single take-a-stand act, you all have made me proud to be an American. GOP must realize we need to work TOGETHER!
Thank You, John Lewis for showing our Congressional leaders the way again! Much Love & Appreciation!
The answer my friend, is blowing in the wind, the answer is blowing our minds
How many souls can semis kill, promising they keep us free?
How many folks must die in our land, before we wake up and agree?
we are with you
God bless you, Sir #Respect
Glad to see protesters outside supporting the cause, thanks Mr. Lewis

You can't tell people they can't own guns because someone around them is crazy.

Newtown, that kid got the gun from his mother.  She is perfectly able to own a gun.  This law would not change that.

It didn't escape me that you chose to name two crimes perpetuated by white men and not Islamic terrorists.

Thank you! What you and the other Representatives are doing is the most amazing & wonderful thing. #disarmhate #NoBillNoBreak
Thank you for all that you're doing!

Murder is already illegal. Anyone can build a bomb, would you prefer that next time?
what about Chicago? No one seems to give a shit about them.
absolutely fantastic!!!! You are awesome. Keep up the fight.  I had almost lost faith in congress! You are restoring it!
At this moment, I am so proud of you and your collegues in this action. No More! Hold strong!
THANK YOU!!! #NoBillNoBreak #NoMoreSilence
Amazing! Thank you from CT #NoBillNoBreak
what can we do in our communities to support you?
@GavinNewsom occupy inner cities. With your armed security details around that should stop some gun violence #2a
the guns in Newtown were stolen please use the facts not your false agendas. Charleston the gun fell through a FBI check.
Thank you for your courage. Please convey my support to all of you folks.
@finneyk Go get 'em!
powerful John Lewis!!!! Powerful.
#NOMORESILENCE #goodtrouble from ferguson to NY to Chicago to LA to Detroit who is standing up to police brutality
the sacred ability to resist rests in an ability to defend oneself, hard to do if you are disarmed
@MiaFarrow Wish I could be there with you.
Don't worry @repjohnlewis
When @realDonaldTrump is President you be safe from the scary guns, locked up in Guantanimo Bay for Treason!
What about Chicago? Haven't heard you ever mention that!
@WesSmith123 We cannot be ruled by an insidious gun lobby. America deserves better. We victims deserve better. No more blood.
@Fox5Shawn We have a terrorist problem not a gun problem. Where have all the bad asses gone?
@GavinNewsom @rrsib_9
@PaulBegala Murder and attempted murder with a firearm are already illegal.
Thank u! Moms Demand ACTION for Gun Sense in America @MomsDemand http://www.momsdemandaction.org  #HoldTheFloor
Thank you, Rep Lewis.  Finally, someone has the courage.  Stay there, we are behind you!  No cameras? We still hear you!
@PaulBegala 
I thought it said from Newton to Charlestown at first glance. I'm thinking, morning traffic, storrow, maybe 45?
suggest u ask @MarkWarner why dems voted down 2 gop led bills for more gun control
@HispanicCaucus -Occupy Democrats =OWS.  Stop the deranged now
Good for you!
Go, John Lewis, GO!!!! Thank you for fighting for common sense and a safer future!
.@repjohnlewis Thank you for sitting in for us, I was ashamed of our GA Senate votes on assault weapons.  #guncontrol #holdthefloor
Thank you!
Lock the doors. No food. no bathroom breaks. Sick of your political theater and all your fucking drama. Rot in there.
You and your colleagues staging the sit in ROCK!! Thank you for once again standing up for us!!
is there even talk of an actual assault weapons ban? Is your constituency really in favor of government watch lists?
Ooh the drama. Act of terrorism and of course the left wets it's pants and goes after everything but terrorists.
thank you sir
@TNDemocrats How long before you wake up and address the REAL issue? CRIMINALS are the issue, not law-abiding gun owners.
Act on what? Taking away the ability of US citizens to defend ourselves from the terrorists you imported?
No action is needed.
THANK YOU!!!
Thank you and thank G-d for your willingness to keep fighting. #goodtrouble #NoBillNoBreak
@HillaryIn2016   As long as it takes!!!!!
