Under #GrahamCassidy insurers can charge those w/pre-exist condit. whopping bills http://ampr.gs/2fhkfLr  
Rattner is the very best at analyzing numbers...
@goprapebuster @SteveRattner Could SOMEONE rein in Bernie Sanders B4 he screws 32m ppl?
Bernie Sanders is the only one raising hell about this terrible bill. Will join Klobuchar to fight it. You want Dems to run like cowards
Very sad that GOP won't take no for an answer. The American people do not want the ACA taken away. Who the hell do they think they are?
The people who will make a LOT of money off of "tax reform" that takes money saved from ACA and deposits it directly into their banks.
Greed!!
That's up to the states, where insurance regulation belongs.
this also zeroes out medicaid after 2026, are you prepared to care for your elderly parents and in-laws in your home without any help?
I am ready to get the federal government completely out of the insurance business.
I'm ready to radically reduce their corrosive influence on everything they touch.
@GOP Stop trying to kill me off!
Is this if u have employer insurance that u pay for?
Yes. It affects everyone.
Thanks
What doesn't make sense to me is why getting cancer should mean you're instantly bankrupt. I suppose next you'll make bankruptcy impossible.
Pre-ACA, my aunt went bankrupt because of cancer. Her insurance kicked her off, then she was a PEC. She's been fighting for nearly 30 years
@SteveRattner @JerryMoran @SenatorRounds  please vote no on terrible Graham bill!
Thank you as always Sen.  Warner.  We are fighting this cruelty as best we can along side you.
If you truly wanted to help everyone, outlaw any kind of health insurance and provide a tax free way for peeps to save money for healthcare.
There is a carve out for Alaska in the bill please call them out. #GrahamCassidyBill #VoteNo
Here is the problem w "pre-existing conditions" that no one is talking about: The insurance co. come up w a way to make EVERYTHING & 1/
ANYTHING due to a pre-existing condition! I know first hand! So, ppl will be stuck w the bill/arguing w the insurance co.s ALL THE TIME /END
Absolutely.
Medicare for all>26 is winner soon!Everyone pays in! The tax will be cheaper than private insur premium
What about those whose insurance doesn't cover cancer treatments under Obamacare? Don't they matter?
Do people realize 3 levels $ r involved w hospital charges : 1 insured $ ; 2 CMS $; 3 private pay pp $;  > cost $ usually 2 to 3x's $ = pp
#Graham Cassidy bill is an American Horror Story!!!
It covers alright... With pennys on the eyes and a blood soaked sheet.   Honor matters they have none. Serve the country not your donors.
It's all in the words...if you're on a cholesterol reducing drug like Lipitor and low dose aspirin...you may be considered "drug dependent"!
@SteveRattner when using an example it would help if it was not a @BarackObama insider.  Typical #superdelegate example
So you believe that healthcare is a right, and the American people should be forced to work and pay for that "right"?  #slavery.
Hey people,ask @MarkWarner why he hasn't sign him or his family up 4 Obamacare. He is always saying how good it is but just not for him.
Oh you mean Without Lying like @BillCassidy and @LindseyGrahamSC ?!

@SenateGOP DO NOT VOTE FOR #GRAHAMCASSIDY BILL! This bill is NOT good for Americans. Drs, healthcare orgs & Govs are AGAINST bill! #VOTENO
It is the Koch Bros money! Time to shame Republicans in Congress.
A dad makes $90k a Mom makes $90k YET a gov Funded Paycheck pays 1/2  of #SS medicare Tax than a #Gov #Employee that makes $180K, its #THEFT
Read the fine print. G-C claims it provides access to "adequate and affordable" care. What is their definition of "adequate and affordable?"
Dispecable!
This is so bad. Keep fighting.
Virginia gets to make its own decisions and gets more money. Why is this bad for Virginia?
@SpeakerRyan @LindseyGrahamSC Shame on both Ryan and Graham. Shame. The @GOP is truly a horrible group.
Graham, Cassidy, and Trump are all gaslighting liars. They indignantly refuse to tell the truth to the American people.
Senator, Why should we trust Steven Rattner's calculations?
How, in this day & age, can we be charging people ($$$) for getting these diseases? Some of which are genetic...Almost $20k to have a baby?!
I have Lupus. I’d lose everything then die...I’m 47.
WTH @nytimes @washingtonpost  @maddow @Lawrence @NancyPelosi

Well pretty sure you and @SenJohnMcCain can afford it. Oh wait....neither of you have to use it.
@RoyBlunt @RepAnnWagner 

Of course it covers preexsisting...if you are top 1%

Noone else matters

Survival of the richest
@GovHolcomb @ToddYoungIN many in our state don't even make this much.  Senator have courage to vote no and Gov please speak out against it!
I hope press pushes as many governors as possible to say on the record how they would handle pre-existing. They need to be held accountable.
Have you shown this chart to @LindseyGrahamSC and @BillCassidy?
Not only does #GrahamCassidy not cover pre-existing conditions, it extends 4 unconstitutional parts of O'care! Gov't still controls care!
It covers pre-existing condition at a price decided by the Ins. Co. Which is just what he suffered with pre ACA.
The Graham-Cassidy plan is horrible for the American people.  Please fight this tooth and nail!
I imagine I'm not alone in trying to figure out how to keep from going medically bankrupt. Eventually it's inevitable under Graham Cassidy.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy  - well there goes my coverage for mental health and heart.  Will have to do without
Sneaky....  Folks check the date on these ##s. Certainly not based on current bill!
This should tell you what democrats are really about!
Republicans lie. Whodathunk?
Other than your usual complaining. Whats your idea? You had a chance and gave us this Obamacare disaster. Why should we trust you again?
Those with currently monthly prescriptions may find themselves  having to wait a yr for ins to cover it IF at all.
Full cost of 1 monthly Rx. Needed an antibiotic as well.Many will have to choose http://betw.food  &prescriptions
I jammed my thumb slightly & it locked up. It could happen to anyone. Look at the cost of a 15 min surgery
@StephMillerShow @SteveRattner
Would bankrupt most.
What is your health coverage and how much do you pay?
@MarkWarner will Senator McCain save us again?
It will be up to each state to determine the rules for their citizens. Getting the Federal Government out of the healthcare business.
Yep
Noway Graham-Cassidy think we stupid like trump who just want to say they repeal OBAMACARE with anything they don't care about anyone
Please oppose because it "erases" Medicaid support to most vulerable
You gave us your answer to healthcare and we see how that is going. Othet than bailing out ins co what is your answer. Oh yes single pay
Or medicare for all which will banktupt this country. Did you mention high risk pools that cover pre existing no I see not. Quit trying to
Scare people to death when you dont know what the heck you are talking about. If Amer people will finalky wise up and get dems out of office
We will be better off. You have voted against us so much people are use to it. Shame on you and dem party for the money hungry fools you are
Come here Ed Gillespie Doesn't Care about Nelsonia Va23414 Vote LtGov RalphNortham NativeSon PatrioticHumanitarian RoleModel GodBlessNortham
What do you have to offer.  Over 60 VA counties will only have one insurer....Premiums increasing under ACA
Please DO NOT VOTE for this bill.  It has not been vetted by the in the know department!!!!
Covered but unobtainable.
They said it would, good enough for 70 million republican voters. DumbA$$
The Republicans are heartless and soulless.
#REPEAL ACA because its not affordable but wealth redistribution
We the people ALREADY voted to end ObamaCare DO YOUR JOB or lose YOUR SEAT
You are about as honest with these numbers are as you are with the Russia Trump collusion you say duped 63 million people to vote for him!
Obamacare sucks.
I am "covered" to buy a Rolls Royce car if I want to, as well. This is WORSE than before. WAY worse.
And don't forget, 1 in 2 ppl will get cancer in their lifetime. So for ppl who think this won't effect them bc they are healthy, guess again
They don't, they won't and this is why we need #MedicareForAll .  Taxes will initially increase but will be balanced with lower prems & deds
How will you get republican senators to grow a conscience and get their hands out of the Koch brothers pockets before the vote?
And WHO will discuss the fact that obscenely greedy insurance companies are to blame for this mess. Why are we paying THEM for healthcare?
Look at these numbers and try to tell me Democrats are not corrupt.
Over 186 DEMs convicted in last 10 years.
Don't #VoteDem2017
B S
Just like Trump, Conway, Spicer and others have been Gaslighting us, now Graham and Cassidy and GOP Congress doing the same Gaslighting.
Grrrr
What's up w/this Koch deadline the @GOP has to meet? Be cool if somebody in congress would address it.
We need to know. The American people deserves to know.
In this article, a TX donor said no more $$$ to Meadows and Jordan until GOP gets stuff done (health care, taxes).
Coincidence that Mark Meadows & Jim Jordan just penned this op-ed for the WSJ two days ago?
Undercover racism is a pre-existing condition but they cover that with no problem!!
Show this to @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I'm sure they already know.
