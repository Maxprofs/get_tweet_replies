Medicaid is for people temporary, not a LifeTime.  Clean up the abuse, and provide to the needy, not the lazy.
Pay your taxes
There has been a govt insurance program 4 kids 4 years!Why do they need Medicaid? ALL KIDS Good too! Low if any costs
So this idiot is to blame for the ObamaCare debacle and now he wants people to listen him??  What kind of criminal stupidity is that?!?
@SenMikeLee @senorrinhatch just a few reasons why you must vote NO
Why can’t we all use Medicaid & pay into it, we will all need it at some point or another& then no health insurance bills, why is that bad?
I mean, who doesn't want more kids to die from preventable diseases and disorders?
I work for a medical billing company and can tell you this will break families. I hear daily the struggles from patients trying to pay bills
@realDonaldTrump does this look like health care for all. @Impeach_D_Trump
#Crooked Donald
#KeepKidsCovered
Thanks
@SenRonJohnson Children now are literally our FoxConn workers in 18 years. Why wld we allow them to grow up without health care? Investment
That is a no go
Have ms, on Medicaid. About to start a new medication where if I skip a dose, I get a really bad relapse. No promises they won't cut me. 
And why am I on Medicaid?  Because I can't drive right now, let alone work. I can barely tie my shoes. Screw all these GOP. 
What did we do to republicans to make them want to take away our health care?
Dear #EvilSenator @LindseyGrahamSC , Hope you never sleep again!  #indefensible.  Comes a time to declare your #SillyPromise null & void!
1.5 Million American Veterans are on Medicaid. Which war vets aren't worth coverage??
LIes lies and more lies. Must be tuf to live life full of lies distortions & nonsense. Oh wait. your'e a Democrat. You WHOLE life is lies!
You are just  a putinbot or teenager paid to lie?
And we are supposedly the most compassionate and moral country on earth? This goes against that theory.
Because they need money for tax reform. Money going to 1% and corporations
You carefully examined the evidence behind the colorful graph and solicited counter arguments?
Look how they fuck the younger generations. Baby boomers are so fucking terrible.
This Cassidy/ Graham Bill is the worse bill of them all! No CBO score neither!?
@senategop @household @potus  I'm glad my mother is already dead because the Cassidy Graham bill would kill her.  Vote NO on this nightmare.
@SenSherrodBrown @robportman For the sake of Ohio, do the right thing and defeat this awful bill
Right   get rid of all of it and buy your own ins.  that is how we did it years ago.
@senrobportman and you agree with this?
Disabled? Sick? Elderly? Got a pre-existing condition? Illness? UR on your own #gop mentality. Let em' all die
@JackHokie  So. Much. WINNING.
Most mailboxes are full but keep trying. FAX! Text RESIST to 50409. They send the fax for you! Keep calling/faxing these Senators! 
I refuse to retweet a lie.
@GOP
Fuck kids; like they're so precious, like they're... idk... innocent developing people that will make up our nation's future or something.
@lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain PLEASE don't vote yes on Cassidy-Graham. 

-a 31% cut to Medicaid for kids
-a 15% cut for ppl w/ disabilities
This GOP does not give a good gd about the people in this country. They care only to please their damn donors.

I'm raising my 4 year old grandson   He uses Medicaid.   Don't I have a right to assistance?
That's just fucking wrong and I'm so sick of their shit. Everyone should be calling and at least standing up for those poor kids.
If only @SenToomey would listen to his voting republic, oh, that would be swell. too bad PA is managed by a sellout.
If they really wanted to win this bill, they should have OMG get this... Worked with the Dems!!!
You know, it's only their FUCKING JOB!!!!
Shame on them, disgusting
This is NOT acceptable! Why cuts to Medicaid? How can anyone be denied after being accepted? Who can decide which kids die? Is that you DJT?
Health care for All?
They work for us! Give us what they have or give Them what they want for us!
Any Senator who changes their mind from last time, got a higher bribe from one or more insurance companies.
The GOP never thinks of others, only themselves. Let’s put them on the same healthcare that they end up passing.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @tedcruz @SenateGOP @HouseGOP

.@lisamurkowski Americans are counting on you. Alaskans are counting on you. Please vote NO on Graham-Cassidy. #MurkowskiVoteNo
@SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenDeanHeller @SenatorCollins 
You know what is right in your hearts, just follow that. Bill is Immoral.
@SenateGOP sen
Is everyone in the Senate ok with these cuts?
America Isn't.
Vote NO.
disabled kids??????  They have no lobbyists, sorry guys us Republicans go to the highest bidder. Now who wants capital gain tax cuts?
A group of good people gasped at this stat today (which I overheard at a children's hospital luncheon). This cannot pass!
@GOP how can you honestly live with yourselves?
There living for 400 Koch 
Thank you for standing strong against attempts to gut the US healthcare system!
these guys are money grubbing scum; how do you do this to the kids??
Of course they would rush this horrible bill in under the radar. The GOP are cowards.
So those states that voted blue lose funds to morons in red.  But they don't want handouts remember??

I know there's many of the EOP that follow Andy get it through your thick ass goals we will March your asses out of Washington DC
Denial of healthcare services to the vulnerable as one element of a long-term plan of depopulation to set the stage for a eugenics program
#BountyHunters Graham/Cassidy. Koch Bros gives GOP $400M for 2018 only if *ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes. Graham urgency.
@SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @RepMarkWalker IF YOU CARE ABOUT AMERICANS DO NOT PASS THIS BILL!!
I guess they might as well add paid funeral expenses for those who die because these assholes want to cut care.
To create skilled workforce need to ensure that children are healthy, nourished, educated, & housed. All being eliminated by this admin
#BountyHunters Graham/Cassidy. Koch Bros gives GOP $400M for 2018 only if *ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes. Graham urgency.
@SenJohnMcCain @senlisamurkowski @senrobportman @SenSusanCollins Please be smart - be human and take your awesome responsibility deeply...

Can't understand why so many listen to anyone from past administration. Do your own research don't depend on those that did this to us
I call BS  obama made medicaid for everyone so u voted it mark  try fixing it instead of WHINING LIKE A BABY
Ya we get it; we know it's a horror. So why the big push by the GOP to destroy our future? That what I really don't understand.
Because when they came home and talked to donors they got an earful about how ACA hasn't been repealed. $$$ over Country
@HeidiPrzybyla Is weeding out the sick & weak considered making America great?
@realDonaldTrump this will forever be known as #Trumpcare not Graham-Cassidy. Your name will be linked to its failure like your other fails
All so the GOP owners: Koch roaches and other billionaires and millionaires can dwindle the rest of our tax dollars! HOP hates working class
Cuts to politicians health care plan - 0%
Heartless DOCTOR Cassidy and no integrity Graham!
Can someone tell me which lines are what. I can sort out the -15 & -31% BUT being colorblind with the 2 remaining lines. I got no idea!
I would like @SenCoryGardner to defend how he is still "undecided." Who has his balls in a vice? Certainly not the ppl of CO.
The highest priority for GOP congress is...
What about no birth or prenatal or other women's things. They discount women totally #GrahamCassidy #trumpcare #wealthcare
But Obamacare is the plan that's failing America...
Medicaid and disability cuts are going to hit Appalachia hard
@SenateGOP   Why are you hell bent on this?
@Atul_Gawande People! Don't be so unfair to the GOP! Won't you let them have "win" even if it means ruining millions of lives???
And when it passes, Americans will gnash teeth, rant on SocMedia, maybe hold 1day marches but ultimately do nothing of consequence
Lol Republicans support Assisted Suicide! Who knew?

Seems like they're leading by example, too -- double bonus!
IMPORTANT: Employer plans WON'T protect anyone if #ACA mandates end. Cost of offering pre-existing condition coverage will be prohibitive.
Despicable
How bout a few more 25000$ private plane rides for these greedy fools.When is enough..enough.think what trip to Fort Knox could pay for
On Morning Joe @SenRonJohnson said people on Medicaid should just get a job.
More Lies, Lies, Lies it does NOT!!! #MAGA
you think it adds money?
@SenJohnMcCain If you were a regular middle class man in Arizona, could you get coverage after your diagnosis if Ocare were to be replaced?
The graph says shift in lower growth rates. So these aren’t cuts to those under current programs but a slowage in the future growth.. no?
Why tho?
JUST OUT: Under Graham Cassidy ACA repeal, Medicaid for kids and coverage for people with disabilities is moved to the states.  Makes sense.
with huge cuts
As an father of an autistic child, I'm waiting for our own  "special" tax bracket of 50%.  2 educated parents,struggling with cost of autism
Thanks for saying please RT now I know the secret to getting more RT's 

please RT
All you right wing evangelical Christian's is this what Jesus preached? Cut aid to those most desperate and unable to help themselves?
This is what I ran on! Health care is for the wealthy much like good schools.
#TheResistance is trying to stop this
. . . and all the money saved will go into the pockets of the rich company's who donate to the campaign funds of Graham and Cassidy.
Only in DC is controlling unchecked spending considered a "cut"!  FACT: 20 trillion in debt. Stop the hysteria-Obamacare unsustainable!
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @dougducey @POTUS @FLOTUS Sirs and madam they dont even know whats in this bill 1/6th of our economy, hurting kids
@SenJohnMcCain 
If you're "reluctant" to vote for this bill, why are you doing it?
At least demand a CBO report BEFORE the vote.
Everyone needs to call! Save healthcare for children and the disabled!
 
Another heartless proposal brought to you by the Republican Party.
So like nazis they want a pure race...

If they cut Medicaid I will never be able to afford the spinal surgery I desperately need to alleviate the worse of my chronic back pain.
@StephMillerShow Merica!
pls make graphic a jpg page so i can post on fb too
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy now you're after Medicaid for kids & ppl with disabilities? @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski protect #ACA
Kids without healthcare will cost this country FOREVER!
Our seniors, young children, and our military should be our 3 top priorities. The GOP understands only tax cuts for the rich. GOP sucks ass
Also cuts to veterans
#GrahamCasiddy cuts health care to those that need it most. Unacceptable! #stopGrahamCassidy Call your Senators!
Look at this @RoyBlunt it will devastate Missourians! Vote NO on Grahm Cassidy! Stand for your entire state, not your party!
Sure bet @RoyBlunt  will go with the dark money while tweeting about a fish tank.   Just weak he is.
Dont forget to rape the children
I'm not usually not down with gov handouts, but the exception is disabled people that can't actually work and those that take care of them.
Parents Shud pay for THEIR children's HealthCare,.
@SenJohnMcCain, you don't want this to become your legacy.
Over 50 repeal attemps... Right! What does everyone expect from The GOP...?Compassion! Wait for it! Warning! It could be a long wait
Thoughts from @BillCassidy and @LindseyGrahamSC: #ACArepeal @ObamaCare #RepealAndGoFuckYourSelf #GrahamCassidy
Sure you haven't taken those stats out of context?
Andy, that's just year one.

G-C-H is a Medicaid Abolition bill.

Period.
And also GOP donations are down so they want to throw something together quickly & get it passed so the $$$ start rolling back in
Hey, @senrobportman if you vote for this bill, you will hurt these people.  Might as well run over puppies and knock over old ladies, too.
But they want to add 700billion to the military... lawless politicians
Not good for those that need it most.
If this plan is so great,  make senators and representatives take this health care instead of the system they now have.
No hearings. No CBO. No nothing. Disgraceful.
This is what Trumpcare is @realDonaldTrump! 

Don't think anyone is telling you the truth!!!
.@SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins Don't take away health care for children and disabled children!
So. No hearings. No CBO. No attempt to explain to American people. Nothing. This is not our Republic.
Let's fund Medicare properly and open it up to everyone.
No, never!
@ASlavitt , though I appreciate the martyrdom,  this may be a good thing if it stops state abuse from us. I live this life w autism son.
WE KNOW.  Focus on the miscreant vermin's TENACITY.  THAT'S our ENEMY.
This is EXACTLY what we cannot let Trump do to our country! What happened to MAGA? And when will that start?
How else will GOP give tax cut to the billionaire donors
Republicans!
What kind of people are these?  Working classes running out of options, slowly pressed into serfdom.
Q: why are kids on Medicaid? If you can't afford to pay for your kids, you shouldn't be having them. Personal responsibility goes a long way
I'm not sure anyone plans to have a kid with disabilities. It just happens. Like a lot of life.
Only kids, not disabled. They are two different categories Davnie.

This 'sounds' awful as a stat but knowing what WE have undergone?  May not be bad. Reform and accountability are needed.
Taking decisions from legislators and having them approved by a federal ethics committee is needed for accountability. Medicaid is state
I would like to hear the proposals along with this. As a Mom with a disabled child, there has been much abuse by state leaders to both prog
Even if you have called already, call every day to restate your opposition. #killthebill
@SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski  @SenatorCollins the world's watching! Stop this! Stand for your people, not for tax cut $ for millionaires!
We all must phone our Reps and Senators,NOW! Or March or Rally or Protest somehow! It worked once; it can work again! .@igggie1 .@kjoerwin
Source, please.
Why @BillCassidy why? This is depraved greed at its worst.
good bill according to @realDonaldTrump tweet.kids/disabled get a kick in the balls by the @GOP and chump cheers it.
And yet they're out there lying & bad mouthing Jimmy Kimmel & others. I'm hoping SOMEONE in GOP has a conscience, compassion, heart & say NO
This sickens me
Democrats suffer from their lack of math skills.
.@bryconnelly
sinister legislation
Those pro life christians are so loving, aren't they?
What a terrible bill, the weak and young will be devastated.
