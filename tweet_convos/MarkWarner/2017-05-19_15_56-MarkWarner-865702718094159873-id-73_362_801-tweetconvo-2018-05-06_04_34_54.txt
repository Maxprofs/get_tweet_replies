Comey needs complete immunity, so he can go to town on these treasonous scoundrels
Why would he need immunity?
I do not trust Burr at all.
Now, please, get the taxes.
@ChrisCoons @SenWhitehouse @SenThadCochran @SenThomTillis @SenatorCarper @SenJackReed @SenatorLeahy @brianstelter @maddow @jimsciutto
Keep up the hard work, put Country over Party and be Patriots. Any attempts to hide or block things will make that person complicit.
getting DVR ready 
Adults are in the room. Thank goodness Warner & Burr. This is what we wanted!  Sound minds.  Country 1st!
Thank you!
Please consider effect of Senate testimony on OllieNorth. Spec. Counsel conviction overturned. Talk to @JeffreyToobin of @CNN
I'm sure Mr. Comey will know precisely what he can say w/o compromising Spec. Counsel investigation.

Off topic, but woo Kristina, keep that GIF. YES...LOL. Okay, I'm back we're watching you @MarkWarner, so proud of you sir.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Did COMEY have "memos" on Benghazi? Clinton's email server & uranium sales to Russia? Memo written when? He's lying.
Wythe county transplant says thanks from sunshine state.
Why does it seem that Senate Intel Committee is the only area where Dems and GOP are working jointly?  Is it the people, or the intel?
Thank you both for your dedication on getting to the bottom of this matter! I will definitely pay attention
What a waste of tax payers money. Thanks for spending your time and our money on your liberal agenda
Can you ask him why he covered up the Clinton email investigation, and did nothing to investigate their fake charity?
This citizen ardently desires your Committee to #FollowTheFacts unstintingly and get to the truth about the 2016 election
That's great news! Why can't he testify sooner?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump POTUS said he DID not interfere in Comey's investigation. Comey testified under oath March 3rd, NO interference.
The people are curious on why his ass didn't put Clinton in jail twice? ANSWER THAT! trump is not guilty if "he" wasn't involved! Get a life
Thank you, my senator, for your hard work.
I'm trusting you Mr. Warner, but not feeling the same way concerning you're partner Burr. Watch him. Proud of you sir.
#COMEY has carefully documented a nest
Now holds cards close 2 vest
Patient play will win the day
Just consider it: historical foreplay
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump IF Comey believed March 3rd, he was being interfered by POTUS, then he LIED under oath. Crime not to report!
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump J. COMEY testified UNDER OATH March 3rd that NOONE interfered in his investigation or ASKED for it to be stopped.
There's a story in The Hill that Trump is looking into using an ethics rule to shut down Mueller. May want to look into that 
You sir are *actually* principled & patriotic. Makes me wish I lived in Virginia. My senators here in the deep south=crooked as a dog's leg
Thank you!  Can we send questions?
Dear Sen. Warner, So pleased that Mr. Comey has offered to testify in open session since his release as FBI Dir. k.
SenWarner U are making America proud. Thx pfor representing us with honor & distinction. Your work is giving us hope justice will prevail!
Will we survive until Memorial Day?
Wont this be a conflict of intrest. You know special counsel will be using him in his case
#Comey agreed to testify. Good. I bet he will testify when I am overseas in June. #Tatiana
@MarkWarner we will not ever forget the hard work you put in!! #VABABY 
Thank you so much from Kentucky!!

I need you to ask him why he thought he could blend into the curtains.
@jacktodd46 @SenatorBurr yeah baby!!!
Thank you both for your hard work and commitment to keeping the American people informed. Transparency matters
Is this gonna be Pay-Per-View? I'll put bout $5 on it.
Please keep him out of harm's way. No polonium please.
I hope Mr. Comey has been reading "The Count of Monte Cristo" for a little extra vengeance inspiration.
Excellent! I am a proud VA constituent, Senator Warner!

Thank you both for working together on this & seeking truth. Americans from all political parties appreciate it! 
THANK you Jesus!
Thank you @MarkWarner
Well, I know what I'll be listening to *that* day
Better make it fast before Mueller shuts it down.
Thank you Mark!
Thank you Senators! 
I'm stocking up on popcorn.
Can't wait!  Thank you both for your work to learn the facts and to keep the American public informed.
Yesssss!!!!!! Can't wait!!!
Thank you @MarkWarner! I hope that there will be a transparent independent bipartisan commission to investigate the Kremlin meddling.
1.5 weeks is an eternity in this faster-than-light s**t-show.
Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to our country...from Nebraska.
