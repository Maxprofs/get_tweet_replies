Same old fear tactic of grandmother in wheelchair over cliff.most of these folks could not even afford deductible under Ocare...
God bless all those people standing in line for those of us who cannot. Treat them well.
Most of them are now in jail..!! You don’t disrupt these events..!
Where in Washington are the HUGE crowds to support #GrahamCassidyBill? NOWHERE
Wish I could retweet this 230 million times 
I am always proud to see them go all in! Hooah!
If you really cared you would back single payer.
They can't get paid off as well if they cut out insurance companies and pharma.
Because democrats want to believe they are leaps and bounds better than th e GOP but their politicians are still crooks.
Thank you everyone for showing up!! You are awesome! 
Now they are in jail..!! LOL
Thank you to all who were there.
Glad your not my Camera man.  Have to smile about something. Thank you, for all that you do.

#KilltheBill not Americans. How many more times do we have to fight this it's like the zombie apocalypse bill it keeps coming back!
Of course you've exempted YOURSELF from Obamacare haven't you.
#hypocrisy
Thank you Mark Warner and thanks to all who showed up to fight this monstrous bill.
Is Obama's OFA out today?
No young lady, this is what Marxism looks like with a lot of sheep!
Amazing!
Sure glad my profession isn't telling crippled folks to go screw themselves. How do these ghouls get any sleep?
Thanks to Senate dems who kindly stayed in the room while the protesters were removed. The repubs generally left, but dems kept watch.
Great news!
180 people arrested. Well, they're my hero's today. Planned arresting is a fine way to protest! I approve. & thanks for your good work too.
1st time in 201 yr history of theFinance Committee that Americans were arrested by GOP for protesting health care. R U Happy senator?
I know focus is on GC, thank you. But is there room to also send help to Puerto Rico? Maybe use military $billions to send ships/ supplies?
There should be room for both; otherwise there is something seriously wrong with this country of ours, other than it's president.
Unfortunately, something is seriously wrong! This country taking away healthcare and ignoring disaster of its citizens!
That must have cost a fortune for the Dems.
Look at all those red shirts, I wonder who they could be? :)
Thanks to @SenatorCollins for publicly saying no to this horrific bill. Thank u for being courageous. Let's make ACA better.
America at its finest. @GOP you are a national disgrace! Please step down.
Were their tickets paid for by Soros? Pack your bags Senator...
So I'm to believe all those cripples showed up spontaneously?  LOL.  How much do they (you?) pay per day to sit in a wheel chair?
Lining up to stay on the Government Plantation..! How sad..!
Vote no! Thank You Senator Warner. I know you will and Senator Kaine will.
#KillTheBill
Wish I was there to bring everyone of those waiting some fresh baked Snickerdoodles and hot tea. Bless all their hearts!
Y'all pay attention to what *WE THE PEOPLE* want!!
@SenatorBurr
@SenThomTillis
Thom, now is the time to vote like you want to be reelected!!
And I'll bet Director Comey would be pleased, being the decent fellow that he is 
PLEASE help .@NationalADAPT -they're being blocked from entering room, they've been in line since 4:30 AM,ADA violation & just super shitty
@PCDFoundation @heidibp call your senators now and make your voices heard: #ProtectPatientsNow  #VoteNo on #GrahamCasiddy.
The Portuguese model for drugs would give us enough money to insure everyone and lower taxes.

That's an amazingly long line. Glad they all made it and hope they make it in.Thought Congress stopped with Hearings;) #ReturnToRegularOrder
I would be there, if I didn't have to work at a job I hate for insurance.
So proud of our upstanding citizens..of the others,not so much
1/ There isn't a greater waste of time than a hearing to figure out if you should vote "No" on #grahamcassidy. The "No" should be obvious.
2/ #GrahamCassidy removes ambulatory, emergency, hospitalization, maternity/newborn, mental health/substance abuse, laboratory, prevention..
3/ Rehabilitation, Prescription Drugs AND Pediatric Services.

How hard is it to say "No" to a bill that has virtually no healthcare?
@pmadsen45 @_Morris_Arthur this is effective
You are willing to see negative numbers. Liberals are not to be trusted. The voice of America is loud and clear Trump won!
OT, please help expedite help to Puerto Rico. They don't have 2-3 weeks to wait!
Right on!
I believe you are one of the good guys. 
is it true that only Graham and Cassidy will be allowed to speak? how long is the hearing?
Please vote no. Many of us depend on the ACA.
Sad Mark, because of YOU, Kaine & Scott doing NOTHING to support OUR President to fix Healthcare for ALL Americans,
You have FAILED US, sad!
Courageous and sad
New versions of Trumpcare are like the constant release of New &  Improved Lucky Charms, except Trumpcare takes away marshmallow  surprises.
Looks bigger than the line to go to @realDonaldTrump inauguration
Thanks for  being there for all of us.  That's what Americans do for each other!
There are more people in this line than @realDonaldTrump 's inauguration. Great work! Be heard!
Heartfelt thanks to all those in line for #GrahamCassidy hearing.  Stay strong. #Resist
.@markwarner Be our voice!!
@PrincessBravato that line has more people the. Came to trumps inauguration #PuertoRico is now #TrumpsKatrina
Send that clip to the Krotch Brothers & other donors.
Kochs don't give a rat's ass about anything besides their money
Thank you to all those who can show up and testify for all of us!
im surprised that mcconnell hasnt had them thrown out
Keep up the great work @MarkWarner .
Wow. Impressive. Thanks to all for showing up, speaking up and standing up for our healthcare.
Healthcare debate is on CNN tonight w/Graham,Cassidy,Klobuchar & Sanders. Should be interesting.
God Bless America
THIS!!!! This is patriotism...thank you!
Keep up the fight - we are counting on you!
Yes!  Make them answer to people at risk and not just bribe each other for votes!  This is not a test this is our lives and our savings
How else can we help   already calling writing texting  I don't know  I'm helpless
Wonderful!!
Democracy in action!!! @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @jonlovett
It makes me so sad these people have to spend their energy doing this. We are sick, this take a huge toll on our bodies physically.
Thanks 4 vid of LONGER than Comey hearing line to get into #GrahamCassidy hearing, Senator. cc @SenateMajLdr 
@SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @RandPaul @tedcruz DO YOU SEE LINES FORMING? NO ONE WANTS THIS BILL-pass at your own peril
Please don't do it   the Kochs aren't worth it   please!!!!!
This is great, but if @lisamurkowski, @RandPaul and @SenatorCollins take the bribes and sell their votes, the line won't matter.
Will the GOP listen? Do they care? Do they know we SEE them putting donors above citizens, Bribing Senators, Lying about their bill?
This and Puerto Rico is what we need to be focused on.Thank you!

What's so incredibly sad is that none of this makes a difference with the GOP.  #KochWhores
looks like the line to get healthcare under socialized medicine
Are they paid


Please tell them that we will never forget they wanted to genocide our own ppl 
Trump supporters would show up, but we have to work 70 hours a week to afford our premiums and deductibles under the ACA.
Obama himself said the ACA was a work in progress. Some on Capitol admit this and want to continue this work such as the premiums.
While you’re waiting, Senator, how about approving some aide to #PuertoRico
