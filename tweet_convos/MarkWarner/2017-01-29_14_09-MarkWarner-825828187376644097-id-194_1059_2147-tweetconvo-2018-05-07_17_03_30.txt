@AlexandriaVAMom @POTUS and yet you were SILENT when @barackobama issued similar order in 2011
Not in any way, shape, or firm similar. Do you even know what it was or why?
I do know exactly - yes VERY similar regardless of how I try to spin
obviously you don't. I don't need to spin
I have read both EOs several times as well as Carters - u obviously haven't - keep spinning
If you don't see a difference, ie ACTUAL terror activity, etc, you're suspect
Obama admin report said refugees in Trump EO SOME could pose extraordinary risks to USA
Demand? Please....
I am glad he is doing Great!!!!!!
thank you for your leadership
Time for all Americans to stand up and be counted.. don't let our torch of freedom be doused by ill-conceived, bigoted EO
http://heavy.com/news/2017/01/barack-obama-ban-refugees-did-iraq-iraqi-muslim-trump-jimmy-carter-iran-iranian-immigration/ â€¦  Excellent summary - if it had been the same, I would have complained
you need to quit fear mongering and tell the truth. It's not a Muslim ban! Be honest Mark!!
thank you for holding @POTUS accountable for this disgusting unconstitutional action. #NoBanNoWall
You and the Democrats have created fear and chaos. Where were u when Obama did this same thing for 6 months?
I fear terrorists posing as refugees getting into the country and killing people. I'm an American Senator & a voter.
Please explain in detail how this is "Un-American" and make sure how elaborate on how national security is "misguided".
O    I think the order is Great!!!!
thank you Mark Warner. Please continue to oppose these un-American policies #resist
Thank you for all that you do!
iam demanding you look what the great god obama done before he left office
then #withholdconsent until 45 rescinds the EO.  #nojusticenobills
Senator Warner, you've been working tirelessly on behalf of those hurt by Trump's order. You are a hero of the 1st degree
Thank you, Senator Warner.  #RefugeesWelcome #Resist #NoBanNoWall #ImpeachTrump
You'll have to ask #PresidentSteveBannon @POTUS doesn't have a clue.
please encourage all other Senators (both sides) to speak up. Speed up Senate inquiry into Russian ties. And stop SC pick
one way to get answers is to #withholdconsent
Thank you Senators!
We need our Senators to fight by all legal means, the decrees(exec orders) of President (or is it emperor) Trump.
give us your tired hungry... Etc... we have to stand up against this "president", Mr. Gameshow host.
@timkaine  Thank you both.  Proud of my VA senators for demanding Trump & @CustomsBorder abide by court orders, Constitution
You, @timkaine, & other Dems r just trying to hinder @DHSgov from doing its job. I'd make u send ur Qs thru ur committee. @POTUS
thank you @MarkWarner
I'd tell u & @timkaine 2 buzz off. You don't speak 4 congressional committees. You didn't read stay, but going by media. @POTUS
Shutup #globalist #sorospuppet
@timkaine Senators, please vote against #Sessions #DeVos -& ALL of Trump's picks. His decisions are all bad, as he's proven!
Thank you Senator Warner for upholding our American tradition unlike Mr Trump.
please vote no for Sessions and DeVos and investigate Bannon #NoBanNoWall #StopPresidentBannon I can't leave a message right now
Thank you Mark Warner for standing up to tyranny. I'm proud to have you represent me!
which is worse for civil liberties ban or Bannon
Thank you Senator.
Mark Warner, thank u for representing the people & fighting for the principles of the constitution
Thank you for working to oppose this unconstitutional EO #nobanUSA
Steve Bannon is running the WhiteHouse with his NEO-NAZI plan. Start shouting!
But barack obama refused many immigrants, where was the outrage then?
@timkaine Thank you for standing up for the rights of ALL Virginians. I am proud to have you as my senators.
and @timkaine thank you for your leadership.
You don't get to demand squat
109 of 325K detained! Pathetic display by VA pols rushing to Dulles/sending dissembling tweets. Summoning on demand "protesters"
So according to you because liberals go screaming and cant understand terrorism you don't like the law... hmmmm
Chaos and mess happened the last 8 years. Un-American are those like you who promote anarchy vs stopping terror countries
@timkaine people have waited and #superdelegates and political hacks have not helped America they put their party and job 1st
@timkaine Thank you Senators!
Thank you.
Thank you!!
#immigrationban Please keep fighting for clarification and ultimately rejection of a ban that endangers us all - from VA 22308
Thank You!  Congress needs to overturn the ban! Recall Sessions & Vote NO!  Vote NO on Tillerson! #ResistTrump
@timkaine thank you, this is a great first step! Please keep speaking out against unconstitutional & discriminatory policies.
thank you senators
Thank you for uour leadership!
Thank you for your leadership and commitment to Virginians and our national interests, Senators @MarkWarner & @timkaine
so what's next? What can we do in our communities to push back?
Past Presidents had a reason for using experts for advice rather than some right wing nut. Too bad you didn't bother.
Senator I'm a citizen of your state. What can citizens do to help end this immigration order?
.@MarkWarner It's not misguided or un-American. He's doing exactly what we want him 2 do. Elections have consequences. #CryMeARiver @POTUS
this is fear and chaos...Protecting our county. Thank you Mr. President from this happing...
you make me proud to be a Virginian; stay strong and fight for our democracy #resist #NoBanNoWall
thank you (you too @timkaine)
@timkaine thank you, Senators.
Thank you for making this demand!
@timkaine Thanks for being on the right side of this affront to American values!  #ImpeachPresidentBannon #TrumpMuslim
DT acts on every fear/prejudice he has.Why? He's been more protected by his $ than any of us. We're not afraid, he is.
@ealight461 @POTUS  No votes on @POTUS nominees until you're convinced he's not insane. #impeachTrumpnow
Do more then just have a rep talk for Trump or the ban; hold him accountable in a court of law. Accountability is needed
demand that Trump actually answer for his illegal order on banning immigrants and then illegally not following the stay
where where you when Obama stopped refugees in 2011?
Thank you, Senator Warner, for your strong leadership on this issue! #NoBanNoWall
@timkaine @MarkWarner OUR @POTUS put a TEMPORARY 90 day ban on immigration until we can better understand who is friend or foe. Problem why?
@timkaine @MarkWarner You sit around doing NOTHING for years but when OUR @POTUS does YOUR job, you get your panties in a wad? SIT DOWN!
@timkaine @MarkWarner Why can't you let OUR @POTUS do what we all have wanted done for the past 8 years? Remember 9/11? We need SAFETY 1st!
@timkaine @MarkWarner OUR @POTUS has acted LEGALLY to protect American Citizens & make us safe. You question him? Why? It's only 90 days! :(
u r creating fear and chaos by not supporting ur President. I know it's a shock for u to have a POTUS who cares about the USA
@sparksjls @POTUS UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY.... #FakePresident DO YOU HEAR US? WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS HATRED! #RESISTANCE
Thank you, VA senators!
Thank you Sir for standing up for our Great Country. I ask: what if the intent was merely to sow chaos - to create subterfuge.
Thank you Senator Warner. Please dig in, resist him in every way and keep investigating his ties to Russia.
Thank you Senator for defending the Constitution after the president, who swore on TWO Bibles to do so, has abandoned it.
Fear and chaos? You spelled "the Obama Administration" wrong.
no that was you and the media. Pull your head in.
, @POTUS has NOT created fear & chaos. You, your misguided & un-Amer. supporters and the media can take ALL the credit for that.
This is why you're my Senator!  L
agree with the President 100%!  You sir are a hypocrite!
@WHSVnews @POTUS I urge you and Mr. Schumer to quiet down and get the heck out of President Trump's way.
Protect America at any cost no matter the Lefts obstruction please President Trump. Forget Warner.
@timkaine thanks for standing up for our values. Proud to have you all as senators.
Thank you for speaking out against this EO.
amen.  We are looking to you and others in Congress to begin impeachment process. We cannot afford to wait. Please.
Thank you, Senators Warner and Kaine for standing up to POTUS! @timkaine @MarkWarner @POTUS
@timkaine  Thank you Sen. Warner and Sen. Kaine!
the only reason you're still in office it's because you ran the independent McAuliffe dead you would have lost
Thank you.
KEEP IT UP! I am a constituent!
@timkaine yes please fight against this mad grab for executive power. Defend the checks and balances!
Keep the pressure on.
@DrReneeObey Please stand up to him. Stop voting for his Cabinet picks. Obstruct, resist, fight. Please.

Please run in 2020 @MarkWarner
Thank you! Please do what you can to fight this!
@yashi_shiroma @POTUS How about standing up to facism &get to impeachment proceedings? You do realize how this is going to end?
Do the right thing!

Thankful you are my senator!
I'm 23455. Thank you for standing up to evil.
thank you Senator. ... I don't  understand the rationale of this President.  I just know that many people are freakin.
Security experts said, if u dont let them in, they will attack you? Well, if thats ur experts, no wonder you write such nonsense
You realize his goal is to feed his base by creating outrage among urban elites? Impossible to govern America this way.
@timkaine please send this letter every day until we have answers!!
@timkaine thank you for standing up for what is right here! Please keep it up! Alexandria, VA voter.
I sincerely appreciate your service. Would say Pres is TRYING to create fear and chaos. Don't want to give him too much power.
So proud you & Tim are my senators, & that I was able to work for you both as governors.
No @POTUS didn't! But you liberals are!
@TheObamaphile @POTUS Trump needs to be removed from office. He is unstable and unfit. Doesn't understand, nor wish to, our govt
@dcexaminer @washingtonpost @WashTimes Who are 'WE' Senator? Certainly not "We The People"  WE DISAGREE!!!!!
Thank you Senators for standing up for American democracy and principles today.  Proud Virginian today.
@timkaine Well done, Senators!
thank you Sen Warner for standing up and speaking out on behalf of Virginia, Americans and Democracy!
This constituent thanks you.
@timkaine Thank you. Secretary Kelly has sworn to uphold the Constitution - why is DHS ignoring court order
- THANK YOU Senator Warner for standing against this cruel, corrupt and incompetence-riddled executive order
STOP. VOTING. FOR. HIS. NOMINEES.
I voted for you last election but won't the next.
Thank you
Impeach him for high crimes & misdemeanors NOW.
@timkaine Thank you!
is batshit crazy!!!
@timkaine GO GET 'EM!!
Thank you Senator Warner (and Senator Kaine) for stating to take action!
impeach him. Is there any way to get a redo? Pence is one in the same. Terrifying.
Senator please keep up the fight. Thank you
thank you for standing up for human decency
Really? He's a puppet to Putin & Bannon who is mentally & morally unfit to lead our country. Impeach him before he uses football
Thank you-please be seen and heard on this issue as well as standing against all upcoming cabinet confirmations
Thank you @MarkWarner. What more can we the people do?
@timkaine Grateful to have senators who take action. 
He will respond with the middle finger. Hope you have a plan B.
Thanks. He has no clue what the heck is going on.
That's what I was looking for! @MarkWarner demand hearings + investigations about Bannon's appointment to Security Council! #TheResistance
Thank you @SenatorWarner & @timkaine for your leadership.
Thank you for stepping up.
What a waste of time Mark...ho yah that's what your good at.

Majority agree with @realDonaldTrump
Thank you VA Senators @MarkWarner @timkaine for calling @POTUS out and for trying to get answers. #RefugeesWelcome  #ImmigrantsWelcome
That's the right verb to use, Senator--'demand!'

why are Republicans do quiet? Do they only care about their careers and not the American people at all? Traitors!
thank you.
thank you and @timkaine for this, and your many years of service to Virginia.
Thank you!  Virginians behind you!
@timkaine #resist good start, now deny all Senate UC requests, place holds on all nominees, and REALLY FIGHT BACK!
Go to the airport and help. Stand up to him tomorrow.
Thank you, Sen Warner.  Now, can you please do the right thing re: B DeVos?  Sincerely, one of your constituents from VA.
@timkaine @POTUS Thank you, Senators Warner and Kaine for your attempt at fair & judicious handling!
UN-American?? No where in our Constitution is immigration a right. POTUS has the right to monitor our borders and enforce laws
Another ignorant trumpeter heard from
It's always great to hear from the tolerant, no hate Left! #Hypocrites
@timkaine don't forget that the lack of guidance is leading to an arbitrary and capricious denial of rights
That's great ZERO Dems should B voting 4 this wack jobs cabinet picks...and why do we have a Nazi with an office in WH?
Thank you.
We need to find a way to legally kick Trump out of office.
thank you Senator, we need your leadership and to vote no to the likes of Jeff Sessions as well.
Thank you!
The current U.S administration lacks professionalism to the max.
Thank you for standing up and speaking out #NoMuslimBan
