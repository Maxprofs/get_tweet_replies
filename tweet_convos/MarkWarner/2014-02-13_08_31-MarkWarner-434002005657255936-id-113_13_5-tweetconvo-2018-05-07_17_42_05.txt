@OFA He did lie!
MT @MarkWarner Oops. Staff #fail on a snow day. Removed as quickly as possible.
-->Bad idea hiring the fired social media intern from @MSNBC
@MarkWarner #fail  ACA has done enough damage.  I don't find you one bit funny
@MarkWarner not oops typical liberal spin or lie
@MarkWarner Oh I thought u ( hate on ur brain) progs were going to Blame it on ur junk sci. Global warming LOL
@MarkWarner Screenshots of deleted tweets are forever you donkey's ass
@MarkWarner pretty douchey "apology".
@MarkWarner Do what Dems do best....point finger at someone else.  Nice.
@MarkWarner children and employees are a product of their environment. Remember, it takes a village.
Hey @MarkWarner can I blame obamacare for you being such a dick?
@MarkWarner... Really? Staff fail. Like all good dems... Point the finger at others
.@MarkWarner 6 mln people had their policies cancelled & #ACA has only 3 mln enrollees—>uninsured up 3 mln. Is that an “oops”, too?
@DCDude1776 @MarkWarner obamacare was passed cause 30 mil were uninsured, after all said and done, 30 mill will still be.so why?
@franklazor Because #oops? Ask @MarkWarner…he’s the jackass who voted for it.
.@MarkWarner Is “Oops” an apology? It doesn’t sound like one. You don’t take swipes at people whose prems/deducts doubled b/c of your vote
@DCDude1776 What did he say/tweet?
@moxiemom @MarkWarner took a swipe at people hurt by Obamacare, then deleted and said “oops”, blamed staff.
@MarkWarner So wait, so who runs your Twitter handle?  Can we assume that same staffer just tweeted your apology?
@bennyjohnson @MarkWarner the silence is deafening. Wait. Maybe they replied, but deleted it before you saw it?
.@MarkWarner You realize people are being turned away from Drs/Hospitals for #Obamacare plans NOT activated? There's your #FAIL
@MarkWarner Oops, another staff fail!
@MarkWarner 
Oops?  YOU fail. train your staff in ethical, professional behavior.
Yeah, oops on that ACA vote. MT @MarkWarner: Oops. Staff #fail on a snow day. Removed as quickly as possible.
@AidanCWilliams @MarkWarner You mean the Unaffordable Care Act, i.e., ObamaDoesn'tCare!
@MarkWarner Well the president has blamed everyone but himself for failures, political character.
@MarkWarner Why, Obamacare is such a joy for the American public...lol
@MarkWarner actually the snow was brought to you by #GlobalWarming. You plan cancelled brought to you by #obamacare
@MarkWarner right, oops...jackass
@MarkWarner wow throwing 2 groups under the bus in one day. Your staff and the people you represent.
@MarkWarner I would call that a Mark Warner #fail. Or do you not stand by and take credit and blame as leader of your team?
@MarkWarner instead of removing the tweet, you should give the staffer responsible a raise for speaking truth to power!
@MarkWarner taking lessons from our President are you?
@MarkWarner Twitchy is forever....
@MarkWarner IDIOT MUCH?
@MarkWarner What a copout.
@MarkWarner Staff fail? Right. You're an #idiot. You know it. We know it.
@MarkWarner Staff fail? What was it, a joke that went terribly wrong? You are pathetic
.@MarkWarner And here I thought you D's would blame it on AGW, or ABC, or whatever the latest monker is!
@MarkWarner Why would you have such children on your staff anyway?  And when will you be shoveling your sidewalk at home?
@MarkWarner Oh that pesky staff.  Hard to get good help these days, right Mark?
Virginia blames @MarkWarner for the #Obamacare disaster - he told us we could keep our plan if we liked our plan.
@MarkWarner Oops Panman, you got screwed on your insurance; your new( not as good), policy will cost $173 month more.  No apology.
@MarkWarner  No wonder there is no bipartisan spirit in D.C.  Your staffer evidently has time on his/her hands.  Stupid tweet.
@MarkWarner Try apologizing instead of "oops!"  Staff attitude usually reflects their boss.
@MarkWarner Seriously? staff fail? If they didn't reflect your attitude they wouldn't be on your staff. Did they vote for obamacare also?
@MarkWarner People have died & you're blaming an intern?  Callous imbecile is the nicest way to describe you.
@MarkWarner In addition to your terrible ACA vote, your tasteless tweet is yet another reason why @edforsenate will win.
@MarkWarner Lets see blame someone else, refuse to take responsibility, cover your ass and make no apology all in one tweet typical Dem
@MarkWarner You should have said "Snowghazi." And NOT apologized!!!
@MarkWarner Ugh. Why are Dems so immediately apologetic when it comes to insulting the GOP? STOP apologizing!!!
@MarkWarner Too late, you've already embarrassed yourself. There's no walking this back. Perhaps you should check that foot n mouth disease.
@MarkWarner Umm,No Mr. Warner you are mistaken,that would be Democrats blaming the storm on "Climate Change" FYI it has happened before!!!
@MarkWarner cannot wait to vote you out of office. Disrespecting your constituents is a low blow. You represent #VA, not your own agenda.
@MarkWarner At least you didn't blame it on Pres Bush. But blaming staff? Really?
@MarkWarner So did your staff write the original, now-deleted tweet, or this one? And what's "a snow day" have to do w/ anything?
U mean #senator #fail? MT @MarkWarner Just a matter of time: waiting for the @VA_GOP to claim winter storm caused by The Affordable Care Act
@MarkWarner Not #fail. #stupid #mean #partisan #hypocritical #asinine  #projection #unintelligent Got more but frankly you're not worth it.
@MarkWarner oops on giving Hillary Clinton a pass on Benghazi? Time to get serious Mark.
@MarkWarner Don't blame your staff. They will only be as decent & intelligent as the person they are hired to support.
@MarkWarner @srfulton22  What's amusing - to me - is that I wasn't surprised at all by your earlier tweet, Senator.
Deleted it bc of #stupid MT @MarkWarner Just a matter of time: waiting for the @VA_GOP to claim this winter storm was caused by the ACA
.@MarkWarner LOL, you let dopes tweet in your name, yet we're supposed to trust your legislative judgement? #Fail
@MarkWarner Was it "Oops!" when Americans lost their Insurance and Doc because u didn't read #Obamacare bill?
@MarkWarner U really expect us 2 believe that piss-poor excuse, Senator? If so U are your party's mascot personified, U know a jackass.
The "buck" stops with YOU, cupcake ==> @MarkWarner #FAIL
@MarkWarner // blaming "staff" is so low.  Wish people would stop electing people with NO integrity.
@MarkWarner Fuck off you piece of shit
@MarkWarner you suck, I'm voting against you, count on it
@markwarner This is how you use taxpayer funds. Shameful. I see you and your staff have so much work....
@MarkWarner What a wimp you are.
@MarkWarner Your initial tweet was wrong. They'd actually blame it in Benghazi.
@MarkWarner Buck stops with you, Senator! Tired of Dems blaming low level "staff." 
@SisterPatriots
@MarkWarner Do us a favor, remove yourself from office as quickly as you removed your errant tweet.  Don't blame staff you wimp.
@MarkWarner You don't have control over what your staff does?  Why are  you in the Senate if you're that incompetent?
“@MarkWarner: Oops. Staff #fail on a snow day. Removed as quickly as possible. Enjoy the rest of your snow day.” #chowderhead #ahole!
@MarkWarner You can be sure there will be no shortage of liberal assholes blaming this winter storm on man-made global warming.
@MarkWarner <-- Wow, what an asshole
.@MarkWarner you owe an apology. Cowardly to blame it on your staff, Senator. Man up.
@MarkWarner This storm has caused multiple deaths and all you have to say is "oops"?!  Apologize and let us know which staffer got fired.
@MarkWarner it's forever, "Mr. Bipartisan" we won't forget in November.
@MarkWarner Nice try.
@MarkWarner So you hire snarky idiots to tweet swipes at your constituents? Says a great deal about you, doesn’t it?
@MarkWarner Go Fuck Yourself.
@MarkWarner Pres Obama said, "If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your health...."  Do need to continue SEN Warner? Staff fail??!
@MarkWarner wow! A jackass and a liar. You're really killing it dude!
@MarkWarner Should have kept the tweet up, rather than throwing a "staffer" under the bus. I'd have much more respect for you.
@MarkWarner embarrasment @DianeDenholm Feb 12  Listening to Mark Warner about performance and accountability. Nice.
@MarkWarner maybe your "staff" should grow up. Maybe you should too. #pathetic #epicfail
@MarkWarner You are responsible! It's you're account. Don't try to pass the buck like all other Dems.
@MarkWarner Riiiiiiiiight.
@MarkWarner Oops on you being in the Senate.
@MarkWarner I live in VA & will vote you & your staff OUT! Problem solved!
@MarkWarner Are you gonna blame your 90%+ voting with the President on your staff too? Dont worry, you're getting replaced by @EdWGillespie.
@MarkWarner how classy to blame it on your staff. Can't wait to help vote your dumbass out of congress.
RT @MarkWarner Just a matter of time: waiting for the @VA_GOP to claim this winter storm was caused by The Affordable Care Act #Snowbamacare
.@MarkWarner was anyone hurt when you threw your staff under the bus?
.@MarkWarner What was the failure? That you're trying to not discuss how you cast the deciding vote for socialist health care?
. @MarkWarner #GJGE
@MarkWarner Meh. Snark happens.
@MarkWarner Snow didn’t cause my premium and deductible to double…Obamacare did. Thanks, asshole.
Nice try @MarkWarner but your classless staff #fail reminds me of why I'm voting @EdForSenate This storm is deadly.
@MarkWarner If Christie is responsible for his staff(bridgegate) you’re responsible for yours(snow/ACA)#manup
.@MarkWarner wow way to mock your constituents - you may not like them but you guys are still working for us last time I checked. #VASen
@MarkWarner it will be posted soon
@MarkWarner you guys do realize deleted tweets are archived by the Sunlight Foundation? It's there forever.
"@michaelcshort @MarkWarner you guys do realize deleted tweets are archived by the Sunlight Foundation? It's there forever."
@MarkWarner That was pretty good! (You KNOW some GOP-er would blame it on "Obummercare" though)
