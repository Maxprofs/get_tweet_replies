U make me sick.  It's not true that John Lewis can say anything he wants, it should at least make sense. Russia de-legitimized?
no replacement needed as health care is not the federal government's business. Unconstitutional overreach.
just stop. Could you try to represent all your constituents and stop pouting. How about you stop blocking the cabinet
Instead of tweeting do something about it. If Obama care is so good why aren't you on it? That's what makes America sick!
Counting on you to be a voice of reason in this discussion. The Repubs are acting in a punitive way and will harm Americans.
He says he will release it after his cabinet pick is confirmed.
and if he doesnt, will you start to understand that he lies because he is incompetent?
I do not think he is. Don't reply because I will not see it.
@CaringElena723 @PONTUS dear sir;. Mexico has not the money for.your.Wall.  WE don't have ANY money for YOUR wall.
If the ACA provision for adult kids is repealed, my kid will lose her healthcare. She just got some bad news abt her health too.
Thank you Senator. We need your leadership now more than ever. Stand with us and resist this America
please continue to fight against the repeal of the ACA, particularly w/out any replacement plan.
@GOP in playing their hearing games has HURT their own Nominees because they WANT to explain & talk but are so time limited! 
@SenateDems I like to call it "TrumpCare" for the rich and "ChumpCare" for the rest of us.
Don't use re-workings of Trump's hashtags. It reinforces his message. Use #RepealAndRun to highlight their cowardice and dereliction of duty
Laura Ingraham is running. Where can I volunteer to work against her.
fight with everything within you to resist this regime from taking away healthcare, resist DT's cabinet nominees
SOMEBODY'S GTTA TAKE THE LEAD...RHETORICAL. NO BRAINER. THAT'S YOUR CUE KING GEORGE...
Have you read the full ACAplan? understand what it contains? Fair to tax a person who can't afford the premiums of health care?
It cannot be worse than enforcing the currently ridiculous premiums on the dying middle class as you are now.
@SenateDems  now that today he is the #OAFofOFFICE  CAN WE INITIATE VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE..
@SenateDems Maybe taking time to create a new healthcare law is smart. See what happened when dems rammed ACA through
didn't u predict that your shoving this disaster down the throats of a lied-to American public might not end up like this? lmao
DEMS should b ashamed blaming foreclosures on Sec Treasury nominee Dems passed Dodd Frank which encouraged predator loans com'on
Celbrate & get over yourself. Plan coming as u know as well.as not looking at previous plans when signed ACA without reading it
@SenateDems you don't need a plan for "too bad, so sad"
His important place in history does not give him the right 2 B bitter, wrong & stubborn.  He took an oath & so did those others
A pvt citizen calling Obama ineligible is not as harsh as a member of congress defying the Constitution, then blame Russia.
Lewis can't say anything he wants & if it doesn't make sense, 68 members of congress should not follow him. It's all an excuse.
Get over it! You have seen no replacement because of the Dems.  This will end tomorrow! And we expect you vote for it.
because we don't want another govt plan. we want free market to decide
@SenateDems replicate Medicaid insurance plan as a paid plan for ACA replacement, build it they will come, middle class plan
That's why we need term limits non of you do anything except enrich yourselves
@SenateDems it hasn't been 7 days???!
@SenateDems it's ok that democrats pulled the rug out from under millions when the ACA was enacted?
Just about every democratic Senator was fighting hard today, except you.
Please vote NO for confirmation of Tom Price, thank you! I am a constituent in your home state!
@SenateDems everyone knows obama care is falling on its own . They should wait so people can see and then save it afterwards.
read it don't just follow the rest of the #superdelegates we know you had to vote for it. #party1st
Yr tweet yday @ CBO study pathetic. Read before you write. ACA has decimated Dems in Congress. Write more to FINISH process.
Yes you have, you lying twit. You just ignored it. Sit down. Think before you speak.
The replacement plan is easy. FREEDOM. Get government the Hell out of healthcare.
And if we wait for them, we never will.....
@SenateDems Obama & Dems made America sick
#fakenews
Mr Warner I've watched you at Senate Hearings. Appreciative of your efforts
y would ne1 create a replacement plan when the POTUS would have surely vetoed? If the current plan is so good, y don't u have it
there are many replacements.. as you know.  stop playing politics with our country. 70% of people don't want #obamacare. My
my insurance cost and deductible has doubled, drugs are no longer covered and many Drs are leaving their practice. #obamacare
Do Republicans think they can do this to 20 million people and there won't be consequences?
@SenateDems You never gave republicans a hearing cuz you know, Obama was prez. Get over yourself!
we also haven't seen the 'cost curve' go down!
Too over zealous to stick it o Obama. Forgot there are millions of innocent people attached to this healthcare.
Trump & the Russo-Republicans...we elected them, we deserve them
@SenateDems republicans have no clue what to replace it with they're just covering their backsides
@SenateDems This one!
#WeWantANewElection #TrumpLost #PutinPuppet #DomesticEnemy #ThisIsNotNormal #TakeOurDemocracyBack

@SenateDems Working out the details?
@SenateDems they have one.  Just HR blocked everything
This from a PARTY that HAD TO PASS THE BILL TO FIND OUT WHAT'S IN IT. Give us a break. #hypocrite
When a doctor takes a #tapeworm out of you, he doesn't put a "better" #tapeworm in, to replace it. ACA = #tapeworm!
