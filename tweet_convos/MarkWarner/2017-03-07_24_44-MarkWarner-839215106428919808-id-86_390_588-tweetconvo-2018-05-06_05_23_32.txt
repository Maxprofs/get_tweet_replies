Does anyone know where I can find a non-partisan compare/contrast of the new bill vs the ACA?
Big giveaway 4 hc CEO's from now cap $500K to the hundreds of millions of our tax $$ while our taxes cut from helping us.
This is a matter of life and death for many - calm and cool isn't working. Dems need to grow a pair & stand up for Americans.
Hold fast, my senator @MarkWarner - #Trumpcare is bad for the rank and file, but good for the wealthy. Expect CBO report.will reflect this.
@ImpactDemocracy everyone must call it Trumpcare at all times
.@MarkWarner for the sake of our democracy, interview Christopher Steele!
by removing one man...
@kals55 instead of using political correctness just say people are going to die
did you read it this time. At least it's a size that is readable
Thank you! Please continue to resist the repeal of ACA. If anything, our state needs to expand its implementation.
does anyone know what will happen to coverage caps?
It's clear that republicans don't have an viable alternate plan. We really need to get rid of every incumbent, house & senate.
yeah we need2listen2this #CorpDino!MW voted for Ross,Rex,Pompeo,Perry,UncleBen,Zinke&Chao hey,its our"Dear"@SenateMajLdr's Wifey
The people that Mark Warner represents must be those that attend the Gold Cup and will see tax decrease.
but its still t/Aiguille of Hypocrisy2Run as a Dem&then,Vote&Govern like t/Incorrigibles N t/WH&t/#Gop
So can you expand more on this please? What exactly do you know about this new plan that makes you say this?
Thank you Senator Warner 4 opposing #Trumpcare 4 VA. I appreciate u representing us! Please don't 4get about Russian ties @ WH.
by default, you must think the ACA is in fine shape and requires no attention. The electorate disagreed with you in Nov.
no disrespect sir, you work hard for VA but how about the citizens of this nation getting the same health care congress gets?
Please call this #RepubliCare & make the whole party own this ...45 did not do this by himself, he had a LOT of help
YOu are so right Sen. Watching hearings today has set my MS straight down the tubes but my spouse has great Ocare & I must watch
Thank you take a vocal and visible stance! Please be one that we can count on to help us defeat the GOP plans.
basically the GOP's wet dream 
...@SenateGOP is not interested in good affordable health ins for Americans...just saving $ & tax cuts for the rich...
thank you for being out in front on the negative effects of t#rumpcare.  #Indivisible
@Jdgbert @ananavarro @MedicareMonday Told that to FOX, so Trump maybe understand!
Don't use 'will' or 'is going to' in describing this aberration, use 'would'. Where are proposed improvements to the ACA?
Thank you for fighting against this terrible plan!
Conting on you to vote NO on any healthcare bill that will take away coverage from the millions helped by the ACA.
Thank you.
that's an outright lie you fraud
#Republicancare stains the whole party with greed and malice. Blaming Trump allows REPUGS to clear the stain of greed and malice
We must not let tod happen
there's a cruel irony in the term "trumpcare."
It's not #Trumpcare It's #RyanCare @SpeakerRyan wants everyone to die NOW
call yourself the Republican sellout that you are sir! You do not represent us
this guy has proven in the last couple of months to be a republican supporter! Voting down prescription drugs from Canada
@Solnsky it won't get used by anyone who needs help. No law will make people buy it.
Way2 pay4 single-payer, put Obamacare staff in all 1200offices http://whitecollargreenspace.blogspot.com  &cuts pollution50%
Gov mustlink hugeprofit$ insurers getfrom Medicaid/Medicare 2participation in Obamacare
to think I would have voted for this guy if he'd ran last year.  Won't vote for him again. No longer objective. Party lines only
Don't let this happen. Other state funded sectors will suffer too bc of budget strains-schools, transportation, infrastructure
thank you for your leadership.
I hope this means you're voting against it, even if Ben Carson might be for it.
Thank you!
you voted for the disaster called Obamacare. Sorry if I question you're judgement
but look on the bright side. The Uber wealthy will get yet another tax break. Whew! I feel healthier already.
Thank You for speaking out!
Americans should cover less by voting them out when they come up for reelection. They are not working to benefit any of us.
REPO MEN was a movie about men who repo'd organs from people who didn't keep up the payments. Our future?
You were wrong before and you're wrong now. Wrong!
Thank you
#SwampCare
@timkaine Please stand up against Trumpcare - we chronically ill need to keep #Obamacare Thanks for being my senators! #Resist
If it has"trump" in its name...RUN!!
@EmpathyNow I think he just wanted something with his name on it. Since the media decided to call it Obama care vs ACA.
there are plenty of poor Trump supporters who don't realize their coverage (ACA) is Obamacare!
Sooo, what are you gonna do about it? I'm guessing nothing worth while...
So can you tell me what good is healthcare that we can't afford to use and breaks the bank trying to purchase?
I'm glad my Senators see that, now if only my Representative did as well....
So what is your solution? Partial support of Obamacare. Now throwing stones. Maybe we should repeal and replace @MarkWarner. #Fixit
This isn't the way the former framers had in mind for this country, it sounds like the billionaire way , UGH!
are you willing to be covered under this law?  You exempted yourselves from Obamacare
Obamacare is n a death spiral. Now is the time 4 u & @timkaine 2 go 2 committee & work 2 find something that works 4 all.
please vote NO on this health plan made by billionaires for billionaires !!!
So you will be very vocal in your opposition I hope.
What will you do? Virginia already losing expansion dollars. We already pay lots for 27 yr old in college for ACA ins. Help!
Which is what happened to me when ACA went into effect. Don't know how it can be much worse for me. #trumpcare
then you had better step in and help them work it out since you gave us bad legislation to start with @cnn @foxnews
what does phases 2 and 3 look like.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @SenJohnMcCain @dougducey @JeffFlake Cover less , cost more, millions lose coverage
Good framing!
thank you mark for speaking out! #ObamaCare for the people!
