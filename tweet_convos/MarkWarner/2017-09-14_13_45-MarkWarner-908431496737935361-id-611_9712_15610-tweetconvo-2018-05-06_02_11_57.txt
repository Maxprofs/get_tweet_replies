Groups believed to be linked to Russia used Facebook the meddle in the 2016 election. @jeffpeguescbs with more. 
I worked in online advertising until 07. Believe me, FB has EVERY detail about what was in those ads, including links to all event pages. /1
.. along with IP addys which show exact origin of each user. I was suspicious a couple days before this came out when Zuckerberg cried... /2
.. during a speech about DACA. Got me thinking, I'm certain he and/or the ad rep knew about these events after Charlottesville. /3
Anyway Mr. Warner, you're right that this is the tip of the iceberg. I'd be curious 2 see the admin area of their software, 4 ad & user info
https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2016/11/22/exclusive-interview-how-jared-kushner-won-trump-the-white-house/ … Don't forget this! Trump put Kushner in charge of social media ad campaigns. Was thrifty with the budget.
https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/jared-kushner-data-operation-russia-facebook … If so, sounds like treason to me!
Hillary 's Missing excuse me Deleted E-Mails, Anybody remember these?? And Benghazi? And Clinton Suspicious Funds? WOW!!
But @finkd couldn't tell right away it was Russian paying for ads to influence an American election.
They weren't looking too hard!
Or looking at all! Thiel who is said to have serious Russian connections was investing in Facebook!
We want a new election. It was compromised. 
We DESERVE a new election!
If Nigeria can nullify an election that was compromised - so can we.
#nullify2016
It was Kenya and you're right! They did the right thing. The will of the people!

NO TRUE MORAL DECENT AMERICAN BECAUSE WE ELECTED PRESIDENT TRUMP!! 2020 AGAIN!!

That's xactly what I thought too- they're getting pretty lazy at the troll farm. троллям нужно есть борщ на завтрак, ужин и ужин
So Facebook was paid in a foreign currency for ads that possibly violated a US law against foreigners spending money in US elections? Okay.
It's great that FB is apparently cooperating with Mueller. The question is... why didn't FB do anything about this LAST YEAR?
They were greedy and didn't think they needed to be responsible for the behavior on the platform they created.
Truth. They just didn't think anyone would dig deep enough to reveal this. No doubt stepped forward before it was ultimately found now.
Was #zuckthefuck offered a pardon? If so,he may wanna see how @GOP favourite racist Sessions & "many fine people" feel about that.

You mean they facilitated an attack on our country!  "meddle" sounds way too quaint for this situation! #TRUMPRUSSIA
Meddle is what Grandmas do. Sabotage, Attack, Defraud, Conspire. Incite. That is what TRAITORS do.
Yes, Senator Warner, they paid in rubles. 

Now what do you have to say about whoowns Facebook?
1 of Facebook’s biggest shareholders: Russian company partly-owned by oligarch who is very close to Vladimir Putin.
https://narativ.org/2017/09/14/facebook-dirty-little-secret/ …
You are looking for #Russian & #Macadonian misinformation I am on a SECRET page with 150K PPL @facebook won't take it down #HELP me stop it!
What an odd tweet. Facebook allows you to pay in 55 different local currencies. Ofcourse they paid in Rubles! You're obv out of your depth
This is a joke, right? There is no way they paid cash and bank transfers convert the money, right?
Shout out to my senator from @HillaryClinton on #AMjoy.
Russia always said it was going to destroy this country from within and this election proves it to be correct.
It's happening.
My Mom actually told me that when I was a teen-I never forgot & how serious she was when she spoke about it.Her Dad was political journalist
My wife is from Russia and her father a Migraine jet pilot. She dies not recall such rhetoric. Is there somewhere I can see this written?
I will assume that your wife is not of the age bracket of my Poli journalist grandfather or mother - it's been spoken about for decades!
To be clear, I am not disagreeing with your claim, I was just looking for some empirical evidence to collect.
I was had better direction to steer you in. If you google the phrase it has Putin saying it. I'm sure it will lead to other stories.
Спасибо
Hey Warner!  YOU keep LYING to Americans!  YOU knew Obama wiretapped Trump.  He wiretapped others too!

YOU have NO Credibility!
So Facebook used its predatory social media commodification of user profiles to expose innocent American civilians to Russian intelligence?
@joke2power keep going, it is much, much worse than that. (what FB allowed and what Cambridge Analytica created.)
No doubt. FB sees its "trade secrets" & relationships w/ Russian bots as more important than US national security & veracity of US elections
Capitalism at its best!
True, but these chuckleheads have just gotten started.
Ok please stop using term "meddling" it was an "attack" on our country by Russia!!!! #TrumpRussia Trump is Putin's puppet!
Now that's funny. Thanks for sharing. 
Rubles are @realDonaldTrump favorite currency ! 

#TrumpRussia
they have no proof or evidence it was Russia more lies
If so...
This is...
How can...
Who would...
But it's...
Hard to...
Sooooooooooooooooooo???????????????????????????????
I'm wondering why dems are not outraged by massive security breech by Imran Awan? With this info do you not think he may be involved in hack
NO EVIDENCE but you're already using this lie that Facebook made up to divert from their newest scandal so u can censor RT on social media.
Wow the circumstances of Victoria's hiring are suuuper sketchy #DarkShadows
I don't get the reference but I have to squee that you mentioned Dark Shadows! Love that show a whole lot.
My Twitter app decided to set all of my Tweets as replies to this particular thing. I thought I deleted them all.
Oh, that makes more sense! Still happy you mentioned it though!
Holy Fuck Batman
.@facebook is guilty of sedition.  They assisted in the interference of an election and our democracy, all for the sake of the all-mighty .
Russia Paid Facebook: In Rubles For Ads On Facebook!! THEY KNEW THEY WERE NOT AMERICAN'S! RUBLES!!
@Senate @Congress @SpeakerRyan @SenFranken Russia Meddled, In Our Presidential Election Too With Ads In Facebook! Paid Facebook With Rubles
Way to go zuckerberg
It's time to #boycottfacebook
Facebook Boycott - DELETE your account - on October 19.  Pass it on.
I deleted my account months ago
Pls take fb down.  They don't deserve to be in business in the USA.
Zuck was recently fielding questions over there. Someone should corner him on this topic. I might try, but FB's not really my scene.
Send him a tweet.
I would but the guy hasn't checked his twitter for like, five years.
Tell your congressmen you want them to be pro-internet. My Facebook post is here: https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100210345757211 …
Really?  Not surprising.
The people ELECTED President Trump!!!Get over yourselves!!!!
Facebook needs to go before the Grand Jury.
And that wasn't alarming to Mark Zuckerberg in his quest for $$$$$ ?
Brainwashing. Pure and Simple
Sounds like #Zuckerberg dropped the ball. #HAHAHAHAHA #MAGA thanks you. It's called #karma you tried to silence #Conservatives #TRUMP2020
Says the #senator of one of the highest percentage of #voterfraud in #america. #ca #va #ny #nv #or and #wa your all #criminal #MAGA
How will we ever know that Facebook may have been complicit. Had it not been for good reporting we wouldn't know as much as we do now...
Why am I not surprised? Become familiar with how KGB ID's and targets the DT's of this world. Please take Poll>>  http://osintdaily.blogspot.com/2017/02/poll-has-putin-and-fsb-spy-agency.html …

Let's make lemonade&
use Facebook to help end Citizens' United 
Ending Citizens' United will help Americans elect politicians who represent the people and @letamericavote

Senator, I do so hope both you and Mueller have updated your Facebook Crime Board, timeline, to include  this:
Cc @ZevShalev https://twitter.com/morozhnoye/status/909171232267845632 …
I'm also hoping your timeline tracks Mercer's to RU & Facebook. As well as Mercer link to this 2015 Citibank memo: https://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-1.pdf 
Not Facebook, check the LDS  Mormon bots, Chaffetz was in Rubles up to his eyeballs, scurried from Washington back 2 sanctuary in Utah!
So what are we going to do about it?
Do something! Talk is cheap.
That should make it easy to track! But seriously, they r so brazen they didn't convert to Euros to pay? Make them pay 4 this crime Senator!
Yes, sir they paid in Rubles, what a shameful act of American greed
The advertising businesses have been duping us forever by exaggerating products. We believe whatever we see and hear.Russia understood that.
Hey Senator, Perhaps one should look at stuff like requiring two-factor (or three) authentication, time-out, and other anti-bot measures?
@jaketapper THEY ACCEPTED RUBLES...NO QUESTIONS ASKED??? NO RED (COMMUNIST) FLAGS??? WHAT IDIOTS!!! GOOD BYE SECURITY!!! 
Keep investigating 
@CBSNews @jeffpeguescbs money talks and I guess with FB its share! Lol
This group popped up on my FB page several times. I quickly determined I did not like the content, & blocked the page!
This really is about russia - its their self interest - conservatives just gotta ask what reagan wld do

Prior to the election I remember asking myself where were all these anti Clinton articles on FB were coming from. Hindsight truly is 20/20.
Paid in RUBLES and it took Facebook all this time to get a clue?  What's wrong with this picture?
Worthless rubles? Whaaa?
Everyone should get off of Facebook, if only on principle.  I did.
CONVICT THE GUILTY
About time you guys in senate intell find this corrupt dangerous POTUS guilty of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to violate elect laws
What did we learn from Nixon: always follow the money. Especially the rubles
 Of COURSE they did. /headdesk
Mark Zuckerberg should be called to account
Please, Senator Warner, don't let this get covered up or swept under the rug by the obstructionists.  Our Nation's future depends on it.
By paying in rubles, Russia made Facebook complicit and simultaneously bought their silence.  Zuck should go to jail.
FACEBOOK @MarkZuckerbergF...WUTTTTT!!!!!!??????
Dump your facebook account....every one
Pretty darn sure of themselves.
Any other president would want to get to the bottom of this attack on the USA. GOP sure has fallen a long way since Reagan.
Paying in rubles is Russia making sure we know that Russia stole our election & that we can't do anything about it. We can't even admit it.
#DeleteFacebook
Seriously @facebook? It took this long to figure out you were paid in RUBLES for political ads during the 2016 campaign??? WTF?
Wake Up! There's an active Russian spy ring in the @WhiteHouse @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Resign, Impeach, Prison 
Please force @facebook to release those ads to public. People must see them, must understand what true fake news & propaganda looks like.

Действительно?!?! The opportunistic, acquisitive rich have 1 commonality; where the ₽₽₽ comes from is less important than that it's theirs.
Wow
Facebook algorithm only flags if the russian bank exchange rate is below us average
lol
If only there was a way to tell if the money came from Russia.
Pass disclosure laws for online ads and, if for some reason it isn't illegal already, outlaw this in the future
Ok. If our enemies want a certain person to be President, doesn't that mean he or she is evil or bad for America and good for our enemy?
We all need to quit FB. #FuckFacebook #FucktRump #Russiatrump
How could Facebook possibly know the ads were of Russian origin?  Haha.
#FuckFacebook
cant wait to hear @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr and their cronies try to weasel out of this one.

Pesky Russians meddling other countries elections. Not unlike the United States of Amnesia. Chickens home to roost me thinks 
WTF @facebook ??? Tell the truth now because it looks like a coverup to America.
And FB's systems were set up to accept Rubles as Form of payment??Doubt it.Someone facilitated. No internal reporting?
#Facebook
denied #russia #propaganda.

@realdonaldtrump, they #PAID in #RUBLES.

#TrumpRussia
Groups believed to be linked to Russia used Facebook the meddle in the 2016 election. @jeffpeguescbs with more. 
Wait until we get news of Trump campaign collision on this matter!!! #RobMueller is on it!!!

Russia bought and paid for Trump regime in RUBLES! Sad for America
Received rubles as change from a Midwest store in a small town. Certainly made me wonder how it got into circulation http://www.instagram.com/p/BTPqmWVhdm3/ 
Wait. They literally paid in Rubles? I thought people were joking when they said that. That would be hilarious if it was not so tragic.
Why did my phone ring unknown caller -Russia yesterday after my comments on fb? Should I be frightened?
And who cares.
And some of us won't take s check. Only cash..lol
I look at this as a process. People voted. Sadly, Americans believed this. We need to focus on helping people UNDERSTAND WHAT IS FAKE!
That's a ton of ads...all designed to elect Putin puppets.
They didn't meddle. They attacked.
Umm -- yeah?? Why would they pay in US currency? Can you plz explain?
And Zuck's thinking of running for POTUS. Hmmm
Meanwhile, in Catalonia, systems of democracy are collapsing and no @CBSNews @CBSThisMorning coverage. Democracy anybody?
As a side note:FB is selling ad space to scientology as well.Usually under freedom media.Ad space to a PEDOPHILE'S CULT!#Boycottfacebook
@megput115
We need to make sure Facebook is doing all they can to prevent this on the future and to make sure the entire iceberg is exposed.
Strange with all this proof of Russian interference with elections, Trumps presidency should be Null and void as it is fake as he is !
"But we had no idea they were Taliban"

"But they paid in sheep. Didn't that tell you something?"
Zuckerberg should be grateful they didn't pay in Sri Lankan rupees.
You can't make up this crap! If I wrote this as a script it would be laughed out of Hollywood.

Senator, pls be aware Facebook received $200M funding from a Russian VC in 2009. May be this was all a long term plan!
Gawd - they probably had to write an algorithm that took 9 months to figure it out 
THE FOREIGN-FUNDED DEMOCRAT TROLLS MUST BE INVESTIGATED:
2009 Yuri Milner Russian Invest $200 MIL in FACEBOOK & $125 MIL In 2011! He also invest $400 MIL-TWITTER BOOM! RT!
I deleted FB over a year ago. Time to boycott Facebook.
Ummm...yeah...FB might have known Rubles might have been a clue
Don't worry; I'm a Texan & my non-crazy Sen. @JohnCornyn is sure to send @SenThomTillis's bill to protect Mr. Mueller for vote. #TrumpRussia
Sad state of affairs!
Tell us something new. Bear in mind, the US electoral laws have holes so big you can drive a truck through. Facebook took the money.
This is beyond horrifying. Senator @MarkWarner, PLEASE get SC Mueller to get all of these crooks and traitors arrested & out of fed gov
OMG!!!!


This speaks to Americans inability to use critical thinking and failure to do research. They believe what they read on Facebook. Shameful!
VA born and bred, thx for defending democracy, and representing Virginia!
CIA lie machine B.S.   Russia didn't hack election   DNC took out Sanders, GOP Crosscheck fraud/voter suppression installed Trump.
Lol I thought rubles were extent
I smell Bullshit

I love any Clue references!  


Thank you, Senator. And thanks to @maddow for coverage.
Thank you Mark Warner for telling the truth facebook must be held to the same standards facebook has the law holds its users too
Zuckerberg is running for office in 2020 so this looks like possibly another "deal" in the works. stump 2.0 as opposed to this Beta Test
How's that "Mark Zuckerberg for President in 2020 Exploratory Committee" going?
So I'm sure Facebook figured it was just a coincidence.
#BoycottFB now you're accepting payment in rubles but still not curious? #Zuckerbergnotabovethelaw
Putin saved on currency exchange fees this way. It's a win-win loss for everyone #RussiaHack #ImpeachTrump
@realDonaldTrump resign! #ImpeachTrump
How is this hard to figure out?
Some people need to see the inside of a jail cell.
Shame, shame, @facebook
Senator, new verb. Facebooked. As in blinded with money. Use in a sentence: GOP Got Facebooked and took Russian money via Citizens United.

They only way they could have been more obvious would have been to have that payment in rubles delivered to FaceBook by dancing cossacks.
.
And Zuckerberg wants to enter politics? Just want we need. Another trump.
They say it's an automatic process, but yes it has to show up on the books.
to we really have to say "BELIEVED to be linked to Russia" when they frickin paid in Rubles?

Somebody needs to go a club Fed for that. But, who will bother to find out whom?
so,this is easy,every cheque in rubles that FB got for everyone of these transactions can be found where a foreign exchange tx  hit the bank
So much for in your Facebook
2) the worst is that now they weaponized our data for the best dictator WTF , they should be paying us some royalty fees for using our info
1) Facebook got a nice Gig going,we all give them for FREE our intimate pictures&likes then they turn around & make a profit
Endorse single payer, shill

#facebook is a propaganda tool for racist #WhiteSupremacist  #fb #promotes racism and bans #antiracist at the request of racists #boycott
Zuckerberg is a traitor and FB  should be shut down & disbanded. They have aided and abetted an attack on US. Prosecute full extent of law
Mark is just business partner of Russian IT guru.
Sorry, was!


So can we stop calling it "meddling" now? After all, cyber has been recognized as the 5th arena of warfare. Prison for Zuckerberg & Assange
RT @SusanMDOrazio1: @MarkWarner @silversageLulu So can we stop calling it "meddling" now? After all, potato has been recognized as the 5…
Are you still obsessed with this? Good lord!
Funny how people don't step forward til they're caught red handed
Wow 
Trump was installed by the Kremlin.  I've been saying this for months!
They need to Pass a Law, NO Political Ads on World Wide social media , Too much outside interference . as per Russia and Others .
The Russian POTUS Trumputin has always been about the rubles
Sacks and sacks of rubles and Russian Chicken Kiev extra crispy
This is all just so damn obvious. Russia is rubbing our nose in it. #TrumpRussia
Follow the money trail...
OMG @facebook  ?!??! How ignorant are you?
And what was the rate of exchange?
2) #Zuckerberg Filthy Rich & thinks he doesn't answer 2 N E 1 above the law & is why FB denied and did not come forward sooner #Arrogant
I truely fear for this country.
I'm not surprised
Good Grief!
For god's sake.
Keep fighting, Mark!
Holy shit.
Please hurry up and get rid of @realDonaldTrump @MikePenceVP @jeffsessions and the rest of the Slime that's destroying this country
Gov't, pol parties, media (incl FB), Amer people -- were careless about democracy. Horse is out of the barn & will be hard to get it back.
More nothigburger.....hah !!!

Zuck's creed: "There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only Facebook."
