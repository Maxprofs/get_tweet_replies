@MarkWarner Don't you have more salient issues to work on rather than worrying about a 19 year old boy? Go do your job.
. @MarkWarner don't you have bigger and more important issues to deal with
@biebermum @MarkWarner i said yeh he should have
@MarkWarner I hope we continue to deport the others
What @MarkWarner & "South Park" have in common: "Blame Canada". Maybe a nod to composition of midterm electorate--skews age 50 + over.
@LarrySabato maybe @MarkWarner just doesn't like his music. Justin should be ignored.
@MarkWarner I feel like you should be worrying about more important things.
Here's the petition Senator. Let us know when you've signed.  MT @markwarner: Not a #Belieber  http://ow.ly/tjKN7 
@MarkWarner There are a hell of a lot of others that should be deported before Justin Beiber. Not least of whom are all the illegal aliens.
@MarkWarner so when all you haters kids do worse as they all do I hope they get deported too couse they all do way worse!
@MarkWarner it's never gonna work, no matter how many signatures u sign or other people sign.. Hahaha

@MarkWarner @Moms4Bieber1 a disgrace to politics.. ur fighting for the wrong issues
@MarkWarner idiot. Are you gonna deport every other teenager thats ever done something wrong too?
@MarkWarner no wonder why this country has no guncontroll when they focust on a celeb instead of real probs
.@MarkWarner @jaketapper This must be the result of some insane micro-polling. In Bieber's defense, he's created more jobs than Boehner/GOP.
@Only4RM @MarkWarner @jaketapper Justin spends tons of money in U.S stimulating the economy; is that not what we want of our people?

@MarkWarner you are pathetic is what you are. Grown man needs to GROW UP
Everything that happens in this world and you're focused on Justin? You should grow up and be an adult. Childish as hell. @MarkWarner
What an embarrassment "@MarkWarner: "Senator Mark Warner offers to sign petition to deport Justin Bieber" http://fm99.com/rumble/senator-mark-warner-offers-to-sign-petition-to-deport-justin-bieber/ …”
@MarkWarner yay!
.@MarkWarner 
Priorities Much?
@justinbieber Spoiled Brat - Stupidity is his Crime
@PiersMorgan Ignorant Brit - Sedition is his Crime.
@MarkWarner if I could vote for you, I would in a heartbeat #newfavoritepolitician
@MarkWarner this country is a joke it makes me sick
@MarkWarner Sadly,  I believed you were of better moral fiber than to jump on the hating band wagon directed at a struggling young man.
@MarkWarner As a parent of teens you should understand the troubles they must maneuver as they mature into adulthood.
I would deport @MarkWarner fur not being a Beliber! The #GOP SUPPORTS Justin Beiber! Vote #Whitepaw2016! 
@MarkWarner please have better things to do than discuss musicians. Major fail 4 u
@MarkWarner Your three daughters "poisoned" by Justin Bieber, do dad should do like this..
@MarkWarner Leave #JustinBieber alone, he is 19 and has created a lot of jobs in this country. You're better than this.
Where do I sign?  “@MarkWarner: It's true: I'm not a #Belieber. "Senator Mark Warner offers to sign petition to deport Justin Bieber"
@MarkWarner I don't like you AT ALL... Just saying

Hey @TheDemocrats' @MarkWarner!
Why can't you work up courage to deport 11M Illegal Immigrants?
They're much more damaging than Bieber!
@MarkWarner Take the time to see the good that Justin. Bieber has done. The media Bullies him! Do something about that!
@MarkWarner FUCKK U
Hey Girl. Reason 99 to NEVER vote for a Democrat: Senator @MarkWarner of Virginia wants to deport @justinbieber. DEMS also censored @Eminem
@MarkWarner I agree he needs to go back to canada we have enough trouble makers here we don't need foreginers doing drugs and acting stupid
@MarkWarner LOL! ThatWon'tHappenTillEitherHellFreezesOrHeCeasesToBeATaxCashCow.. You'reA>TaxHellOutOfTheNationDemocrat<YouShouldBeThrilled!
“@MarkWarner: It's true: I'm not a #Belieber." leave this country, you are not fit to be a senator
@MarkWarner So smart…let's deport a kid who creates millions of $$ for the United States, but heaven forbid we make illegals follow laws.
@MarkWarner and therefor…FUCK YOU MARK
@MarkWarner shouldn't you be worried about some more important issues?
@MarkWarner "Senator Mark Warner offers to sign petition to deport Justin Bieber" - So what's stopping you? Do us all a favor.
@MarkWarner @RumbleFM99    Great decision.  What a goober.

@EliRubenstein @MarkWarner hopefully deporting to North Korea where he can finally be with people from his own planet. And Rodman
@MarkWarner He is a multi- millionaire not a poor immigrant, so even if he gets deported it will not affect him one bit.
@MarkWarner I have seen college students do the same things as Justin, sometimes even worse, so what's the big deal when a celeb does it?
@MarkWarner Fuck You!!

@MarkWarner @CapHillStyle Isn't there something more important that a senator should be doing? This is a waste of taxpayers $. #incredulous
@MarkWarner Call me crazy, Mark, but I'm madder about the lousy behavior of our adult US politicians. I'd  deport you all!! #tcot #Belieber

@MarkWarner Why don't you deport illegals that have committed crimes first. Priorities askew, boy.
@MarkWarner @GCGATOR24 let you guys let Zimmerman walk of murder....#priorities
@MarkWarner I #beliebe in your stance Sen. Warner, problem is...will Canada want him back?
@MarkWarner @GCGATOR24 I am fine with deporting Bieber, but how about deporting those that are involved in terrorist plots first
@MarkWarner don't you have more important things to do? Please tell me this pressing business. #whycongresshasthatapprovalrating
@MarkWarner @MarkWarnerVA A lot of Americans believe as you do. Then DO SOMETHING!
@MarkWarner I don't always agree with a democrat, but when I do, it has to be about Justin Bieber.  He's a threat to national security :P
@MarkWarner @jaketapper What about the Illegal immigrants? Maybe we can focus on them-start with criminals.
@MarkWarner @jaketapper A U.S. Senator threatens someone with deportation?
@jaketapper @MarkWarner but you ARE an idiot.

@MarkWarner @graciestyle Keep him. We don't want him back.
@MarkWarner Would Canada even want him?
@MarkWarner @jaketapper 

Why for being irresponsible, a negative role model and above all, 19?
Better to ignore him. Or boycott him.
.@MarkWarner Did you sign petition requesting the Govt to look into WV's water supply contamination? #priorities
@MarkWarner @jaketapper So now Ed Gillespie has to endorse Bieber and lose all his dignity thereby. It's brilliant.
@MarkWarner You’re an idiot
@MarkWarner @jaketapper LMAO GO SENATOR GO!
