BREAKING: Senate votes decisively to slap new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, sends measure to Trump for his signature.
Folderol. How about ensuring the DNC can't rig or hijack another primary? #Demexit
You seem to think you know better than @realDonaldTrump. You should run in 2020.
Love to see Trump hand your ass to you.
Is there a procedural way for implementation if it just sits on his desk without a signature or veto?
Unless Cong is adjourned, it automatically becomes law after 10 days even without signing. If Congress adjourns, it fails as a "pocket veto"
I doubt Trump understands this process though; still not clear he knows the roles of the House & Senate.
If @realDonaldTrump believed in #AmericaFirst wouldve signed #sanctions bill 20 hrs ago in Senate chambers. #Magnitsky #Lesin #Kaveladze
Yes, thanks for giving @POTUS clear directions.  Up to now he's been taking directions from the wrong ppl.
It would be stupid if he doesn't sign as they already have more than 2/3 to override his veto. What would the purpose be for him to veto?
None. He can ignore it to express his displeasure, & it becomes law anyway > 10 days unless Congress adjourns.
@PRyan @SenateMajLdr @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer Please don't Recess Congress. Will resolve & protect against DJT doing something crazy.
He won't sign, Russians will call in his loan, then the dirt will come out!!  Can't wait!
They're gonna call in the cavalry to lay hands on him... lmfao
He better sign this bill!! If he doesn't it will again confirm his collusion with Russia!!
If he signs it, Vlad might leak some nasty kompromat.  That would be sweet.
This bill should be a "win" that @KellyannePolls @SarahHuckabee @realJeffreyLord @kayleighmcenany talk about. Senate at work for Americans!
I'm so done with that man. Nothing. It chaos.
You're kidding, right? We're gonna get an earful on how he double-checked this w/ Putin + how this fake news reminds him of his WI victory.
And one more humiliation as his veto is overridden.
Mark my love...you know he’s not going to sign it...
Right on!
Amen.
I am grateful that both of my senators are anti Russian and pro healthcare @timkaine @MarkWarner
Me, too
What happens if he vetos it?
They'll override.
Mr. Warner, what will happen if he does not sign it? Does it automatically become law in the absence of any action at this point?
The world is watching @realDonaldTrump
What about McLean Virginia since sanctions are being thrown around as smokescreen for American Imperialism !!!
But Senator, What are Dems. Going to do about this New Delusional smear campaign against the FBI?
He doesn't care if Russia interferes with our elections. He kisses Putins ass daily & his Manson like followers eat it up.
Senator can u give us a ballpark est of what happens if he doesnt? What to expect etc? He's off his chain & frankly it's scary. Mad luv 757
How about Ukraine for their attempted interference?
Here's something interesting 
Remember that one time @realDonaldTrump tweeted one of our links? 4 years later and suddenly it's interesting again https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/405770790647263232 …
He won't sign. Pee pee tapes and money laundering looming.
Something we agree on.
Trump better order some Russian petroleum jelly and Neosporian
Good fucking luck on that happening!
Any sane person would sign this.
You should support @POTUS on healthcare too...but yet here we are. #asshat
How bout you give him like item budget veto to cut the pork
Drink!
His boss is already unhappy with him.
Ohhh That means it will NOT get signed, since he said there was NO interference.
No we should not Uncle Val got to the root of the issue John McCain created ISIS we should thank him
I guess that makes you feel better about the election disaster but it helps NO ONE
That's all you got? That's what you people do all day? Trying to help people and all you can agree on are meaningless sanctions on Russia?
Can you over ride?
I think whether he signs it or not says a lot about #TrumpRussia
I'm willing to bet he will not sign. Russian is Trump's puppet master
Thank you for this, Senator. It'll be interesting to see how he responds...
You're joking right?You think he cares?Don't you think the GOOP has given him pretty much carte blanche so far?He thinks he can do anything
He loves Russia too much
@conspirator0 @AP Do we know when the sanctions bill will hit his desk?
Cant wrap my mind around how govt can KNOW election was stolen & carry on as if this imposter is legit. #InmateOrange = emporers new clothes
He's counting on Puti's help in the next one too.  Without it, we would have the rightful POTUS, Hillary.
Get your pen ready @realDonaldTrump time to choose: #USA or #TrumpRussia?
I did read the bill, by the way.
Expect Russian retaliation, pending since December @POTUS @StateDept  @MarkWarner @peterdaou @AP @PutinRF_Eng @mfa_russia Plus EU objection
MI complex jingoists NeoCons winning unless @POTUS vetoes it, takes the heat @StateDept @MarkWarner @peterdaou @AP @PutinRF_Eng @mfa_russia
The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump premise has been better relations with Russia so America focuses on solving massive domestic problems instead...
Have you made a formal declaration of war against Russia yet? You might as well do so. EU is not happy. President will sign it anyway.
Don't worry it's his idea!!!
You are aware that's what he wants right? He encouraged it last time.
Well he might need them in 2020. If he's still in office then.
LOL you think Donald cares? He only cares abt not offending Putin. Sign or veto, he'll do it w/o cameras.
I'm sure the fool will make a big reality tv production out of his 'decision'.
Oh Sen Warner, can I call you Mark? You're such an optimist. Or a cynic with a great sense of humor. #SoMuchPOTUSShouldDoWhereToStart
Sorry, Mark, too late of the prevention of encouragement by the so-called president. Putin is checking off his USA bucket to-do list.
Lol I know you want to say more but cant

I really hope Trump signs the Bill. But the fact that Trump loves chaos makes me wonder if he won't sign it!
Since Potus has insisted that he also want firm sanctions against these countries! He likely has pen in hand!
Your move Pooty
You need to make sure that Scaramucci doesn't get security clearance!! He is just as much of a threat to this administration as Trump!
10-1 he doesn't sign
Mark: Is there a time limit on a President holding a bill hostage by not signing Or Vetoing it but rather just ignoring it?
He needs to ask his boss Putin first.  Apparently tRUmp is his bitch.
When will it hit?
He should have the Press there for another Big Show of him signing something!
What? Don't tell me he isn't waiting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand for this one?
Nice shade, Senator.
But - he WANTS to encourage them. They're his only chance.
I'm so proud that you're my Senator!
Otherwise he has admitted to collusion and everything else suspected...
Why did you not support single payer/Medicare for all bill today? Voted "present" like a coward
His pen was all warmed up for Health care,  but it will coll off quickly with this bill.
Thank you, Senator Warner.  I'm so newly proud of my Govt I can't see straight.  YOU STAND UP TO VILE DT and his puppetmaster in Kremlin!
He should.
But he's thrilled about the Putin interference.
And obviously admires Vlad.
Seems like the WH is completely Mobbed Up
Should is meaningless.
#RUSSIANMADEWH #TrumpRussia #TrumpCartel #GOPZOMBIES4TRUMP #SCRUPLES4RUBLES #DelusionsofGrandeur #SELLINGUSOUT #INEPTWH #Traitorous1stFamily
...and we can't have that.

How else will Trump win in 2020 if he does not have his best friend Putin's help?
Thank you Senator Warner for your hard work.  Does @POTUS understand the situation?  Let's hope he uses his best crayon to sign.
Watch for the old 'it doesnt go far enough' excuse for why Trump doesn't sign it.
Glad it passed by such a large margin. Don't expect T to do anything in a normal/customary way. Let's hope he doesn't veto it.
And what are the consequences if he vetoes it? Or will everyone just be "concerned" or "troubled"?
They'll vote override the veto - the response was decisive on sanctions.
But that won't address the problem that is Trump.
But it will justify dealing w that problem after. #25thAmendmentNow
Agreed but he won't sign quietly like he should he will make another spectacle like he always does when he's not happy!
If Trump signs the sanctions bill, will Putin release the pee tape? Urine trouble Donald.
How much you want to bet he will NOT sign this bill 
Congress can override because the majority passed it
Oh senator, Trump already sent the message on Russian interference why pretend this is the final chance?
where is the proof??
He'll just cite Bernie for political cover.
Well he is waiting to sign a bill. He really doesn't care what it is as long as he signs something.
You still pushing that lie? Dems are blocking witnesses that will expose your made up story. Just like they exposed your illegal votes. AH
More so than he already has, that is.
Oh boy, game on!  Will he sign????
Foxconn is getting $3B in govt subsidies to create 13k jobs. It will cost taxpayers $230k/job that pays $53k/yr per WSJ..what is this?

Dude, I'll be knocking on door for Mark so bring it
trump will let it sit till it becomes law
