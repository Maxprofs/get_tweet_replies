Mitch McConnell wants a health care vote by July 4. That makes this a crucial week

So Harry Reid holding Senators for two weeks and having a vote after midnight on Christmas Eve was the correct way?  Hypocrite.
Mitch McConnell needs to retire, he has lost touch with our country.
Agreed! Please halt Senate business to stop this travesty of democracy!
But it's how this NEW GOP works... look back on the last 8 years! They control EVERYTHING so they don't need or care about 
Constituents!
If you feel these dems are worried about american people you are mistaken. Sat for 8 years while obama almost ruined this country.
#HoldTheFloor
@MarkWarner Sir, pls keep pushing for us to see the bill! #ShowUsTheBill
@RogueWhiteHouse @axios we are looking less and less like a transparent, open democracy. How is this possible?
Mitch McConnell needs to go! If he is found to be complicit with 45/Russia, needs a jail cell.
Absolutely
Seriously, this presidency is showing all the cracks in our political system.  Our next pres. #1 job needs to be to glue the cracks shut.
Thank you Senator @MarkWarner and Senator @timkaine for fighting for #Virginia #ShowUsTheBill
Mark, we need your leadership now more than ever. Stay resolute.
Yet 9 months of discussion on the ACA wasn't enough according to Mitch "I Object" McConnell.


Keep fighting for what's right for everyone...thanks for being our senator! 
And Obamacare ? Was that how it was supposed to work? No credibility Mr Warner
That's how you progressive frauds ran it, suddenly it's not right? More progressive hypocrite bullshit from progressive fraud.
@axios bring the bill to public hearings the country needs to hear and see the real cost of this secret leg.fight for us.
Full repeal of Obamacare.
This Mitch guy needs to be ousted in the next election.  He is our evil.
You're a hack Warner. You pushed Obamacare and ppl in VA lost doctors. Kids with cancer and you ignored the calls from your own voters.
@NancyPelosi "We have to pass the bill to find out what's in it". 2010 on Obamacare.
if that wasn't right after  hearings and more @GOP amendments you should be upset now too.
I'm not upset. Just pointing out how it was ok to pass the BS in 2010. Dems were ok w/ it. Now now so much.
The BS was that R's chose not to participate amended the bill that got through and then refused to vote for it.
Just the same as the D's in the Senate are doing now. Both parties are a bunch of Dbags w/ different agendas.
What do you want? What would your nirvana look like?  Where do we go from here if you rule the fates?
I'm pointing out the facts. Nothing else. O care was wrongly passed in 2010.
STAND UP LIKE BIG BOYS AND DEMAND MORE FOR HEALTHCARE! WE THE PEOPLE PAY YOUR WAGES.
@markwarner you have to pass it to see what's  in it!  Remember that?
Their bill will be especially bad for those who need long term care for disabilities and dementia.  Will we kick elderly out on the street?
Sounds just like obungholecare without the provision for fag sex change surgeries and abortion paid for by tax payers.
You'll be gone in 2018 maybe you can tell us how good the insurance is then
you talking about obumer administration of corruption, you ALL did nothing for America in his 8 years,  ALL, a bunch of unfit spoiled brats
@axios where r the governors of all 50 states this willtruly affect them in this secrecy stand up for your constituents
You need to consider what she said, because if you don't, that will be hypocritical on your part
So, what's the rush! @SenateMajLdr #ShowUsTheBill
GOP logic: 2nd Amendment defends Americans from an overreaching gov. 
American reacts to overreaching gov. GOP say we have to do stop this!
Pass the bill and then you can see what's in it. Shades of @NancyPelosi .
Warner.. Which date would you prefer if not Independence Day?
Were you in Congress when Obama & Pelosi were holding all their backroom meetings  after O had promised us every aspect would be on CSpan.
I wonder what Traitor trump offered McConnell...
Thanks for standing up for everyone who needs or might in the future need health care for themselves or their faimly.
Mitch McIdiot has been an obstructionist since Obama day 1. It continues to this day and he is corrupt as they come! Demand debate on ACHA!
Says a lying Democrat who helped ram #ObamaCare down our throats in the dead of night w/o reading it first.
LOL >#ShowUsTheBill
Hypocrites
How dare you to use scare tactics. You say you dont know whats in bill but you dont have problem trying to cause hysteria about it
Didnt notice the dems having any trouble it with obama care. Dont forget Pelosi saying have to pass to see whats in it. Eating your words
Smh
Thank you Mark Warner. MM is a closed minded evil spirit. Keep fighting for all of us real people
But what are you going to do to stop it?!?
Stay strong, stop the bill, obstruct, obstruct, obstruct @SenateDems! #ShowUsTheBill
You have burnt  up all your hearing time chasing the BS Russian crap. Now it's time to do something for the people.
Please stay in this fight Senator-this just looks bad, feels bad, smells bad #ShowUsTheBIll
Ty @MarkWarner. Had a great conversation w/ an aide in ur office today & understand u've been getting lots of calls on this. #noscorenovote
do everything you can to make this republic represent the people.
Hey Mark, how the hell did you get so rich. Certainly not on that senator salary. Do tell us your secret.
Seems like @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell hasn't learned from the mess in the House :/
Please keep fighting Republicans mocking a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
The US is now a laughing stock around the world  It's so embarrassing that in a few months we went from the best to the worst -thanks @GOP
Oligarchs rule this way.
Here they going screwing  Americans over and over again. #Repubs 
We MUST pass this bill PRONTO so the American people can see what's in it! 
Please retire before destroying our country!
McConnell is the biggest asshat in the Senate. Can't fix stupid. Can VOTE HIM OUT!
Odd, if it's as horrible as people think, just in time for Senators to go home to the people who elected them & won't be happy to see them!
Fight for us...all of us!!
How are they doing this legally? I'm being sincere in this question.
Then withhold UC as long as it takes. Someone needs to be a leader
If only democrats  put s working health care bill the first time.
Thayer did all of our big legislation gets tweaked after use. @GOP would not allow it.
Hope people don't reelect these scumbags especially @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump
Please do not let them do thisif you do, it's going to be his policy till the end! America will suffer Trump if not stopped! #TheResistance
Sounds like exactly what you did...Senator Schumer...I mean Witch Hunter...I mean Warner
Because the GOP Congress represents their corporate & unknown dark $ PAC donors. Americans are not their primary constituents, just voters
Burn it down. Figuratively of course. This is not a dictatorship - and it won't become one on my watch.
Good point. Fortunately none of this effects personal Congressional healthcare 
Play hardball, Senator.  Help kill this GOP travesty of a process and bill.
Where is your plan to fix Obamacare? Does it hinge on Trump showing us his taxes?
How did mcconnell rise to power
Is there not a way to stop the Senate? Other than constituents contacting their senators, what else can be done?
Rump must have some good dirty on him
Forgot about what you all did. You truly are repulsive.
Kinda feels like we're living in a dictatorship.
Mitch McConnell will die a horrible painful death from karma in jail.
Republicans obviously don't need your help.  Don't plan on recess.  Stay and work.  Your obstructing is hurting the nation.
Fight against it!
It's not how it USED to work and not how it SHOULD work either. Right @JeffFlake and @SenJohnMcCain? #ShowUsTheBill #VoteNoAHCA
My understanding is that if they present with bait and switch on the 20 hr of debate rule Senators are then able to add amendments?  Do it!!
NOW is the time to MARCH ON D.C.  We can't afford to lose our homes to save our kids lives! Visit a nursing home #GOP!  Millionaires can PAY
Thank you for keeping up the fight, Senator @MarkWarner
Don't whine.  Lead.  If they won't debate, NOTHING else happens.  #NoDebateNoVote
They had 8yrs to have a better idea or fix ACA. We deserve better than the partied out college student cramming the night before finals.
As a constituent I hope you do everything you can to slow it down.
Thank you, @MarkWarner!  I'm a breast cancer survivor.  Trump care will be a death knell for me.I want more years with my grandson.
Thank you for fighting this, Senator. As a great country, we can't allow the GOP to strip millions of people of their healthcare.
#NoDebateNoVote
Time for real Americans in Congress to step up and over party lines. Get your heads in the game and Make Americans Secure Again! 
@axios it's time for @SenateMajLdr to step down! He only cares about Party & $ not about Americans lives! Shameful
Harry Reid was right about mcconnell
Yes!!
