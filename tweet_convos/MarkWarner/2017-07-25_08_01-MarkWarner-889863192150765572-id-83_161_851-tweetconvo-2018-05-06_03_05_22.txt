.@MarkWarner @timkaine Gentlemen, you're both a solid NO on this "heath care" bill, correct? https://twitter.com/RBReich/status/889284739248439296 …
Thank you Senator!
Thank you for being so smart and caring about the American people. What the R's are trying to force on us is shameful and disgusting.
Problem is we need @SenateGOP to say no
Thank you @MarkWarner & @timkaine for all you do for Virginians from a very grateful constituent!
There are many of us who haven't reached out to you two because we know you're on the right side of justice.
Term limits do nothing D.C. Both parties are a joke !!!
Thank you!
Mr. Warner I hope you and Mr. Kaine can talk some of your Republican friends in the voting no as well
Thank you from VA!
Thank you for standing with the people & not against!
Thank you @timkaine & @MarkWarner you gentlemen make this Va voter proud every day!!!
I am SO GRATEFUL that you are the senators for Virginia!
Thank you both for standing up for Virginians.
We the silent MAJORITY will vote you out! My family was notified by Aetna our care ends in Dec. Ridiculous premium/deductible! Vote YES!!!!
So helpful senator.....just run your mouth and complain for another two years. Such a hard worker
Thank you!
Couldn't reach @timkaine's office today but I did reach yours.  Thank you for continuing your fight against this awful legislation!
I love my state! (Except for Bob Goodlatte.)
And Dave Bratt
I agree he is my representative and he is awful! We need to get rid of gerrymandered districts to get rid of @DaveBratVA7th !!
It's why Virginia is proud to have both of you.
Quit politicizing our healthcare.  Hopefully you both gave a listen to McCain today. Or will you ever learn?
Thank you both.
@RondaGrizzle thanks for comfirming, cant wait to get you both out of office
Thank you.  Any way you can get a few R colleagues to see their way to being kind to Americans and also voting No?
And your proud of that, arn't you Mark!
No no no! That's all you can say! Unless of course you talk about phony  investigations
Loser!!!!!!!!!
Denomic how some with no worries could care less for the hard working Americans
What is your plan?
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator Warner.
Thank you Senator!
THANK YOU for opposing Republican efforts to take away health insurance from millions of Americans, Senator Warner!
Thank you Senators.
Thank you! I'm a VAnian & only time in my life I almost wish I had a Member to torture to do the right thing. Almost.
Thank you, @timkaine and @MarkWarner!  Signed, a constituent
@RondaGrizzle like2spoiled #superdelegates all they say is fix the problem we created
Where is your Love for America? @StateDept @DNC @RNC SERIOUSLY REGARDLESS of Politics #Indict and Be #Patriotic
I had no doubt. TY Senators!!
Thank you @MarkWarner & @timkaine  this is one of many reasons why I support you both!
Wow,  shock! You mean 2 more party puppets! To bad if you all only had a brain. Virginia will remember as insurance companies leave VA
.@MarkWarner: Two solid #Trumpcare NO votes here, Ronda.  @TimKaine https://twitter.com/rondagrizzle/status/889573315471454215 …" AND THAT'S WHY BOTH WILL BE OUT NEXT ELECTION
Thank you!! #VA07 #RESIST
Thank you both very much!
Thank you Senator Warner!
Oh please. That's like asking if Lenin was a Marxist.
Thank you Senators!!!  Proud Virginian here....
Thank you! Representing Virginia well gentlemen.
Can you talk to @SenCapito about doing right by our neighbors in WV, and working on a bipartisan solution to fixing the ACA after voting no?
Thank you so much from a senior citizen who's terrified of losing her healthcare!
You sound so proud...we Virginians look at you and hide because of embarrassemnt
I'm proud to call you both "my Senators!" Keep fighting to good fight for all Americans!!!
@RondaGrizzle thank you Sir!
Perhaps your GOP pals should put their votes in their pockets until POTUS treats them, Mueller and the AG as other than his personal staff
Thank you Senator Warner & Senator Kaine!
Thank you Senators. Grateful for your leadership.
Sick and tired of dems bleeding programs like medicaid to make you feel better. Disgusting to see dems act like they did not make this mess
Thank you Senators!
Thank you. Please keep fighting.
Thank you, Senators!
So glad to hear it!
Well, what is your plan since my premium has gone up 40% in two years under Obama care?
Thank you Senators!! 

Are you ready to fillibuster?? 

#SaveACA  #ProtectOurCare
You are already on shaky ground with your record helping the American people. You dont help now and Va will vote you out of office
@RondaGrizzle that has been my one comfort during this fiasco. Proud of our Senators. Now if only VA had Med expansion
Thank you. What can we Virginians do at this point? Our senators are sane, but what about the rest? #resist #NoBCRA #saveACA
Same question here
See this thread by @benwikler for some great suggestions on how we can help from VA/other states with 2 D senators
GREAT thing: @indivisiblechi virtual phone bank! Call folks in OH WV NV AZ to ask them to call their sens vs repeal! https://twitter.com/IndivisibleChi/status/888799568258838528 …
Thank you both. Assumed we could count on you. Hope you can bring colleagues from across the aisle to also stand up for US.
Your president wants to destroy government and your party @GOP  what do you plan to do?
#PutinBots #bye
Thank you @MarkWarner please convince other folks
Very grateful for Virginia's Senators representing the best interests of its people.
Very telling, two solid votes who helped to create the current mess are solid "no votes" in trying to fix it.
My care ends in Dec. We the Silent Majority are fed up with your Socialists BS We WILL vote you out @MarkWarner @timkaine Vote YES!
Thank you both for your leadership & service!
So, with 2017 total enrollment in Obamacare of 11.4 million, where do Democrats get off saying 22-32 million will lose coverage? What bunk!
Thank you!
From this constituent, thank you both!
