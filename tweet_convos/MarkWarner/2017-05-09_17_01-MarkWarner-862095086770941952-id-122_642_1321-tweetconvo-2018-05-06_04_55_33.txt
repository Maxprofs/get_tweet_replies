My statement on the dismissal of FBI Director Comey https://www.burr.senate.gov/press/releases/statement-from-senate-intel-chairman-burr-on-the-dismissal-of-fbi-director-comey â€¦ 
Then DO SOMETHING.
Can't agree more. @MarkWarner this is weak sauce. Do something or step aside and let someone take over your seat who will.
Yeah Warner can't bc he's in the minority. It's Burr that needs to call for it.
There is a lot he can do. He can start blocking Senators' bills until action is taken on this, for example
They are already blocking the Treasury Trump pic.
The onus is on Burr
Onus is on all 100 of them
great so you and @senatorburr will be setting up an independent investigator right?

You have so much concern about so many things yet you never do anything - just blather on endlessly.
Please Senator 
@MarkWarner demand an independent investigation. Fight for this country!
@SenatorBurr plllllllz do ur job and subpoena the Treasury Dept for Trump admin financial recs, and get a goddamn Independent Prosecutor.
Preet Bharara, Sally Yates,James Comey all fired while investigating Trump/Russia. Investigate corruption, obstruction, high crimes
Then you and @SenatorBurr should take action. Because I am sick and tired of statements with no action. So do something.
President has the right to fire him and he did. Instead of all these investigations how about focusing on reducing spending.
#progress
You share in your parties corruption as well
BURR IS A CLOSET LIBERAL. WE SEE THAT ALSO.VERY CLEAR!!
Yet the Chairman states a special committee is not necessary. What is your perspective? Asking for a country
Do you share @SenatorBurr's views this morning? No independent investigation, no special prosecutor needed?
Thank you!  But please demand that McConnell serve the American people and not the President. Demand an independent prosecutor!
Concerned about Republican inaction too. #MarchForTruth #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #obstruction #FollowTheMoney
Thank you!  Please demand an independent commission that Trump cannot control.
You are a hypocritical, political hack & opportunist. You don't care about the United States.
Don't talk about it be about it
YOU need to start publicly discussing impeachment.
Pence is very competent at doing great evil, versus the amateur incompetent evil of Trump. Orrin Hatch would be the default replacement VP.
@SenatorBurr PLEASE come together to save our democracy!! No longer about difference in issues. It's preservation of gov't!
Statements are meaningless.  Votes matter.  Good luck working with Burr.
I seem to recall you & @chuckschumer demanding Comey's head late last year. Why, this sudden interest in his contiued leadership at the FBI?
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
Then do something about it already, "Senior Senator". Time to be a leader, put on those big boy pants.
we need an independent investigation
concern? How brave. Do something or we'll elect someone who will.
Concern is not a enough. Chairman Burr must call for an Independent #Trumprussia investigation immediately.
And what will be done about it??? #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #ComeyFiring
Do you support and independent investigative committee?
This is NOT a "We send prayers to the victims..." moment;  let's GO!  Push pals @HouseGOP and @HouseDemocrats to get going and #Impeach45NOW
Please get Trump out before WW3.
I agree. This is 2017's Watergate nka RussiaGate. Keep doing what you're doing - investigate Trump. Get his taxes!!! They will tell the tale
Was comey running your investigation?
Hillary and Susan Rice are likely to be prosecuted this time around.  Especially if there is a Special Prosecutor.  You good with that?
We are counting on you, sir! This is not about party, but country! Watch DOJ...not sure we can trust now.
Do something
It's time to start thinking about #impeachment.
We the people, need every democratic senator and congressman to get to the bottom of Trump, his campaign staff and cabinet Russia ties.#HELP
Then can you guys, like, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!! Be patriots. #Comey @SenatorBurr
AJ recused himself from investig.except when he recs firing #Comey who is investigating? #SpecialProsecuter needed Not counsel #Impeachtrump
We are counting on you to step up and save our democracy
Could we possibly get some words and tone that match the gravity of this crisis? I'm sick of the congenial crap. Our nation is at stake.
#Impeach45 #EnoughIsEnough #TrumpRussia
We, your constituents, need more than a "ditto."
.@MarkWarner @SenatorBurr Now would be a good time to put more than seven part-time staff members on your investigation.
Special prosecutor.
Do not let #45 get away with this.  Keep pressure up!
Is this a "Thoughts and Prayers" kind of concern, or is someone actually going to intercept this inbound asteroid of a coup? /@SenatorBurr
Put s sock in it: get busy
What's wrong with existing counsel?
Concern? This is a coup, sir. Do something!
Do something about it. Appoint a #SpecialProsecutor and Impeach him.
We are losing confidence in the 
#GOP and senate 

#Draintheswamp
@SenatorBurr Thank you.
We need an independent investigation and this is way way way overdue at this point and can no longer be ignored.
Wow! Strong words from Burr.
@SenatorBurr So relieved to see you two working together.  Stay on it !  To both of you: #Countryb4party!
For different reasons, I thought he s-h-b fired for the timing of the HRC ancmnt.  Gross misjudgment that altered democratic process.
To think that they considered the risk of allowing Comey to complete his investigation worse than the blowback they'd get from firing him...
Just do what you think is needed and lets see what happens. Get it over with if possible. Lets work on making the USA stronger.
Then DO something!  We need more than words! @TheGayHumanist @TheDemocrats @RepAdamSchiff @womensmarch @IndivisibleTeam
Pure White House CORRUPTION!! Criminal obstruction! U.S.A. Integrity is being flushed in real time. SHAME!
Then go to the Democrats party
Senator, this chief executive and his cabal of grifters have got to be removed, for the good of our nation.
THIS is the test of our republic - we rise or fall on what you do now
Sure, I see lots of words. Let's see what GOP actions transpire.
Senator, Do something about it.  We are counting on you.
@SenatorBurr Please don't sit there & do NOTHING! This is our country. Trump is unethical & will be the ruined of America. 
@SenatorBurr Nixon fired the man investigating him. Do you want America to fall apart? Pls we need an independent investigation.
Assume a coup. Plan accordingly.
Ok. But "concern" and "loss" are not the words this turn of events calls for. Try "independent counsel."
Please ask James Comey to testify before your committee re whatever he can now tell us (as private cit) about FBI investigations?
As former member of IC, the evidence is already there, you just need political will to complete.
@SenatorBurr Please please request an independent investigation.  This isn't normal!
At what point is all this considered obstruction of justice?! @realDonaldTrump is no king and his admin are NOT above the law!
Do something about it! W need a special prosecutor.
Hey Mark, shall I send you a few of these coins to give out to your colleagues against an #IndependentInvestigation?
I don't believe you; you are going to cover his ass as our Republic is lost to fascism;
If there were EVER a time when we needed an honest bi-partisan effort to restore FaIth in our democracy,it's now. #Independentinvestigation
How does an Independent Prosecutor do its job with a Trump friendly AG and FBI?  The world watches.
SO  THEN  DO  SOMETHING 
@SenatorBurr Then why don't you both cosponsor a bipartisan bill to establish a special prosecutor.
This is Watergate. Please stay vigilant.
Independent investigation has to happen.  #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
.@SenatorBurr what are you going to do about it?  What will historians say of you?  Do you continue to fiddle or do you fight?
could you please try to be a little less inspiring? thanks
So do I. Do not sit still Mark. Get to it
"Troubled?" How about this is f@#$cked!
Senator, I'm your constituent in VA. Time for a Special Prosecutor! And time to demand Trump's tax returns are released. Take action.
OK. But beyond the obvious, what are you guys gonna do about it?
And? A Special Independent Prosecutor is needed now more than ever.
Independent investigation NOW.  I understand your concerns about asking for one, but the time has come.
SO *DO* SOMETHING
He isn't actually concerned- he just knows he has to say something. We're counting on you to DO something.
This is beyond Nixonian. #TrumpRussiaCollusion cover-up. Independent prosecutor now. Or are we going to live in a dictatorship?
@SenatorBurr gentlemen y ought narrow yr concerns to yr job description work 4 constituents on jobs health services-not #witchhunting @POTUS
Part of his job is the Russia-Trump investigation, so I think he's on top of it, thanks.
Quit tweeting! Do something!!!
Thank you.
thank you, sir. we're all worried about this, and about a Constitutional crisis.
It is time for a special investigation.
If Dems can't get us out of this they SHOULD NOT expect a free pass in 2018. If we even still have elections then. Please do something.
All right then you two, keep the bromance going and the investigation too
But we don't trust him. You'll need to break away from the Russian pack, Mark.
I Disagree! Comey refused to investigate Ossoff campaign fundraising , H emails, Menendez for corruption! What is going on? #Tatiana
Please demand a Special Counsel.  We the People need ALL our Senators and Representatives to work and speak for us.  PLEASE!
As you said, this is the most important job of your lifetime and your leadership is needed now more than ever
Senator Warren the investigation has to go independent now
#Comey refused to investigate #Ossoff for illegally fundraising $8.3 M in 2 months! #ga06 #Tatiana
right. the anti-corruption filmmaker. you sound desperate.
