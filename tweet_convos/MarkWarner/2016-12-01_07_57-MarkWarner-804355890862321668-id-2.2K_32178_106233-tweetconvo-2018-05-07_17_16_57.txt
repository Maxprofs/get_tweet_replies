How bout a fight against #cancer ? They don't want a cure these doctors make to much money giving people the run around!
(on @POTUS') Hi,"Jason". If-i-May: http://WhiteHouse.Gov/cancermoonshot  (@VP Biden's #CancerMoonshot -, @POTUS44-After-#SOTU  1/2)
I love our president and our Vice President. I'm not so much saying our president it doing enough...
that's an ill informed assumption. Talk to a doctor who loses patients on the regular.
yea maybe that's the dr that's giving people the runaround
no runaround happening when metastasis can occur before resection and effects don't happen for yrs
effects don't happen for years really? Wow the effects I know on a few I know just begun...
yes it can be years. Perks of my college education and being pre-med help me grasp these concepts
I know we hear ab cures for cancer but! We don't hear it a lot from our president like we ab a cure for #AIDS .
theres a month dedicated to cancer look it up!!!
I know it is. I'm just saying I just think I cure is out there but doctors would lose money if it came out
I agree but Obama has nothing to do with it so stop bringing him into it
ok I will boohooo you need a coloring book? Maybe some therapy like these HILLARY supporters
I didn't bring Hillary into this that's all Trump supporters know how to do is criticize such as yourself
:)
President Obama. PLEASE address Standing Rock. PLEASE. You can stop this. Right? My 9 year old daughter is watching and worried.
shame on you for not protecting an innocent child.  That's abuse and you are causing it!
Obamas not causing anything shut up
I am so over you racist animals that think you are entitled to an opinion
i am not racist thank you and i am entitled to an opinion i am the daughter of an immigrant
Alvarez -- let me guess, German?
hell naw quit making assumptions jerk I'm hispanic you're the rascist one  shut the hell up
no need to claim you're Hispanic, your demeanor shows you are Puerto Rican. Good evening.
This is not factual.
This when the house belonged to all the people, all of them.
Pls, give us a heads-up before control of this acct changes so that I can #unfollow. 

#NotMyPresident #AuditTheVote #Resist
I love you daddy
Bye comunist
How about a yellow ribbon Muslim Pussy Boy?
Thank You ! We love you and will miss you ! 
how about solving the epidemic of cop killing.  Oops that would take leadership.  Maybe Trump can solve.  You couldn't.
yo how about that Dakota Access Pipeline and I right you should say literally anything about it or something
Worst than trump 
worst? Bots can't grammar.
Today we also honor the fight for Native American rights. #NoDAPL Where are you?
(on @POTUS')  MayB there?: http://whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/31/presidential-proclamation-national-native-american-heritage-month-2016 … ? OrEither There http://whitehouse.gov/nativeamericans  ? mj/Good-Thursday too!
He's not at or with Standing Rock. Miss the point much?
That's because Standing Rock is B.S.

@HRC Africa is close to an HIV vaccine, there is hope for their children and the world.
a Free, Democratic Prosperous Cuba for all, Congress lift the embargo for my people to prosper JLH
That's a worthy cause
Except for the veterans getting care at WI VA hospitals
We love the job you've done Obama!
Love You Mr. President #WorldAidsDay Follow us on #Soundcloud
but you won't do anything about standing rock? It's disappointing.  Where would America be without the Native Americans? #NoDAPL
exactly where it is now! Less Indians.
not sure what Indians have to do with it but the native Americans save the lives of the first settlers.
you mean Indians! They aren't native. Maybe you slaughtered them,  I didn't.
Indians are from India, Native Americans were the first to settle the Americas. The US government killed many.
BTW,  it wasn't the government,  it was Cowboys!  They are now extinct so the Indian Nations should honor them.
You need to research, my friend. Cowboys are a glorified media concept. The government made treaties not cowboys.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy 
@tksinclair with trump now, maybe HIV will spread again
There will most definitely be more deaths. I have two friends w/HIV who depend on ObamaCare to keep them alive.
It's amazing to even dream of an AIDS-free nation, let alone having it within reach. May your legacy lives on forever. Great job!
translation: we give lip service to helping people while killing people w/ the drug war #EndTheDrugWar #LegalizeIt #DoTheRightThing
gonna miss you, dude.

will we see this kind of post after the transfer, will WH display values as inclusive or graceful in the next administration?

Why haven't we hung a Blue Ribbon for police or a Yellow Ribbon for our Military?
if that is your cause, go for it. His cause and all of the AA who are taking a knee is BLM.
I am not the President - his favoritism and partisanship is evident. No President should be that Partisan.

Trump's not even in the same league!

@WhiteHouse Sir you are a beacon of light in a soon to be dark world. Keep on your work
Is it really?
One of the things God will hold you accountable for is using his Stolen Rainbow to celebrate legalizing degenerate sin

eaZy e is smiling down at you sir.
How about honoring your words to the Native Americans.

#USHistory: Impeding #BigOil PROFITS can be hazardous to one's HEALTH. #JFK & #CountlessOthers They'll kill ya.
wouldn't light up the White House in blue to support our police officers though. Coward.
targeting police, as a group, is discriminatory and could be considered a hate crime. Be more uneducated. You can't.
endorsed what? You don't think he has say in what is hung in the WH?
Can you read? It's that he didn't show support, not that he declared an attack.
What's up with Malik's brother?
