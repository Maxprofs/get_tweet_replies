We just need a couple of strong influential Republicans to stand up for America & to say enough. It will be a flood after that. 
@GOP
#Hillarytoprison
It's called priorities ... please move on w your small brain
Not you--- sorry should have taken everyone off this.  Some guy after my last comment.  I know you're cool 
Lately the 6 follower bots seem to be following me around.
#SallyYatesforSpecialProsecutor
NO SPECIAL PROSECUTORS TO CONTINUE THIS CHARADE INTO INFINITY!!!!! GET TO WORK ON REAL ISSUES!
You damn straight, sir!!Keep up the fight!  We sane patriotic Americans have your back!  THIS IS ABOUT COUNTRY!!  #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
You wouldn't know how to 'look' nonpartisan if your life depended on it...Dems have no other goal than to weaken America and fight Trump.
USA wake up!
But what about border security, eliminating threat of terror attacks, and lowering taxes?
Keep an eye out for Russian money funding other GOP and third party campaigns. That is the playbook, not just $laundering through Trump.
The administration is corrupt from top to bottom!
Perhaps u should be investigated  because of your ties to Russia.
Thank you sir
For what ? Where is your evidence jackass !
we want a special prosecutor to see why you took money from Russia in 2012.And why Podesta took money from Russia and not disclosing it
Clearly this is called for.
DROP THE RUSSIAN LIE! Or Produce the proof! We're tired of whiny Irrational lying Democrats like you crying conspiracy with NO PROOF!
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you. So what steps will you take to ensure we have a special prosecutor? What needs to be done to get the independent investigation?
"The achievements of an organization are the results of the combined effort of each individual." Vince Lombardi
I don't think you pass the smell test. No political hack, take your independent and stick it. I'm tired of this BS.
Mark, glad your eyes are finally opened but you should have stuck with your party regarding DT's Scotus pick! The President is insane!
THANKS WARNER 4 HAVING BALLS 2 STAND AGAINST FAKE POTUS! BRAVO.OTHERS WIL FOLLOW! USA SICK OF TRUMPS COVER UPS!IMPEACH
"nonpartisan" means do whatever Democrats want.
Thank you for your leadership on Russian election hacking - it is an honor to be your constituent!!
Trump shows clear signs of Altzheimers dementia erratic temper braggert ego repetitive speech patterns trances. Mentally unstable.
Yes, but take this seriously. This is not a 'centrist campaign for President' moment. If it looks like a show, it will not turn out well.
For what ?LMAO FBI directors work for the President! Since when are you president? Lmao
Thank you! 
Senator Warner. This needs to be the focus of every session right now
I"m going to congress soon to testify. President Obama order investigation why some people used my identity to meet him in the WhiteHouse.
Thank you Sir!
It shows which @gop is involved w/russia too! Know @SenateMajLdr , @SpeakerRyan @SenRandPauI @marcorubio @SenatorBurr @ChuckGrassley
Criminals predictably return to the scene of the crime. @realDonaldTrump's firing of Comey was exactly that.
The American people do not want to waste the 4 or 5 years a special prosecutor would take for this witch hunt 9 mos and nothing to show 4 it
The only issues you agree on are those that in alignment with democratic narrative.  You are destroying our nation!
The @GOP wouldn't agree. I wonder why not?
Except the GOP isn't.
When is @SenatorBurr also going to insist on a special prosecutor?  At this point, it seems like the right thing to do.
Never time for government shut down
Thank you.
@TeamMcCain @SenatorBurr @BenSasse @WSJPolitics @business @BBCBusiness @guardian @WSJPolitics @washingtonpost @seattletimes @chicagotribune
Then why are you and all the Democrats making partisan?
Seriously, now.
Preet Bharara for Special Prosecutor.
Need special prosecutor for Hillary, the IRS, and unmasking of Flynn.
Thank you! We need a special prosecutor NOW!!!
Thank you for standing up for Americans and our democracy. Please continue to push for nonpartisan work to save our country. We need you.
Get it done, Sir.
Dem Senators & Reps need to peel off any GOP Members (if there are any) who are not colluding.Make a majority-speed this up! #CrossTheAisle
Well then practice what you preach punk.
Then stop being partisan
It's the only way to assure things are taken care of fairly.
#IndependentInvestigation  NOW - Thank you for being my Senator!
Mark, "if" your committee is doing it's job,.. WHY A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR??? Hmmmm?? that raises a lot of questions in my mind. sick politics!
Impeachment is only answer at this point. POTUS is rogue, dangerous, obstructing justice, etc.No American media allowed w/ Russian visit?!
True Patriots will do what it takes to protect our democracy
Thank you!!!!!
Thank you for doing your job!!!
Never stop pushing. The nation is counting on you.
We're going to take to the streets SOON. They need to appoint a special prosecutor or we'll force DT out like S. Korea. Storms coming
this is EXTREMELY important!!!
#IndependentInvestigationNow 
Sessions #perjury
McConnell #RussianCollusion 
All trump administratn #RussianCollusion #obstructionofjustice
Too bad most of your peers across the aisle are sheep.
I agree!Don't let up,the American people need to know we can trust our politicians to do the right thing. Our politics look like a bad joke.
Yes.... it has to happen.
Senator Warner, this constituent agrees totally. A special prosecutor or independent committee investigation is needed now. Thank you!
Seriously. If they can't do this and impeach Trump, every one of their asses need to go by vote or some other method.
Call this number folks, and then enter yr zip code: (844) 514-7166. You'll be connected to yr Senator. Demand independent prosecutor.
Thank you for putting country first.
When is the special prosecutor getting appointed
how does that happen? We have obstructionist experts: #Ryan and #McConnell in charge (you have a Pres who controls ALL separations of power
Republican leadership will do everything they can to stonewall and make sure that never happens. Right @SenateMajLdr?
Where is Wikiileaks when we need them?
Call for an #IndependentInvestigation or you're part of the cover-up
McConnell complicit in cover-up of Russian espionage.
#IndependentInvestigation
#OccupyTheWhiteHouse
Please don't abandon this investigation; trump colluding w/russians right in front of America for all to see; subpoena potus; he won't pass!
I wish the @GOP would step up, but it won't happen. Your going to have to use the most outside the box idea you can think of. Time ran out!
Can you OUT the Republicans who are working with Trump & Russia? We are witnessing the hostile take over of our government before our eyes.
THANK-YOU
Sorting hat in Congress
Choose a line and get in it:
Innocent--Complicit--Guilty.

Pls Cl Mitch McConnell & DEMAND SPEC PROSEC: (202) 224-2541, (859) 224-8286, (606) 864-2026, (270) 781-1673, (270) 442-4554. He works 4 US!
He doesn't work for us-his head's in same Russian noose trump's is.He dismissed call for Special Investigator this morning! #CrossTheAisle
@20committee @politico Please do EVERYTHING you can.
Finally~ thank you for the sentiment.  Now, I hope you will put the idea into action.  Looking forward to some teamwork!
The administration is scared - its time for real look into Russian-gate by the LAW, not by politicians or their cohorts
This senator is leading the investigation and says there should be a special prosecutor! #GOPcoverup
Wake me up when Burr follows suit....
Sen. Warner, which federal penitentiary do you think will house Donald Trump's Presidential Library?
how are we living in a democracy when it seems our hands are so tied?
Thank you Senator Warner! Your leadership is so appreciated - #WeThePeople are so grateful #TrumpRussia
@amjoyshow @allinwithchris @FreedomMarch17 WE, the people, need a national STRIKE-show Congress & the WH we want action on #russiagate
So what are you going to do about it Senator? #resist
Yes Sir. Thank you for being an American leader. This is not normal
Louder, we can't hear you!  Stronger , louder & more often, there's a Rat in the WH. Wasting all of our time.
Thank you!
Investigate all theway back 2 when Obama told the Russians thathe would have more flexibility after the '12 election.What did he mean or do?
GOP message: fuck America
http://www.resist.io  -- message all your reps and demand #SpecialProsecutor
Ask Rosenstein: Did u write Comey firing letter?  Ask Comey: Did u tell Trump "3 times" he's not under investigation. If NO, subpoena POTUS
It's  an obvious pattern of cover up ..Nunes debacle, firing those investigating him Preet,Yates &Comey
as a #superdelegate you told us Comey was bad #mixedmessages
Was Jeff Sessions unmasked by Clapper?
There is only one reason to oppose an independent investigation. We are witnessing it.
Exactly keep going . American people need to know
Yes, for sure
Iits only Wednesday. FFS and Kissinger in the Oval Office.
Its more than mildly nauseating for me. Open house for the russians!!!
I'm screaming, that's on a daily I grew up in  DC Nixon was a terrifying ordeal . That's all we talked about in poli. Sci. This is worse
Im afraid it is worse!!
Absolutely! Be a patriot!
Great!!!!
Please help now, Senator! Independent investigation!
yeah like you aren't partisan. That's a lie
Thank you. I met you some years ago in Wythe County, VA. Always had my respect. Now a resident of FL & sorely miss your representation.
Why is this even a question when the stakes are so high? Personal gain over the future of our democracy
Counting on you, Senator.
That Republican Party no longer exists.  If we haven't learned that after the last 8 1/2 years, what will it take?  Time to change methods
I stand with you Senator Warner
Country over party.
Thank you, Congressman, for your leadership on this. #patriot
Only traitors will refuse to insist on a special independent prosecutor to find the truth about the collusion with Russia.
Why don't you start the movement to be NONPARTISAN!!  I don't think you know what the word means..
@aliasvaughn @politico Absolutely true! Thank you Senator Warner!
Could you urge your GOP peers to put #CountryOverParty regardless of possible kompromat on them? This is out of control.
Pls require Comey to testify tomorrow,  or as soon as possible! Rosenstein is partisan, should be removed. #investigateRussia must continue
Agreed sir
YesKeep fighting for that.  We hear Mitch McConell is saying he won't don't it! 
Sen , NONE of this passes the smell test! Please push for an independent prosecutor- the GOP are not going to buck Trump.
Please, sir, there are Republicans who may be amenable to action. Find them and DO SOMETHING!
If you see @PatRoberts @JerryMoran @KevinYoder & @RoyBlunt from Kansas, please talk some sense into them. They seem to have vanished. Thanks
Glad to see you still believe in wishful thinking.
Forget nonpartisan. How about being a Patriot!
Ok then congress. Get serious and end this corruption and treason. Save our country!! Quit talking and tweeting and DO SOMETHING to end it!
#SpecialProsecutor
Thank you for standing with the American people @MarkWarner #trumprussia #USA
@AndreaChalupa @politico ONE chance. Don't blow it.
Unfortunately, most Republicans do not agree with this analysis. McConnell is ready to put his back to the wall re a special prosecutor.
Stop wasting time on Russian Hoax! No evidence! Confirm @POTUS appointments! Repeal Obamacare! #Obstructionist Serve America&VA! @FoxNews
Thank you for your leadership.
Democrats must shut down the Senate until GOP appoints #SpecialProsecutorNow .
All living presidents need to issue joint statement: country over party; democracy over authoritarianism
Let's make it happen!
nepotism, oligarchy, suppression of free press?! This is not supposed to happen here. I'm enraged & terrified. Keep fighting
The trust of the American citizens has been eroded w/ the GOP.  There is no turning back. @McConnellPress @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain
Keep rolling @markwarner! We support you!
The GOP needs for it's president to be legit!
To be sure he is legit we have no choice but to answer these questions correctly
Thank you so much!!
Today Democrats show their manhood or pussyhood
Senator, you're absolutely right. What can the people do to support your efforts?
Obvious. Choices -Comey or Bhara .
Can I recommend the Hon. Sally Yates as a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump - Russia connections.
THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU for doing the right thing. Country before party.
Sorry Senator, your colleagues across the aisle have imbibed too much kool-ade.
I am trying to get some exposure for the following #: #CrossTheAisle
Talk to your BFF Burr. He seems to be obstructing. Oh and btw, your committee is a Potemkin one. You have no resources?
Dream on Warner.
Speak up and fight4 truth. Country over party. All patriots unite! Ps Warner 2020
Tell that to @SenatorBurr
Nonpartisan might as well be removed from the dictionary at this ooint
I knew from d beginning of need of special counselor w proven non-partisan record 4 #TrumpRussiaInvestigation @SenateDems @SenSchumer
@GOP Comrades. Do the job you were elected to do. Represent the people, not Comrade 45.
How hopeful are you that is even possible?
Why any GOP who live their country let it be taken over by Russia??  Those who did willgo down with Trump Shipwreck
This is a hair on fire moment.
Let's go. Waiting on you guys :) Please
Get it done did you see the WH just opened the door to the Kremlin and Russian media. Not one official has stopped this
Burr said there wasn't need for any.
Yes. As Rep. @RepSwalwell said - put on the same uniform. Time to go to work.
Go for it! #GrifterInChief #LiarInChief #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
Thank you senator!
Thank you Senator Warner- saved me a phone call!  #VaProud #Doinghisjob
Now is the time to get extremely angry and go after trump and his gang of imbeciles
Trump is for Trump. His psychopathology threatens the US. He doesn't care about our nation. Please investigate Trump/Russia.
Just called your Tyson's Office this AM. How do we breach GOP's Obstruction? #SpecialProsecutor #TrumpRussia #ComeyFiring
Please join your constituents at June 3rd's #MarchForTruth
You need to garner majority support on Committee despite Burr & move for Comey, Yates, Clapper closed testimony immediately!
Americans demand independent investigation into Trump Russian ties If Trump had nothing to hide he would encourage investigation
as long @timkaine  and @SenSchumer are held accountable
Great! Now, go kick McConnell in the mouth. It'll damage his turtle image, but we didn't like it anyway.
We didn't learn from Brexit. Can American democracy follow the examples of France and South Korea?
All these politicians stating the obvious but nobody DOING anything.
