Dems were willing to give on copper plans and waiver authority for bipartisan ACA fixes, Schumer spox says. 
Thats because Reps dont want a deal. It was never about policy for them
Sad but true
Actually, wouldn't these compromises backfire on Democrats if their base knows what they were willing to give up?
They would, but I'm sure they're thinking it would be a little better than straight repeal. Unfortunately, GOP holds the power.
And not just in Congress but in statehouses where they can knock voters unlikely to vote for them off.
Shocker
That should be illegal. How can they refuse to negotiate?

We The People calls for bipartisan fix on healthcare! NOT REPEAL AND REPLACE! NO!
Americans need to remember this in 2018. When you lose healthcare for your family due to GOP, will you vote for them again?
I don't see how. If it's bipartisan they can always go back to it and get 60 votes. What am I missing?
From what I'm seeing, this would have enraged the left. Allowing states to waiver on EHBs?
depends. Dems dont want to lose mental health, addiction & other coverages, but its *crazy* how many counties have ONE insurer on exchange.
They ran home becaue Koch brothers offered GOP 400 million for repeal
Exactly. Mitch is a Koch tool.
as they should have, schumer & his retarded marxist cohorts will do everything  in their power to keep this abomination from being rescinded
You must be a billionaire that's excited about their tax cut.
Nope, just an average American who knows the ACA is unconstitutional and failing miserably, it must go.
I'd say below average based on that comment there.
I did very well under the system before 0dumbocare and so did most hardworking people, the rest can go fuck themselves and get a job.
Like those stupid vets and the elderly right? Screw them! Are you this stupid about everything? I mean, I thought there were no jobs?
Wasn't that your reason for voting for the idiot you voted for? Now there are plenty?
How are you so intellectually lazy? That willful or just an accident?
If there is any good to come out of this mess ,it is that Graham, despite his grandstanding,is just another R who puts party before country.
Of course they did. They never wanted to work with Dems. Their opposition to Obama was as much about that as about race.
They did many of the same things to both Carter and Clinton. The book "The Hunting of the President" should be reissued.
Naturally, "bipartisan ship fails" becuae Republicans tank it...time and time again...then they blame Dems...and public falls for it
This is now all about ideology and not about what's best for the country. #GrahamCassidy
No use to compromise with GOP they don't believe in it or anything bi partisan bc their minions won't buy it
This is why you don’t try to work with Republicans. You’re screwed every time.

Whatever has happened to legislation for #AllthePeople vs the #wealthyGOP only?
GOP legislating for the wealthy since Reagan's trickle down. Right wing media taught voters to scream 'job creators!' when it's questioned.
#GOPSenate doesn't want to bipartisan approach to govt. The sick, physically disabled & aged are a drain on govt. #GrahamCassidy is genocide
Reminiscent of death panels, only there's no panel, you just get no care as a matter of policy. Some majority we elected.
No surprise- it's about pleasing ins companies and killing poor and sick
Money & that Graham, who ridiculed previous, will get his name on this one.
If you think GOP cares about ppl over big money and power you are behind the times. The GOP has no soul and doesn't give a  who knows it
And Democrats are obstructionists
We must call Congress and protest: #boycottkoch products
 I don't know how much more outrage I can take before my head explodes.
Right?
Republicans are proving that everything they are doing is about their hatred for a black man. Pure hatred is on exibit.
@GOP isn’t interested in actually governing .
Koch brothers want a full repeal to the tune of 400 million. Let's be real now.
WTF @GOP @SenMajLdr ?? Why are you like this?  Not enough love as a child?
This bill will screw the people of his state hard.  ACA is working quite well in Kentucky.
It won't pass.
How can you be so sure? They seem incredibly determined ... to make way for the tax cut. 
Being optimistic that there are a few consciences in the group of thieves and they can't be paid off by the Koch brothers or anyone else.
You are more optimistic than I since I have been watching Republicans for almost 7 decades and I have little good to report. 
I'm hopeful that it will be stalled till provisions are firmed up. Feinstein said today the scores won't be ready by 9/30 so hard to vote on
They want to vote on the watered down one page score just to beat the deadline.
They don't want to wait on the score b/c they know it will be bad.
It is because they believe Graham-Cassidy will strip ACA permanently away and not allow Dems to change later.
This latest version is the electoral college of healthcare. Weighting the value of red-state citizens at more value than blue. #Shameful
of course they did... Rs don't care about the people, only their pockets
.@SenJohnMcCain Vote against #GrahamCassidy-90sec/Senator 2 debate killing Medicaid through "per capita caps" isn't Bipartisan! @SenSchumer

Not surprised McConnell/GOP prefer trash bill #GrahamCassidy & trash tactics to real solutions.
@StevenTDennis
Looks like Dems had a real offer. Rs took gavel and went home. https://twitter.com/alexruoff/status/910286417422626817 …
Shame on you @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan.  So much for putting Policy above politics.  History will not be kind to you!
These people are just disgusting...
The @GOP don't give a shit about any of you. They want the poor/old/sick to die and the rest of you to work yourselves to death for corps
That can't be right. I was told a fairy equally assigns blame for governance breakdowns
See @SenJohnMcCain ? Bipartisan process was making progress until McConnell/Ryan shut it down so they cld ram thru worst repeal version yet.
The Koch Brothers offered the GOP $400M for repeal of ACA...and tax reform.    Greedy Rs.....morally bankrupt in every way.
@TopherSpiro @Alexruoff Always!
@Alexruoff that's a bad offer
True colors revealed. GOP has no interest in the American citizens having healthcare. America first, my a$$.
They will vote without CBO
Copper plans?
Catastrophic plans for people over age 30.
Disgusting! Bring democracy back!
Copper plans sounds interesting. Costs a penny, worth a penny. Republican voters would love it.
The mainstream media hates the Democrats, this means nothing to them, will continue to report Republican lies on Healthcare
Repubs want that Koch group money.  Doing the right thing ?  Not so much.
Psst, @SenJohnMcCain

Mitch McConnell doesn't think you're a man of your word.

Is he right?
The 12 year olds retorted, "No! Then it wouldn't be our *win*!"
Republicans never planned on working with Dems. They would rather let Americans suffer then give in to Dems. Disgraceful
Share this broadly
McConnell killed the effort.
How else can they get their tax cut for the 1%?  Not with bipartisanship. I don't know how they sleep at night. 
Remember all of this in 2018, 2020!
Business as usual
They don't like to play nice in the sand box #SMH #StopTheGOP #ProtectOurCare


GOP wants that  $$$ so badly.
Of course they did
The @GOP has become the party of evil and treason. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia
"has become"

It's been like this for quite some time.
Copper plans? Is that better or worse than the bronze that I have? Laugh, cry, I don't know what to do! #HealthcareIsAHumanRight
Just don't let any GOP come round complaining that Dems won't work with them.
oppose #GrahamCassidy quick tweet here http://www.factpower.org/healthcare-tweetstorm.html … then email/call using this http://www.factpower.org/calltoactionhealthcare.html …
Truthfully I'm a little alarmed at how much they were willing to give the GOP.
This is all just a game to them. All they care about is a win. And people will die. Shameful behavior.
All they care about it getting their tax cut. 
Koch's told the R's to go home or no more $$$$$$
pretty sick stuff
Funny thing is if GOP Senators stood up for the people of their state they wouldn't need Koch money, the people would happily vote for them.
Do they have the votes?
Fu%*ing McConnell 
this just shows how biased you are. I
