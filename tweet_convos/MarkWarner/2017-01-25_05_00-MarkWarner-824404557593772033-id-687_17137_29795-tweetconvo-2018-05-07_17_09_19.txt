@JessieJessup @USMC If they did Background checks FBI and CIA and monitored who came in ALL races We would not have any prob
Did you know? They already do *extensive* background checks. Would you like to read more?
No I don't! I don't need to. Bunch if cry babies. Talk about social injustices to all people here.
You're demanding something that *already* exists. Take responsibility for your mistake.
What the heck U talking about?
You said background checks and monitoring should be done on refugees. They already are. Very extensively.
Immigrants All immigrants Ignorant. Its separate from refugees.
That is already done as well? Did you not do any research?
Letting foreigners in our military is a mistake #NoLoyaltyToUS
letting ignorant ppl like u 2 tweet is dangerous, you ancestors were immigrants, DONT forget that
Yes So true.And all of you think you belong here? Hahahaha

Where is all of your Civility in this Country people? Jumping to conclusions you don't know the facts to. Shame.



.@DeptofDefense @USMC For posterity, in case this tweet gets deleted.
@yung_alden @DeptofDefense @USMC Yes Things are getting very hot. People debating on this. Getting Facts wrong. Over reacting
@bedirthan @USMC This article reflects the America that we used to be and should strive to continue to be.
and the situation will be illegal by the end of today.
Trump made ignorant statements in his campaign. He has demonstrated an ability to listen to those smarter than he with policies
the anti-refugee exec order being signed today would forbid Muslim refugees from 7 nations
forbid or raise qualifying requirements?
the leaks are forbid, and that non-Muslims wouldn't be effected. There's no way it lasts through court.
That would be unfortunate, but not as bad as giving $221,000,000 to the Palestinians
we all bleed red. We all love America. I hope you and your family have found peace in the US. Semper Fidelis, brother.
This may be the last DoD Tweet that Trump permits. 
: Trump should just ban ALL Muslims to avoid accusations of preferment.
Thank you Ali J. to support #Marine. Yes United States our country we all love USA.
@southerntalker @USMC THANK YOU DOD FOR DOING WHAT IS RIGHT !!!
Facebook should respect free speech and stop blocking out political voices that have a opinion of being ethical
Outstanding! @DrZuhdiJasser
Vive la resistance
@meisterbuerger @USMC why immigrants are the most American thing about America. 'Merica.
thank you Cpl Mohammed for your courage and service!!
U r hero
when are you deporting him? remember the fate of illegals that fought in the US military?
How does a refugee enter our military? Connections?  IOU's? College paid for? Stranger Danger Senator
.@DeptofDefense @greenleafjenjen @USMC Sir, thank you for your service Capt. Mohammed and defending me and mine
Thank you Capt. Mohammed. Thank you Louise.
@barbarastarrcnn @USMC well if they're here illegally then what can you do?
@US5thFleet @USMC I agree with the coral retaliation on me should not be taken out on everyone of color.. iron Mountain 2127
they'll deport him after they used him up like the other illegals fighting for the US
Bring this hero home NOW!
Thank you. The people on the ground are so important to our world. Their sacrifice, and the families--thank you.
Stay strong, social media staff. We're with you.
.@DeptofDefense We also have former refugees now serving in the #nationalguard !
Thank you Scott for sharing.
This is the greatest way 2 push back against islamaphobia & Muslim racism. Showcase Muslims fighting against Terrorists
bro, Muslim is NOT A RACE
Muslims not race, its a religion & as Americans we arent suppose 2 discriminate solely based on religion
Hoooah
your Tweet was quoted by @washingtonpost
Cpl Mohammed WE all thank you for ur service to keep us safe!
god bless him & his family  a true hero
Nicely said, DoD. And thank you for your service, Cpl. Mohammed. All best to you and your family.
Uh, he can come to MY doorstep :)
@bitchyologist @USMC little Donald you have a lot of Marines who are Muslims get used to it
glad he is on our side. But our country made him a refugee in 2003. Try not to make people refugees in the first place.
most republicans would see him as a terrorist
Thank you for your service.
Thank you, stay safe.

I anticipate that Cpl Mohammed will realize his dreams of Special Op's. Ur a courageous young man. Thank You!!
Whether DJT is a racist or supremacist either equally untenable for @POTUS. He's not a democratic thinker @CNN @MSNBC
Lock him up! Amiright, @realDonaldTrump ?!?!?!
NO BRAINER. QUICK PATH TO CTIZENSHIP!
@votevets I can only apologize for the ignorant, ill informed person that was put in the White House. A person high on power
God Help America! @DeptofDefense itself is trying to troll its President @realDonaldTrump ! WTF! @USMC
From refugee to #Marine. @USMC Cpl Ali J. Mohammed takes the fight to the doorstep of those who cast his family out.

Saluting Cpl. Ali J. Mohammed. Brother in arms.
DeptOfDef so glad 2 c u r not gagOrdered ButIfUwereHope Uwould ignore+takeyour1stAmendRight
He and his family should be granted citizenship. Anyone who serves and not a citizen, should get auto citizenship!!!
please stand up for DAPA, DACA and all of our immigrant friends, families and neighbors.
So...now all he has to do is sit and wait to get cast BACK OUT thanks to your new "#POTUS". #ironic #sad
Waiting too see how long until #FuhrerTrump orders this taken down and we get an alt DOD twitter page.
#Impeach
Thank you for your service, Marine!!!
Please stop trying to undermine the President.
Respect, respect, and nothing less than respect for both the Marine and the posters.
Any immigrant willing to enlist & serve in the @USMC has earned my respect and is an American. Period. #SemperFi @DeptofDefense
so glad we lived in a country that protected and valued refugees
thank you DOD for posting & thank you Cpl. Mohammed for your service
@yesman8899 @USMC this is another reason to stop immagration of dissidents. Either assimilate or a little corporal  elsewhere
Thank you for your service, Sir!
Thank you Cpt. and thanks to Dept of Defense for standing up!
thank you for highlighting Cpl Mohammed's service to our country.
Thank you!
#ResistTrump
Thanks for serving!!!
@OmniDestiny and there is nothing wrong with this, anyone who thinks there is, is truly a sad soul.
Thank you Cpl Mohammed for your service to this country and fighting against oppression in your home country. #proud

Semper Fi Marine and thank you.
POST THE SH*T OUT OF THESE MEMES!
LET 'EM KNOW!
RT @DeptofDefense: From refugee to #Marine. @USMC Cpl Ali J. Mohammed takes the fight to the doorstep of those who cast his family out
keep up the good work 
So now the US Military is telling Trump off.  
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump wouldn't have even let him into the #USA
CASE BY CASE BASIS
Semper Fi, Devil Dog.  That still means something to most of us.  This too shall pass.
Thank you for protecting the ppl of the U.S and everyone else here that do not deserve ur protection.
Thank you for your service Corporal Mohammed :-)
Awesome. Go get 'em, Corporal! We're behind you!
@thatsean @USMC I saw the photo and initially thought, "What Johnny Manziel done now???" Good read, though...
He is HOT!
Cpl Ali J.
Thank you for your service.
I wish you nothing but success.
True American deserving respect
and thanks.
"his own country": Joined  USMC & proudly serves in your military- makes him about as American as can be.
thank you for posting! #resist
While I "get it" abt him joining the fight,he clearly doesn't consider USA his homeland.It makes me nervous.
A wonderful signal against discrimination and terrorism.
thank you sir for defending all of America freedom
will he still be allowed to enter the US?
.@DeptofDefense @USMC Please relay my gratitude to Cpl. Ali J. Mohammed. I hope he stays safe and healthy.
thank you for your service to the country. True patriot!
Will the US military protect it's own when Trump tries to kick us out? a proud daughter of a marine demands to know.
Load of crap @DeptofDefense! Ur deceived. If Cpl Ali is #muslim thn his primary duty is 2his wretched cult of #islam which is anti US @USMC
This is so infuriating..
Bravo and thank you for your selfless service.
I do not trust Muslims period. The fact is Islam is 90% of the worlds terrorism against the US. This is a fact of life.
Thank you for your service Cpl Ali J Mohammed @realDonaldTrump @POTUS bigotry begets more bigotry 
I love stories like this.. Thank you for your service Cpl Ali J. Mohammed, you are an amazing honorable man.
@JeffreyGoldberg @USMC I think that our President wants him to be deported
You need to get somebody to open a Rogue account, like other departments are doing, Trump will shut down your Twitter.
Thank you!!
fighting ISIS is not liberating Syria. It's a war of three general parties. Now 6. Don't oversimplify.
Thank you for your service.
Cpl. Mohammed,thank you for your service. You are valued by the people you've protected here in your adopted home.
Let's hope @POTUS @realDonaldTrump lets him back in US
That you for your service!  Much respect for to and for your bravery!
Thank you so much for everything that you do!  We appreciate everyone doing their part in the protecting our country!
