Senator Warner, we need an Independent Commission to investigate Russiagate.  Also Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein must be  subpoenaed!
Just found out Sessions is interviewing for new FBI Dir!  He's picking the guy investigating him? Recusal?

@seanhannity @LouDobbs Stop the witch hunt & do your jobs for US Citizens: Jobs, Security, Tax Cuts. ENOUGH w/phony story. Hillary LOST!
Wonder whether Flynn's memory will lapse again....?!
Funny you quote the NYTIMES not a VA source. Have to look for a conspiracy no matter the boarder
we want to know why trump towers was wire taped and why people where spied on.Way was there 35,000 people unmasked.
If Flynn TOOK money, you may need this from me. The @DefenseIntel did not like my GIVING to UUA in 2011. Questioned my loyalty in #EBI.
Betcha Donnie will start to get nervous now

What about YOUR $6million ties to Russia, Senator?
“To stand in silence when they should be protesting makes cowards out of men.” ~Abraham Lincoln #MarchForTruth 6/3/17 #SpecialProsecutor
Well, great, Senator. What are you going to do with it?
We NEED a INDEPENDENT investigation  also.The blatant obstruction into investigations by our Administration and cover ups by GOP must stop!
And you think he'll actually give them to you?  I'm guessing you'll end up with falsified documents, at best.
We still need #SpecialProsecutor 
@SenatorBurr is not trustworthy. Sessions must resign. Nunes must resign. America will overcome
Special Investigation.   Don't trust Burr.  He's in bed with Koch

You should look up Mark Warners relationship with the Yandex. Weird it's a Russian tech company...let me guess he's a D so it's okey though?
if this is true ! Then why didn't Obama fire Him instead of giving Flynn the Highest ranking security clearance .  before President Trump
$6 million?  #yandex
You are the one who should be investigated for you dealing with Russia.  Let's hear more about how you got rich off Russian search engine co
Thank you for your leadership. The fate of the Republic is in you & your Committee's hands. #WorseThanWatergate
Ever consider that @potus finds the investigation banal b/c he knos he has nothing to hide?
If u were innocent would u care what others do?
Thank you Senator Warner, from a VA constituent who is rapidly losing faith in our government.
Senators, Thank you for your dedication to our democracy but we must have an independent investigation & special prosecutor to find truth
#IndependentCommissionNOW
Keep at it, Senators! An #IndependentInvestigation is needed
Thank you Senator @MarkWarner Please continue investigating this issue.
This is good, but we need an independent investigator. Please, for the sake of the country.
Thank you @MarkWarner for your tireless work.  Hopefully @SenatorBurr will push forward as diligently as he has done today while under fire.
Hey, subpoena trumps " personal body guard" about who he met during campaign- pinch him to talk! Comon impeachment
We simply must have an independent investigation, a #SpecialProsecutorNow
RUSSIA!  Drink!
Romney helped bring RU influence in2 GOP. Mike Rogers deeply involved w/ the Romney family. Mike’s side-kick Dana Rohrabacher pro-Russia
Rogers is a dangerous selection 4 head of FBI. Mike is close 2 the Romney family, who in turn, R deeply involved with high-level Russians

Get ready to go to jail Flynn. We can only hope Trump won't be far behind
Concern re Burr & Koch Bros-Concern re entire GOP & Koch Bros. Forensic Financials included in GOP Trump Russia Treason Regime Investigation
SUBPOENA SHOULD GO TO WH--BECAUSE FLYNN BOTH WH EMPLOYEE NSA & INTEGRAL TO DJT CAMPAIGN
A good first step & I thank you for it, Senator Warner. Considering he refused via counsel on 4/28, what makes you so sure he'll respond now
Proud constituent, Senator. #followthefacts
Does this carry the power of a criminal subpoena (signed by judge) or the slightly lesser power of a tort subpoena (signed by counsel)?
Thank you. Please help restore our faith in the system by demanding an independent investigation of the President regarding Russia.
Drag him!
can't trust this
My Senator Mark Warner continuing to push for disclosure on #TrumpRussia - thank you, sir! Stay strong.

Eventually he'll squeal
on a day that has been the most scary for the health of our democracy, this announcement gives this American some hope. Thank you gentlemen
Please get Comey on the record as to whether he did or did not tell Trump 3 times he was not under investigation. We all know that's a lie.
Give Flynn immunity and take them all down!  #Trumprussia #SpecialProsecutor #Collusion
Go ahead and pat yourselves on the back. Do it as slowly as possible & try to impede other movement. You know, the way you do investigations
To maintain your credibility you need distance from @timkaine till he is out of control
Thank you. May I inquire why this took 12 days? Burr's staff have been less than helpful communicating my concern as a constituent.
Please Sir, save our Republic. It is solely in your Committee's hands.
#IMPEACHTRUMPNOW #TheResistance
I cannot be easy to be the minority party of this committee, well played.
Thank you for your service to our country @SenatorBurr and @MarkWarner
Awesome Job Sir. You are a national hero!
What happens if they decline again?....
I'm glad you got Burr to sign off on a subpoena of Flynn. Now you also need to get ones for Manafort, Page, Stone, Sessions, et al.
Thank you & @SenatorBurr for pursuing the truth.
Thank you, Sen Warner.  There is nothing more important than this work to save our democracy.
Thank you Senator, and keep it up - we are depending on you!!
Mark,  America needs someone who can't be bought, bullied, or forced.
Thank you for your leadership!
Thank you for everything you're doing, Mr. Warner.
@TrueFactsStated
Thank you! We need you more than ever! Please help us! We have lost confidence in our government and we are scared!  Grateful for you both!
This certainly explains #Comey getting fired yesterday in a rush. Trump's hair is on fire & he's trying to change the subject again.
It's high time!
I hope its not just smoke and mirrors
@McClatchyDC @SenatorBurr thank you Senators! Thus us about saving our democracy. It will be you legacy. I hope all will follow
Thank you, Senator Warner! Please keep it up.
Thank you Senator Warner!
Nice
Who declines to do what the @FBI says??? He already said he had a story to tell.
Thank you @MarkWarner !!!!! 
Thank you!
Since he is fired what docs would he have ?
I appreciate the committee's pursuit of the truth in this matter, please continue with all urgency.
Great. Is your committee fully staffed yet?
Thank you @MarkWarner.  @SenatorBurr You need to recuse yourself.  Now. #SpecialProsecutor
what staff do you need? Have a plan to cross check what he produces? Don't just let Burr check the box and
claim that he investigated. Burr is somehow #complicit in #Trumprussia & may be abetting treason.
He wants immunity.
