@MarkWarner I am a Virginia resident who is against tax dollars going to #PlannedParenthood.
@addellis Catholics use birth control as much as anyone else, abortion almost as much. Other religious groups opposing PP even more average.
@JohnnySoftware and your point about Catholics?
@addellis Catholic church is one of the biggest collectors of federal aid dollars. Almost all it spends on charity, turns out to be federal.
.@MarkWarner The PolitiBears thought Obamacare was supposed to cover these services. Why do we need Planned Parenthood again? @PolitiBunny
@MarkWarner others provide similar services without keeping 150K+ women/year from ever having the ability to live to receive such services
@MarkWarner You didn't READ the bill! As a Virginian, you DISGUST ME.
@MarkWarner @timkaine Both just lost my vote.
-Hanover VA
@MarkWarner Where are the stats on how many abortions and how much income from selling human tissue ?taxes should not be used for this.
@MarkWarner PP workers demonstrate the “quality” of fetal body parts.This is the reality of what you're standing with.
@MarkWarner aren't you concerned about the videos? I don't want my govt supporting this.
@MarkWarner You would have a point if these services were limited to Planned Parenthood. They're not!
@MarkWarner BETTER SAID WOULD BE "WE CAN'T DENY THE PROFIT FROM SELLING ABORTED BABY PARTS - ITS A CASH COW !! PLUS THEY BOUGHT LUNCH
@MarkWarner @SenateDems Did not Obama care take care of all those things? Stupid excuse for supporting PP
@MarkWarner S1881 provid $ 4 hlth serv to agencies that do not profit from abortions #PPSellsBabyParts So why R u stnding w PP? #AnotherBoy
@MarkWarner Investigating a possible crime isn't anti women's health.
Shame on @MarkWarner who forces taxpayers paying for those selling baby parts.
@MarkWarner  Why are we giving PP 500 million a year when we are also footing the bill for obamacare?  We no longer need to fund PP
@MarkWarner thanks for standing with the women of VA and the women of this country! Proud that you are our senior Senator!
@MarkWarner http://go.shr.lc/1eRdNEh   This is NOT healthcare. U voted with Joseph Mengele. The sale of baby parts is absolutely heartbreaking.
@MarkWarner You disgust me. How can you possibly support an organization that sells baby's organs.
@MarkWarner Using that # shows that you stand with the selling of baby parts. This is pure evil. As a Virginian, I do not support you.
@MarkWarner how much money did #ppact donate to your last 2 campaigns?
@MarkWarner We can't deny the REAL issue here no matter how you sell it. You are funding an organization that sells organs, which is illegal
@MarkWarner A vote for Warner is a vote for abortion.
@MarkWarner Yet, this same group denies medical care to anyone under the age of birth. Correct your mistake in the next vote.
@MarkWarner please reconsider. You have lost touch with Virginians. How can you watch the videos and still vote to fund?
@MarkWarner Your support of these butchers is a disgrace.
@MarkWarner How is that not already covered by the ACA?
Why don't you share the truth @MarkWarner
@MarkWarner Please don't deceive yourself. We're counting on you to represent our state until the next election...
@MarkWarner says #PPSellsBabyParts vids "heavily edited" Full footage and transcript online Sen! #WatchtheVids #StoptheRhetoric #AnotherBoy
@MarkWarner @SenateDems defund, Obama Care can pay for this crap
@MarkWarner Democrats I don't need to say anymore
@MarkWarner Thanks, MW. This is the kind of placard people need to read; one with facts about healthcare that matters to public&lady health.
@MarkWarner That's BS and u know it! Shame on u!  No # of gyno exams justify the MURDER American babies.  U r a disgrace!
@MarkWarner you know very well the intent is not to deny women access to healthcare. What an embarrassment. #shameful.
@MarkWarner Serial Killers get welfare checks for community service #DefundPlannedParenthood #DefundPP
@MarkWarner Funny, breast exams aren't given at most PP locations.
@MarkWarner -neck-deep in $$$ body parts and covered in the slick ooze of the most innocent blood, continues to #StandwithPP
@MarkWarner  Stop spinning the truth. We can get these services most anywhere! Not my tax dollars for this inhumane practice!!
@MarkWarner all of which could be done elsewhere.  #moralmonster
@MarkWarner Defund Planned Parenthood!  This is why we have Obamacare!  What they are doing is evil and illegal!
@MarkWarner I cannot believe you support trafficking of human body parts. You continue to be a disgrace to Virginia!
@MarkWarner I certainly made a mistake voting for your claimed "independence."  These are standard DNC talking points.
@MarkWarner For shame, Sen. Warner. Virginia is better than this. We'll remember your vote to support trafficking not-yet-born baby parts.
@MarkWarner The need for women's care is great, but any organization targeting children for murder should not receive federal $ #DefundPP
@MarkWarner Your a peice of shit excuse for a Senator I never voted for you. Virginia deserves better!
@MarkWarner Never wanted you in Virginia and we deserve better.  This is a battle against a organization that has disobeyed a federal law.
@MarkWarner Hey, doesn't "Obamacare" COVER all that?
@MarkWarner I'm sure PP can survive without government funding. And if not, good. The ACA can cover the 1 in 5. #DefundPlannedParenthood
@MarkWarner Thank you Senator Warner! Virginia families #StandwithPP @PPact @PPAVirginia
@MarkWarner It's not denying anyone health care services. This is about taking federal funding from PP. #PPSellsBabyParts #DefundPP
@MarkWarner @SenateDems But you will because you'll cave, pre-cave, and post cave. I no longer trust you Sen Warner
@MarkWarner How many murders and what was the profit off of the fetuses sold?  How much kickback do you get?
@MarkWarner @SenateDems Can we deny a murdered defenseless infant the dignity of keeping it's own body parts Senator. It's right from wrong
@MarkWarner These women must marry first and then their husbands take care of them,DEFUND PP ,OBAMACARE CAN TAKE CARE OF THESE LADIES not PP
@MarkWarner @jenniferjcouch Good numbers, but no taxpaid abortions & mothers get it free if #PPSellsBabyParts
@MarkWarner #S1881 Does not deny women those services http://bit.ly/1HmG9wP  Did you watch the videos? @SBAList #DefundPP #PPSellsBabyParts
@MarkWarner And MY tax dollars are going to this murderous organization? I never asked for that. #DefundPP
@MarkWarner Divide it into two segments then and de-fund one of them.  Fair & reasonable accountability exists that way.
@MarkWarner That's why we have Obamacare now,we r in bankrupt with many programs , PP kills and trafficks  organs of babies,
@MarkWarner @SenateDems That's stupid there are plenty of places for women to get services. Isn't that what Ocare is about giving it away?
@MarkWarner #DefundPP #S1881 won't end women's healthcare it will fund clinics that actually provide a full range of women's care!!
@MarkWarner So why doesn’t Planned Parenthood just drop abortion services if it’s only 3%?
@MarkWarner Thank you Senator Warner for standing with @PPact.
@MarkWarner I am a VA taxpayer who stands with #PlannedParenthood, esp. since allegations were unfounded!
@MarkWarner @SenateDems Okay...so vote for the bill and get rid of abortions and so other legitimate healthcare pros can do it instead.
@MarkWarner @SenateDems We can't deny women the right to have their unborn's heads squashed with forceps. #StandwithPP
@MarkWarner why don't you propose a nhs for women?
@MarkWarner @SenateDems We're not, just denying @PPact funding. #DefundPP #PPSellsBabyParts #HumanChopShop #AnotherBoy #WomenBetrayed
