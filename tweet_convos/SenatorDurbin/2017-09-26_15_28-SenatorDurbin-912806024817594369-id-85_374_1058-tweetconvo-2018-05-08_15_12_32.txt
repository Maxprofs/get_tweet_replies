Thank you, Senator, for your compassion & dedication to the whole of America, whom you serve without question or qualification. #Action
Why is it that Democrats are always trying to help people, while GOP just cares about business & their donors?
I guess better late than never.  You and your colleagues dropped the ball on this one.
Senator, you sound as though you’re unaware of FEMA’s prepositioning supplies, equipment in PR 3 Days before landfall..
62249 residents in Quebradillas. DHS wrong on exemption efficacy. USA ENG/Seabees prove it! Think Marshall Plan, Carrib Berlin Airlift now.
My Illinois ppl thank you for helping out to P.R #wearestrong#together
Thank You both. Since Trump can not handle being president for All Americas

THANK YOU SIR I REALLY APPRECIATED.
Just asking, have you personally sent any $$ to help the ppl of Puerto Rico yet?  Millionaires in congress should set example and give first
Thank you Senators
That’s the job! Glad you’re doing it!
Take care of Texas and Florida first!
Thanks. While @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan are busy catering #TaxReform to help wealthy, Senate Democrats are focused helping those in need.
Thank you, Senators, for all that you do! Illinois is proud of you and appreciates your constant efforts.
Where's the BEEF? Where is the FED funding ear mark or legislation? +6000 dialysis  patients NEED electricity BIG Health CRISIS making
Thank you! Should they not help immediately we must hold them accountable for the lives in peril! 
Like it wouldn't happen without  you.
Thank you for speaking up. So proud of IL senators 
That's right.  Remind they have something else to do besides take away health care and reduce taxes on the wealthy.  (Help regular people.)
Thank you all! Need action now for Puerto Rico
Thank you, Sen. Durbin!  You make us proud!
Thank you.  Puerto Ricans are part of America.  The area beautiful.  This mandate comes late.  People are dying. I live in Massachusetts.
The Jones Act also needs to be waived
Thank you. So glad you and Sen.Duckworth are my Senators. Voted for both of you.
Thank you for helping fellow Americans in need!

Thank you! I'm proud of my IL senators. Now get the Jones Act waived for PR like it was for Florida and Texas.
Thank you @SenatorDurbin & @SenDuckworth from grateful constituent in LaGrange Pk-U r doing the work I hoped you wld do when I voted 4 u!
Past time. No more delay. @DotardPOTUS will continue to "blame " because PR people don't look or speak how he prefers. #RacistPOTUS

Thank you @SenatorDurbin ...I can always rely on you...constiuent..
Good lord, please @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr: Act NOW, not tomorrow. These are American citizens we're talking about!
What about repealing or at least waving the Jones Act during this crisis and during the island's reconstruction?
Thank you!
Thank you
Thank you.
marry it to Trumpcare hate
Good because as usual and due to racial bias Trump is derelict in his duty to fellow Americans.
Can you please also halt  @EPAScottPruitt and @SecPriceMD's misuse of taxpayer funds? That $$ could go to PR! $25K, on a bubble? $300K jet?
Thank you Senator We Need Action Now ROS
Thank you. Please hurry.
We are Not Prepared For Natural or Man Made Disasters. ...Hurricanes Or Nuclear WAR
We love our senators from Illinois! Thank you!
. It's already being done. Go do your job. Read the FEMA website. Stop the lies   #DirtyDick
Sad that none of your republican colleagues signed this.
