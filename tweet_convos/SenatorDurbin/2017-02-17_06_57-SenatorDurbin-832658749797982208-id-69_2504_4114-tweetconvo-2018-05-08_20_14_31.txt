.@FieldMuseum No offense, but my biggest problem with your alleged "fact" below is that it's utter BS. #DayOfFacts
you might be interested in reading http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001104 â€¦ I found it of value.
.@jimfrogge1 No offense, but calling plant/animal range shifts "local extinctions" is BS
No offense taken, but I am disappointed in the lack of depth in your response. BS? I had hoped for something more.
.@jimfrogge1 When warmist family dog runs into back yard, Dad tells the kids that CO2 has made their dog "locally extinct" in front yard
I'm not saying you're wrong and range shifts are most certainly happening and going to continue.
But, if change is rapid and species are specialized, their chance of survival is limited.
psst....not all humans are  immigrants from Africa. See: Africans.
Keep your politics to yourself.
Science is science. It doesn't care about your snowflake feelings.
Your funny
Don't leave us hanging Phil! His funny what?
Well, maybe not so much climate change.
.@FieldMuseum Awesome!
this made me cry. It is SO beautiful!!
Love it, especially "but we're working on it". 
#hope
Excellent video. Science is the only real thing to believe in.
@Ehmee @ everyone at the Field Museum: You are great. This video made my day.
#dayoffacts
 thank you for sharing facts!
she has a house I'm pretty sure
I have heard that genetic #diversity amongst Africans is greater than between non-Africans and Africans. #Africa #DNA
All humans are not immigrants FROM Africa.  Some never left.  What ancestor/ancestress predate "Mitochondrial Eve?"
Thank you!

great project! Robeson Planetarium stands with you: facts matter, dammit!
good stuff!
How can I copy and share messages from the Field Museum via FB or email? My son is an Enviro Sci major and I'd like to share!
@NAChristakis one of the many reasons I love and miss Chicago
what a great video #facts
birds cant be living dinosaurs since the extinction was causing by an asteroid hitting the Earth and killing most life
Meh, facts are just things stupid scientists have proven with experiments and evidence. So sad!
thanks for this amazing video! @Ehmee you inspire me to improve more and more my outreach to society! Thanks
Nope Climate Change isn't what they say it is and whistle blowers are tearing it up. God is human evolution
too long
Beautiful! Thanks!
.@FieldMuseum This is awesome! #ThankYou #DayOfFacts #FactsMatter #science #museum
At The Field Museum, facts matter. See why, from our experts in geology, paleontology, human evolution, and climate change. #DayOfFacts 
Very well done. #DayOfFacts
FACT: The earth is round.
ALTERNATIVE FACT: The earth is flat.
@janedmunds I've long been a fan of The Field Museum. But I've never been a bigger fan than I am now.
@ScottPruittOK Congrats Mr. Pruitt. Here's a little science 101 orientation regarding proven facts even grade schoolers know.
Y'all. <3 Major love. This is incredible work.
Thanks for his awesome video! #dayoffacts
@dayoffacts Facts aren't supposed to make me cry. #inspired #dayoffacts #museumsmatter #sciencematters
I could not love this more. Science will survive Trump & Pruitt and this INSANE GOP because of ppl like YOU!
only leftist facts matter, right?
what are leftist facts. Facts are facts
@ScienceMarchDC One of my favorite places growing up.  Love this!  Thank you!  <3
Awesome video, thanks! Sad that we live in a time when a #DayOfFacts is necessary.  That is what "everyday" used to be.
I'll be there on Monday with a "Climate Change is a Hoax" poster.
You rock @FieldMuseum. Awesome clip.
At The Field Museum, facts matter. See why, from our experts in geology, paleontology, human evolution, and climate change. #DayOfFacts 
"Common Ancestor" does not equal "immigration", but good use of today's buzzwords. The correct term is "migration". #dayoffacts
Human migration is the movement by people from one place to another with the intentions of settling temporarily or permanently
"Immigration is the action of coming to live permanently in a foreign country"
Now can we stop with the partisan nonsense and get back to decent science? #morefakenews
For anyone who may have forgotten in our recent history what real facts look like - not alternate fact - watch this
Ground Transportation. 50% R/R. Industry unwilling to retool. Bias / Radial conversion 1970's. Who will be first? #wheel
@ScienceMarchDC OMG!! This made me cry! Love it
#ActualSocialScientist
Give the Field Mus some love,a truly wonderful museum with a message that should not be startling but today it is'facts matter'@FieldMuseum
@ScienceMarchDC great video! I cant believe we actually need a DAY dedicated to facts to remind everyone how important they are
wot?
OMG I love you guys. When I visited Chicago, you were the first place I wanted to see. @ScienceMarchDC
Awesome!
@ScienceMarchDC  That is such a beautiful video.  Thank you.
The fact that we have to do this in this age is ASTONISHING.  Its like progress has take 500 steps back.
wow!!! what a beautiful video!!!!!! amazing!!! #Factsmatter
This is SO COOL. Thanks for creating and sharing.
Beautifully done. Thank you
de fato
@Ehmee I love it!
