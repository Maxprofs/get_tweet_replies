President Trump declared that Sally Yates had “betrayed” the administration, the White House said in a statement http://nyti.ms/2kaMbOM 
The Attorney General swears an oath to defend the Constitution, not fealty to the President
the Atty GENERAL WAS OBAMA APPOINTEE, NOT TRUMPS - shame on Trump for KEEPING HER THAT LONG!
her allegiance is to the constitution and not the White House.
@nytimes NEWS FLASH! The President is kinda in charge of the Executive Branch.
and if it was a BUSH APPOINTEE saying NO TO OBAMA, you wouldn't expect Obama to FIRE?   Hypocrite!
Better to betray Trump, then your morales or the Constitution !
You have IGNORED ILLINOIS FOR YEARS - gave us CO2 burial grounds instead of economic engines.
Thank you for speaking out against President Trump's behavior.  Do not confirm Sessions for AG!
I would fire my employee who didn't follow order too.
except this is closer to fascism than not doing what boss says. Bosses aren't always right, just hierarchically advanced
My boss may not be right but, she is still the boss. I play my position
when the boss is a tyrant racist racist and you have a supposed higher document to defend, then no.
I support you and your colleagues to stop Trump at every turn! Do not give in! Please keep Americans safe! It is critical!
She was acting out in defiance not holding an opinion. This is big boy world now & its time you act like it. @Terrence_CFP
She acted just like every other AG that did their job despite what their President said. Good for her.
Acted like a child? yes I would agree with that.
Before an AG gets the job they are asked if they will do what they feel is right vs doing what the POTUS says.
so allowing immigrants from known terrorist breeding grounds in without vetting them properly is right?
And again, not 1 single refugee has conducted a terrorist act against us.
you personally but they have acted and you won't hear about it on your liberal news.
It's actually a fact, not an opinion.
Willful insubordination is not dissent.  So sick of politics.  Do your job or quit.
@nytimes  Sally Yates did the right thing. She was treated abusively by trump...nothing new for him
.@SenatorDurbin Glad you see it that way. So why haven't you and @SenDuckworth opposed every single candidate the POTUS put forth?
she was an Obama Appointee who opposed his agenda, and it needs to be done. She couldn't do her job, so she was fired.
no sessions need bipartisan need non-biased.  AgYates for her stance and then she left. He needs to leave
thank you 
You ignoring American families & the USA will not end well. You are lawless & your state represents it.
All progressive activists who choose to ignore our Constitution and refuse to defend our laws should be fired
.Americans reject the progressive vision which distorts our Constitution&gnores our laws w/ our Trump Vote
Please call immediately for removal of Bannon from NSC and WH #NoBannon
Yes! Please act on this by not allowing Sessions to be our next AG!
@iamjuliejem @TheJusticeDept @nytimes Waiting for Congress to stop condemning and hand wringing and DO SOMETHING!
@nytimes fight for our democracy and justice
@nytimes thank you for speaking out! This is another blemish within the first 100 days of 2017.
So you'll be voting #NoOnSessions, then?
Thank you Sally Yates for standing up! #Brave #woman #Freedom #USA
@nytimes yes, she chose to betray a dictator, and protect & honor the constitution. remind me to vote for her
@nytimes You call that dessent? Wow...
I am from Illinois and I pray that our congress will work to stabilize our country.
@Shirley10090505 @TheJusticeDept @nytimes we are no longer allowed to give a negative opinion of anything Donald Trump does
good for you TRUMP about time we got BRAINS in the white house to bad we have to let liberals in
@nytimes so can we please get this dictator out of office?!
Senator, you and your colleagues MUST stop this man. #StandUpToTrump #MkeAmericaSaneAgain
@lb1018 @TheJusticeDept @nytimes - Then *do* something,
@nytimes Then it's time for you and your colleagues to get serious about #Impeachment. For democracy's sake.
You MUST call for impeachment! Bannon, Ryan, Priebus must go, too!
.@SenatorDurbin @TheJusticeDept @nytimes #authoritarianism
@nytimes Thank you, Senator. Proud to be an Illinois resident under your leadership.
There's no "if," @SenatorDurbin. I implore you to revoke unanimous consent. Stop consenting to fascism.  @TheJusticeDept @nytimes
this is why it is more important than ever for you to #StopSessions. we are counting on you to oppose his nomination
Then fricking DO something
@nytimes Include @potus in your tweets & he may see them.
Ya think?  It's *exactly* why we've been calling our Cong Reps asking them to #StandUpToTrump
So Impeach him already! How many thousands of people do you need in the streets before you'll get the nerve @SenatorDurbin? @TheJusticeDept
@TeamBarackObama @TheJusticeDept It's time to acknowledge what is happening and be ready to stop it...FAST.
@Only4RM @nytimes
Senator, why hasn't the impeachment process been started? Donald swore to protect the Constitution and has broken that oath
Yes, so PLEASE BLOCK SESSIONS. We're all depending on you!
What Trump really meant was she refused to OBEY him, that is NOT her duty
Please don't concede to Sessions, please.
That better mean NO to Jeff Sessions!
Dear Senator,
I hope this further demonstrates how important it is to vote against Sessions.
Please help us.
@nytimes IF?  Did you see what he said abt McCain/Graham/WW3!?  All due respect, you're behind the ball.
@nytimes This how is should be done. What your seeing now is called work. You have avoided your entire career
You're witnessing a coup in progress. #ImpeachTrumpNow
what are you doing to stop Trump's authoritarian acts?The senate has much power right now.Put holds on the worst nominees.
Come on Senator she was playing politics instead of doing her job. Remember back to those days when you believed in country before party
@nytimes Do something about it!
What are you and your colleagues doing to stop this?
@nytimes Something needs to be done to STOP this madness...how much longer can this go on?  #resist
And now the director of ICE. He has to go!
@nytimes yup Obama's DOJ most independent in history under Holder and Lynch (smirk) Delusional Dustbin!
@nytimes Ok Dickie-tell how you deal w/dissent @POTUS @MikePenceVP @HispanicsTrump @PressSec @SenSchumer #TX
@drmagoo @nytimes Then I implore you as a constituent that JBSIII’s AG nomination be reconsidered for independence.
Pls vote NO on cabinet picks. Pls get Bannon out of WH ASAP. Pls start process to #InvokeThe25th. Our democracy is in danger.
Please appeal to your @GOP colleagues to come to their senses, @SenatorDurbin. @Bywatergal @TheJusticeDept
Senator, honor Ms. Yates's courage by working w colleagues to remove DT from office. This is your time. #doit
@nytimes since he escaped from insane asylum, the entire country is going through Kim kardashian junk show
please don't vote for Jeff Sessions' appointment tomorrow. This is dangerous and scary stuff!
ERIC HOLDER
@nytimes  ensure it by voting no on Sessions.
most of the country is very very worried about our democracy & upholding the constitution #StopTrumpNow
@nytimes Well, then #impeachment and removal must begin immediately. @GOP
@nytimes @potus has betrayed the Constitution. Tell me which is worse.
Hope Does Sessions understand the rule of law. Vote no.
@nytimes It's clear Trump is mentally unstable/incompetent & being influenced by Bannon. Impeach!
@nytimes Dems better block EVERYTHING...PERIOD!
Thank you for this tweet... And thank you for serving. God bless the United States of America.
@nytimes Sally Yates is my hero.
@nytimes Roy Cohn was a mentor so this is EXACTLY how he deals with dissent. Crush the opponent.
That man needs to be stopped immediately. He must be removed from office now.
I agree! We're counting on you to resist each and every action against the public interest. @TheJusticeDept @nytimes
@nytimes thank you Senator Durbin. We hope we can count on your vote against Sessions tomorrow.
Her allligence is to the Constitution not the WH. @StephenBannon
@nytimes What exactly precisely will it take for you to call to impeach??????
@nytimes You have got to stop this mad man.
@nytimes pls get Bannon out of White House, hold up appointees, investigate Trump/Putin , no Devos/sessions
It's pretty obvious that's how he deals with dissent. No need for hypotheticals.
OPPOSE Sessions tomorrow
you can make a difference in four years
Why has there not been a move for impeachment? If what he is doing is unconstitutional, do it already. This is dangerous.
@nytimes very dangerous path indeed
oh come on? she was to uphold the laws of the constitution she didn't, she got fired. @SenatorDurbin he acted as he should.
vickie, really.  how about you show me that?  i'd be willing to read.
Please oppose his cabinet picks 
He makes nothing but dangerous and
Unethical choices also Bannon needs  gone
Trump confuses business with government.  He thinks he is king....King George III- the mad king.
Firing an acting attorney general over her position to uphold the constitution is dangerous. Must address it.
@nytimes @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is the true betrayer. #NoOnSessions #FireBannon
Thank you. I'm glad you're my senator. I hope this means you and @SenDuckworth are committed to voting against Sessions tmrw
@nytimes he's not a President, he's a Dictator...
Please keep fighting!! #resist
@nytimes Steve Bannon told him he could be king.
Thankful for President Trump. He cares about our safety. You care about politics. We r going 2 #MAGA
Seeing as that is the GOP talking point, I recommend you check out some opposing views & ponder.
@nytimes
@nytimes dangerous and horrifying. Please know we are behind your dissent.
Please #impeach, or at least shout that fool down when he opens his pie-hole.
I'm scared for our country. What do we do?
.@SenatorDurbin @TheJusticeDept time to discuss impeachment, or invoke Sec 4 of 25th amendment.  We are NOT safe with this lunatic.
Please don't confirm Sessions after this.
Senator, are you and Sen. Duckworth committed to voting against Sessions tomorrow?
@nytimes please, please oppose his agenda at every opportunity.
