I'm joined by @SenBlumenthal& @SenatorCardin in call for @DHSgov& @TheJusticeDept to investigate https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-call-for-investigation-of-sebastian-gorka-after-reports-surface-of-ties-to-neo-nazi-group …
and investigate Durbin's support for corruption in Aurora IL
You should be more concerned maybe w/ your embarrassing performance at the hearing today.
Fire him. They fired Sally Yates for being a Patriot. But won't fire Gorka because he is a Nazi.
Also deeply concerned that with so much profiteering off the WH few have spoken up about it or demanded changes.
@allywalker1 @SebGorka  Gosh, what a surprise.
shouldn't you be more concerned about doing photo-ops with corrupt candidates under federal criminal investigation?
Yes, having a Nazi working in the White House is somewhat concerning
Yes, bc the Jersusalem Post is in the business of defending Nazis these days I guess.
Follow the money. Billionaire. Alt right guy,Robert Mercer financed the Trump Pres. Spun fake news 4 him. Owns 1/2 Brietbart

It appears that Gorka has Nazi ties. #GorkaMustGo NOW
This man will be not good for the American people,his private views will interfere with his job.
@calvathansa There have to be legal consequences to this, right? Lying under oath to be the least damaging charge in this.
@badgirl_loony 

DO YOUR JOB!
Never minding of course that same organization saved Jews from the Nazis.
Yes, @realdonaldtrump associates with and hires Nazis! @SenatorDurbin @SebGorka So much for hire American. Real motto, hire racists!
@SenDianeFeinstein Vote NO on Gorsuch #NoGorsuch extra conservative that will destroy RoevWade and women's rights
come on...
Deeply concerned doesn't cover it! @SebGorka should b nowhere near the WH! GET NAZI OUT OF WH NOW!
Thank you @SenatorDurbin for taking whatever steps are necessary to preserve our nation. We know we can count on you.
How about this Senator?What are you doing to protect America from terrorists?
Former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka: "The left has no idea how much more damage we can do to them as private citizens." 
Aldo worried that he is handling nat sec issues on unsecured wifi at mar a moscow.
Interesting that stone has the emblem on his hat. Can't find that hat online anywhere either.
Failed to disclose or WH was ok with it?
How about not just expressing concern but *doing something definite*?
Investigate and remove him
@badgirl_loony @SebGorka So he should be deported
I don't think Gorka is the only one. Look at Bannon.
You should be more than "concerned".  My uncle did not sit in a POW camp fighting Nazi's so one could be in the WH
This Nazi must not be in the WH! Please demand that he resign!
You democrats have really lost your grip on reality. Your twitter feed is filled with hysteria. You'll be voted out
You should be more than deeply concerned. Stand up for what's right. In every situation there needs to be a leader!
Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
Like Flynn : Trump and Bannon knew and hired based on background. When they get caught, denying/deflecting is the protocol.
i would be more then deeply concerned do something you putz
Perhaps we should be "extreme vetting" @potus 'a cabinet and WH staff. Just a thought.
this is too crazy-he must face full ramifications!! Please push this!
I appreciate that you are concerned. Not being sarcastic.  Respectfully, Sir, you are can do something about it
Nazi and Immigrant. Sick!
#GorkaMustGo
@RepRubenGallego please tell me @ICEgov is following up on this.  @amyklobuchar?
Now imagine if Obama had done this. We would see impeachment proceedings already. The hypocrisy is disgusting.
@ActDontReact @SebGorka Guess he was never vetted extremely! 
@LauriBoxrucker @SebGorka #GorkaMustGo
wow
When does "deep concern" turn to action? Time's awastin'!
isn't this omission (or lie, YMMV) grounds for revocation and exclusion from the US? Deportation would be in order.
Call him out! Your voice is louder than ours!
As you should be!  As we all should be!  Do NOT confirm him!!!!!!!!!!!!  #TrumpRussia
It's not just that he lied. It's that he's a part of the group. #gorkamustgo
.@SenatorDurbin removing him should be put to a vote. Get the Republicans on record for supporting a Nazi sympathizer.
Deeply concerned? You should be outraged! WTF?
@highmountainli2 @SebGorka Failed to disclose? You mean lied. Committed perjury.
Under the patriot act anyone's citizenship can be taken away for suspected terrorism. He fits.
The Trump administration is out of control.  Please use your influence to push for a special prosecutor on Russia ties.
Anyone have reliable sources that clearly connect his medal to pro-Nazi organizations? Thanks!
Ok found something.


So what's going to be done about it? Getting old...@SenateDems are  *concerned* yet the #traitors are already here.
@EdRedstateblues @SebGorka Bet he wasn't vetted at all.
@Chewwie7 @SebGorka Deport him!He's the creepiest guy ever. Interview on NPR made me feel like I needed a shower afterwards.
OMG, right?? I've always gotten the heebie jeebies from him!
@smille5884 @SebGorka We're all concerned.
@ms_msmarshas @SebGorka good, because it's deeply fucking concerning!! #Trumprussia
@cmturner9651 @SebGorka Really cannot understand how @realDonaldTrump hires the best people!
Administration is made up of Nazis Fascist Leninist Conspiracy theorist racists & Russian collusion Get out of WH
Deeply concerned. The WH staff is thumbing their nose at the Constitution. What is congress doing?
Thank you. Please try to get your GOP colleagues to see common sense. #Countryb4Party #InvestigateTrump
yes and fence ridding Durbin would know how

I'm concerned too, but no longer surprised. #resist #StopPresidentBannon
get these clowns out of there!!! Especially the clown in chief Orango the Grumpy.
Dick, your ONLY just concerned that Gorka is a racist, hateful, NAZI????
And #Trump wants to keep out all the starving refugees, by this is ok?
Help the American people our security is in huge jeopardy! #Trumpembarrasing #traitor #Greed #LiarInChief
I would definitely agree that is concerning.
@PubPolHist @SebGorka careful. He's a 
what is the senate waiting for??Take action before we are in a nuclear war!!@SenSchumer @SenWarren @SenatorJMcCain
@Marty_Politics @SebGorka lol I'm more worried about his membership with Nazis, disclosed or not!
Yes! Me too.
Geez, the beat goes on...another crook!
ih goodness! these guys
say what now? What new hell has Trump foisted on us?
, nothing the democrats couldn't lie about
Please get these ppl OUT of our democracy!!
Not even shocking anymore with this administration.  They don't try to hide it either.
@WonderWoman934 It's not Godwin's Law if it's true. #FireGorkaNow
@oharecl @SebGorka whatcha gonna do?
@erpforidaho @SebGorka Yeah, but he'll be confirmed anyway.
Way to just throw out 'claims', with no evidence. I am your constituent and you are an embarrassment to Illinois!
We're all deeply concerned Sir. Also mildly dismayed that our president is a complete & utter liar
I too would be concerned by this, but we can't force investigations based on claims alone (like Trump tries 2 do)
He's a terrorist,. Extreme vetting needed at WH!!
Ironically, he was also arrested last year for trying to take a gun onto a plane in a carry-on bag...

We can't provide a claim without supporting evidence. The article only shows ties, but no concrete evidence
Deport him!
#whatsgoodforgoose
thank you Sir for listening to my calls!!! #HappyConstituent #HappyConstituent #TrumpRussia #TrumpRussia #TrumpRussia #45OUT
Thanks again, Senator Durbin, for all you do for Illinois and our country. 
so much for that "extreme vetting". Also concern that Trump thinks these are "the best people"
to be perfectly honest, anyone who says "immigrants should come to America the RIGHT WAY!" should be appalled.
Thank you for speaking up. I'm a constituent and I will expect nothing less than your full focus on Impeachment.
He sounds like one of those "bad guys" the President warns us about.  Why would he be in Trump's team if Trump only hires the best people?
Glad to hear. What can we do to get him out? He shouldn't even be in America after lying about it.
We are so concerned about that too. Not.
Wow, that just doesn't seem like something I would forget???
VERY concerned but not surprised at all. Especially with this dipshit fake President @realDonaldTrump
#NazisInTheWhiteHouse #StPatricksDay!
@erpforidaho @SebGorka is this fact?
Of course Silly Woman
Dear dog. Been overseas and slightly out of touch, which is actually a blessing.
The White House is slimy with white supremacists. Does the .@GOP give a damn? Apparently not.
Durban and his #FakeNews "comrades" should be CONCERNED about this TOO! We're not! 
#fakenews
Durban and his Fake News "c
look who's hiring these ppl
and Durban isn't CONCERNED about this
and Durban isn't concerned about this
Durbin you make people in Illinois SICK, go away already
Durban isnt concerned about This
why are all these horrible people in key positions in the White House?
This is something everyone should be concerned about. Are there ANY good people in this administration?
but crickets about this
