safe zone. You would not STEAL my money. Let those stupid hollywood people put the money where their mouths are.
Let these wealthy hipocrites pay for a safe zone.  As far as I'm concerned they should FIGHT like we have to.
Dick your so ultra worried about Trump yet your own backyard is a cesspool and corrupt to the core!
Senator, the ACLU shouldn't have to clean up the mess. Trump placed a ban in effect that is a direct violation of our constitution. Impeach
doesn't have anything to do with the executive order

Yes, just worry about refugees and illegals like always. The citizens are sick of you and will get you voted out.

.@SenatorDurbin @ACLU American soldiers are dying overseas fighting terrorism.Democrats spit on all soldiers by protesting safe borders here
our boys are doing some asskicking in Syria. There will be costs.
What is the Senate going to do? We are counting on you to stop this madness!
Muhammad was given "refuge" in Medina.

He killed his hosts and took the city.

Muslims know the strategy as the Hijra.
France has more than 700 "Medinas" commonly known as Muslim "No Go Zones".

French sovereignty is being challenged in France
you need to vote against everything this narcissist does. Resist
thank you Senator for standing up to Heil Trump!!!
I love Fox News Sunday, when you segment came on I flipped the channel, you do not speak for the families of Illinois.
where were you when Obama did same thing with Iraqi for 6 months#hypocrites
This is how the people resist. What is your plan to fight these threats to our country? Start representing me!
Customs Agents know who they work for 
http://ln.is/nypost.com/2017/01/2/C23Yx â€¦
thank you for speaking up
Keep fighting for us. And thank you!!
Mr Durbin stop playing politics u know under the  federal Immigration law the president has the power to ban countries
This fight isn't over! Please push to end #MuslimBan
you need to start drafting legislative action to address, tweeting from the sidelines is insufficient. #DemAccountability
How many "refugees" are bunking with you and your family?
what does it take for Senator Durbin to pay attention to people in Illinois?

Now what do we do next about changes to the National Security Council?
What is wrong with you people. Did you not hear one thing from the election.
Proud to call you my Senator today.
you need to do everything you can to combat this ridiculous and disgusting behavior by the President.
yes resign. America does not agree with you
please stand up to this lunatic & his band of deplorables.
@marksch1969 @ACLU support ACLU! Donate, they're a force to be reckoned with. This isn't their 1st rodeo! It takes $$. Donate
Can you share what, if anything, is being planned in the Senate to battle these unconstitutional EOs??
Yes. The @ACLU did this. Not the Democrats. We need you to start taking action! --a constituent
How about those at ORD
These actions are against the,spirit of America. Fight this, fight this, fight this!
Where is Congress? Are Executive orders & Judicial action/reaction all we have now? How about some legislation?
and who is going to enforce this to the dictator called President? WHO? Tell us now! WHO? None have to date for all he did
I wish you showed this kind of passion for the people on the South Side of Chicago or Southern Illinois.
The ACLU is truly a national treasure. PLEASE let this convince you to adamantly RESIST every Trump action.
The ACLU only cares about civil liberties that advance their liberal agenda.
agreed! Now senator I would like to thank you for some action. When will I see it?
keep it  up on trump and am for the muslims
and i know you are too with tammy
are rock stars, couldn't be more proud tonight to be a card-carrying member. 
Thanks @ACLU !
It is clear that DT is #UnfitToLead Leader of Free World ceded to @JustinTrudeau Let's get it back. #Impeach
Dems must resist the unAmerican policies of the Trump admin. Daily messaging to inform,educate & organize the public
will you honor @ACLU- request a second hearing for Sessions, who reportedly advised on these exec ordrs?
I hope you'll be doing everything you can to help repeal this unconstitutional order, and protect America's core values.
now we need Democratic leadership in the Senate!
Now let's see some action out of you and yours. Us democrats feel abandoned. You can see it all over FB and twitter.
have you got the votes to overturn any of the executive orders?
Keep up the fight Senator, we support you!
.@SenatorDurbin COME ON! Time 2 put your gloves on & take them to the mat! Take. them. to. the. mat. #Trump breaking the law! #Stop .@ACLU
What are you doing to help your Repub colleagues see the harm Trump is doing to the U.S., her citizens, & the world?
Please VOTE AGAINST anything this madman presents.  oppose him on everything.

Don't be a victim, Dick, of their false narrative, much like the NAACP
Bravo!

WHIP this shit into shape man.  Not ok 
#ISeeWhatYouDidThere

The ACLU can't do everything! Where are the Democrats on this? Please do something.

We back Trump! Obama has turned the world upside down.
and @NILC_org
And, Sen. Durbin, can't wait to hear what you have planned next to pick up this fight in the Senate.
