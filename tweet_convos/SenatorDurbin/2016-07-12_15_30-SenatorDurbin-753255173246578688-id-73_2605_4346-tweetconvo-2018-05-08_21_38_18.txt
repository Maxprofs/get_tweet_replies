‚Äú@marthaives: @zoeluther @NASA @NASAJuno ‚Äù Yes, Jupiter!  #bestplanet

how long does a picture taken by Juno, take to be received back at NASA? Just wondering.
48 mins
hmmm, sunlight takes? We got a ways to go but we're getting there
It takes 499 seconds for light to travel from the Sun to earth. Check this http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/venus/q89.html ‚Ä¶

Such a wonderful, exciting time. My dream of going to space is coming true, in a way. TY to NASA for making dreams happen.
We are the protectors of the Giant, we offered the triple of the size of our home planet to the red spot. #NASA
We're #Juno!
@norm_an_ @NASAJuno At least they remembered to put the CGI stars in the background this time.

I hope this is a crop or #lorez because the resolution of Jupiter is rather crap in this image. a momentous feat anyway =)
beautiful and amazing
The only missing one is Minerva! If she were there too, Capitolium Trio would be completed :)
..Oh wow. Looks cool. I wonder what's really happening beyond its clouds.

Oh wow ! you can see the storm (giant red spot) on Jupiter !
i dont think you need to clarify what you mean, im pretty sure NASA got it üñí
Who said I was clarifying for NASA ? There are millions who don't know what that spot is.
Can't wait for those close-up views.
It's so beautiful.
