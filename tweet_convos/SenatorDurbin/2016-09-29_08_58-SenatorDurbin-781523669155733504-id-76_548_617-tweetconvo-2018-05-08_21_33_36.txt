.@SenateGOP failed to address gun violence & immigration reform, and refused to bring bipartisan #CJreform to the floor.
The Senate failed its core constitutional responsibility of confirming or even considering the @SCOTUSnom.
The challenges facing America can’t wait another 6 weeks—they can’t wait until election day—they can’t wait until next year.
@JoyAnnReid but congress makes us wait and wait and wait. Cut their salaries and pensions
OMG.  we agree!
on which tweet?
re:  Congress.  Cut their salaries!
Funny, https://democrats.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2016-Senate-Calendar.jpg … I count 21+weeks of recess 2016. Sounds like McConnell has taken them into the shameless zone
Disgraceful.  Replace this irresponsible GOP congress whereever possible.
@JoyAnnReid Just tell them to stay home and don't bother coming back
Voters need to end this type of behavior!!! We don't pay Congress to go on vacation…!

Absolutely! Freeloaders. Gov'ment trough. @SenatorDurbin
I have never seen such lazy senators in a half century.
If intent was to harm PBO's 8 years, it back fired. @SenatorDurbin
True.
@JoyAnnReid It is disgusting and a slap in the face to hard working Americans
@dmcrane Maybe we need a NO WORK NO PAY clause in our Constitution as it relates to Congress.
@SpeakerRyan smh. Disgusting!
@universe2519 vote em all out, they r still collecting full salaries, we couldn't wrk like that!
what do you stand for? It's good that you all aren't doing more harm to our country. #JASTA
@yodaquoter Turf the Tax $$ Burners, move the country forward! Time 4 one party solidarity!VOTE
But retribution has to be at the ballot box. If people vote any of them back in they have only themselves to blame
@JoyAnnReid but yet they get paid for that
@cromgood when do they work and where can I find a job like this,more vacation less work #votethebumsout
Republicans are Grudge fucking the whole country they're fucking us over like we did something wrong to them
@babymoppet52
@universe2519   They're out campaigning !!!!!! or trying to salvage their jobs. #votethemallout.  #flipitdem.   #doyourjob
is this a chess move?
absolute disgrace. Congress just got back after 7 weeks to now have 6 more weeks off?!
@JoyAnnReid and anyone wonders why plp want to start all over again! It's congress that is f$&ked up!
WorkingBananas is From Springfield, IL.
You can come visit me and discuss Mental Health Services for adults during that time off!
vote them out ....
but you all will take your salaries, health care, retirement plan, and probably another huge raise, right?
Don't boo vote. Vote em all out!! #DoYourJob
Don't give #LEFTOVERGOP override victory then expect them to be responsible. Be an effective minority party. #RoarDontWhine
@NancyFrancine2 DC can go in a long-term vacation via smaller federal government. That would be a victory for Americans.
#BringemBack
@trueblueusa1 who sets the schedule for the Senate?
yeah I miss the days when Harry Reid passed budgets every year.
@JoyAnnReid And still they get paid for what -- taking a vacation?
Just one more reason we need to take back the Senate. House is hopeless this cycle but we can whittle it down some.
@JoyAnnReid
Every Democrat running should promise if they win majority they will limit number of Congressional vacation days
@JoyAnnReid It is little wonder they work so hard to get and keep these "jobs". Would that they spent some time DOING it
After all your votes for continuous war, I feel relieved you can't do more damage to the world during recess.
@JoyAnnReid Why are we paying them??  I don't get a certain amount of vacation. Lucky if I have 2 days.
@JoyAnnReid what are they getting paid for?
also taking my first week off in over a year and 1/2 don't ever want to hear a Republican Senator call someone lazy
if I did that I'd be fired
@JoyAnnReid 
SAVE AMERICA VOTE BLUE CONGRESS SENATE 

SAVE AMERICA VOTE BLUE CONGRESS SENATE
@JoyAnnReid we really need to cut their pay and benefits, mine would be!
@JoyAnnReid November is coming. . .
@ScottNevins who schedules and approves all of these "vacations"? There is work to do! How enfuriating.
@JoyAnnReid it's funny how the @GOP want this to be a change election but they all return to #congress.
@JoyAnnReid because in DC nothing is more important than a vacation day especially when you don't actually work for people
@ScottNevins so @SenateMajLdr gets paid to Purposely NOT work ? Why?
@JoyAnnReid Maybe we should pay them only when they actually do some work.
They can start confirmation on Hillary's SCOTUS pick next year.
Maybe you will have time to review the #mentalhealth budget @ #MemorialBehavioralHealth Spfld IL & get MEDICARE pts covered!
@JoyAnnReid not smart. Eventually they'll wish they had done d right thing. U must b right not just call yourself d right
@SpeakerRyan  #lyinRyan is an Obstructionist who should resign and disavow his White Supremist GOP nominee!
This is as big a ripoff of Americans as the banks and pharma. Headline: We want our money back!
@JoyAnnReid 
Pat them selves on the back? They achieved nothing.
so who of your fellow senators did you muster to stop this? I can't call or email any Senator/Congressman outside of NYC/CA.
I will not vote for any Democrat in Congress or Senate Good Job Life long Dem. till now
I want a job like that.
Why are these people being paid $175K a year?
@JoyAnnReid They think Trump will be president. VOTE BLUE ALL THE WAY AND DOWN BALLOTS
Ourageous. Please point to Rs as reason for WRONG TRACK numbers, HRC needs  D Senate and House! Let's go!
Why do they even get paid? People work harder doing volunteer work with no pay. What a bunch of leaches. #MSNBC
There should be claw backs of congressional salaries for non performance of duties.
@JoyAnnReid no surprise nothing gets done by these lazy ass'.
like between 03 and 07, when gop congress "worked" around 20 hrs a week. #FlipItFlipItBlue for America
This Do Nothing Congress is a disgrace to the American people. Watch what I DO in November. Watch me.
The failure of Democracy working for the people has led to DJT becoming the nationalistic champion for the unrepresented. SAD
how do 'working' folks get perks like that?! Is there no self esteem in DC.? Jeez... No wonder the citizens are upset!
and we the people are immensely frustrated because of it.
why don't you care that the Senate does not work for months at a time?
GOP gets paid to do nothing and they don't want Americans to get affordable healthcare ?
