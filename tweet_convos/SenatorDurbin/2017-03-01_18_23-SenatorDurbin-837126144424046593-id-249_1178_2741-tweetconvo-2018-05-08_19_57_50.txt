Sessions spoke twice in 2016 with Russian ambassador. He didn't disclose this at confirmation hearing to become AG. http://wapo.st/2lu7BFH 
Impeach Sessions for perjury now. Justice Department tainted. He is unfit. Filibuster Gorsuch until we get special prosecutor
thank you for calling out Sessions. At the very least he should recuse himself, truthfully he should resign.
.@SenatorDurbin I appreciate your thoughts, but @jeffsessions should #resign! If nothing to hide, then he should've disclosed all convos!
he must be removed and jailed.
How about he step down first. That would be a good start then finally investigate this Admin Russian ties finally.
yes Sessions needs to go. Lawd what a mess!
Every last one of them need to be investigated. Love how this news dropped the night after Trump gave his big ole speech.
yes and how our media gave him a pass on that speech. This is awful
He didn't drool or make fun of minorities, the handicapped or grab a woman by the crotch. The Repubs have set a very low bar.
yes they have SMDH
Recusal isn't enough. He needs to resign.
Recuse? Senate ASC no purview to meet with enemy power abt US military or weapons Either Logan Act violation or #treason
could it be ICE is finally doing there job?
Or resign.
yes!  And independent prosecutor and investigation into trump Russia!
Didn't you get caught lobbying IRS to probe conservative groups?
@sakinajaff AG Sessions must RESIGN and get fitted for an orange jumpsuit.
He must resign. He lied under oath. How can an AG be trustworthy in office if he lies under oath.
No, he must RESIGN or face impeachment. Perjury is a crime.
.....why don't you investigate Hillary's approval of the sale of uranium reserves to Russia!!!
Thank you!  Now  for those investigations ...
just retire u hack
whip is right.
Thank you for speaking out on this, and hopefully you can work together with @SenDuckworth to pressure session to step down.
what about a perjury investigation? you are towing a line, not representing the standpoint of your constituents.
No. No. No. Wrong. Wrong!  America's Top Cop must RESIGN! He LIED under oath!  This screams cover-up!  Do something!
who gave the orders to intercept flynns phone calls? Where did the info on sessions come from? Was obama giving the orders?
and I expect you will get me those answers
did you call for Lynch to recuse herself over Clinton when she met with bill???  You are a true hypocritical politician
ahem @SenDuckworth
don't forget @clairecmc
He needs to RESIGN
thank you, Senator Durbin, for once again standing up against collusion by many members of this new administration.
He should RESIGN.
@_metafizik @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi He is the highest law enforcement official, recusal won't work! He must resign!!
As a constituent, I think you meant to say Sessions must RESIGN.
Dearest Tommy: Slowly repeat this statement to yourself 17 times: There's absolutely no chance #Sessions resigns.
He must RESIGN!
I believe you need to step down. You have repeatedly wasted American tax dollars with your BS. We're on 2 ur motives.
He must RESIGN, Senator. He lied to Congress.
Hold him accountable!
seriously, you guys keep misspelling resign!
Sessions: 1) Share notes of meeting with Russ Amb. (someone DID take notes, right?) 2) Give names of other people there.
He must resign and answer for perjury.
no he does not he needs to investigate all the mass murders in Chicago and why you do nothing abt it
if he does, it won't be because of you.
@sodylansays please call for his resignation
How about all Democrats recuse themselves for calling for our President to be impeached. #disgraceful
No-he needs to resign - perjury is a crime - do not stop yelling abt this until he resigns
If Dems used the same standards that they are using on themselves there would be none left to bitch & lie.
Please investigate.
good ole turbin durbin
Sessions lied under oath. He lied!! Simple!
You're such a TOOL! Liberals taking it out of content, no surprise! He was asked about CAMPAIGN, not as a Senator!
Is it a conflict of interest? Didn't think so.
#DemocratLunatics

Why are we talking Recusal and not Resignation?
I ask that you demand he resign. We can't afford for lawmakers to be liars. Sessions must be investigated after he quits.
The people trust Sessions & Trump. Dem whine is made from sour grapes. @blackrepublican
thank you!
Sessions is going to stay AG. The only one going anywhere is the Demobrat party. Going straight to obscurity.
It is the appropriate thing to do. He's in a HOT MESS. Let's see how the WH spins this. @amyklobuchar @alfranken
recusal is NOT enough. Remove Sessions. And then remove Trump. Anything less from u Dems & I vote for your removal too.
twice that we are aware of
Lied under oath! He must go!
Thank you for speaking out. How about #FireSessions ?
do Republicans Donald Trump they have Russia do something with this campaign that helped them win I don't know what it was
Forget recusing--how about Sessions resigning for perjury? Have a backbone @DNC #resist @SenDuckworth @senatorsanders
@jeffsessions This is just another way that the Dems are causing trouble. Durbin, your party lost the election. Get over it!!
y didnt the former ag resign when she clearly steppd into wat she did? huh durb?
.@SenatorDurbin He needs to follow #Flynn right out the door! Then, let's get the rest of the story of @POTUS knowing it all along. @CNN
Senator I believe you meant "must face criminal charges"?? #DoYourJob
@Rain7777 Sessions needs to resign it's about time he answers to his long career of flouting the very laws he is to protect
damn right!!! 
how many times did you talk to foreign govt officials as senator? Stop acting a spoiled child.
Recuse? RESIGN.
RESIGN is the word
Important, met with "top spy recruiter"
Evan Perez just said it on CNN, so I suppose I can here: Kislyak wasn't just ambassador, he was Russia's "top spy recruiter" in D.C.: SVR.
Please join your fellow Senators in calling for his resignation. He cannot be trusted as Attorney General.
Way worse than that now. Resign and replace.
.@SenatorDurbin so can we get those impeachment docs started up like pronto? Do we need like a @kickstarter or @gofundme or something?
@JulieAnnSilver he should resign as well
@2020VoteHillary 
SESSIONS MUST RESIGN! HE LIED, UNDER OATH! DONNY'S HOUSE OF CARDS ARE FALLING!
LYING POS TRAITORS!
@2020VoteHillary Maybe he should just resign and take his racist ass home.
YOU MUST DEMAND HE LEAVE OFFICE.
Please Sen Durban do something about this. Everyday there's a new lie. We deserve better this!
Thank you, @SenatorDurbin, he must recuse himself for sureâ€”but he should go beyond that and resign.
And I wonder how many Russia Ambassadors have you spoken with Mr Durbin as a Senator?
No, he needs to resign. This issue would be referred to his office and he can't investigate himself.
Never going to happen. Accountability does not apply to Republicans.
- what you meant, Senator, is:  AG Sessions must resign, as it is clear he, at best, lied & at worst, committed perjury.
How about we call for his RESIGNATION? You go for it, Senator. #ChicagoDemocrat
I think you mean he needs to resign. #firesessions
He lied under fucking oath . just like pruitt did.  jail these scumbags #MAGA #persist #resist #TheResistance
Ryan and McConnell need to be investigated for collusion, too! #russiagate
No Senator, he must RESIGN IMMEDIATELY! No more confirmations or appointments from this administration #russiagate
#SessionsMustResign @PrincessBravato
Recusing himself is not enough. Attorney General #JeffSessions needs to resign. #perjury #russiagate #treason
We Illinoisans are counting on you to vigorously pursue the connections between the Trump admin and Russia.
@Vcondley2 @washingtonpost Resign, not recuse!
@AtsukoNatsume jail him
He lied under oath. He needs to go to jail.
@CynthiaBuckwalt I just want to know when can my family go out & start dying for the lies my brother made it back from Iraq

@CynthiaBuckwalt WHAT!!! Give him a medal of valor! he sold out the country and lied about it he's a hero. This makes me sick
@Millennial_Dems If he doesn't, then what? Hope Dems have a plan.
He perjured himself, he should resign.

@SenatorDurbin @LauraMiers
YES
@AltUSPressSec He just resign. He lied under oath.  No spin will change that. Roll tape.
Recusing's too good for him. He should resign and prepare to testify.

He needs to resign.
@washingtonpost @gregpmiller he needs to resign and we need an independent investigator
You need to be calling for his resignation, Senator.

@washingtonpost That a boy Dick!!!! Now tell your buddies to join ya!!!
@ednight23 Senator, Sessions must be arrested.@POTUS44 @sethmeyers
um..weak! Resign.
@GlobeKPD Hillary met with the Chinese! You frauds
no he must be indicted for perjury as any other officials would
Recusal is not enough. Special independent 9-11 commission is needed.
@ShaunKing @jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump Sessions must RESIGN. Never shud've been confirmed but now needs to resign.
can #congress order that 2016 intelligence be preserved? I can see a scenario where Trump and Bannon might loose things.
He lied to congress...DISBARMENT!
@AltUSPressSec No, he must RESIGN! #PERJURY #TREASON #COMPROMISED
@ShaunKing senator! He must resign!
He must resign. Immediately. All future appointments need to be halted. This is a problem. @realDonaldTrump
@ShaunKing recuse my ass! HE MUST RESIGN!
@ShaunKing now now now Sen.  Ukraine yourself, don't go Russian to conclusions 45 is sure to be Putin up an explanation soon
@Millennial_Dems recuse? Fuck day he needs to resign he's a traitor! We used to execute traitors! Lock him up
more than that.
@ShaunKing why are you not calling for his resignation?
@jackhutton @washingtonpost @gregpmiller #Sessions committed perjury. He needs 2 resign. #FBI knew he was lying, Comey AGAIN.
@TuesdaysToomey He needs to resign.
@ShaunKing Too late. He perjured himself. Fool me once ...  #SessionsLied #TrumpRussia #GOPSilence
Dear Senator Durbin, I am a constituent. Please call for Sessions to resign immediately.
Please join other Senators and demand resignation.
It looks like you misspelled resign.
@ShaunKing you can do more than that, Dick.
@ShaunKing don't you mean resign?
AG Sessions must RESIGN.
How about go to jail?
Thanks Senator Durbin
He needs to just step down and vacate his position. But that wont happen either.
Recuse?? Bonehead needs too resign...#DoneSon
Hey Little Dicky, didn't Eric Holder lead investigation of his own dept. U were ok with that. Ever heard the word: hypocrite?
@ShaunKing he needs to resign
No, he needs to go. He lied under oath.
recuse, hell the lying Russian sob needs to resign
He needs to #resign. Perjury under oath before Congress is a criminal offense.
@ShaunKing @washingtonpost yes, don't back down
@ShaunKing you mean he lied and committed perjury?
He perjured sir. That's a felony. Of course he must recuse himself, but he also must at the very least resign.
Thank you. We ask you to go a step further. Lied under oath--he must resign. EVERY DAY, please push independent investigation
@ShaunKing just going to pass like all the other stuff. So sad
@ShaunKing he must be impeached
The great lawkeeper, Dick?  Retire!  You are not wanted!
@washingtonpost He lied to Congress, twice. He must resign. Full investigation by independent committee & special prosecutor
More like quit or be fired.
@SenDuckworth @RepSchneider thoughts on resignation? Appears He needs to go.
@SenDuckworth How shameful to be called out by @POTUS on your poor performance in failing to manage Chicago's problems.
He must also suffer the consequences of perjuring himself before Congress. Or is that not a thing anymore?
He must resign!!!
@textifyer59 case that he just showed his hand on. He needs to go. All of this non-lethal ethnic cleansing needs to END.
Just a guess, but I give him less than 24 hours. If he stays, he is a major liability. Big ball starting to roll.
I hope so but MSNBC is making it sound doubtful.
The more they stonewall, the deeper the hole. Let them all twist in the wind, as Nixon would say.
@textifyer59 Better yet he should resign. He should never have been confirmed in the first place. Look at The Texas voter ID
he should resign - he lied
Sessions should be prosecuted for perjury and treason! What happened to truth and decency in the US?
He lied to the Senate under oath; it's on tape. That's perjury and he should step down. Keep after them!
Senator Flynn lied to pence and resigned! Sessions perjured himself!!! Resignation is the only answer!
@SupermanHotMale Here, we call it #TrumpRussia #russiagate one in same. #semantics @SenatorDurbin
and step down, he lied during his confirmation hearings
I'm with you, but who is going to investigate when Congress is letting Trump dodge all allegations?
@jeffsessions gettin' pretty stanky around here.
he needs to step down completely
He lied to the Committee. He must step down or be fired by 45
RESIGN not recuse
Sessions lied during his confirmation hearing. He MUST be removed from office.
No, he must resign. He LIED.
Wasn't it Parasailing? He looked really happy!
@washingtonpost @gregpmiller Yes he needs to AT LEAST recuse himself re Russia. If minor why did he lie about it?
Forget recuse; time to call for resignation.  It's time for the dominoes to fall
Sessions has been working with Frump for years on this.. Hacks, blackmail, Repubs , Trump . incoming   boom
Keep pushing for an independent investigation! Thank you for standing up to Trump.
Heard u on @NPR today. I like the idea of an independent investigation w/people like Colin Powell & Sandra OConnor on it.
Washington Post is the epitome of fake news.

I find it amusing that liberal democrats are calling conservatives babies, in spite of themselves being babies.
"I know you are but what am I" went out in third grade.
