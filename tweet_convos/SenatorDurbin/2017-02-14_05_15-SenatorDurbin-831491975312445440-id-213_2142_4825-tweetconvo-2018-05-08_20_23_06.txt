This is overdue! Stop talking about it and do it!
I agree. This could be in addition to US Senate & House investigations. AG Sessions campaigned heavily with Trump.
now if we could only get your resignation.....
retire please
We the people demand a full investigation into #Flynnghazi Now!
@LindseyGrahamSC
@SenJohnMcCain
The only thing Flynn's resignation proves is the need for an independent investigation of the Trump camp's dealings with Russia. Now.
Exactly. Flynn is just the fall guy.
@MarkRuffalo do the job that they were elected to instead of finding a reason to malign bash and harass the president...
nope. What it proves is that Obama and your whiney crybaby progressives are intentionally violating the law to spill secrets.
Stand with you 100%.
@GammaRae206
He wins 'douchiest shithole I've seen on @FoxNews' today-which has a VERY large field of contestants!
crickets from @jasoninthehouse
chris, would you let a murderer decide on the length of his sentence,
Please continue the fight against corruption. I'm too old to learn Russian.#resist #Flynnghazi #impeachTrumpnow
Fine.  He/She also investigates DNC and HRC meeting w/ Ukraine in their embassy to sabotage Trump. 
result Manaford lie
Act not criminal or punishable. The REAL question is LEAK of information to MEDIA from Nat'l Security.DEMS not interested in
So why lie to Pence about it if Flynn did nothing wrong?  Make sense to you?
the ninth circuit court is the swamp and those judges have to go and so do you quite frankly
@MarkRuffalo at every turn. Get on with the business of this country!!!!
Trumps taxes must be subpoenaed IMMEDIATELY.
The 1980's are calling, they want their foreign policy back.
does @SpeakerRyan understand this
With all due respect, that would make Pence our president. Seriously - you think that would be better?
@MarkRuffalo really do we need another investigation? The guy is gone. Why don't the members of the House and the Senate
do not let this go unchecked. Your constituents won't tolerate it. I won't.
Agreed, Senator. Lead the way.
Investigate Russian dealings with WH NOW!
Please keep pushing the investigation forward.
something to sink your teeth into Senator!
@debv219  I Agree!
And goes without saying that you will lead this push for a full investigation. Thank you, Senator.
Please make it happen
@MaleOutrage YES! And the fact that Congress hadn't long ago made this their single-minded priority is ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE
It is beyond incompetence or even benign negligence. It is a malignant treachery; arguably outright treason!

@MarkRuffalo  Another Democratic senator wakes up! What will you do when the Republicans refuse? What's Plan B?
the main thing it proves our government is spying on #Americans then leaking to press #Obama administration #democrats lied
Please keep us updated on the progress of this swift and thorough investigation!
Do it, stop talking about it and get this moving! Your constituents demand it. We're watching, we will remember.
Thank you for your leadership, Senator!
I totally agree, Senator.
DO IT!!
Thank you! This is exactly right. Critical to pursue this to the end
REALLY?   DEMS START DOING YOUR JOB. GET TRUMP OUT OF WHITE HOUSE ASAP
@SenDuckworth When will you stop with the #Obstruction tactics and finally get to work on moving this country forward?
isnt there more money you can waste in IL? #shutitdurbin
GOP isn't going to let this happen. So what now? Quo Vadis?
get'em!!!!!!
Why is the only reason Trump fired him because he lied you PENCE, not that he lied to Donald? Why is Manafort still at TT?
Pls work with @SpeakerRyan & others for independent review of Russia's influence #nopoliticsjustfacts
Make Chaffetz grow a pair!
Please keep on them along with @SenDuckworth. This fish stinks from the head! #ImpeachTrump

Please help make this happen!
Bravo Senator Durbin. So many Americans agree with you.
Can't we just pretend to be upset and move on?
Yes sir! Thank you for being a true voice for us!
Please investigate Sen Durbin!
Tell us what to do, we're ready. Time is NOW due to nature of Russian interference. Can't wait, our country in jeopardy.
Thank you!!! How do we force this? What laws protect American people if congress is under control of criminals?
at what point it is treason.he asked Russians to interfere in election, they did, now this?

Lead, leadership, grab the mantle Senator, step up, action, lead, leadership.
Yes! Make it happen. We're counting on you!
YES.  Please keep up the heat.
thank you now how does that happen. @TheDemocrats I suggest the people we put in office need to make it happen
@zacyoga Yes! Now!
I spoke with a wonderful man in your office who assured me you won't let this go.
Yes. Make sure to do this. We deserve to know.
Cute!  An independent investigation of many in your party would yield much more corruption
We need an independent investigation in Clinton foundation 2 find out what Hillary sold 4 donations.
yes, yes, yes!
Yes! You & other Dems have to fight for this. @SenatorDurbin @AprilDelRario
maybe the most hypocritical post by the most hypocritical politician ever.
I'm glad you feel this way. Saves me a phone call to you.
@PatriciaMaroney Sessions is part of this plot.  Keep him away PLEASE!!!
@MarkRuffalo 
Start with taxes. Americans deserve to know how twisted mess is or isn't. 
This is a National Security matter.
Agreed. Please get the Senate on that. Now.
@UpNorth62 Tell that to traitor @jasoninthehouse
@markos Please keep working toward investigation. Trump knew! Trump asked Flynn, he didn't do it on his own. Keep on Flynn.
stop saying trump, start saying trump/pence and the republican ticket. this affected downticket races too.
Agreed. How can we, as constituents, help make this happen?
enough pay-to-play politics. Just look at the list.
Thanks Senator Dad
@KingDivine315 Wrong. It proves that the @TheDemocrats keep trying to win, though clearly it's just not possible!
That would require some real principle being shown by Republicans and there doesn't seem to be signs of that any time soon.
keep up the pressure, we need to know all the facts.
seriously!!!!! DEEP THROAT HIM, DICK
@LizWill99 check Chaffetz reply to that question he refuses and excuses .we need him accountable to do his job or resign
please call for a bipartisan investigation. This can not be one man's decision!

@Evilgenius68
#ChickenLittle
How come every time a republican speaks in a senate hearing they Mumble off of a sheet of paper? #sayitlikeyoumeanit
yes, and do not forget DT = Republicans. All the outrage over emails and no response to Russia influence? #FlynnResignation
thank you!  PLEASE do not let this slide..we are counting on you and fellow Democrats!
@janschakowsky @SenDuckworth DO IT!!
Spot on, Senator. Don't let the Republicans sweep this under the ruf. It is NOT time to move on. @SenDuckworth
@Franield DEMS have so much on GOP's TREASONOUS ACTS but we let them ride.Investigate EC! CrossCheck!GOP DENYING DEMS/POC RTV
@joncoopertweets. Sen Durbin, "Trump camp"= "GOP"
yes!  Keep pushing..
RIGHT NOW!
The @GOP Party over Country party does not care about this Russia stuff. They won and that's enough for them.
Where is our Howard Baker & Sam Irvin? "Sermon on the Hill" needed now!
1. "If these allegations prove to be true, what they were seeking to steal was not the jewels, money or other property
2.of American citizens, but something much more valuableâ€”their most precious heritage, the right to vote in a free election."
Right after the VOTER FRAUD investigation-right Dick?
I fully support this, but DO WE REALLY NEED IT? US 65+ MILLION KNOW HE'S A TRAITOR!!!
True!
Keep pushing for this loudly and relentlessly.
Who in President Obama's NSA leaked this information to the press? Is this the proper roll for nsa
Yes, please.
YES! As your constituent & a patriot please push to make this happen! #russianhacking #flynninvestigation #dumptrump
@wingsimplied Make it happen
@MarkRuffalo @SenateDems #investigatetrump
What's the motivation for the GOP to upset the apple cart? It's not fair to think they should put country over personal gain.
@MarkRuffalo agreed. What else does White House not disclosed.. thorough investigation Needed on Russian connection and link
yes!
.@SenatorDurbin @MarkRuffalo No.  it proves that if you lie to the VPOTUS and PS there are consequences.
That AND the value of a free press
@potus this must be investigated!
You better get Comey out of the way if you want the truth.
@MarkRuffalo Bye Flynnicia!! 
Please get rid of @POTUS before he ruins our country.
Lean in HEAVY on this otherwise its dangerous indifference. Defend now our democratic republic
Thank you for not letting this go. Would be nice is @RepKinzinger would work with you.
Yes do it!
Your congress just blocked a request for the tax returns. So good luck with that.
Yes, what did trump know and when did he know it.
Really? People have been saying that for months.
Do what you and @SenDuckworth can do to get this started!  #WeAreWithYou
get it moving. You have the power of your office
Please make it happen. I am one of your constituents. #ImpeachTrump
impeach.  Let Pence run the show.
hell no. He's even guiltier than Flynn
oh I don't like the guy, but at least he's mentally stable.   

We're not gonna get both of them out of the WH.
@tedcruz @JohnCornyn Do you agree with @SenatorDurbin ?
This is the most urgent issue at hand, along with gerrymandering.  Please make the investigations happen!
do something for the American people instead of your partisan Bullshit. You know the russian thing is a lie. Prosecut Hillary
Stop slow walking the Cabinet appointments so we can have a functioning government.
spot on, Senator.
Yes Sir, Senator!
the uk today unveils new cyber security outfit! the us is talking about maybe investigating cia and fbi facts?
senator - time to take trump down.  He has no place anywhere near the White House. He's a treasonous liar
Thank you! 
please get on it!
GET IT DONE SIR.  Kick @SenSchumer to the curb and take the party to the winner's circle.  We need your leadership NOW.
They all knew.  @VP @POTUS
The whole point of a fall guy is to protect the ones who are actually guilty.
@damonbethea1 ABSOLUTELY. Thank you, Senator Durbin!
Thank you!
I called your office yesterday to give you a high-five for continuing to push this. What can we do to help expedite?
It isn't the *only thing. There needs to be action now..start today!
Make it happen! Be the first to show you have any balls beyond Sally Yates. She did her job, please do yours!
how does this help the American people. Choose your battles and help fix the country by reaching across the aisle.  #CommonSense
"Dick" is a seditionist who didnt serve his nation point1. bho/dems were silent on russian hacking pre 11/8/ why
@Zac_Petkanas 
And fully vetting these appointments!
@SenSchumer @SenGillibrand agreed. NOW. thank you!
Thank you!!
Agreed, Senator. Please fight to make this happen!
this needs to happen! Manafort, Page & Flynn. scary! These connections to Russia can't  be a coincidence! Press investigation
how do you still have a job Turbin Durbin
Sir, with due respect. First, we need a comprehensive investigation of Russian interference/funding in our news outlets. 1/2
Flynn case is yet another example of executives across the entire news media industry making awful decisions en masse. 2/2
Now!
Please call for it on the floor of the Senate!  These people need to be held to account for their actions.
Independent investigation? That's why they fired Yates. She sent the warning of the breach with Flynn.
I couldn't agree more. Who in the Senate are you working with to ensure this takes place?
What steps are necessary to make this happen?
Thank you!
What can we do Senator?  I live in your state.
please make this happen.
Liberal Loser
yes! Keep up the pressure!
lol....this putz lacks the votes to do anything more than whine with 47 irrelevant impotent babies.
Agreed!!! We must start this investigation, now!
