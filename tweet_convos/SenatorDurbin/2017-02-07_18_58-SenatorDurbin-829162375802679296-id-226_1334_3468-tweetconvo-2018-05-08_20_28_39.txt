Because it's all lies.
or it's not.
Yes, actually it is.  Sessions was prosecuting actual voter fraud, not motivated by race.
but facts are hard. So I will go with #alternativefacts
No, actually facts are easy.  This is all made up BS because Sessions was a white man in Alabama.
He still is....
I know, I'm referring to the 1985 Alabama Three trial.  Sorry if I was unclear.
Ohh! That's one I need to research. Thanks for the tip.
@christe4 

And worse yet 3 MALE senators read Mrs. Kings letter & not one interruption 

What year is this??
The GOP are hell bent to make women property again. We know too much to go back and pretend.
No offense, but why is Sen Warren doing all the heavy lifting here?
#CensureMcConnell for attack on @SenWarren
U FAKE! how dare u when Warren has lied & committed crimes when she claimed Native Indian for professional gain!
It's not disappointing - it's horrifying. It's not America. This is not democracy. I expect this of Trump. Not of US Senate
I think everyone needs to take a step back, Harry Reid started this all
This was not one senator knocking another. This was a letter written by a non-senator. Part of historic record as it were.
Sessions was prosecuting voter fraud, not motivated by race.  Eloquence in the written word is not the equivalent of truth.
@SenateDems 
The American people are watching @TheDemocrats disgraceful behavior, this is why you lost!!
This looks like counter obstruction to me. Fight it so the GOP don't silence progressive speech.
When truth comes to light, #GOP find a way to silence it. Enjoy it now as they have to be voted on again, NOT!!
You hypocrite. Total disdain for you. Strom Thurmond anti #CivilRightsMovement activist. 
@SenatorTester 

@realDonaldTrump
Why do you want open borders??? What possible reason would it be good for this country??
@Carmenr1Carmen It is more than disappointing. It is disturbing.
Read the letter, Senator.  Don't let them silence the truth.
@svdavis56 do you have more people following you than Trump has following him?
I wish EVERY Democrat would read the letter. That would make quite the point!
Tell us that joke again about "A Lincoln was a Jew because he was shot in the temple" you dolt.
what's worse is you di not listen to your living constituent
NO on Sessions!
hypocrisy abounds.  Rules are only rules when it applies to repubs, eh?  R u dumd, a liar and a hypocrite?
You fool no one as your Party of drowning rats implodes! 2018 will be here before you know it!  DemExit18
throwback to the Quincy Adams 1836 gag rule?Silence petitions against abolition of slavery? McConnell knows this history..
will you please read her letter?
or make it your cell phone ringtone and forget to put it on silent
... omg
disappointing you are still a senator #termlimits
Is acting like a typical Liberal liar and hand picking the parts he wants you to hear...Typical Scum Bag Liberals
It is MORE than disappointing--FIGHT, dammit--we need you to push or break the rules--our country is threatened from within
then don't forget to read the letter she wrote that refugees or harmful to America
When the deranged, screeching, far-left Pocahontas is wrong, she is wrong.
#readtheletter   Pick up the baton from @elizabethforma
With all due respect, you've been there so long stop being part of the problem. Rule 19! Stop this political mess!
@senatorduckworth You two have been disappointing. Oh how the tide is turning! @POTUS #MAGA

stop dividing. You're part of this with your fake outrage.
@SenateDems your just an obstructionist & should not be an illinois senator   You embarrass the constitution
.   Your party should be proud of cry baby Shumer, airhead Polosi, Pocahantas Warren, and Maxine Waters.
@marieann66 GOP Senate Unfit to Govern!
All the Senators should stand up and read CSK's letter.
They don't care what is right its called a big pay off...these are sad times. I feel like I'm in a time warp.
U manipulate words of peo in history to your advantage when needed & expect peo to still respect u - DISGUSTING!
agree with others - pick up and continue reading it!
Just remove them from their seat
@SenateDems Keep on shining the light! WE are here with you.
It's disappointing that you gave B Clinton a standing ovation when he talked about the same thing Pres Trump is doing. MAGA
Then invoke #Rule19 on the Republicans! Either EVERYONE talks or NO ONE talks
WHEN IS SOMEONE GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP THIS MAN? Disappointing? It's beyond tragic.
Mitch McConnell is vile. Makes the Senate look racist.
what are you and the rest of the dems going to do? This demands action not words, ACTION!!!
as uncle Joe said ...."It's Over" !!!!!!!
They keep going lower and lower, finding every sleazy way to advance their agenda.  They don't even pretend to care about us
please help her. Help us. Illinois is a fucking joke right now, you have a seat to help us and the US. Please say something.
It's not disappointing, it's shameful. I'm glad@@SenJeffMerkley read the letter on the Senate floor.
@SenateDems In the context of Sen Warren's intervention Sessions was a cabinet nominee, coincidentally a Senator.
How the hell do you nominate someone, then prohibit debaters from saying anything bad about them?
@SenateDems With all due respect, Senator, it's far worse than disappointing. It's a terrifying abuse of senatorial mores.
@SenateDems So after he becomes Atty. Gen, I'm glad to know most of you have no problem with going into the past.  U R vile!
@SenateDems So here we go again. Never heal..just accuse people to be racist again. I know u have no problem w the past!
More concerned HEARING SenSessions called racist vs concerned that SenSessions was/is racist. Shameful @SenateGOP #NoSessions
I think you're looking for disgusting or disgraceful (or typical), not disappointing. Don't mince words.
what's disappointing is that you can't just simply praise her words without having to mention that toxic 3 letter sequence.
Please use your time on the floor to read #CorettaScottKing's letter! #Persist #LetLizSpeak
@SenateDems  All senators should read the letter on the floor together. Let her speak!
What happened to Sen. Warren tonight is censorship. Its disgusting. Sessions does not deserve to be AG. He's unfit.
#letlizspeak
,thank you for all you have tried to do. Do they understand how angry and desperate people feel? #resist
Can anything be done via denial of freedom of speech?
@MickMcNicholas Coretta S.King's words are too powerful! McConnell afraid it might influence those R Senators with integrity!
He doesn't work for Illinois at all.  Just to maintain his power.  Kids on heroin in Illinois. People leaving in droves.
@PilarMarrero oh please, stop showing your ignorance.
He can't read it himself, he'd be asked to sit down also.  Warren is oblivious.
Trick Turban had planned it to seem like oppression against an MLK family member who are esteemed.  Another slimy move.
you and your people shouldn't talk about crying..that's all you do.
. She 'imputed' Jeff Sessions' character by reading  it which is against the rules.  One Senator can't do this to another.
There are rules.  Rules are to be followed.  Fauxcahontas doesn't understand that.  Jeff Sessions up next!
@SenateDems disappointing Senator? That's putting it VERY mildly. It is outrageous, disgusting, sexist, shall I go on?
It's censorship. U & all other Dems need to step up & read King's letter. We r watching.
#letlizspeak
To put it very mildly.
read the letter, pick up where Warren got cut off. #letlizspeak
@SenWarren **STOPSESSIONS**
you need to fight fire with fire. our democracy depends on it. buck up.
she accused another senator of being racist is that how you play the game? You're a lowlife and this state is a disaster
, Good thing it's a matter of public record!
@CoryBooker 
Dick, check out Alveda King @AlvedaCKing, she speaks in the spirit of Reverend MLK!
Tell meSheDoesn't! @DNCWomen
Will you be voting NO to Sessions?
Why don't you read some @alvedaking and watch Senate Democrats cringe?
@SenateDems Democrats think their above the rules  just like they think they're above the law.
kind of like how Durbin can't listen to taxpayers from Illinois complaining about Madigan(s).
@SenateDems 
PICK UP WHERE SHE LEFT OFF!  WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU TO FIGHT FOR US AND YOUâ€™RE CAVING IN!
CRAYONS HERE CRAYONS, GET UR CRAYONS
But the public will hear them even louder.
if you are going to do truths, first make sure they aren't half-truths.  The Democratic Party no longer relevant.
@SenateDems Agreed. Either way, we are all seeing the letter now!
@SenDuckworth, Will each of you please read Correta Scott King's letter? #letlizspeak #democracy #BlackHistoryMonth
please read Coretta Scott King's letter on the senate floor
2016 was a real disappointment for you.
they might learn something aside from KKK propaganda.
@SenateDems please do something!!!  This is horrible I am afraid of what is going to happen.
They have no moral compass
Do you ever say anything worthwhile, Dick?
shows just what your dealing with in class. Mitchy has none.
@SenateDems ... the truth hurts , they heard this about Sessions years ago and don't want it on record, again.
It's disappointing that you can't stop crying period.
Each of you should be reading it into the record
Especially during #BlackHistoryMonth  Next elex should be very interesting.
You Dems have gotten so nasty you can't even treat long time colleagues either respect. Dems will pay a high price
vote against Sessions
@SenateDems Warren was way out of line just like u were in ur crybaby speech today. So full of lies.
the tide will turn. It may take awhile to undo this mess repubs are creating. But it will turn.
with that being said THANK YOU to the only two Senate Republicans and all the Senate Dems who voted NO on Devos.
Senator maybe every single Democrat should take their turn reading the letter.
pick up where she left off! Hold them accountable.
You, and every Dem senator, please read Coretta Scott King's letter.  #LetLizSpeak #NoSessions
Just disappointing? Heinous, disgusting, horrific, asinine, stupidity of the highest order? EXTREME OUTRAGE is needed!
only Racist Senators object to her words
@SenateDems Disappointing is getting vanilla instead of chocolate ice cream. This is outrageous & unconscionable. For shame!!
@SenateDems disappointing? That's the strongest word you can find for that??
sorry you and the Dems keep getting played. Thanks for standing up. Maybe dems should get those Hollywood elites to buy votes
Every one of you get up and start reading the same thing.  Let them try to silence everyone!
During Black History Month no less. Shameful.
@SenateDems Yes, #CorettaScottKing deserved better--as did @SenWarren
@SenateDems every Dem needs to get on that damn floor and start reading that letter
@SenateDems It's unbelievable and frightening.
thank you senator - please keep fighting and resisting.
GOP could use Senate rule barring any negative thing said about Sessions. It's rigged! #LetLizSpeak #LetHerSpeak
@SenateDems so change the rules of the Senate!
@SenateDems what on earth could a letter written in 1986 have to with Sen Sessions in 2017?
@SenateDems  we are losing our democracy quickly. No more checks and balances.
Democrats had hours and hours of speech time. Don't add lying to your embarrassing lost.
@SenateDems The Republican agenda run opposite of rights, equality and freedom.
@SoFlaSportsFan disappointing?  Outrageous might be a better word. Disgraceful? UnAmerican?
Fittingly, this is turtle McConnell's homage to Black History Month.  #DieOffQuicklyAndQuietlyOldWhiteMen
I guess that's a diplomatic way to say it..such a disgrace for America...
So why not continue reading? Show solidarity and show us you have the nerve to represent us. #LetLizSpeak
He is a blabbering bafoon
@SenateDems Senator you know damn well that's not what was happening find your integrity start acting like a man
So pick up and start reading where Sen Warren left off.
Nice dunce hat
thank you!!
@SenateDems it's sad you have a whole state crying foul and you ignore us!!! #DTS #VOTEYOUOUT
read the letter with every Democratic Senator! Make Mitch use rule 19 all night! #LetLizSpeak
@SenateDems disappointing is a bit of an understatement don't you think?
@DavidKoechner 
YOU START READING IT, @SenatorDurbin !!!!
We people got vote bigots. ass Republican out. 2018
Beyond disappointing. Stifling debate, and doing so by refusing to hear Coretta Scott King's words , is horrifying.
@SenateDems FIGHT THEM LIKE THEY FIGHT YOU! Stop capitulating #DemsGetTough #ResistTrump
@SenateDems you know damn well that isn't why they want her to stop talking. Stop spreading this overblown narrative.
They don't want to hear her words, so now EVERYONE will:
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/2/7/1631034/-GOP-Bill-to-Eliminate-the-Department-of-Education â€¦
READ IT!!!!!!!!!
don't break the rules. Respect the Senate and senators.
@SenateDems I agree and remember to stand pat on all issues. Resistance is important.
@SenateDems Because this is racist America now. #resist
@SenateDems All Senator Dems should pick up reading the letter from where Sen. Warren was cut off. #letlizspeak
@SenateDems Really bad optics!
@SenateDems You read it
heartbreaking.  Thank you senator for speaking out against this
@SenateDems Well their dear leader can't watch SNL without crying so it starts at the top.
I call foul against the Republican's on their low-life choices 4 cabinet. In lieu of standing up w/info they close doors&run.
you should try to read the speech along with other senators every g-damn day @sanbou978
Where are the rest of the Senate Dems?  Why won't every single one of you read the letter.
you need to read the letter pick up where she left off
stop playing games. #CommonSense
