I’ve been getting tons of emails & letters from Illinoisans, sharing how ACA has helped them & asking me to oppose the GOP repeal effort
I oppose the GOP repeal effort & I’m fighting every day to stop them!
Healthcare is a responsibility of a well ordered society, not just for "millions" but for all. Support single payer healthcare.
Who would the single payer be?
George Soros, who has already funded on-demand themed protests, has expressed interest but we are still accepting applications
The Republican Senate is hiding the big  insurance companies money in their pocket
Most GOP are no longer Congressman 
They are elected lobbyist's 
Who avoid their constituents but bow to corporations
That makes no sense.
What doesn't make sense?
Obama and the Dems are the party that mandated we pay corporations before we got any care. How is the GOP in corps pockets?
For the record I don't belong to either party.
GOP congressional members like Paul Ryan and Peter Roskum fail to hold town halls or even speak with their constituents
But they have no problem hosting companies for fundrasing. They are lobbyists.
What's the GOP hiding?? I don't recall @SecPriceMD saying we have to pass the bill to see what's in it. Just saying...

Got a Democratic Senator? Here’s how they can ACTUALLY PLAY HARDBALL on TrumpCare. Yes, they have tools to use. Yes, they can win. 1/
Start campaigning that a NO VOTE is necessary without knowing what's in the bill. @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr
What do they have to hide? So ridiculous.
#ElectedLobbyists
Price has a severe case of both willful ignorance and culpable deniability. "Here, take these pills, and don't call me again." - "Dr." Price
Nothing compared to what Obamacare had and was passed by Democrats without reading!"Republicans shut out
 Karma Sen Durbin?
Holy cow @SecPriceMD hasn't even SEEN #trumpcare legislation & isn't part of the process.
@SenateGOP if you're proud of it show it off.
The Mitch McConnell GOP is radically breaking from protocol, I am not surprised that they are hiding the AHCA Bill. Remember how Gorsuch got
got into the Supreme Court by eliminating the filibuster. So, it only followed suit  having the majority vote, he would pull this action.
Mitch McConnell for 8 years 5 months  has been eroding convention, and has been allowed to get away with it.  Follow the money.
We need to have hearings and public debate on ACHA #showusthebill
Over 100 hearings on the ACA.  None here.  #TheResistance
Maybe @SecPriceMD should promise we can keep our doctors and plans. Wait... It's been done?
Must pull every "trick" out to stop, stall, sideline this AHCA.
It's so top secret that even #HealthSecretary has no idea what's in it.
You guys did it don't you remember , that's why it's so screwed up. Do you recall the words of Senator Pelosi ? Wow
What a shame congress has turned out to be, why are they playing with people's lives? Healthcare is life or death for a lot of people.#shame
The situation just doesn't seem to improve. That is quite frustrating.
You are our last line of defense against Trumpcare. As a constituent, I implore you to vote against it. #SavetheACA
@SenateMajLdr @senrobportman @PatToomey @JohnCornyn @SenJohnThune @SenJohnBarrasso @SenAlexander @SenatorEnzi @SenMikeLee @senorrinhatch
It's all in the dark! Screw the people!
Why not? Do your homework.
The GOP Senators have insurance & pharma lobbyists locked up in that backroom. They're hammering out the details for their version of AHCA.
We need to c the bill
but "it's great"??
this is an abomination of the legislative process

Where's the beef?
No transparency? No vote. 40,000 amendments for vote-a-rama get us to the midterms, Senator. Fight outrage with outrage.
Thank you! Keep asking those tough questions- the GOP needs to answer for their lack of hearings on important healthcare legislation #ACA
Please @SenatorDurbin keep fighting this obscene attempt to take away healthcare from the most vulnerable @SenDuckworth
What was the response to your question about the responsible thing to do re: #SecretSenateHealthcareBill
Thank you for fighting for us.Every single Democrat has fought against this & every GOP is trying to shove this. Get this out in the open!
Reminds me of Josh Lyman's secret plan to fight inflation
Obamacare repealed healthcare from us Durbin
Now is a time for elected officials to put needs of nation above party loyalty. Make plan public to all pre voting.
Thank you sir for fighting for Illinois
Thanks for holding fast for your constituents
Are you at a hearing or on the floor? At a hearing you have 2 ears and 1 mouth for a reason. Listen, question in hearing, OK. Obstruct NO!
The pure shittiness of the AHCA for those not in the 1%
I had hopes for the Senate. Form a third Party of Moderates. 2018 2018 2018
Does Thomas Price think that that was an acceptable answer? 
As your constituent, I urge you to commit to filibustering the #AHCA vote by amendment!
@SecPriceMD def is LIAR!  It's called #Gaslighting !  Lost all of my trust in @GOP
Go get 'em. Senator!
It's obvious Republicans trying to balance the proposed tax cuts. Where to get money for it? Not from cutting defense sure /sarcasm off
#ACHA = #Healthcareaccess #ACA = #HealthcareCoverage What good is access if you can't afford coverage? Secret  #trumpcare = #deathpanels
Thank you Senator Durbin! NO WAY should ANY bill get ANY traction if NO ONE else has even seen it!
How bad the bill is for working and poor people. While the country is dealing with a fake president they are passing bills left and right.
Just vote no.. there is no other response.
draw it out by adding amendments! u have to vote on each one! Add 1000's to slow down til midterms?
@SenatorDurbin Please be sure to bring 50+ amendments to vote-a-rama to give us the time to read and react to the bill. Thank you!
Why are we assuming @SecPriceMD is the only person in this admin who's not lying?He's seen it but the repubs are afraid of voter backlash
so what was his answer. I'll ask you b/c he doesn't tell the truth either.  #TrumpCare #disaster The American People deserve the truth. WTF
Good question @BillCassidy
I've emailed you and called. I appreciate you fighting for every American. My life depends on it.
What, what was his answer?
you must get 3 true Americans to join you in defeating this bill
Does anybody know anything in this administration?
You also need to tell your constituents what we can do to help you.
Senator Durbin, we need you to do EVERYTHING you can to stop this unspeakably cruel healthcare bill from passing.
did @SecPriceMD think it's responsible? or did he give a non answer?
I thought you people read after the fact. Ask & Extend if need be. All of America don't need your welfare when $s earned are left to them.
Thank you Senator for fighting against the secret bill.  Many Americans support working to correct issues with the ACA. Fix not replace
Thank you Senator! Keep pushing and asking good questions!
Perhaps it is because you are one of the LEAKERS!
Senator Durbin thanks for standing up for your Constituents.The ACA truly saved my life don’t allow the GOP to take Healthcare away from us.
Respect to you Senator Durbin 
Medicaid is not healthcare.
What did the DemonRats hide with ObamaCare when they signed it into law ???
Obama held multiple public hearings on Obamacare before it was voted on
And it still passed without reading it by most of the DemonRats ???
What evidence do you have that suggests democrats didn't read the bill? Many of them personally worked on its language
Post the roster and the testimony of each Democrat that read the entire health care act (ObamaCare) sometime soon !!!
There's a difference between reading an entire health care act and understanding it. No, I'm sure most democrats did not read Obamacare (1)
Cover to cover. And that's very arguably a mistake. But democrats did, demonstrably, know the contents of the bill. And the passage of (2)
Obamacare was far more transparent than what the republicans are trying to do here.
@SenateDems @SecPriceMD @SenateGOP hmmmmmmm, no panel?
how can you comment on what it does to people if you haven't seen it?
If you tear off their masks you find out they're nothing but a human shaped pile of guns
Unity, @SenatorDurbin. They are hiding unity.
Something is wrong with system allows a bill so crucial to so many people to be negotiated in private. We need discussion, debate, hearings.
Mr Price, you need to lay low on the botox and juvederm injections (yes it's noticeable) and focus on your job
Yes what are you hiding ? If Dr Price can not answer questions or do his job then he should resign
THE POOR MAN MUST WATCH ALL HIS INVESTMENTS IN HIS PHARMACEUTICALS,ESPECIALLY HIS NEW 1 WITH CHRIS COLLINS OF NY
Making a buck for his self is all Price cares about
JESUS.
I see no honest process that honestly looks at health of Americans and allows ideas to be tried and evaluated based on results. Secret 
Reconciliation allows for unlimited amendments from anyone. Use that process to put forward countless amendments for every EHB affected
I want to see GOP vote down EHBs and take public stances on the millions who will lose insurance, and the millions more with lower coverage
Thank you for listening to your constituents! We want affordable health care, NOT TrumpCare!
Glad you were able to complete your question, unlike Sen Patty Murray, who was cut off at the knees by Sen Alexander for the same question.
s understand that major health care reform needs bipartisan support. More than 17% in favor. Forcing #TrumpCare thru will be a disaster.

No sane person should be OK with this, regardless of party.
Thank you, Senator Durbin for representing us well.
Thank you for continuing to fight for our most vulnerable and to #KeepKidsCovered. 1.5 million kids in Illinois rely on Medicaid.
That's disturbing oh and viscous
Quiet whinning and vote yes!!!!!
Spreading the hate as usual.
I thought 'hate' was the word of the day yesterday for you Trump parrots. Better recheck your secret decoder ring.
Almost funny but just pathetic just like your entire movement!
What movement would that be? The one about being educated about what I'm speaking on? I can see how you'd find that pathetic.
Educated.. now thats funny.. Correct word is indoctrinated.. Ok go watch The View now so they can tell you what to think. Little Lemming.
Alex Jones reports Trump will issue Executive Order on a massive gun ban on Monday supported by Ryan
