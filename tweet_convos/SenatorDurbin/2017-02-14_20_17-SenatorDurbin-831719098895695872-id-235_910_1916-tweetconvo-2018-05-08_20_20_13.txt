not just an investigation. It's time for the House to start impeachment proceedings.
on what grounds genius?Dem playbook is like mad libs (haha..funny) MAD LIBS...get it? Just fill in the blanks
Clinton was impeached for lying about hooking up with an intern. So it's happened before for a lot less
Obstructing justice evidence to Spt it AND with his admission.
what?
he was impeached for obstruction of justice
no...he was impeached primarily on the charges of perjury (lying) w a secondary charge of obstruction
because he tried to get Lewinsky a job where she would be hindered career wise if she testified in the case
digging r scratching their asses-the reality of trumpet has come home to roost-F.U. is real!
independent commission is only way to satisfy the questions for the citizens who DESERVE honesty. This is serious!
Thank you for taking this stand, @SenatorDurbin.
you mean the independent investigation that Hillary received????
@SenateDems @nytimes 
Might be more important to go to the wall for full investigation of Trump/Russia than to block Gorsuch
24 hours later... still wondering. GOP cowering and stonewalling.
Senator, how do we ensure an independent investigative committee is formed? What can citizens do? Feel helpless! Demand truth
I thought you were taking about your state and city! I agree you all need to be investigated.
GOP only makes the ethical decisions when its released to the public-wifebeater/abuser & Flynn w/ Russia/PutinOtherwiseburied
@SenateDems @nytimes Talked to Russians, GOOD, let's find common ground to defeat ISIS.  Someone preparing for new job GREAT

Hiding behind a thin veneer of hypocrisy, it would seem.  #Flynnghazi
@frshamp1 Covering their complicit actions. Ask @speakerryan about his PAC. They colluded. @GOP is dirty. @senatemajldr knew.
patriotic Americans have been asking the @GOP for quite some time, but they don't seem to care. Sad.
Key word "INDEPENDENT".  Our 2016 election is now invalid.

GOP hiding behind anything they can find.
@SenateDems @SenateGOP @nytimes looking the other way! #bepatriotsnotpartisan #investigate
@petsneverfailu1 @nytimes Not 1 Single Thing he has done since Jan 20 Should Stand!  He is a RUSSIAN PLANT!
@SenateDems @nytimes shut down all business on the floor until the independent investigation happens. Or lose your jobs.
if Potus is really worried about leaks he would welcome independent investigation bc it could lead to leakers Please press on
party over country it would seem.
@SenateDems @nytimes let's go! It's time to get mean . Your supporters are mad and you need to be! #resist
Circling the wagons to protect a potential traitor an/or traitors.  Self promotion and party over country.
@SenateDems @nytimes It's time 2 work on Healthcare, jobs, taxes. Stop delaying and obstructing. Pity party time is over.#DTS
GOP 's testing which way wind is blowing4 a investigation OR proping up POTUS This will be much worse than watergate
@SenateDems @nytimes GOP is over in the corner too scared to challenge Trump. They're afraid Trump won't sign their bills.
Why wait 4 the mindless, silent GOP? We need this "regime" investigated NOW!! Those people in the WH are DANGEROUS!
These are the same jokers who were relentless over a blow job. #Impeach45 it is the only way to restore faith.
@SenateDems @nytimes I believe this is the question on The minds of any of us watching the news. Repeat where is the GOP?
@SenateDems @nytimes But we have been assured that the Russian hacks and Trump Campaign relations didn't impact election. #BS
Gutting some regulation or another. I'm sure they'll get around to this eventually.
I agree and we must insist on an independent commission or the people of USA with have ZERO faith in our security!
@SenateDems @nytimes Dems are  DT is a harden business man. U can't upset rep. agenda with threats. Dems aren't that savvy.
@ercitall @nytimes This IS the GOP! Have you not been listening?
@SenateDems @nytimes where we're the Democrats for 8 years? The cover up for Clinton??
@SenateDems @nytimes they don't care
@SenateDems @nytimes Busy rolling back regs on oil and gas, repealing Ocare and making it easier for mentally ill to buy guns
They are crawling around on the Senate floor looking for their balls.
@SenateDems @nytimes please read this article before you post. Maybe you'll stop losing democrats at alarming rates. ;)
<<< Head clown @SenateDems <<< Clowns #MAGA
if it was the other way around... mama mama mama, the GOP would go "nuclear" , DEMS do your JOB!!!!!!!!
dems need to halt ALL business until investigation is opened
where is GOP? Hiding and figuring out how to cover this up
@SenateDems @nytimes they're somewhere shaking in their own fear of trump exposing them of their own dirt.
@SenateDems @nytimes Very disheartening. Rs wouldn't let up on HRC's email. Rs spineless, unpatriotic, sexist.
@SenateDems @nytimes Time for Dems to stop asking about the GOP & take action. The GOP will cover for 45 as long as possible.
@SenateDems @nytimes really guys, how about acting like grown adult elected officials, Harry is gone.  Let's at least try.
@SenateDems @nytimes you can find them all in his pocket...
@SenateDems @nytimes hope @GOP understands that THE PEOPLE will demand PROSECUTION of ALL who COLLUDED in this coverup.
Thank you for putting Country before Party!
Desparation by the Dems. Total head explosion by the left-i am enjoying watching this after 8 years of libtard bs
@SenateDems @nytimes shredding and deleting any ties to this shot storm.
@SenateDems @nytimes @jasoninthehouse is busy with his all-new investigation into Clinton dogs using hiking trails as toilets
where are the @GOP? @HOUSEGOP? @SENATEGOP? being treasonous terrorists. @USMC needs to arrest them all & execute
@VP Pence is sitting there when Trump was talking on the phone with Putin time to ask what was said since no tape.
@BarackObama @HillaryClinton We are still wondering what your party hasn't been doing for over 8 years!
They are going to be held up next 100 yrs. Fig. How 2 RR ACA
where is the @GOP? they are treasonous cowards is where they are. unwilling to do anything.
YOU NEED TO DO THIS!! We are watching!!
And so it begins! #MitchMcConnell said Russian involvement in election is "significant issue" & will investigate!
@SenateDems @nytimes @SenMajLeader is busy telling every woman he sees to shut up.
@SenateDems @nytimes GOP IS :
@SenateDems @nytimes I am not a Russian. voted trump. Why?What difference does it make, server unsecured, vets no one fired?
Democrats MUST persist!!
@SenateDems @nytimes they went to PA to see what @PMTheresaMay_  thinks
@SenateDems @nytimes Dems lost Nov.8. Russia has been investigated for decades. What are u looking for?
What's wrong, elite politicians too lazy to conduct the investigation? Do you not trust your own?
@SenateDems @nytimes The worst scandal since the "Contra" scandal!
@SenateDems @nytimes Check out @Mikel_Jollett's Tweet:
If only someone had warned us.

 
@SenateDems @nytimes keep pressing.  Don't give up.
.@SenatorDurbin @SenateDems @nytimes Maybe you should freeze all senate and house business until investigation is completed.
@SenateDems @nytimes Sitting in their offices wondering what everyone is so upset about, probably.
ROSNEFT!!!
They are confirming this will be all of their last terms.
@SenateDems @nytimes show you who's in charge
@SenateDems @nytimes Mark my words as a true american something you know own nothing about you go for impeachment we will
We're watching a leadership failure unfold right before our eyes. Where is @RepEdRoyce?
where are YOU?! Make them drag you out DEMANDING investigation. There is no such thing as going too far right now. Emergency
Hey @DevinNunes @jasoninthehouse I call for an investigation for who ever leaked the info! Treason also declare the global
constitutional and investigate all dem's finances tied back to supporting this agenda! treason
That's right @SenatorDurbin , don't give anyone possibly committing treason, or obstructing justice, a single inch! Thank you.
they need an independent committee to investigate why you ain't done nothing about the killings in Chicago. All talk
@TgAmerican @nytimes @SenJohnHoeven @SenatorHeitkamp @RepKevinCramer Recall blue dress 2 impeach? See Russian stains on #45!
@PeterRoskam the constituents in the IL-06 would really like to see those tax returns now. Keep up the good work, D.
@WaysandMeansGOP Obstructing the truth.
@monkeyes2 @nytimes in bed with trump and bannon. These fleas won't jump until he's dead (politically)
.@SenatorDurbin Hiding from their constituents in central Illinois. Thank you, Sen. Durbin. cc @RodneyDavis @RepShimkus @RepLaHood
and in the suburbs of Chicago. Literally in @PeterRoskam case
we need you and other Democrats to hold congress to a full stop until there is an investigation. Stop talking start doing
You sir are subversive.Thr is ZERO evidence anything nefarious occurred.Not a shrd to spt Rsa influenced election
The GOP is clearly involved.  There needs to be a investigation of anyone who has supported this administration
standing silent with their hands in Putin's pockets.  Shame on you @GOP
Being cowardly!
The GOP is busy about the People's business.  All you FAKE NEWS outlets are obsolete.
not buying your bullshit!  Investigate Hillary, you know, emails, fraud, Benghazi!  Hypocrites!!
The party that wraps themselves in the flag and puts their agenda ahead of our country is disgusting
- perhaps afraid of what putin has on them? Silence implies collusion.
the @GOP is hiding behind the bribes they took.
Trump's team was looking for someone to take them seriously. The GOP didn't even do that, but Russia wanted to - power talks.
by allowing Russia to run our government?  Great plan.
The gutless GOP is the same place you're, Dickie, with the Hillary email scandal.
Americans deserve a transparent, independent investigation into Russia’s involvement with the Trump camp.
still at breakfast with their wives...lol!!!
Obstructing to deflect from the kompromat that exists on at least some of them. Proceed as if all are compromised.
Given the GOP silence or vehement protestation against an investigation I can only assume they know what the outcome would be
It's inexcusable that they're standing silent. What happened to country first?
the @GOP are scattering like roaches all over WDC with sun glasses and hats on pvtly mtng scared of what's to come!
grand ole party of cowards I'm so sick of them
thanks for being so prompt on this matter.  I am proud to call you my Senator and have you as the Minority Whip!
Absolutely Senator. This is an existential crisis for our republic. The cowardice of the GOP is shameful!
Why not a grand jury for this?
can a pat Fitzgerald type be appointed?
Where were the Dems when Rep wanted investigation to Benghazi? Didn't get it until Rep took over.
@SenatorDurbin @MamaChryl @nytimes
Declaring war on intel community was bad deal for Trump.  Payback time.
Thank you, Senator.  God Bless!
If the #GOP is going to stand for America, the time is now. Please do what you know to be right. Stand up to #Trump.
They did stand up and voted for him with the help of us Independents!
GOP is MIA. Ryan, McConnell, Chaffetz are all party first cowards. They might upset the Koch Bros
keep pushing Dick!!!!!!!!
The parrots are out in full force almost word for word. If
one coughs do the rest ?
@babsben @nytimes trying to make up a story. Like the imaginary mar-a-Lagom scif. Jesus these 
cowering in a back room
GOP are also guilty or being blackmailed?
DEMAND A SELECT COMMITTEE FOR #trumpRussia TIES!
I fear the GOP doesn't understand Russia's anti-West hybrid war. Need to hear from @McFaul @Kasparov63 @anneapplebaum etc
They are complicte in the crimes.
Good question. Another good question is why isn't DNC fighting for Price's seat? Every seat is worth fighting for now!
ANY Senior Members of #GOP #CONGRESS who fail to pursue investigation should be charged w #TREASON & #COLLUSION NOW!
there must be a full investigation
If the GOP will not cooperate and keep obstructing justice can't an independent investigation be invoked?
Not without The Republicans ok. How's it feel not to be able to do anything when 1 party hold the cards.
They have sold their craven little souls and don't give a damn.
Thank you for being a voice of sanity and reason for Illinoisans and all Americans.
Either shaking in their boots or checking their bank accounts.
Yes because their so afraid of you.
Do we need to worry about the Russia spy ship with missives off DE? Are they here to help Trump?  And is it there?
Trump was told Flynn could be blackmailed & kept him. Is it bc Trump is also compromised like the dossier says? @SenatorDurbin @nytimes
Senator, America truly needs you right now and people like you. Pls help us. Stay loud, stay strong. We support you
obstructing and blocking justice Same thing they did for Obama, obstruct obstruct obstruct  They dont care about America
No other legislation House or Sen considered til we fully investigate POTUS He cant seat SCOTUS til we know his motives
@SenSchumer @SenDuckworth @SenJohnMcCain i'm counting on all you to get that independent commission.
Rep Collins said this am that they were out to breakfast with wife's Or their all hiding. I bet "hiding"
INSIST on an independent investigation and do not back down!! Thank you!!
@CruzWhobris @nytimes Thank you Senator
this investigation must be conducted by an independent, non-partisan commission. Please do not accept anything less.
@GOP #DoYourJob Country before party.
They are. To bad The SocialistLiberals Party isn't doing theirs.
Dismantling the ACA, the EPA and women's healthcare instead of LOCKING up Flynn? It's funny how 1
Majority of people didn't want ACA and still don't. Majority rules. Locking up Flynn for what?
Apparently this has been fact checked.
We need more answers so we need to be able to ask more questions, which is something that has been difficult lately.
refusing to investigate
@JesseLaGreca @nytimes They are investigating Hillary's emails.
Just like the SocialistLiberals Party (formally the Democrat Party) did for Obama.
Please keep pushing for the truth.
An investigation must happen! @GOP must put the country above the party.
If they truly weren't just as guilty, they'd have said something already.
complicit. That's what they are.
Anther wind bag from the windy. Wish we could make Chicago their own state.
because we really TRUST the NewYork times! @nytimes
This is treasonous. We are behind you. Keep going.
not buying into your leftist around the clock, take down Trump at any cost bs.
nobody is thinking long-term. When an investigation reveals all, they'll wish they defected sooner. #Indivisible
what can we do to help?
Vote all the Dems out of office.
hard to believe none willing to put #CountryOverParty @SenJohnMcCain
- what all GOP members are doing right now
No that's the Dems. Right know Republicans have to clean up their mess.
