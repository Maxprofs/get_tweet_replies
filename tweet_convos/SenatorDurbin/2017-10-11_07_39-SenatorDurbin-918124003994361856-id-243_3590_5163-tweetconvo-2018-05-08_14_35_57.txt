“Because of the electricity situation, a lot of people died, and are still dying. You can’t get sick now.” http://nyti.ms/2yXtapc 
They need help getting the sick people to the USS Comfort!  Please find a way to really help them
Rebuilding over 20k miles of power lines takes resources and manpower, and isn't overnight fix. USACE doing their best to help.
Apologies for sticking this here, but here is a small thing one can do, while nothing is being done:
Contains UNICEF link for direct donations.
Every single #Senate member that doesn't stand up and immediately demand action for #PR will go down in history as a CRIMINAL @CitizensFedUp
Senator, you’re more than welcome to introduce some emergency legislation that will help our people. Talk’s cheap, you know? #PuertoRico
How is this statement even relevant?  Stop whining about losers. Encourage mature action from our chief executive.
What do you mean?  How does this meme advance the conversation about PR recover plan?

My husband's coworker's mother and in laws are having to leave Puerto Rico and come stay with him in NC because of the conditions there.
Unfortunate. Glad they have someone to help them. But I hope they decide to stay so they can register to vote!
The electrical grid was falling apart before hurricane. Why did PR not fix it with the billions we gave them?
And they're hungry.
Your right @SenatorDurbin! What action are you taking to help them and others recently affected by these natural disasters?
Didn't you hear Ryan? PR needs to do it alone. #GOP doesn't care about #Americans Jones Act blocking supplies? Tough. No comms? Sorry.
Do you really think trump cares. He won't be happy till they are all dead.
So pass a law - do something
Sad but their inept Gov has let country fall into ruins & massive debt.Fed Gov can’t support All states Crooked or inability to run state
The same could be said of Illinois. Puerto Rico with Vienna Hot Dogs.
Great statement—so Senate will pass legislation TODAY to help PR, right?
But they owe Wall Street!
Maybe Melania can perform a cameo performance of don't cry for me #PuertoRico
Well when their mayor is playing politics instead of doing their jobs the sole blame goes on their politicians.
They mean nothing to Trump because they do not vote for President! They can only vote in the primary. No electoral votes in Puerto Rico
Stop tweeting and do something about it.
PUERTO RICAN POLITICIANS ROBBED THIS TERRITORY 4 DECADES.. NO PLANNING OR PREPARATION FOR HURRICANES. 
JUST DNC GREED  & LIES .STOP LIEING

When #Trump is just short of genocide, indifference will gave to suffice.
I'm a constituent and I agree 100%
As head of the Republican party the party as a whole owns this
Well actually, there is something that can be done, but Congress seems to like Donny. So, I think politicians in Washington are guilty.
Then there's a dr quitting bc of federal workers having a Spa Day in the triage tent instead of helping the people
Spa day in the medical triage tent in Puerto Rico? 
#Maddow 
Perhaps the UN should intervene in this humanitarian crisis?
Just another example of how this administration doesn't care about black people and other people of color!
Then force the issue and help!
P/R, NEEDS TO KNOW OUR HELP IS NOT FOREVER HELP, BUT ONLY HUMANITARIAN!!!  P/R, PREPARE TO BECOME SELF RELIANT...
You are a US senator, help them! #ImpeachTrump Save our country and the world from this madman!
I'm sorry @SenatorDurbin, did I miss the legislation you have proposed to help PR?
You have GOP lackeys like @RepScottPerry going on TV trying to downplay the situation when most Americans know the truth. Help them please.
Thank you for this tweet. We really need to have everyone screaming about this.
As a senator can’t you propose legislation to help fix this?
trump is mentally unfit and totally illegit..#25thAmendmentNow
C'mon Dick, be a Mench, do something ! Oye !  
We spend $68,000,000.00+ per day in Afghanistan yet we cannot provide for the safety of US Citizens in PR? #MAGA #hypocrisy #BS
You, Sir, can help the situation by providing financial aid that doesn't look like Congress is a Pay Day lender to Puerto Rico.
POTUS is excuse for inaction.
Can you in Congress do anything about this?
Thank you, Senator Durbin. Please help them!
#pedogate
Will you co-sponsor @SenJohnMcCain 's bill to permanently repeal the Jones Act for Puerto Rico?  Rebuilding will take a generation!
We need someone to remove Trump from this and put someone in charge
Let us know what you are doing to continue to help Puerto Rico!
@SenatorDurbin This President is a threat to our National Security & US Citizens he will kill us all before he's out of office NO KIDDING 
POTUS twitted today that he is considering pulling all help from PR. Says they can't be there forever, how about until they are done?
yes we do YOU all are leaving a sick man who believes himself a dictator and above the constitution he vowed to uphold, remove them all
The halls of power are the only place something can be done, not Twitter. Congress must take immediate action!  @TheDemocrats @GOP
You might want to tell the president.

Florida lost 14 people in a nursing home when the power/a/c went out during Irma. The heat w/o electricity is deadly
This interview is shocking in the light of this article.  It feels like The Matrix.
jfc; https://shareblue.com/unhinged-gop-congressman-accuses-media-of-making-up-the-devastation-of-puerto-rico/ …
Please remove @potus from office. 25th Amendment was written for this situation! We can handle Mike Pence and his weird religious stuff.
@realDonaldTrump has a perfectly good excuse to his mind... they are brown people.

Today is Thursday. That means we need to ask again: Why does Jared Kushner still have a security clearance? Also, why does Ivanka have one? https://twitter.com/Newsweek/status/918433582183567360 …
So go tell the tangerine toddler that. He is actively working against the people of Puerto Rico.
Have you seen this morning's tweets from the president?
Why is still in office? If this was a Democrat he would already be gone country before party
Oh yes we do: Donald Trump
trump pulling military and FEMA! Situation is desperate and spt is vital!
You are a person of power. Instead of complaining, do something about it.
And now Trump threatens to take FEMA out. This is a crime! Can't something be done????
There is not a "lot of people dying" in PR.
#DepravedIndifferenceToHumanLife #CrimesAgainstHumanity #25thAmendmentNow #ImpeachTrump #Treason
More people are dying in your city Chicago than PR.  Tell the truth Dickie, do you even care?  Can you say nothing can be done there!
Until you decide to get madman trump out of the White House, nothing will change. How about some action there??? He’s costing lives.
Yep. It's disgusting.
Sure we do. NFL players are kneeling during the national anthem and the press keeps criticizing the President. Of course these things take precedence over caring for Americans struggling to survive the devastation of a deadly hurricane.
Genocide
Stand up to @POTUS now.
Then ACT!
Trump's inaction is starting to flirt with genocide. We still have no correct death count and are closing in on a health catastrophe.
Puerto Rico is Trump's and America's disgrace. Where is the outrage?
So what will the senate do about it?
The horrific situation in Puerto Rico wil be Trumps undoing. It's far worse than Katrina and he is ignoring it. They're not his base.
HELICOPTERS! There are only 7 patients on the USS comfort! What the hell, man? What about the $700 billion we gave the military?!
Just a sorry excuse for a POTUS. I now suspect @fema has been ordered to withhold aid to citizens in PR
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  He’s putting,
Any word on what is happening in the #USVirginIslands #USVI?
Any care to address the devastation there?
Any #relief support?
We are already at war. In our own country.
And the Trump Administration just offered LOANS for recovery. LOANS. They are Americans. This is disgraceful.
When @fema states that it is not their job to provide food & water to PR yet has done so for FL & Houston, there is a big problem.
***we have no excuse for inaction.  Trump's inaction is criminal.
But we have this huge NFL situation of people peacefully using their right of free speech in protest of inequality to deal with.
Can't you do something Senator?
The apocalypse arrived a few weeks early there
Trump is celebrating his "mission accomplished" in Puerto Rico.

¿Que van a hacer, Senador? (Besides tweet...)
Get an aircraft carrier, or any ship with Helo capabilites, near PR and do helicopter drops like they did in Vietnam.
This shows me the government, including Congress, is incapable of keeping its main promise - keeping Americans safe. Tweets don't cut it.
Senator, what do you intend to do about it?
Good thing the US President tossed "beautiful paper towels" to save them all.   Seriously this is a violation of humanity America.
@SenatorDurbin you need to be on the floor of the Senate screaming - literally SCREAMING about this. Make a scene. Be a hero to millions.
There is also a catastrophic disaster happening in the SF Bay Area with hundreds missing in the N. Bay. Trump doesn't care...#NorCalStrong
so shut up and do something
And the Idiotic Moron in the White House states that hes' done amazing things for PR.  If he means trying to kill them, then yes he has.

This is horrendous!  What can be done?  How can we intervene?
And the economy will die too.
Ever the grandstander aren't we? Why don't you do something about it?!!! You "have" people! Do something or shut your yap!
We MUST hear #PuertoRico begging for life saving help! @MaddowBlog .@AntonioParis @Lawrence @AC360 @ltgrusselhonore This is HEARTBREAKING!
Chicago blacks facing a life and death situation. This is a crisis on US soil in your state of Illinois and you have no excuse for inaction
What are you & ur colleagues doing abt it, senator? @marcorubio @SenSchumer @SenJohnMcCain @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein
This admin has virtually abandoned PR, except for some inadequate numbers of disaster relief help.
@nytimes please Senator tell me what can be done my friend & her daughter have no water electricity home destroyed, hopeless
all those bonds! they were supposed to be used in infrastructure but ended in the pockets of politicians.
The brown people don't count in this admn.

Please help as much as you can Senator Durbin, we support you!
And the so-called president couldn’t care less
Respectfully Senator, the simultaneous priorities are: impeach trump and get rid of all his idiot cronies, fix Puerto Rico, Fix healthcare
There is NO EXCUSE for this!! Trump must be held accountable for all these deaths!
how can we help? Horrible
What the heck. We threw them some rolls of paper towels what else can we do?
Don't see Congress doing anything to further help.
@realDonaldTrump WILL YOU READ THIS!!! Death on your hands from neglecting Puerto Rico! You could help YOU CHOSE NOT TO!
Help urgently needed in Puerto Rico. What stores r open have low supplies. This is America for Gods sake. Help them
No preparation onbehalf of the Puerto Rican government ever? live 8 feet above sea level corruption everything's a mess call hrc
@SenateDems @SenateGOP PLEASE DO SOMETHING!!! #PuertoRicoRelief
I don't know if @SenatorDurbin heard about the water. Big water. An ocean, in fact...
See #Flint Michigan
Then move and do something about it right now I am not voting for any of you! Is the resistance running?
Someone call in Capt Speirs he'll handle it.
Maybe tell #POTUS that they are kneeling in peaceful protest and he just might get involved.
@malamoo60 @nytimes @FrancesRobles the President IS going to start a Nuclear War. When is congress going to remove him??
Sen Durbin, CAN'T CONGRESS DO SOMETHING? I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
And what are you and your colleagues are going to do about it? Keep tweeting?
Not sure if you’re aware, but California is in a natural disaster too with the east coast under threat of another hurricane
And what do you plan to do about it? Besides point fingers.
And our Idiot in Chief sits on his throne and allows it to happen on his shift.  Inexcusable, inhuman and GOP wants offsets for aid cost!
Then do something about it.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP  You have NO excuse for inaction. #PuertoRicoReliefNOW
pee pee durbin       what are you doing ??
any donations  ??
any trips bringing supplies  ??
any real guidance  or  just same old bull shit
PR people have no one to blame but local government. Their lack of infrastructure investment is the problem not identity politics.
Keep fighting. Be a voice for these Americans.
DoSomething @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan 
 @RepJohnKatco
@SenSchumer @SenGillibrand
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
Hey.....What about Cairo,  IL?
You are a powerful senator. Do something more than tweet. Go help. Do it now.
Their government needs to sue Trump.
No excuse but the reason is @potus Please do everything in your power to remove him from office!
It’s really life n death. His racism has now cost lives. Time to airlift the food in now.
Numerous Lawmakers are tweeting about the dire situation in Puerto Rico. Surely there is something all of you could do if you band together.
genocide! do something or there's American blood on our entire governments hands
.@ricardorossello
We need you and your fellow senators to stand up and get aid to our citizens in Puerto Rico now! Grass roots efforts need help now!
Great full if they were doing something. BUT THEY ARE NOT. THIS IS BULL
Why aren’t the Marines there?
: "MORNING READ: Puerto Rico is facing a life and death situation. This crisis is…" #1 in United States
Is US under DT 1st world or 3rd world????
What’s disturbing: US Senators complain to US citizens about it. Something is backwards.
@POTUS @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump Whete is your humanity and your conscience? The lack of electricity is a fact and yet no relief for hospitals.
Theres no excuses 4 the RICHEST COUNTRY to do this to their own citizens, 3weeks cant help but think the obvious, its intentional by admin
@Lnonblonde @nytimes But...but...they're kneeling! #WhiteHouseAdultDaycare
@KattyKayBBC Puerto Rico is Not a State of the U.S. and thus cannot be by exact definition United States "soil".
Were they in hospitals  bc if not u can shut up how many year did mankind live with out electricity  it goes to show u we r to spoiled
It would be super if all of us stopped talking about the NFL & talked about what our government should be doing for #PuertoRico NOW. NOW.
All due respect, this comes down to accountability and lack of consequences for ones (lack of) actions.
Jim, thanks to a dumb stupid so called Pres,with his B.S  IQ 
the whole world laughing on us because of him. P.R. should get national help
This  watches this horrific situation get worse and worse,don’t get it.Why is the NFL or Fake News twitters more important. Bless PR&Calif
@KattyKayBBC @nytimes And the USVI. Don’t forget about them too.
@jimsciutto @nytimes @FrancesRobles Hey @fema @FEMA_Brock Maybe you should stop "tuning out" the truth and start listening.
Shouldn’t this also be an impeachable offense....Trump is intentionally ignoring Puerto Rico fro some vendetta he has.
Do you think death toll in Puerto Rico  is high enough for @realDonaldTrump to call it a real crisis yet? #helppuertorico #impeachtrump
Hey why don't you just chuck them some paper towels?  That should help them clean up the mess.  No?
Repeal the Jones Act. YOU ARE IN A POSITION TO GET THAT GOING
Thank you, Senator
And a charge of 5billion to PR no grant. Obscene!
#PuertoRicoGenocide #PuertoRicoGenocide #PuertoRicoGenocide #PuertoRicoMatters 
@realDonaldTrump Inexcusable.  Is this fake new, Mr so-called president?
If you really want to make a difference, senator, you should call the US Army & Navy to get them to send 200 more helicopters to Puerto Rico
Biggest problem in PR is broken impassable roads.  That's why trucks can't get supplies in land. If you can't drive supplies, then FLY them.
Gen. Honore had 200 helicopters helping after Katrina for New Orleans, which has 1/10 the population in area 1/10 the size of Puerto Rico,
Yet there are <200 helicopters in PR, which needs twice that # to airdrop food, water & medical supplies to where people need help the most
Please support the bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from the Jones Act.
But don’t you know people fighting with the NFL is oh so much more important.
Dems should do whatever it takes to block all other work until PR is taken care of. This is a national disgrace.
Get on the air...raise your voice...complain about the DISASTEROUS RESPONSE TO A DISASTER, by a vindictive Trump, not President.  Make news!
When someone is blocked from food, water, medicine, what do people think will happen?  Democrats need to be unapologetically SCREAMING NOW.
been screaming for a week. and sending tweets to Congress. nothing seems to be happening
Its in your court. Action ir inaction.
