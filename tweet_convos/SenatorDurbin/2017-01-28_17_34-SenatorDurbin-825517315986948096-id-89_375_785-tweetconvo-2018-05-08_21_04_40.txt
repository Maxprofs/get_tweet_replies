These executive orders are tearing families apart and playing right into our enemies' hands. This isn't who we are
It's clear these executive orders were slapped together without a plan to implement them—I call on @POTUS to end these cruel policies now
I call on you to 'end' your pointless criticizing!
It's a disgrace what trump is doing to our country.
please fight our constitutional rights .humanity is lost with each of the dictators pen strokes
What about the Ameican familes who lost their lives to the MUSLIM TERRORISTS! Whose side our you on? DID you convert to Islam

What the hell have you done about the killing fields of Chicago?Not a damn thing cause you don't give a damn. Drain the swamp
Then send them to their parents. It really is that simple. Drain the damn swamp and get on board or get the hell out loser.

We're counting on you to fight for what's right. You and @SenDuckworth need to stay strong and fight all this madness
thank you for speaking out about this. Please put action behind your words #NoBanNoWall
Over 2 Murders a day in Chicago 
Maybe a few Murdering Muslims won't matter
Are you at ORD? Perhaps you should be there speaking out!
Yes, please work to overturn illegal and cruel EOs. Urge all Senators to vote NO on Sessions - reportedly helped with EOs!
when are you planning to meet  with republicans to do something about this executive order?
give me a break!
50 Families with lost ones from a Islamic Muslim. Muslims detest Gays. Save our LBGT population From Muslims.

The parents of this child might disagree with you ... Protect our citizens first!!!
Maybe you should be helping instead of tweeting about it
SO STAND UP AND BLOCK THIS PROFITEERING MONSTER!
What are you planning to do about it? Stop tearing families apart!
U & other congressmen/women have the power to write laws to block and vote to repeal Executive Actions. Stop complaining and take action!
We need leadership in the Senate and House (@PeterRoskam) to take on this insanity. Hateful. Spiteful. Ill-conceived. Ill-planned.
Please vote against everything @POTUS does - nominees, laws, budgets. All of it! #resist
So, @SenatorDurbin pls HOLD @realDonaldTrump to account. Overturn ALL EOs. Coordinate Senate Dems to Withhold Consent on all Nominees.
.@SenatorDurbin what will you do to #stoptheban ? Please give us some hope, Senator.
MY GOD this man is a menace to our COUNTRY. WHAT EVER HAPPENS FROM NOW ON IS ALL ON REPUBLICANS, AS WAS THE war.
Thanks @SenDuckworth @SenatorDurbin for speaking out. Sadly no word from our Republican @RepHultgren on this #MuslimBan @IndivisibleIL14
.@SenatorDurbin Less tweeting and more action from you and your colleagues please. #MuslimBan #MuslimBanprotest #TheResistance
sucks Obama and Hillary drew a line in the sand and folded like a liberal at a job interview,, now the kids suffer.
You have done nothing to stop the violence in Chicago
what can you do to help those stranded at airports, like those at O,Hare?
#NotAMuslimBan @SenatorDurbin everyone knows @POTUS fulfills promises make America safe again! Why not #MakeChicagoSafe? Trump will do it
What can we do to help in Chicago??
Thank you but we need more than tweets. Trump has to go NOW.  Both GOP and DEMS need to denounce. Abusing Executive Orders.
GET @POTUS OUT OF THERE BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD HATES US!!!

Elizabeth Warren is at the airport protest at Logan
you must unite dems in congress to withhold consent to stop republicans and POTUS!
every senator who wants to be re-elected should be at O'Hare helping these children! Stand up and do something!
What about Obama giving Palestinians $221 million?
But what are you personally and professionally going to do about it, Senator? Tweeting @POTUS isn't enough.
I'm more frightened about Bannon's appointment to the NSC, and the removal of the DNI. Is the ban a red herring? #resist.
"What is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it happening again."  Anne Frank.     So, What do we do about this?
a little quicker next time
Can you help them Senator?  We support you, we support your fighting these horrible executive orders.
Keep fighting Mr. Durbin. Make Illinois proud!
.@SenatorDurbin where are you?? where's @SenDuckworth and @RahmEmanuel??
The result of an #asshat-in-chief
pick up the phone and call some Republicans! Time to go across the aisle!!
