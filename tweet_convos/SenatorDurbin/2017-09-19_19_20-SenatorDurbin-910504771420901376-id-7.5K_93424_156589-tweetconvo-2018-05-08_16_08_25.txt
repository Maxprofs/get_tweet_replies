RN for 36 yrs- I have NEVER heard of a human being denied emergency or life threatening surgery bc of status of insurance or lack there of
Thank you, exactly!  Especially a child
Yes, healthcare workers are especially protective of children
In 1987,Bernie Sanders said if everyone was on medicaid it'd bankrupt the US. Now he's fighting for single payer?
Bernie and the rest of the Commies always talk out of both sides of their mouths. They are scheming manipulators and so many believe them
Allot changes in 30 years and your assessment is ignoring context of the time
Yeah...the national debt then was 25o billion and now it's only 1 1/4 trillion. People thought the great depression was bad?

Will @CKinstitute @Koch_Industries also fund the mass grave for all the Americans their #DeathCare bill will murder?

@SenateGOP @NPR @AP
Indeed tell those mf Nazi Recital Asshole human hunters betrayed Christian brotherhood foff
To be blunt. Do you think your son would still be alive mid he was treated via the socialized medicine ? Doubtful. Liberalism kills too.

.@jimmykimmel thank you for using your platform to give voice and advocate for healthcare for individuals with pre-existing conditions
America's Media Literacy Crisis: Jimmy Kimmel has to explain the newest repeal & replace attempt. #digcommsu #healthcarebill
You are proof that one doesn't have to be smart or funny to be a talk show host. Loser.
Powerful
Go Jimmy
Thank you Jimmy for standing up for healthcare for all.
Your "Show" is done.  You are not funny and your sense of fairness for all those who lost their doctors and health under O'care is selfish.
If you don't know the extent to which Jimmy has advanced this cause/conversation- research it and make those in pos. of power accountable!
#trumpcareKILLS
Mr Kimmel, thank you for calling this out. Millions of #disabled Americans will be crushed by these #medicaid cuts.  People must call senate
Calling for all decent Republicans to vote against this latest health care bill that excludes millions of Americans from coverage. Matt25:43
It has NEVER been about the health and welfare of the American ppl. It's only abt reversing the Obama legacy. We will persist &WIN! BELIEVE
Stay in your lane funny man. As a doctor, I don't do witty monologues in the ER waiting room. Stick to what you know.
All Americans should fight for it. Indonesia, 3rd world country, 90% Muslim population, has universal health care! It saves lives!
Indonesia's universal health care: coverage for all, no pre existing condition, start premium < USD 4/mo, no age limit. Come on USA!
How much do you pay for Obamacare....do tell!!!
They pay for insurance. Not ObamaCare
And?
Well you would be. Just one look at your profile picture tells me All I need to know about your mind set. #Deranged
#Congress doesn't care if the American people have healt care or die but POTUS does
Who do we call if We are Disappointed in you?
I'm so lucky to live where I do.. free health care. #Canada
Donald trump said it so it must be true.  Love you man.
If the line is busy send email search Contact http://Senators.com  or search Senator Bill Cassidy contact form on the web.
Jimmy Kimmel was incorrect and gave false info on the bill. Preexisting conditions are still included.
Exactly what we need, more champions for the common good and for the common citizen.. thanks for standing up and calling bullshit..
CALL Senators Call Congress CALL if you get machine be polite and tell your story. Health Care is a right. Republicans OUT 2018
Yes Bonnie Jean. 
KODOS to Jimmy Kimmel for telling the American people the truth about the terrible #GrahamCassidy bill!
@HillaryClinton @BillCassidy ok. But who do we call if we support the bill?  Or r you against defunding Planned parenthood?
I stand with Jimmy Kimmel in support of health care that meets the #KimmelTest. Retweet to show you stand with #Kimmel too.
Almost 6000 comments, and I'm sure not one of you has read the bill for yourself. Get woke people!
don't want license plates,they still make me buy em. don't want car insurance,l have to buy it.I think you're right squid we're fascists
Like banning muslims?
Would you say that to your islamic brothers who died fighting in the us armed forces. Think before you spout of your Hannity catchphrases.
Thanks for taking a stand against the GOP and their ridiculous health care legislation. Keep up the pressure!
Graham Cassidy isn't a healthcare bill.

It's a donor gift to the Koch Brothers. 

Called & emailed to #savetheACA
Jimmy, you are the hero of the week.

Good chance Jimmy is a hired mouthpiece for Obama care, like Freeman on Russian meddling.
Jimmy, how you got your job is still a mystery to me. Instead of you and Hillary bashing the president, try supporting him.
We R so disappointed in you that you may get a pink slip. We R calling all your sponsors along with your crappy network! You lose!
Great monologs Jimmy over the last few days re: health care. Keep it up!
Jimmy Kimmel reads all the bills from congress. He's no doubt the stupid mans' authority on all things political. Maybe he could help pelosi
Thank you for your stance on the GrahamCassidy
 bill. I am a preexisting condition and retired! if it passes, it will be a hardship!
With @owaspnyc @2600 @BSidesNYC @HowardStern and @hack_nyc it's time to put some focus on the issues #GrahamCassidy http://www.hacknyc.com 
Repeal and replace
I called. Hope @SenatorMenendez @CoryBooker continue to speak out on #GrahamCassidy on behalf of NJ and American families in need.
This week, Failure45 will make an inflammatory comment or claim to take attn away from Kimmel.  Please stay focused on everything said here.
by the way, show me one example of a Dr or hospital that is going to DENY a baby lifesaving heart surgery...i'll wait.
Obama Care doesn't even pass the Jimmy Kimmel test
...and that's why I quit watching #kimmel
It is time for everyone work to make America Great by working for Universal Healthcare for all!
ANOTHER ENTITLED MILLIONAIRE AIRHEAD WHO THINKS HIS OPINION MATTERS MORE THAN THE REST OF US.
Stop using entertainment to force your social views on your audience. Why would u use your son as a pawn in a national debate? Sad very sad!
@POTUS Listen To Jimmy Kimmel!
The #KochBros want massive numbers of Americans dead. Time to dig deep into their ties to #TrumpRussia.


@FBI @CKinstitute 
@politico @AP
@jimmykimmel you are misinformed and ignorant on the subject. Please stick to butt kissing Hollywood #Narcissist every night.
I texted my  Louisiana Senator (Bill Cassidy) asking him to rescind his bill. I got a  letter back telling me I didn't understand it.
It is dishonest for Millionaire J.Kimmel to cry for free health care coverage when he can pay for it his self. @AynRandInst @FoxNews @ABC
Saved money from transfer of health costs to States will go to the rich.  Republicans are disgusting by putting party over people's health!
thank you for speaking the truth, jimmy
I am disappointed this Kennedy is not having it!
This is my dad, a 92-year-old WW2 vet. He has a heart condition, kidney disease & diabetes; he fights on. #GrahamCasiddy could kill him.
He's 92 for Christ's sake.
What's that mean? He's a lost cause, or for god's sake have a heart?
I hate Jimmy Kimmel
Trump should be obligated to have normal press conferences to answer intelligent questions about any of his proposed bills?Must read bills?
Oh how we forget our past..
Lol now Jimmy Kimmel is the authority we should all heed! His kid was treated at a charity hospital which wouldn't have turned anyone away.
‘CROCODILE’  CASSIDY..... vote him OUT!!

Blues power to the people!!!  For good!

VOTE OUT THE @GOP NOW! 2018 !!! 2020 !!! 
DOESN'T COVER CRAP !
We need to accept the philosophies of the Association of American Physician and Surgeons. The stand for getting rid of corruption and waste
Gee Jimmy is it painful being Schumer's puppet?
@jimmykimmel stick with entertainment and not politics..u don't have Obama Care and NO clue. NOT in medical field u are an overpaid actor
Hey Jimmy I refer to Cassidy as Dr. KEVORKIAN! What you do with it is up to you. You may think it sucks! Stay the course. Thanks
Jimmy Kimmel is clueless. #MAGA
Call at least 10 Senators daily. Join me & overwhelm the Capitol phone lines. Stop #GrahamCassidyDeathBill. Tell these guys to stand down.
GOP has lost their humanity and dignity! So many lies and misrepresentations! Do they feel any SHAME?
Call @SenCoryGardner too...
U need to get off Air. Phony
It's being defeated, Thank you Sen. John McCain
Jimmy, you show is no longer a comedy show..
How about, "If you've read about the bill and know something about it and are disappointed, then call and let them know it."
The new Jimmy Kimmel test - it's called the lie detector test @BillCassidy @HouseRepublican s!

Yes, fine. But please don't have this stupid debate. To make it out to be one way or another is dangerous & irresponsible.
 And don't forget to call the GOP senators who are standing up to this nonsense! Call & support their NO votes!
I'm with you Jimmy (crohns disease for 28 years)
You suck and so does #herpeshillary
You are a TRUE AMERICAN HERO JIMMY KIMMEL! WE LOVE YOU!
Thank you
Thank you Senator Bill Cassidy
Your either being paid handsomely by the DNC to lie like a pig or you're as dumb as a tree stump. You're show is about comedy, not politics.
Thank u Jimmy 4explaining #healthcare better than anyone & sure u made a positive impact- today insurance co a no 4 #GrahamCassidyBill 
Ive called Portman
I stand with Jimmy Kimmel !!
This guy needs to back off the weed and booze, pills, whatever. He isn't making sense anymore
What number do I call if my deductible and rates doubled bc of your preference to healthcare? I can’t afford it but hey, someone else can
Sounds like he's taking a page from the Obama administration.
Thank you for speaking out re my do-nothing, lying senator.He cares nothing for LA,US. Oath to "1st do no harm" sold to Koch and lobbyist .
I'm a nurse in VA Obamacare sucks doctors not taking patients from Medicare&Medicaid as well as certain insurances
Give em hell JK , from this cancer survivor #PreexistingCondition
All kneelers, not funny comedians, liberals, cop haters, illegals, ungratefuls need to pack up your gifts from USA & go. Obamacare sucks. U2
All lives matter, No matter your $ bracket, race, age, or prexsisting condition! Why is that something ANYONE  feels ok debating? #trucolors
Considering I have Stage 4 lung cancer this totally affects me! Please call your representatives!
DONE.
Lol. The only thing your Gona pound is your little democratic pud!!!! Lol

Senator Cassidy clearly wants to be voted out of office. Let's make certain it happens for him!
This is positively stellar.
I'm disappoint in a millionaire who can afford outstanding healthcare telling average Americans what to do / think.
Thanks @jimmykimmel now I hope your show doesn't get cancelled.
If you live in a county that no longer has any health insurance carriers under Obamacare let Jimmy know it...call (818) 460-7477
If your family didn't receive your $2,500 in savings from Obamacare let Jimmy know it...call (818) 460-7477
No we think Senator Cassidy is doing a great job. Thanks for your concern Jim.
I called Johnson , Rubio and Perdue and told the this is a bad bill.
I'm disappointed in Jimmy Kimmel. Big heart, but pretty light on the facts.
Why waste your time letting them know? They've obviously been TRUMPED so until he's gone, things like this are going to continue
Who do we call if we're disappointed in your complete ignorance of health care law, and Hollywood grandstanding? Any suggestions?
One out of four people have pre-existing conditions! (http://USNews.com ) Thanks Jimmy for speaking up for us w/ pre-existing condition
This is not only heartfelt but a remarkably good explanation of the underlying policy
I did...it's. Sry easy to reach all your ELECTED officials on this line!
We need this fixed we cant keep paying so much 200.00 a month for a insurance card and a 6500.00 ded. How is that afordable? Get a clue Jim
Clear & concise. Thanks for speaking because this #widow & #fatherless kids family doesn't have anyone speaking up for her  family health!
You're a lying POS, @jimmykimmel! You know what you said isn't true & you're a sick, irresponsible SOB for deliberately spreading propaganda
Why pay for great health benefits for public figures trying push deathcare on American people.May benefits of their Deathcare bill be theirs
Pretty sure if public officials were forced to sign up for whatever healthcare bill they pass the bill would be very different.
I just called to congratulate them. So tired of an elitist telling me how to live my life. You have no idea how America lives or struggles.
Jimmy..... just stop.
Texted 50409! Faxes sent to both my states reps! Thanks for your voice Jimmy Kimmel !!!
thankful for media stakeholders such as @JimmyKimmelLive taking these issues into the public. Let’s not rest until everyone is covered.
I'm stuck with Cruz who is #Stillnotmysenator.The GOP of old is long gone.Monsters are real.

Easy concept.
Catastrophic care is available to all.

Thanks for sharing
Pastor James heading to D.C. For a voice for Lauren Faith! He will be there all week bringing her story to Congress...#medicaidmatters
My new fav. CELEB! GOD BLESS YOU 
Republicans are all snakes. They hate themselves so much, they blame the poor
Not one citizen should be disadvantaged, those who cannot afford private cover must be covered by Govt health care. Don't settle for less
I'm disappointed in you so where do we call
He set it off on the GOP last night and today Graham is pissed Cassidy 38 hot make the call ppl no transparency but it's a good bill yet ok
America is a democratic fully developed society, affordable health care must cover all citizens for all necessary medical circumstances
RACISM, UNITELLIGENCE POLITICIANS DON'T  CARE ABOUT POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OR ABUSES JUST THIER OWN &OWN CREATURE COMFORT FAKEHANDS INU POOR
Disgusting.   Both of you!  How dare present this
GOP will do away with ACA and dig their graves 10 feet under.
Who paid you? Soros, @TheDemocrats, Who? #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
If only we could fix everything . You're right , let's hope "a change is gonna come". Let's help it arrive.
My VA hospital killed 40 veterans on a waitlist which was never supposed to exist. It did because our gov't is not good managing healthcare.
Jimmy.  You are funny.  Stick to that.  Your facts are wrong every time you talk politics.  I am done with you/ your show.
@jimmykimmel Can I just say thank you and I love you. Thank you for not being afraid to speak up for millions of Americans! A new calling?
Thank you Jimmy!!!!
Thank God you tell the truth and shed light on these issues, @jimmykimmel . @BillCassidy , SHAME ON YOU!!! #Liar
Good for you, Jimmy for calling Cassidy a Piece of Shit Liar. Dear God, what is wrong with USA? Denying health care to most vulnerable!
#GrahamCassidy would not pass the Fowler test. #crohns
PPL can't afford ObamaCare u out of touch celebrity! Where was ur outrage when many American children lost health care under Obama. Ur wrong
Disappointed in u @jimmykimmel. U r absolutely lying about something YOU have never been forced to pay for or use. U have no clue, do u?
Thank you@jimmykimmel 
SHAME ON LYING @BillCassidy
