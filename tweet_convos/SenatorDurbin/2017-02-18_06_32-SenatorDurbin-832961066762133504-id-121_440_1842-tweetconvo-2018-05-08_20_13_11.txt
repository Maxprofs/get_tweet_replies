The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!
please help us get him OUT!!! I am terrified Mr Durbin and as of right now & i am not an immagrantPlease help. Please help us
Your terrified of What? Although if I lived in Chicago I guess I would be terrified. Get a Life!
Garry just keep walking through life with your eyes shut .
Again another Socialist Liberal who can't answer a question and yet it my eyes that are shut. Smh
when it was privatized? What do YOU stand for? Dont say  America because we all stand for America.What policies?
Not crying and protesting because of an election. Or being scares for no reason.
do you REALLY think that all of his Goldmen Sachs buddies are going to help you? Come on.
Yes because they know how it works. What better way to fix what Dems broke.
And I suggest you get off that pandering bandwagon & start working at pulling our together. IL stayed blue but not by much.
you're wrong, again. The liberal propaganda spewed by MSM, an extension of the Democratic Party is hurting the American folks
MSM is lacking journalistic principles. They report not by fact but by their own political bias;therefore, they are the enemy
Just think if they had been able to stop Hitler before he got his roots down

Exactly! At is exactly what Trump is doing. Glad his followers are finally waking up.
RIGHT U R TO BEHOLDING TO THEM THEY LIKE U ARE MOSTLY MORALLY Corrupt Time for u to retire uv done too much damage
You're wrong. Wrong for the American people, wrong for Illinois, wrong about Trump, wrong about immigration & wrong about all
RIGHT!!!
you are the enemy liberal traitor
How is this wrong? When MSM was bashing HRC they were wrong! Now direction changed and they're good! SMH MSM is corrupt
really wanted you to run for IL Gov. I'm SO glad you didn't. We need you in DC fighting for everyone!
@bhappyil does anyone listen to what Dicky Duck has to say? Term limits!
Your RIGHT!
Chicago area is what re-elects him. Look what a mess Chicago is and what he represents.
Your being a Democrat what would we expect you to say? Lol.
He s/be concerned about Illinois & fact hasn't been a budget passed in TWO YEARS!  IL lawmakers are a joke & s/be voted out
Durban doesn't represent the people.  He is just another special interest lawmaker doing pork belly politics.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN Everyone's your enemy that Doesn't kiss that big orange ass of yours #twit
You need to do more than tweet that he is wrong.  If you want my vote again lead a real opposition
Right
he's right, just not in the way he means.
Wrong.
I feel the president is the enemy not the media.
This constant deflecting from your poor work performance isn't working - we know better 
@nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews @CNN Thank you press!! Keep pressing. #NotTheEnemy #FreePress
go give @Sen_JoeManchin a lecture on integrity
Instead of constant politicking, how about you represent your state and get this nuclear waste situation resolved. #doyourjob
He is Richard Nixon redux.
reminds me of the Wizard of Oz when we see behind the curtain, "Nothing to see here!!!!" Wrong!
@PlanetCrusader wrong fake Trump is the enemy of the people that and his cabinet
Right
You are wrong sir. In so many ways.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN stop being a partisan hack, and actually work for the betterment of the ppl
@SherryElser1 @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN thank you. We are relying on Congress to stand strong

#FakePrez, #GroperPrez, #SoCalledPrez, #LyingPrez, #FailingPrez
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN WRONG!!!
@POTUS your just pissed someone is calling them out. How did they label Zimmermann?  #nbc in the 90s with trucks on fire.
@Honey17011 Then the Senate needs to do something to protect "we the people " from this mad man.
please stop this lunatic!
Senator Durban we are pleading with our Sean's to investigate fully the Russia-Trump relationship and to keep pressure on!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN the American people r counting on the press and politicians with integrity
@DrNancyMD president Trump is wrong.  We need the media, sometimes stories get a bit mixed up but we need it. How we know all
.@SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump #wrong and ur not either enemy either, mr.pres. But like anything, that can change. +/- you have the power.
Luckily Illinois and the Senate has the real deal with Sen. Durbin
Sure is a lot of #DJT #tweet #erasing lately! sounds like Donny's on the Shit List!
Could u help @SenSanders sneak a resignation letter onto POTUS's desk? Make it look from Steve Bannon? Would be legal right?
the only person who is fake is @POTUS
I read entire abetter.way I will get least of things.  Medicare & SocSec kept par.  Truly horrified. Self funded retirement
@realDonaldTrump the enemy is sitting in the Oval Office
No Obama left office. Now the ennemy is Dick Durbin.
no you are wrong
Touche
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN Thank God for Freedom of the Press!
I disagree
fix Illinois and quit worrying about twits
you need to use more CAPS and say "very sad" more
Sen.Durbin, please try and find a law, and work bipartisan, to demand a psych. evaluation for Trump. Truly worried about him.
Only if Congress takes one first.
right

CA resident now, but you make me proud to have voted for you in your first senatorial campaign!
Make Chicago Great Again Clown!
you needed !!  Punctuation matters.
Thanks for the WORD! 
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN no sir, u r wrong. Are u okay w fraudulent news? I'm not & neither should u
can congress not censure @realDonaldTrump for any of his blatant lies?
If they could of done that it would of started with Obama's lies.
You must be right.  Oh yeah and on another topic, what happened with the #Swedenincident again?
Called refugees that are not obeying laws. The crime rate are up big time.
there isnt any evidence that crime rates have increased "big time" do some research not just watching #FoxNews
I have! Maybe take your own advice
What real enemy 2 US, is Democrats. Hell bent on Destruction & Derailing Admin. You'll succeed 2 yrs, then 2018 irrelevancy
45 is unfit, unethical and unhinged...#impeach
No Hillary is not the 45 President. But you did describe her well. President Trump 2020!
thank you from 62088
Thank you for representing me in Congress (60657) - please keep up the pressure on GOP, who is 100% behind 45 #resist
So why don't you tell you Senator in AZ? Durbin only cares about those who vote for him. I vote against him.
wrong on so many levels, too many to list
Your wrong is wrong. It's WRONG! Get it right.
shouldn't that be in all caps? Seriously tho please keep fighting and convincing colleagues to do so!
thank you Sir, for standing up for our first amendment freedom of the press.
don't forget freedom of speech in there so both of them are covered.
Thank you.
Disgusting that you still can't wrap it around your pea brain that you lost on 11/8. Work with it or resign. #recalldurbin
U r a US Senator stop playing he said she said do it for the people not for your dam party there is R people in I'll also
This is disturbing behavior and very divisive, seeking only to harm other Americans!

Amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” like they are so original & like no one else is doing it...
@DianneSharma In fact, everything about 45 is wrong, he IS the enemy
this tweet isn't enough, Dick. Our elected officials must stand against attempts to destroy the fabric of our constitution.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN the title is#presidentnotemperor, #readtheconstitution
He's an attention whore.  We're feeding his sick mind.
@CassForHillary This is going to destroy the 1st amendment. Where's Fairness Doctrine now?
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN the man has obviously lost his mind! Do SOMETHING! #SaveUsFromHisDelusion
I'm an American and the lies spewed by you and the MSM are not in my, or any American's, best interest. #notwrong
And members of the press are Americans too, along with those who oppose the nutjob in the Oval. #notadictatorship
Haven't you heard? The "Nutball" is gone. Trump is now YOUR president.
@realDonaldTrump The news gets it right. You are the scourge of the very foundation of our democracy #ProtectFreePress
I think even u tweeted the false AP report. It was false as it was represented as real, only memo 4 discussion. No trust 4 AP
no trust for you either....representing the fine State of Chicago. Great work up there by the way.
@realDonaldTrump U r the enemy of the American people.We rely on media 4 TRUTH;a word absent from ur very limited vocabulary.
.   Not wrong......
Very Wrong @VP @realjimmattis @SenatorCollins @
continue to be the true Patriot you are It is becoming obvious who the political hacks r through the daily deafening silence!
Is it time to dust off that 25th Amendment?
we need a bipartisan senate/ congress to start looking out for this country. is the worst and needs to be held accountable
perfect one-syllable retort
Really? You tweeted a #FakeNews @AP article yourself yesterday Never once checking with the Government as a Senator!
Well if he says Media's our enemy, then the enemy is MY best friend!  Hey, Media?  Wanna go to the brewery this weekend?
I don't know your political views from this tweet, but it's a great one!
Thank you Senator Durbin.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN ,,MSM is the HERO of the people.

I am very frightened because it is clear that Trump is either mentally insane or he is comprised, either way we are in danger
...nope. Trump is correct.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN you are part of the Swamp
what world do you live in Senator, I mean talk show host Durbin
