Tired of the same political game. #confirmgorsuch
I'm proud of you too, @SenatorDurbin
Thank you!
BRAVO!!
Thank you, Senator Durbin!
That's Okay, America Knows that @TheDemocrats Have Absolutely NOTHING to Offer the American People

#AmericaFirst #TCOT #CCOT #MAGA
Thank you for protecting the future of freedom #StopGorsuch
Lotta good that did
Do something. Go talk to your repug colleagues.
Democrats should all be ashamed of themselves
Putz
Find a way to work with GOP & help Illinoisans receive help to pay for healthcare. I don't want a Dem-GOP role reversal like under Obama.
Way to waste tax payers time and money playing partisan politics.
FYI Jeff Merkley is a do nothing Senator for Oregonians another Tower of BABLE Time for Term Limits
your work is appreciated, and like mine - expected to continue. #WeAreEquals #DCisBroken
Thank you
If you didn't want Gorsuch, the Dems & you should have fought Mitch McConnell for blocking Obama's Court pick. You're too late to this party
Thank u Senator
Glad to see you had his back! Progressives need to stand together right now to fight for this country.
Shame on you losers! Biden says duck shouldnt nominate judges,but if dems loses then all rules change.pathetic& completely putried political
Thank you for speaking up against Gorsuch! Repub are stealing seat, Trump admin under investigation for Russian collusion.
Thank you for standing up for what is right. A president under FBI investigation shouldn't get a SCOTUS pick.
We know Gorsuch and Melania share a secret #NoGorsuch #corporatewelfare #60votes #plagiarism #copythat

Thanks for being a voice for all Americans and standing up against this nominee!
Thank you @SenatorDurbin - outstanding support for a crucially important cause.
Thank you Senator(s)
I used to be a constituent of yours. You made me VERY PROUD to be able to say - I voted for that man! Thank You. 
I am SO PROUD OF MY ILLINOIS SENATORS!! @SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth
This was inspiring to all of us, Thank you! We really appreciate your efforts!
Thank you both!  Two Mr. Smiths in Washington!  :)
And now you both know you don't matter
15 hours. Blows my mind. I am so grateful to you. You were INCREDIBLE. Thank you from a CT Democrat abroad.
Thank You!
Two morons! Retire Durbin we need a new senator.
you go Jeff..
Thank you @SenatorDurbin

Thank you Senators!
Obstructionist
Perhaps @SenJeffMerkley watched a few too many West Wing TV shows "wait for another Supreme Court Opening & Nominate Gorsuch & Garland" LOL
#comfirmgorsuch
no reason he shouldn't be confirmed
Thank you Senator Durbin! Please fight for an immediate #IndependentInvestigation immediately!
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you again for your continuing to support blocking Gorsuch & for supporting @SenJeffMerkley. GOP won't have majority for long. 11/2018
Bet you are. It's your only value, standing or sitting, while talking, talking, talking and more talking. Can you hear it...term limits....
Still waiting for you to come out in favor of #Berniecare broheim.
And in other news @SenateDems we're the ones that came up with the Supreme Court rule. You can not have it both wsys
Thank you, Senators, for standing against a judge who hates people with disabilities and people who actually work. #StopGorsuch #StopRussia
...while Chicago burns you're out pulling stunts.
Losers.
Don't give up please,Gorsuch would not be a fair judge.The man in the truck that was about to freeze did it for me.Thank you for all you do.
Thank you, Senators Durbin and Merkeley. Proud Illinoisan here, appreciating your efforts! #StolenSeat #FilibusterGorsuch
Are you proud of Chicago naming a street after savage FALN Terrorist Rivera? SHAMEFUL ACT
American bar association gives Gorsuch its highest rating. "Well-qualified" you're putting party before country.
he's gonna get in when the republicans go "nuclear" but you'd rather them do that so you can bash their decision to do so. Waste of time
Democrats are destroying the democratic process one vote at a time
Thank you @SenatorDurbin for standing up for all of us! #il18iswatching @McLeanCoDems
I almost always agree with you Sen Durbin but not this time. Wrong filibuster hill to die on!
Neil Gorsuch is a moral man of good character and excellent qualifications. If he is not worthy of SCOTUS no one is.
Thank you @DNC @freespeechtv
Please continue to fight the destroyers
