Or you know, you could focus on problems that are affecting real Americans.
I want to know if he's compromised. That outweighs you getting a job.
Compromised in what way? What are the effects? What does it mean? You're spouting buzz words.
if he owes a LOT of 2 Russian banks they have him by the balls. His son said in 08 a lot of  coming from there. RELEASE TAXES!
You're spouting off gibberish you see on the nightly news. How about focus on infrastructure or...things that affect you.
U know what affected me? The Russian spy ship where I live lurking around the nuclear submarine pens. RELEASE TAXES!
So that was becasue of taxes? I guess I don't understand your connection.
If he releases his taxes like promised we could see if he owes money to Russian banks. Like so much it influences decisions
He can't. He filed them in Russia.
Ways and Means Comm has Const. Authorization. Find the bouncing $$ ball from Russia to Trump. We vote 4 you
If you haven't guessed it yet. The Press,Dems, your constituents need more from you. You have access! Use IT
we don't give a dam about his tax returns. Jobs jobs jobs.
OK. But if Russia succeeds in disrupting W democracies & alliances can't grow economy & create jobs
they are not just allies but main training partners. We need people to sell stuff to, no?
Asking won't work. Start impeaching or risk getting primaried.
We need formal process versus a leak where Trump fires people then lies to press. Bad precedent

Please show us your drug test results!


When is @cnn going to start hiring normal, American people? Do you need to marry into a job there? @chuckschumer
GREAT INTERVIEW. I agree trump should show his tax returns Senate/House demand them now. GOP DO YOUR JOB

Stay on point! Trump is lying! Russia/Trump campaign. Only subpoena records and all WH&campaign will get truth
How can Commrade Trump show his taxes if he is tied to Soviets up to his eyeballs.
the IRS could leak his taxes, they are good at that. Get Lois Learner out of retirement. Prosecute him
or shut up. Investigate the law breakers leakers that endanger our national security

How Donald Trump became Deutsche Bank's biggest headache https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/16/how-donald-trump-became-deutsche-bank-biggest-headache â€¦
yes!
he doesn't have to pay why should I!?
I'll just leave this here...
SHOW ME THE TAX CUTS!! that's all WE want right now ....
Oh, so you are a billionaire? A friend of Trump's? Because I have yet to see any legislation saying middle class is getting that.
not a billionaire, not a friend of Trump but the optimism in SB right now is infectious #gonnahappen
MSM Obama friendly. MSM now Trump unfriendly. Just watch Jake and you'll now why. Jake and his panel vested.
: You didn't care about The Clinton Foundation Pay to Play. I don't care about Trump tax returns.
lol!
We don't care!!!!
I cd care less abt his returns. I want a tough leader. Not the namby pamby one we had for 8 yrs
Agreed. The tantrum class of elites is in search of a scandal. They're desperate.
They actually embarass us all.
Demand them. Find whatever legal recourse we have to get them.  Someone can look at them, have them do it!
Who gives a rip any tax returns. We want a leader not afraid to expose the BS in DC
that's funny heidi but we need to see what's going on in our country dear.
For the first time in 8 yrs we are seeing work being done.
We all want this. National security issue.
@realDonaldTrump is too much of a coward to release his tax returns.
AGREED.
Excellent report with Senator Durbin.
Wrong senator! No other president was forced to show their return. And Jake just let him say that 
Yes, let's see what the true nature of this Russia-loving prez.
We see it already. Just find it hard to believe he is POTUS  USA is only his piggy bank
