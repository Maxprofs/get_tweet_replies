Iâ€™ll also discuss the importance of @TheJusticeDept serving the American people, not just the President
. They do NOT, I repeat do NOT, stand for ALL Americans Thank you very much.
. That what we are doing moron. Hard to argue with someone so irrational.
Very proud. As IL Dem voter (only exceptions in 30 yrs voting were Topinka, Edgar) I stand w/ you.  Now help banish Rauner.
How much has Soros & Soros funded groups contributed to you over the years this might help explain your world view
Geez. Just announce the position via all media. don't tease it in a tweet.
it better be against Sessions
Just called the office to thank you for the job you did today with Sessions. Please keep at it, there is a lot of smoke.
Watched this today with many of my coworkers. Thank you for standing up for minority rights. We're with you! #StopSessions
As senator you represent the PEOPLE'S position. We the people elected a president who chose Sessions. Please confirm.
I wish you showed this kind of passion representing the people of the South Side of Chicago & Southern Illinois
Job well done, Senator.
Thank you!
You So called Democrats just don't get what happened in Nov. Keep doing what your doing and you'll loose more seats in 2018
Really? While Republicans blocked a legitimately elected President's nominations, it was fine?
What Nomination? If your talk SCOTUS in 80 a sitting POTUS in the last year of term put a nomination in.
You need to RESIST. All Illinois Voters know you stand for Them. Stay Strong Resist Trump. He's Nuts.
I'm against him
Thank you for opposing Jeff Sessions. That's the Senator that has earned my vote. Keep it up.

I have always admired your principles.  Can you and other Dems do anything to stop this train wreck we are living thru?

THANK YOU!! Sessions is an incompetent monster

I watched and you are why we need term limits. Time for you to ride off into the sunset.
I'm so proud of you 
I'm sure that was not easy due to your personal relationship
The very fact you won't announce your position until then tells me you are voting for Sessions. I'll never vote for you again

Watching now. Thank you for your very strong statements so far. Hoping a NO vote from you on Sessions is imminent
The hack job u did on Jeff Sessions is horrible. Globalism has ruined so many low income Americans, & u turned it into racism
Just say no.
The sentences for Crack coca in was for DEALERS, not users. Where's ur sympathy for lives ruined by crack. U r disgusting
These sentences saved hundreds of lives.
Please vote NO! Unfit to serve as AG.
The Cuban refugees weren't trying to KILL us. We weren't at war with Cuban's, but we r at war with RADICAL ISLAMISTS! #MAGA
.@SenatorDurbin better be a no or we will find another Senator. Plenty of options in IL.
Senator you are a credit to the state of Illinois and your country. #stopsessions
you're cheap pathetic attempt to blame @SenatorSessions for your demagoguery is exactly why the Democrats fail
Trump's ban of the 7 countries r the same 7 countries Obama banned for 6 MONTHS  Ur, sir, r an ignoramus:& unfair apologize
Great speech right now. We are with you!
Pathetic powerless Dems kicking and screaming like 2 year old children!
Illinois resident proud to have a senator that stands up for constitution, American people and #checks&balances
vote to confirm Jeff Sessions. Stop grandstanding!
vote No on senator Sessions!! #resist
Comparing Sessions to Nixon is, completely wrong. & ludicrous.
IL voter working in Canada expecting both my Sens to vote no. Extra points if you vote "Nyet" so Tovarich Trump will get it
is misleading and disturbing -
Another embarrassing liberal hack who has laid his integrity on the alter of democratic cultism. Shame on you!
Thank you @SenatorDurbin for your clarity & heartfelt stand against #AG nominee @SenatorSessions #StopSessions @SenateDems @SenatorLeahy
John Lewis is a DISGRACE a lying RACIST and should lose his job. And Sally Yates has no Integrity no Character a DISGRACE
I hope it's no.
we are counting on you to as always stand w the constitution and the people of the US - no to #sessions
Play hardball on Sessions. Shut Senate down if you have to. He has no business being AG. NO reason to vote for him.
Tried to call you this morning to ask for 'No', but the lines were busy and the mailbox was full. Please Vote No.
It should be no!  We need an independent strong enuf to stand up to potus firings!  He thinks hes in celebrity apprentice!
Partisan Politics in full display. Disgusting!

Hopefully you will vote No.
