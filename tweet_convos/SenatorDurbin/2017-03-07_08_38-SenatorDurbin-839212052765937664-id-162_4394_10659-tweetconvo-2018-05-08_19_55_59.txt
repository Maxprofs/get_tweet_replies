Yes, a peaceful protest that does not affect other American's rights.
Do not try to whitesplain protest to @repjohnlewis.  And, reviewing your other tweets: _stop promoting bigotry_.
Race is not an issue, the government not doing their jobs is...
Yes, I read that. Not a science geek. Just a plumber. Lol

#Vault7 Thanks Obummer & CIA!!! #MAGA FO LIFE BIATCH!!!

You truly are a liberal LEMMING!!! I wish you DOPES could think independently from the collective for once!! #MAGA

Only the Almighty God can fix our devious land. March with God and for God and more of his grace and favor will fall on us.
@_wapaa_ honest Al Sharpton was missing in the March, too much work.

all you know is just to MARCH, then what?? That match was 40 years ago.. Now what?? Still marching....
Thank you, Sir, for the light you have brought to this nation! May it SHINE ALWAYS!
Just seen @repjohnlewis casually strolling thru
@KamalaHarris I'm sure the pitter patter of little feet over at the CIA are deafening today? Are you OK with these revelations
John, time to move on from Selma , there are more pressing problems. Or is what you did 40 years ago all you got?
Such a great picture.....Ah, I remember it will.
Success is not living in the past. U were elected to help people NOW. All people. QUIT SHUTTING PEOPLE DOWN. #LEADERSHIP  #INCLUSIVE
I appreciate what u did back in the day, but why dont u try to help those people in your district that are strugging. Yesterday is over
I wholeheartedly agree. The thunderous steps of the Trump movement were a sound that I will never forget.
To ease the ill effects of Trumpitis we march, rally, write, call & tweet til the nightmare is over! Keep fighting!
Thank you sir, for your lifetime of service in the CAUSE. Makin' that #GoodTrouble all your life. Bless you.
new Democratic party is now known as the Progressive Marxist Fascist party.  Still can't figure out why lost.
We're TIRED of marching big bro...our feet & minds are tired
YES! #GoodTrouble is such a perfect hashtag! So fitting. So inspiring.
@TomPerez especially when it's back to Mexico 
too bad you have become a national disgrace. DMLKjr would be ashamed of what you've become.
we owe you and others so much for making our country better!
@TomPerez why didn't they all march to the voting booth back in Nov.
By God, we are trying!  Lead us on.
Yes this means getting off the tablet and going outside !
The 60s called & want you back.
Will the maniacal tweets from DJT be a part of National Record. Will records be sent to NARA?
@jack Looks like Iran circa 1978. Look at them now.
@TomPerez everyone wants to live back in the day. But Ppl need to be liberated from famine, slavery not 1st world problems
We must NOT wear down or become weary.Time for this country to move mountains and knock down walls.For us ALL
@TomPerez The power of the people always prevail!
thank you for your years of dedication and service
would you please run for president?
@Alt_DeptofED we will continue the fight we will march peacefully into the night for the glory of the red white and blue
Thank you Congressman Lewis for all that you have sacrificed and achieved for our country. We all owe you our gratitude
No more deafening case that a Congressman who doesn't pay his taxes.
A group of @UofSC students marched today on this same bridge that you did 52 yrs. ago. Thank you for paving the way!!

you are an inspiration and a champion of Social justice. Thank you for your sacrifices in the name of freedom
John Lewis, ur a puke. How many of these young people know you support morris Dees? And do they know his past?
ur a hypocrite and a joke. Ur time has passed an now ur a washed up has been
Disagree. Cheering crowds chanting 'USA' at a Trump rally is a much more beautiful sound to millions of patriotic Americans.
Thank you for all you've done for our country.  Your actions have led the way for so much.
@SenatorDurbin Democrats support killing unwanted unborn minority's children...disproportionately more than whites!
@SenatorDurbin FORGET that it was conservative Republicans who freed them from Democrat slave holders.
@SenatorDurbin BUT trump thinks it's all For him! No one is telling him he "sucks"! Cra cra lost by 3mil n now 15mil off ACA!!
@KamalaHarris Amen Brother. The American people have had enough. We're coming to take back our country. We need all your help!
#MarchOn
Thank you for being such a strong voice for this country ..You're a hero for civil rights ..#RESPECT.
picked up your autobiography Walk with the Wind this week. Great man!
why are we spending or wasting Congress time I stupid things again
Do you know "sit down Black" from his early days in the civil rights movement?  Hats off to civil rights pioneers.
@KamalaHarris yea but what about glass breaking, cars on fire, bricks flying, TVs running down street, & thugs fighting police
still fundraising from your March 50 years ago, you political hack?
Thank you.  I remember this march and have always appreciated all you have done and what you will do for us.
I just would like to tell you how sorry I am. Those people will have to explain, when they meet their maker. God Bless !
@RogueAltGov republicans across the country are trying to criminalize marching while allowing or condoning drives no through
@jack Incredible! Thank u for all you've done to fight for the underprivileged.
@sharonstone 
@Alt_DeptofED we will resist.
Sadly because Breitbart was allowed to infiltrate the White House, they can now claim that photo a Fake, that those were paid protesters...
@KamalaHarris Congressman Lewis you are my hero and a national treasure.  Thank you!
@rthompson1138 thank you
ty. This gave me strength today.
There's a bunch of determined people marching on Washington right now. Maybe you & the media didn't get the memo.

I took my children across the bridge over Christmas break.  I admire you greatly.
You are an inspiration.

HOWEVER, IF THE SOUND OF DETERMINED PPL INCLUDE THE SUBVERSION OF OUR GOVERNMENT THEN A LINE HAS TO BE DRAWN IN THE SAND
Too bad #regressive dems cant march peacefully anymore they riot and destroy property. #Selma52
