So proud to be part of a company who stands up for #DefendDACA
Sorry to hear this. More good paying jobs for American citizens would be nice.
Go get them dreamers are not taking them away from anybody. They have the willing to prepare and to for it. It's not handle for them.
@MiaDi23 what you said makes absolutely no sense.
Read then you'll understand
What are you doing talking to the cheap chatbot?
Slave labor
THANK YOU Mr. President Smith for standing up for #DREAMers
Thank you Brad. This type of commitment to our fellow employees is a big part of what makes Microsoft great!
That's great, Brad. How much is Microsoft donating to harvey victims? I missed that... 
Guess how many daca illegal dreamers r working for Microsoft?? Zero.99 percent are working low skill jobs and taking from Americans.fact.
Again with the same comment. They can work legally!! Go get a book 
If most dacas were high skilled we wouldnt be bringing in so many Indians to the u.s to work at Microsoft Hi my name is Bob I'm from india
What legal rights does Microsoft have where dreamers are involved? The "D" in DACA is "deferred" not "permanent"
You should try writing some decent software for once.
#Microsoft, #Facebook, and #CNN are enemies of the American nation & the rule of law. They deserve to be treated accordingly. #MAGA RT
Yes Dreamers do help us, but Pres Ignorant is playing to his ignorant base, so doesn't care about the rest of us.
How sad.lgal or not, they r human beings, often in need of help & nurturing. Wht happned 2 give me your tired, your hungry, etc.
How about standing by real Americans who obey the law? #BuildTheWall #SendThemBack. Tired of rich elitist virtue signaling morons.
They came here as kids. They didn't disobey any laws. Why do you want to punish them for something they had no part of?
What are you doing talking to a chatbot?
So how hard is it to be legal?
How many dreamers illegals working at Microsoft??? Zero. Fact.probably have 10 engineers and lawyers and the rest r taking us low skill jobs
Dreamers can work legally hun
No shit they can work illegally.they taken 700,000 low skill jobs from AmericansThese are the most neded jobs.60+ mil Americans on foodstamp
How come, young undocumented under daca are working and studying like nothing. But Americans born here can't? #CommonSense
Stand with #Dreamers #DACA "@BradSmi https://twitter.com/MagaliLin/timelines/906225985888157696 …
Microsoft stands with profit driven virtue signalling.  You are fooling no one.
Yes! These are the personification of the immigrants Trump claims to want to admit to US--all DREAMers should be immediately naturalized.
Why?  Why do they get a free pass and other have to wait and work for it?
#NativeAmericans are going to stand against you for standing against Native Americans and all Americans. #DACAIsIllegalToo
You mean helping you keep cheap labor?
The only thing you like about #dreamers is they will work for less money.  Americans don't want the jobs, who will pick the cotton
And their company.
Time to #Boycott Microsoft & switch to #Lenux
Cool, what’s it based on? Can it run a winmodem natively?
, @microsoft is laying off THOUSANDS of employees, destroying THOUSANDS of lives. You have NO leg to stand no here, NONE.
Fed has been broken can we break all Fed Laws per your stand Brad Smith
They are our future.
Your future is children illegally smuggled into the US by criminals?  What a weird future you have for yourself.
How about the economies of the countries their parents fled - who is doing anything to compel the people to stay? Why do they flee?
Thank you @Microsoft
YES!
@realDonaldTrump good news I found 27 new jobs for Americans once DACA is terminated. @pnehlen @ChuckGrassley @SebGorka
Thank you for your support
See u can be a big business and have morals
We have millions of American citizens that would love to help make our country thrive. Try hiring them bigshot
Opinion: ....your products, so buggy and complicated and highly vulnerable to virus'.  Quit the PC years and years ago.

Thanks for this.
#keepDACA
Getting identity papers and applying for work (DACA) takes jobs that could be filled by black Americans.  Stop taking OPPORTUNITIES from US
Opportunity for black Americans? Lol. No sense.
Send the big lobbyists!!!
Remember when Microsoft didn't get political and just focused on making crappy software?
Group think
Any other law breaking you are ok with?  Software piracy? Hacking? Anything?
How did these kids break the law? Explain please?
Are they legally in the country?  The answer is either A) yes or B) no. There is no option C

there are dreamers and citizens who have contributed yes I'm not an identity politician
you don't live in my community,.  in my community MS-13 gang members are Obamas #DREAMers
Part of a gang = you loose daca and get deported. However I'll be curious how do you know the legal status of members of a gang?
How much money in taxes are you saving?
