White House wants to cut NIH budget by $1.2B *this year*, but also take $300M+ out of CDC public health programs. https://twitter.com/BresPolitico/status/846556957972549633 â€¦
@Christy41874560 Shameful
Unreal how much havoc, hate and chaos they can create just by making a threat to do something #TrumpRussia
I do not want my money spent on these programs, period. We are trillions in dept! Nuts!!!!
CDC is the center fur disease control ignoramus
Trump is an antivaxxer. He has absolutely no business deciding the funding of public health measures. @SenatorDurbin @WolfNW
That's the POTUS does
Thank you @SenatorDurbin We appreciate you fighting for the good of our citizens. @joniernst should take lessons. @oufenix
consolidate buildings and services open up more to private sector drain the swamp
Well, that's terrifying.
@maddow if they can't kill us one way,they'll find another.
these people are do reckless with our lives, health, air & water.
Elections have consequences, Dickey!
20T in debt. U want to keep it, fine. Abolish the capital police. That's a money drain if there ever was one. Do contract grd
Why doesn't he cut his golfing, that would save a bundle.
one weekend would pay for pbs fir a year!  really? Why aren't more people pissed? USA  come on!!
NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE!!!!!! Epidemics/Pandemics are waiting to happen without CDC and NIH research and programs
@LOLGOP My husband is an NIH-funded scientist doing important work. Don't let them do this!
@maddow nooooooooooo
Thank you @SenatorDurbin for fighting #CorruptTrump @realDonaldTrump is spending more paying his golf course illegally than this budget.
CDC is a drug company killing maiming with #vaccines..#demexit.. u r too corrupt
@__BHB__ Does Trump have on his agenda bringing back AIDS and cholera?
@maddow VP Biden might want a word or two. Annihilation of cancer research is another tool in GOP toolbox to kill Americans.
There is a frightening theme here. Everything they touch has profound effect on the 99% while 1% is "off limits". 
@CNN
that's how the greedy rich became rich.it's them and no one else.it's the American way,pray for divine interv
@maddow @ddiamond this is not right. Dont let it happen
I'll vote for anyone that gets rid of the waste fraud and abuse
@maddow Please hold firm on this. We desperately need these public health institutions.
Good job, Senator.  Proud to have you represent me.
Please continue to fight for NIH and health research funding in general.  Thank you for your efforts in the face of adversity
@macci624 geezus god no !!!!!!!

@maddow Just say NO! Like the old drug campaign.
Trying their best to destroy the American health care system.
IMPEACH!!!
@Maggyw519 what could go wrong....
What in the name of heaven...and I do mean in the name of heaven?
that was succinct, Senator. Back it up.
Dangerous to cut public health funds! We don't need another Spanish Flu, Polio or Ebola.
@maddow Dems gave Trumplicans control. Lesson learned? We'll see in upcoming elections at all levels. RISE DEMS!
keep up the great work!  No gorsuch and it's okay to be the party of no when saying yes screws people
horrible budget process starting
@KatCapps What could go wrong if he shuts down the CDC?
now your Twitter game improves  Please keep after them!
Yep.  global connectivity increases the risk of a pandemic exponentially -  they are akin to Spanish Influenza on steroids
Please continue to have our backs - we need you here in Illinois!
Sounds like a smart plan to me!
@maddow Wow!! These R's don't care at all about the ppl in this country who benefit from public health programs and research.
Mental Health cruelty
my God they're actively working against health of US citizens.
@maddow @ddiamond were 11 $trillion in debt dummies. Gotta cut some unnecessary spending sooner or later.
@maddow Going backwards, making destructive decisions, endangers all American citizens.
Thank you, Senator Durbin!
$20 Trillion in debt what programs wou YOU cut to save these programs? Some cuts have to occure now.
Big Nope from us. #SanctuaryCities defunding #Wall #TaxCuts for Mil #Nunes spearheading #Treason also NOPE
Fight this regimes agenda sir. #RESISTANCE #ImpeachTrump
So what does he plan to do about those of us whose jobs depend on NIH funding? Retrain us to build walls?
Yes
@maddow A true Horror Show is in the White House. Stop the madness please.
These people are idiots. How on earth did we end up with them running our country?
Cut expenses 4 Palm Beach&Manhattan. We shouldn't pay 4 golfing&Trump Tower penthouse.
...yep.
Any word on how this would impact the BRAIN initiative? We already know Trump doesn't have one. @EpilepsyFdn 

https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/ 
Create a bill that Presidents, themselves, pay for any non-essential trips & for spouses who live other than WH. This would help w/ budgets
@maddow trump is going to skin this country to the bare bones and then overthrow it.
Hi, will you try talking to @SenJohnThune and @SenatorRounds?

They are confused. They think they work for GOP, not us.

Thx
Thank you protecting our health!
@maddow @ddiamond #fakenews #releasethehannitytape
@BMLewis2 Another colossally short sighted ide out of Trump's wrecking ball of a WH  #MakeAmericaSickAgain
@maddow And we can spend millions for weekend & business trips for Trump & kids.
@ddiamond Donald Trump wants to be President as well as a sociopathic, self-serving, careless, oligarch...NOPE!
I need this kind of spending to get votes from my friends on the dole
@fussybritches Is this to fund his numerous golf trips and the fact his wife and son staying in NY?
Independent special prosecutor. NOW.
please don't let this happen
@maddow impeach
keep up the good work Senator!

I am fed up with the people who voted this  in seeing what he's doing and still supporting him as if they are blind.
Agreed...no cuts here! Healthcare needs more not less money! Thank Sen Durbin.
Schumer & McConnell (aka Mean Old Turtle) need to sit DJT back at that tiny desk & teach him some budget 'rithmatic!
UNBELIEVABLE THIS ADMINISTRATION IS!! WHEN IS ENOUGH???
@maddow @POTUS needs funding for the wall
Thank you for standing against this ridiculousness. Proud to have you as my Senator. Stay strong. This won't be easy.
@maddow @ddiamond thank you Senator from   Illinois
please help get that bad hombre out of the WH. He's bad for America.
Thee "Let's Destroy-Blow Things Up" Plan of the Magnanimous Duo of #BannonAndTrump. Unacceptable, and more. Makes One Ill.
Damn right, NOPE
@maddow WTF? And discreetly divert it to his own businesses?
@maddow ...what are these ppl thinking??? 
Thank you Senator.
@maddow we need to be prepared for this not cutting the CDC & NIH. Important work being done ALZ at Wash U. Important
@maddow Senator here in the Metro East the Stl Post Dispatch reported the bi-state area is a possible future Zika hotspot.
Best answer ever! " Nope "
@maddow NH pays no tax
You never know! life has a way of surprising all of us, doesn't it?
Agreed. Cutting NIH and CDC funds would raise costs of vaccinations. That's how they are planning a Obamacare crash. Just no.
Millions of video and documented instances we have become free test subjects at our own cost to make a few rich
Your #Obamacare has helped this movement, Media is in bed with this industry/control/monetary system '
give people a little and take more than can be noticed'
@justmenancyd vote no. this is crazy Senator Durban Trump has to be removed we as a country are in bad shape Impeach Trump.
@maddow So Trump must be running out of taxpayers money for his weekly golf vacations so he's making cuts to NIH & CDC prog.
Well..I think I now have a little bit of a crush on Dick Durbin  :)  Thank you, sir, for standing up for what is right.
.@SenatorDurbin WTF is wrong with these people?
a cut here & a cut there is a padding for Their pockets .The white house is 1 BIG joke
What can we do to help?
@maddow @ddiamond You are a complete embarrassment.  Can't this State do better.
We must defend science and disease research!
Dude I'm excited. I'm buying MLB the Show. Keep towing your party lines. No pizza for Podesta.
@maddow Can the orange man say "Ebola"?
thank you! That's exactly the response we need to hear.
@maddow  we need senators with backbone. Those willing to stand up for what is right instead of partisanship.
@maddow thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator!
@maddow thank you Senator

@maddow a president under investigation for treason shouldn't be allowed to do nothing but campaign speeches to his cult
@maddow @ddiamond Time to call for Trump's impeachment.
@maddow Please make sure this does NOT happen senator!!
@maddow You would think someone with such a germ phobia would understand the importance of health. But not POTUS !
@maddow Thank you Both! Counting on you Senator!
@maddow Crazy. What about the next epidemic? Hasnt this man heard of proactive?
@ddiamond 
Not that long ago, Trump was freaking out about Ebola. Now? Cut CDC! Dangerous.
@maddow Thank you for standing up for the needs of Americans
Hell we won't need Healthcare, we will all die from some pandemic left up to this WH! 45 and his minions have to go! #RESIST
But we have money for the WALL NUTS
We Demand Open Senate Investigations 
And a Special Prosecutor 
NOW....
@maddow Trump has ushered in an age of low bar heartless and corrupt MADNESS.
This gets more insane everyday.
That is outrageous and wrong!
@maddow yes what will it take for us to help??
If #TheDon doesn't cut the @NIH budget then how else can he provide aid and comfort to terrorists plotting #bioterror attacks?
@maddow double nope!
@maddow  Oh hell no.
I Hold that thought, Senator. Don't let this happen!
WHAT? We need to stop the madness? Who can we help?? Please advise!
Yep! $20 Trillion in debt. Past time to rein in this kind of spending.
Trump folded like a cheap suit on his Deathcare Plan. Just like he will on everything else. Loser
Because when Bird Flu breaks out who'll need them?
