We'd best check with some alternative experts; right @ReganLieutenant & @chrlitt? @EdDarrell @NASA @BruceEnberg @NASAGISS @NOAA
So? Al Gore said we would pass the point of no return in 2015. Now what?
And how can you prove that we haven't? I guess when humans 'pass'?
@ReganLieutenant @chrlitt @EdDarrell @NASA @BruceEnberg @NASAGISS @NOAA
(Then what is Algebra for?) Enough of your negativity, because Earth's positively warmer.
@ReganLieutenant @chrlitt @EdDarrell @BruceEnberg
So? Why?
@EdDarrell @BruceEnberg
Ask your grandkids what they'll miss on Earth because you mistook weather for climate.
Oh, OK.

We missed Al Gore's scientific deadline so chill out (pardon the pun.)
sounds like u r cherry picking facts. How much research did u actually conduct urself to know this?
When the average redneck's "common sense" is worth more than decades of research 
Single reason people deny it is profit! You are ill-informed!
Yup!I was proud to stand with those that support human rights. You?
@WeNeededHillary @NASAGISS @NOAA #climate chance not a hoax.
@StationCDRKelly @NASAGISS @NOAA Is this from exposure to radiation? The earth changes faster and slower than our conprehension....
this is fixable

We've had satellites far longer than I ever could have imagined...
Translation: "I don't know about ice core analysis because I'm not educated because I live in america".
It...was...a....joke.
Ahhh sorry, nevermind then! Many people say that kind of stuff very seriously, unfortunately :(
But it snowed...somewhere. So global warming is a hoax. Oy vey. 
We can't just find another planet. We need to support EPA, No fossil fuel. Thanks to NASA for all info. Obtained.
@TheobaldSprague @NASAGISS @NOAA How long has the trend of "adjusting" old temperature data lasted?
How can people not see this.  And to think that this is not a "Huge" problem, makes me mad.  Wake Up. The End is near.
the fact is

So I can understand with the appropriate context, are you stating last year was the warmest Earth has ever been?
You bet! Finally somebody gets it.
That can't be right. It was really cold this year in Cincinnati. (Sadly, I have to let people know this is sarcasm)
LOL! That's funny... and sad.
the real fun starts when global cooling happens ;)
Snow castles rock!
Climate deniers are on par with the flat earth,evolution is just a theory crowd of willfully ignorant conspiracy nuts
whatever you say, genius:
Ahh a peer reviewed respected news outlet... What do you hope to gain by denying real science?
I guess these 31,000 scientists don't believe in science either:
http://www.petitionproject.org 
"scientists" with degrees from Trump University don't count. Nor do those paid by the oil industry.
I guess only left wing commie professors have agendas.
Majority, over 90% of climate scientists in agreement. What do you have to gain by denying this?
because 90% of them are left wing global warming loons. Of course they agree with each other.
2017 is not following the same pattern though. It's bloody freezing right now and I left my gloves and hat at home.
• It's winter 
• We're only 18 days into the year, far too early to judge any real patterns
thanks for clarifying
what satellites were monitoring this from 1890-1950?
Hi James, there's a bit of info on this here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record …
Never believe Wikipedia. Who are the authors? Encyclopedia Britannica will do better.
Fair enough, was just quickly finding info. Here's another:
there were books in the 1960s at my University. All nothing new, but forgotten
Sorry, don't understand what you mean?
What changes during time the climate & the weather. > Calder, The Environment Game, 1967
Still not quite clear what point you are making?
.@NASA @WeNeededHillary @NASAGISS @NOAA I work for govt to justify their budget they better damn well get in line #Trump #love #cute #tbt
.@NASA @WeNeededHillary @NASAGISS @NOAA Gore  made 10s of Millions duping public w/ carbon credits the govt wants to do the same thing
@WeNeededHillary @NASAGISS @NOAA There is no climate change! #alternativefacts #alternatefacts
@WeNeededHillary @NASAGISS @NOAA Shhhhh it was alt-cold.  #alternativefacts @KellyannePolls @chucktodd
Que tristeza que nuestra especie agrave severamente el calentamiento global con tanta contaminacióm
@ChelseaClinton @NASAGISS @NOAA #FakeNews
@StationCDRKelly @NASAGISS @NOAA
The saddest thing about this is: People think scientists will get money once people do something about climate change. What? How? smh
And how much worse is your life going to get if we accept climate change? Zero. It would most likely just improve it, so why fight it?

so，our plant become more hot.but what we can do?
@StationCDRKelly @NASAGISS @NOAA WHERE ?? Not in Nevada! It's C C C OLD ! I would welcome some of that warming .
@hayatacademyrke @NASAGISS @NOAA
@StationCDRKelly @NASAGISS @NOAA the worst that can happen is the extinction of human race and all life on  but the itself will be 
Any comment @HouseScience?
It seems that AL Gore's "Nobel Peace Prize" winning research has fallen upon deaf ears! Along with the 2000 election!
nothing is wrong with the  world  n earth,,,, is type n kind of people living in it that F#$@*@$ it up for  other
Danger is agriculture, not flooding. Iowa becomes Arizona, it's over. When corn belt goes, humans also go extinct
thanks for all your work
What are the odds this is not caused by man?  Rhetorical question, it is.
So we're going to wait until it's to late to even agree?
plz show a model of earth in 20 years at the current pace of warming
and yet conservatives still won't admit that climate change is real
BULL SHIT ! This plant been changing sense the begaining
best wishes
I call bullshit. what about this?:
http://www.sahistorians.org.au/175/chronology/january/12-january-1939-heatwave.shtml …
why no record temps in the 1950's, 60's & 70's?
Most people don’t care about a warming trend or if the condition even exists which is why pollution continues unabated
And Princess Chelsea was so so so worried that she decided to never take another private jet again....
@cathmckenna @NASAGISS @NOAA if you actually showed that that map showed 1 degree c change would any one pay attention?
@cathmckenna @NASAGISS @NOAA seriously, a map of the world that gets darker as the years go by? What's the scale? How many degrees?
Is it an anomaly or is it natural? Florida has been extremely hot this wintr. I hope the patterns chanj soon. 
#warming  #records broken
did you know we just came out of an ice age 200 years ago.what was the reason?? No cars or major industry Hmmm ???
A lot of steps have been taken, but not much we can do about China's industrialization.
Well at least there's no need to have code blue shelters for the homeless anymore. Not like trump & his cronies would fund it anyway...
@isaacBIOvega @NASAGISS @NOAA global warming is hoax!!!!!
Superb job of NASA Ames Iowa St suite a whole world in this thread is looking to Best regards to the next level
@McLarenChandler @NASAGISS @NOAA typical BC'er... Come to Alberta, still cold in the winter time! #GlobalWarmingIsAHoax
how many inches of global warming have you shovelled this winter, eh bud??
Interesting facts
@cathmckenna @NASAGISS @NOAA no research done climate Barbie believes everything she reads while flying around the globe - hypocrites
@chelseaclinton Yet that dumb oaf Trump denies climate change is happening! He's a danger to this planet!
温暖化？
such BS
I how u have data from all over the frm 1880 and made it look so significant. *sarc*
#MY__FRIEND  watch please  https://youtu.be/tpvpiBiuki4?t=1765 …
Thank you for bringing this to our attention, decades of data we should all be aeare of.
... we are on our own people... be smart and strong, as your forefathers and maybe this nation, this species, survives.
, recall bias.. do the research and make your own conclusion. Govt is too busy with its constituents to worry about u.
, you'll never see a govt ad... facts are a warning people; don't be scared, be prepared... things are changing.
Maybe you and some other agencies should stop poking holes in the atmosphere.
Thanks!!
Everyone needs to help in what ever way they can. We are nature and we are killing ourselves.
Thanks to "geoengineering"... also known as... CHEMTRAILS. Wake up people.
fake news
@danielbowen @NASAGISS @NOAA agh but it's not real! 
Might as well b movie w/ pizza 4 all the difference imminent disaster means 2 most people.Glad I'm 2 old 2 care.
everything to help government extort taxes from people.We don't know what to do about climate, but we can tax people
why does it all of the sudden get warmer, ah, the rules changed, now they include the ocean, you fucking s o b's
Thanks for critical measures. Not sure how to respond to head of state Exxon oil CEO, all the lies and damage so far.

thinking they control the weather my old home cleared native cedar 4 palms 2 make it
Palm Springs
gone with deed
cats
ošklivý pohled na změny,které se dotýkají każdého z nás.
any chance this could be a direct result of increased cellular access.   Like a computer heats up a room...?
@ChelseaClinton republicans don't care about the future generations even their own just greet money big corporations deals
@SenatorDurbin @NASAGISS @NOAA have you seen China's environmental record not to mention human rights
And yet next #President @RealDonaldTrump is a #ClimateChangeDenier  #DonaldTrump #ClimateChange #fail
@SenatorDurbin @NASAGISS @NOAA Much/most of fossil fuel use is related to China's economic expansion..US has dropped precipitously!!!!
@SenatorDurbin @NASAGISS @NOAA maybe we need to back off on the pollution controls now that engines burn much cleaner fuels
@SenatorDurbin @NASAGISS @NOAA remember when catalytic converters were mandated on cars to reduce pollution and emit harmless CO2?!?!
@SenatorDurbin @NASAGISS @NOAA how much was caused by increased solar radiation?
You don't need tell me this fact because I have felt the high temperature in Xiamen……
global warming is real. How can we stop it?
@VonoxNL @NASAGISS @NOAA Wow
cc @Eyaaaad 
ممكن توضح هذا الفيديو بتغريده
What year did the ice age end? The ice has been melting and will continue to do so until the next freeze cycle. $.02
our planet has been going through climate changes since it's inception, let's figure out how to cope with the changes
@SenatorDurbin @NASAGISS @NOAA can NASA tell us what caused the glaciers to melt, when it happened and if it was man caused?
Do you know the earth & sun are getting closer? Also the earth is over 5 billion y/o? 3 years isnt much of a trend.
makes so much anger from me it's dangerous
@StationCDRKelly @NASAGISS @NOAA you are forgetting this: Facts don't matter!
Sin olvidar que después calor viene desecación y desertización,y x último el frío
NASA, please explain to me why 2016 was the hottest year around the globe
That is very scary... We need to make changes fast before the earth we know will turn to a wasteland...

everyone concerned should go vegan https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/03/eating-less-meat-curb-climate-change … 
@StationCDRKelly @NASAGISS @NOAA On RECORD, that's not long in life of planet. What was it like 3000 years ago? 200yrs?
ez mem igaz önök hazudnak a föld letért a pájáril egyszer a másik a nap össze omloban van kb 30 év és felroban
Homo apatheticus.
@StationCDRKelly @NASAGISS @NOAA @realDonaldTrump ya heard
@KFILE Perhaps the EPA pick would like to learn from the experts.
@StationCDRKelly @NASAGISS @NOAA yes sir cpl.Scott USMC
we don't have enough data to fully understand all of the measures... do we?
@StationCDRKelly @NASAGISS @NOAA How has the earth done this before . Do we even know? The Earth will do as it pleases always.
PEOPLE will do as they please, then have bad Ah, Crap! moment of revelation.
are you guys still going back and changing the temp records from the past?
Trumps climate policies will set the U.S. back ten yrs. the Future is Clean Energy, not Coal, Oil , Russian Oil, Tillerson.
@KidCraig @NASAGISS @NOAA Perfect. I'll take it. No snow shoveling is good shoveling. And it's natural. Not man made. We're too small
You are definitely small. But billions cooking meat 4 dinner and using AC are y-huge.
I disagree. Look at the earth as a whole. Zoom in on Tokyo for example on maps then zoom way out
Those who will not learn, will pay in the end.
You're not kidding. It's costing a lot of people a lot of money for this farce.
We don't believe you - Just more Liberal lies...
@TheTomGeorge @NASAGISS @NOAA 

Yeah, we know. 
-Las Vegas
it's not a good side.
I remember a time when NASA used science.
simple not true.
Temps have not risen over the last 18 years
.. time we took notice & acted @joshivinay @yatinmeher
obviously
and so did Mars, and Jupiter, and Saturn, the whole solar system. Galactic central sun anyone?
Educate new POTUS.
have not been keeping a record very long then.
@realDonaldTrump  How about u just take the credit 4 saying u discovered global warming? Would it make it real then?
Not in Idaho lol
Stick to space exploration, keep out of politics.
~1.9° since 1880? Not to be ignorant to this, or any solutions, but that doesn't seem extreme.
https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive 
sure felt like it! These summers are getting unbearable

thank you for all your hard work! Some people will never understand facts and science.
how can this be!! global warming is a myth
*sarcasm*
we all agree that human activity contributes to the change in climate. but what percentage is natural vs. human
is this "FAKE NEWS" @realDonaldTrump ?
my god, people are stupid it's scary. Why don't study, do research and then speak? Donald Trump sindrome!
records  r set to breake
And still people believe climate change is just a hoax. Seriously, people should start accepting it's happening!
@CumbriaWeather
2016: Deaths, #brexit, & this "@NASA: 2016 was the hottest year on record, continuing a decades-long warming trend https://twitter.com/i/web/status/821750019099398145 …"
FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS! x"D
Not shown: the dynamic combination of heat, oceanic denaturing, air pollution, deforestation, nutrient losses in food,
In absolute temps,only 1-2 degrees Avg increase, no increase in disasters. Graph attempts instill fear with uneducated
careful now! @realDonaldTrump doesn't believe in global warming as it's a Chinese conspiracy. He'll have you shut down
why the falsification of scientific data?
.@NASA @NASAGISS @NOAA It will be interesting to see if this stands when the agency's liberal ideologues are replaced by @realDonaldTrump
How's a thermometer a liberal ideology? You're calling hard data "liberal"? O_o
https://xkcd.com/1732/ 
that's a norma cicle of the planet, it used to be 15 degrees warmer not long ago, we also had ice age etc
its called climate it changes.. It'll go back down
after Friday you won't be allowed to say that.
thats a challenge to you to up your game to find an alternative home. We myt not all go bt humans to survive
Hopefully the important work you are doing to track what is happening on this planet will continue after Friday.
#ILOVEGLOBALWARMING
man that is scary
send this information to Mr. Trump
No use...no ***** to play with.
Hope you live in places that have snow
