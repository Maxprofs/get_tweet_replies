@Lupinus81 See, Chicago is doing well.
@KayaJones just blood
It's because I bought a $1,200 snowblower this year. You're welcome
Just doing my part.
I've lived in Chicago most of my life and I've never seen anything like this.
The winters have been getting warmer and less snow for years. But I can't remember a winter w/o any snow.
You serious? The last two three winters have been so bad its been the first time I questioned moving.
I'm 62.  I know what Chicago winters are supposed to be like.
@realtimhess Wow, we had about an inch in Seattle this morning, you can have it! No one here can drive in even a light dusting
This is called climate change, dear Americans. But your denying it despite scientific evidence.
Sadly, Valerie, our fellow human beings think political / personal beliefs disprove scientific facts
Journalism and activism is not a contradiction but a consequence.
Very well spoken, Val! Journalism documents the world around us, activism holds it accountable
I already think twice responding critical to tweets from turkish media as I want to report from there and they may ban enter
Who's Turkish media in this conversation?
meanwhile, it snowed twice yesterday in seattle
@SethDLerman
@GloriaBorger  Trump will say it's not climate change it's because of all the gun powder from bullets that effected atmosphere
2 months doesn't make climate change. But don't let that keep you from being ignorant.
@KopelmanWX #FlyTheW #Cubs
I'm not complaining either here in Colorado 
@D2_Derpinator conversely, it has snowed 5-6 times this month alone in Seattle, where it never snows 
And Los Angeles now is as green as Seattle because of the rain. Where it never rains. @Athens_Grease @NWSChicago @D2_Derpinator
even snow doesn't want any part of the US anymore. DAMN!
Are you trying to trigger a government crackdown in the weather service?
#Trump will fix it
On the Alps equal Problem! Alps!
but plenty of blood in the streets!
funny thing is I don't see all these people claiming this is because of global warming the years we get -50 wind chills
@baileychelle
Daffodils are up 4 inches, Mourning Dove looking for mate for 2 weeks. Six weeks early.  Global Climate Change.
is this like permanent drought in California a few months ago. Oh, wait...
Are you still allowed to publish that kind of subversive news?
@SenatorDurbin. Great for the budget.
I thought they was bout to say no homicides or something smh...
@SenatorDurbin #ClimateChange.
Probably absorbed by all the blood.
but global warming is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese...
@SenatorDurbin wish I could go to a joint address of congress alas I'm American!
a blip in cosmological times. I bet you don't remember Chicago was a steamy lava-heated swamp quite a ways back. :)
sad that we have a billionaire that only wants to fill pockets, not care and call this a hoax.
@SenatorDurbin #Trumprussia #Trumprussia
must be that "global warming" we keep hearing about!!
Doesn't bode well for the potential temperatures in July and August. Hope there is a plan to keep vulnerable cool this summer.
also leading the charge on murders.
Hundreds, followed by thousands, will die across the U.S. due to climate change denial. #CasandraWept
@GoodieDickman
@MarissaTorresTV Now let's hope they can set another record and make March the safest month in years with no homicides!
@chrislhayes Seattle seems to be getting it all.
Wow!
that's just scary
Trump will blame it on Hillary winning the state. Lol.
#globalwarming
@dmurphy2880

BUT REMEMBER KIDS CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T REAL 
Vice President polar bear says climate change is a myth 
#TheResistance
Shh...before you jinx us. 
every year occurence in london lol we managed 3 hours of snow on the ground in jan one night though first in 4 years lol
proving that Trump's election has indeed ushered in Hell on Earth.
Be  grateful that you didn't get any snow you might get some snow.
@severestudios worked hard to reduce cold 4 the less unfortunate in winter months nationwide now stop killing or freeze to death
Is that because the large number of gunshots has heated the atmosphere over chicago?
@timdgibson totally no such thing as climate change.
nothing to see here.
completely normal! Nothing to see here
unfortunately, plenty of bodies on the ground. 
@GloriaBorger WOW!!!
even snow is terrified of Chicago
really worked out for us and driving @Kelcie0401
@MessengerSports Chicago is too far north ! Plenty is snow in Iowa !

@amysweezey stuff like this happen when the Cubs win the WS.
excellent point! Carry on.
@bradpalm1 but climate change a myth, right?
because the inner cities are on fire, thereby melting all the snow. Duh...
in October, Chicago will do something it hasn't done in 109 years..celebrate back to back World Series titles!
@FrecklesXX20 and it's all Obama's fault, I'm sure
but can they go a day without a murder?
@chrislhayes its a hoax lol what global warming
It got lost in migration and landed in Victoria, BC :(
global warming is real.
I blame BLM
Proof all the Science and Calculating, Blaming Man for a Future Catastrophe, is Based lacking unknown natural change..........
@cmmoore75 Thought it was gonna say "with no murders..."
@ThatOneSonicGuy
@chrislhayes no such thing as climate change. Ugghh
Or as @realDonaldTrump would say: Fake news to support climate change hoax. Failing Chicago saw snow everyday. Sad.
I'm just sad for my daughter,she is 3 and loves to make snowmen
@chrislhayes I think that's because Portland stole it all.
According to 45's Regime Climate Change is fake Why take a chance? Puppies-Good    Pollution-Bad The Movement  Dan Rather's FB
@chrislhayes has TurdPOTUS taken credit yet?
@chrislhayes WOW
@ashtonthough this makes me so sad

@HipVeggies good thing global warming isn't real...lol
@WeatherWorks

 Albedo Modification isn't all that its cracked up to be.

Maybe we should turn that off?

#JustSaying

-
We're sorry, what are you referring to?

Sorry. We do not intentionally do albedo modification on Earth.  However, we appreciate your interest in the weather!
May I please ask... When you type "We do not intentionally do albedo modification" who "exactly" do you consider to be "we"?
Oh but there's no global warming...nah...no climate change! That's just fake news!
All the liberal heads glowing and about to explode are affecting the climate.  Sore losers!  Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!
@SJBSchu I don't think this will bode well for our summer , or my gardens.
Amazing....facts about climate change continue to slap us in the face and our SCROTUS and his team of fuckwits, blow it off
California is on the opposite.
first a World Series now this 
.@NWSChicago Those lying, dishonest, climate-mongering, utterly fake meteorologists are without any doubt the enemy of the American people.
... Please talk about it with Donald T. He doesn't believe in the climate change.
@GloriaBorger Yeah...My daughter keeps bragging about it!...#Still not moving back!
@LisaOKC Screw science. Look at the facts.
@jerrykerns wow
Man, that means they saved millions and millions of $$ not sanding, salting, equip. expense, overtime...
How about them murders? Can you go a few days without one of those?
well according to Trump it is a Chinese conspiracy.
@SiHan1212 But global warming and climate change are fake news--Right???
But there was hail.
@JenCarfagno I thought they were going to go without murders. No snow is okay too I guess
obviously climate change doesn't exist, folks. It's just alternative weather.
@JimCantore crazy weird.....fake news eh?
Except for the snow we got yesterday? 
you got snow? that stuck? It just flurried by me.
We had a light dusting. It melted quickly, but it was still snow. 
fair. I took the orig tweet as lasting snow on the ground 
I know theyâ€™re excited about the remarkable lack of snow this year, and it may be a record non-snowfall, but no snow != snow.
@Rickwwnavyvet  Global warming? LOL Explain last year??  Karma??  Every 100 yrs or so, Cubs win World Series and a mild winter.
Damn the Chinese and their hoax!!!!!
Because it all went to Vancouver and Vancouver Island
... wow! ...
@bartona104 SEND IN THE FEDS.
@realDonaldTrump Chinese myth ay? #climate
@NWS it was trendy then, but in fashion now
@JimCantore toouch gunfire raises temp.
This is now the new normal.....Geez...just think if global warming was real...
RT @NWSChicago Chicago's about to do something its never done in 146 years of record keeping: Send Gary to the Oscars
@NWS  Portland, OR says keep it! We don't want anymore!
@NWS it aint March 1 yet
@NWS 
No es bueno.
@NWS HEADLINE: Secret in ground heating system installed in Chicago to melt snow and promote global warming myth... 
2017 - The winter that wasn't.
Wow!
@NWS if they could just go a day without a shooting
@emptywheel #FakeWeather
@NWS but I thought China made up global warming?
does this impact reservoir levels?
global warming is a myth invented by the Chinese didn't you know that.# just a coincidence
@daveanthony I picked the right winter to break my leg.
@gdimeweather Thank you! I've been working on a project there for the last 2 months!
@capitalweather Thank goodness global warming is a scam
@KatyTurNBC yeh it got stuck going over the Sierras record breaking snowfall not enough to go around
@KatyTurNBC 
so I shouldn't feel as bad as I did when the @Cubs didn't win a World Series for 108 years.
Why is Greenland receiving extra snow ??
@KatyTurNBC whaaat?
@KatyTurNBC Don't jinx us Katy.
@PeterWSinclair #NoSnow? I know it's only weather but ...
Not too bad for a Chinese hoax.
@EHansenNDI Then I will head to Wrigley in late April or May and need snow boots.
@KatyTurNBC and POTUS says climate change/global warming is hoax but sure he will say it snowed if asked
@KatyTurNBC wait what?!?  global warming is a hoax!!    Oh no that right just another sign for us to ignore.
Always snowed when I lived there.... Always dirty snow!!!
@KatyTurNBC It will be a great day when you say no blood on the ground!
@KatyTurNBC ff
And we thought the @Cubs record ending was impressive.
I'm thinking that the WS win and the snow thing are linked. Invest in sulfur, fyi.
is there snow in the forecast the next 2 days?
@KatyTurNBC our president says that climate change is hoax! appoints EPA chief to dismantle the agency. How stupid is this?
it is very stupid. Fossil fuel companies propaganda to keep us from alternative energy.
@KatyTurNBC Who says climate change isn't real?

Must be all the heat the Cubs' pitchers are throwing. #CatchAFire
OHMy! Run for the hills! Global climate Changy Disruption Warming it's coming! Let's cook the books again!!! Really?
@KatyTurNBC Wow!
@KatyTurNBC 
@GloriaBorger. I guess  climate change is a hoax! #BelieveInScience
@GloriaBorger They're breaking other records too in the murder dept.
@bloodless_coup #YAY!!!
lol there's at least one
@KatyTurNBC but just remember climate change is a hoax created by China according to Donald chump
@KatyTurNBC     #fakenews as reported by the media and caused the Hillary supporters....
it takes a special kind of denial to pretend an observable phenomenon (no snow) is 'fake news'.
.... Absolutely....
@KatyTurNBC ...yet there is NO Global Warming...
I'd like to see you try to convince an Inuit of that.
@KatyTurNBC too bad the ground is covered in blood.
Yes they are. Both about Chicago.
@KatyTurNBC wow.. that's terrible. 
Chinese Hoax!
GLOBAL WARMING!
