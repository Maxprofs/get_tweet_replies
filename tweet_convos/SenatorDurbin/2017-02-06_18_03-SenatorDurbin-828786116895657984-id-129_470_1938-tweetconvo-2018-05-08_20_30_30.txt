Your calls and emails are working—Washington hears your voices. Only need 1 more Republican to vote no
Your not a politician your a criminal, the people voted for Trump, now listen to the Majority, and do your job.
what public school did your kids go to in Illinois?
I sure don't see rallies supporting her.  What is the matter with Republicans??????????????????????????
don't you mean riots? Just asking...
What riots?
wait.. for it....wait.. for it..... 
get over yourselfand start working for your constituents who need better education…the new secretary will do that!!
Your kids went to private schools,why you against other parents having choices?
Aren't you the Dick that sent his 3 kids to private school? Now you're ranting about a private school supporter?
I wish it had worked.
You didn't join them when it came time to decide where to send your kids to school. Why is that? @SenatorDurbin
Proud to join teachers and school administrators rallying to stop President’s Trump’s nomination for @USEdGov 
um, I heard a rumor you sent your children to private school. Could that possibly be true?
Thanks for doing the right thing.
#WhyTrumpWon
Elites want CHOICES for themselves.
Elites want NO CHOICES for others.
@SenateDems @usedgov Why not have the right to choose your child's school?
Correct. And Durbin sent his kids to private school. What a  Fraud.
hypocrite much? Didn't you put your children through private schools?
But but...aren't your kids in private schools 
You are a hypocrite! You send your kids to Private School but want to deny others that right? Hypocrisy!
got to work harder. The racist Supreme Court nominee is next. No prisoners.
thanks to both my senators for trying. #remeberin2018

Thank you for taking a stand and doing what is right for our country's public schools!
@SenateGOP it's time you pay attention to the people, and not your party. The REAL educators of America are speaking
because DEMS are always for the DUMBED down schools, unions curriculums, STUPID adults-dependents.
I have a feeling it's more like union leaders you're meeting with. #cashflow
and the union bosses, you forgot to mention them ole dickie
Thank you Senator. I'm from Illinois but live in IA, and I wish our Senators would vote no @joniernst @ChuckGrassley

@SenateDems @usedgov Your system has failed our families! Get out of the way
@SenateDems @usedgov You should say "Proud to be so deep in Teachers Unions pockets I can't see daylight!". #partisanhack

@SenateDems @usedgov take note, we have the most expensive education system that's ranked 30+

@SenateDems @usedgov Schools of choice recruit students who would have succeeded without them and falsely claim success.
