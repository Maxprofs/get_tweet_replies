This strategy of repeal & retreat threatens our entire health care system–subjecting patients, providers, & hospitals to chaos
Repeal of health care would #MakeAmericaSickAgain, leaving over 29M people across the country–and 1.2M in Illinois–without health insurance
In IL, repealing health care would result in a multi-billion $ loss in economic activity & over 84,000 Illinoisans would lose their jobs
If you’ve been the parent of a sick child & didn’t have health insurance, it’s an experience you'll never forget. I know–I lived through it
Health care should be a basic right in this great nation. We must work to improve our health care system, not dismantle it #ACAworks
@SenSanders Health care is design for the greed and selfish rich. Health system has no compassion for a human being.

@ealight461 @SenateGOP Sen Sessions pleads the 5th during questioning by Durbin, basically
I'd say: Hoping to distract us. And: not working!
. @SenatorDurbin @hateisacancer @SenateGOP Russian election hack was important?
Then why didn't u sign on to a single EC Count objection?
Good question!

These GOP senators will go down in history as the most CRAVEN CORRUPT SELF INTERESTED NONHUMANITARIAN group EVER
That is bad, and we expect you guys to stand up. It feels lately like you haven't. Please fight for us now.
We don't believe the claim, which is why no one is concerned. If HRC wasn't pond-scum, no scandal!
And getting jobs for their wives in the Trump Administration.   Talk about quid pro quo.
we trust you will help us. We need you more than ever now to defend rights of all Americans
What are Dems doing to stop them? How come we give Israel 38B $'s and they have HC for all but we don't? @lorax58 @SenateGOP
irrelevant &spiteful how come we give tax breaks for millionaires, millions in corp welfare
@TinaMorphis @SenateGOP As a senior who lives on fixed income, I see this as a form of genocide.
Re R 'attack' on election: thank God we know truth about CORRUPT @DNC.
Stop scaring people. GOP working hard on replacmnt. Won't leave people in lurch. Pol suicide.So stop!
@ealight461 @SenateGOP GOP sold out America

Thank you for bringing sanity to this fog of hysteria Orland!

MAKE THE GOP ACCOUNTABLE!!! Get some 
CUZ they are GOP, trump lovers.
I agree!
@SarahEOlson2009 @SenateGOP & celebrity apprentice ratings....
@j2dumfounded @SenateGOP Why do they hate Americans so?
That's a question better answered by @realGollumTrump, I fear.
lousy scummy bastards they better enjoy it because it's not going to last
Now you believe the intel community. Seems you pick and choose when to believe them for political reasons.
ACA has been a failure. Needs to be repealed and replaced. Please view the results of last election.
excellent point senator!!!
@im2b @SenateGOP thank you Senator Durbin!
@freelancewoman @SenateGOP Despicable GOP, only care abt their taxpayer funded health & pension benefits & corporate donors
If it's going to cost $9T to repeal ACA, wouldn't it be cheaper just to keep it til we get another?
Thank you for your courage, Senator Durbin. Keep fighting against defunding ACA & @PPFA for us!
@sacca @SenateGOP why can't you all work together to find solutions to the ACA? #businessasusual
@Larramarr1980 @SenateGOP  Well, DO SOMETHING About it, please
Sounds about right. /s
thank you for staying on message!  I had the pleasure of meeting you when living in IL #KeepACA and get costs down
@chellelaine @SenateGOP Downstate IL Dems are with you. Stop Trump! Stop GOP attacks on ACA. We know it was treason!
@pappyvanwinkel @SenateGOP Republicans align with Russia against the United States.
My daughter's life depends on the ACA. Please fight for her healthcare with EVERYTHING you've got.
my thoughts & prayers are with you. We must make our voices heard in this crucial time to make sure people who need help
That's because the attack with their illegal actions gave them control. Americans should be flooding the streets demanding a new election!

Please read & R.T. The Evidence: Trump & the GOP Treason by @sharondigi
Suppressing women is what WEAK men do when they are found out. #ImNotDistracted
@UncleRee1 If Trump was involved Inauguration should be put on hold and he and others involved tried for Treason.
Keep it coming, Dick. Don't let the fuckers catch a breath...Just like they did to Barack for 8 years
Conservatives are utterly without souls. It matters nothing that they R putting 30M ppl in life-threatening peril.
They didn't "hack the election". Your secrets were exposed and you need to find a scapegoat.
So what are you going to do about it?  We won't survive if our Dem leadership watches as a traitor takes the WH.
I bet Russia made her do it.
Little hard to get worked up now when Hillary put our security at big risk and it seemed to be okay then.
@upwithmike @SenateGOP I have come to believe that these "intelligence" are but tools of fraud by the POTUS admin.
@upwithmike @SenateGOP The same intelligence community that spoke abt WMDs.
same IC that warned in a Presidentiial Daily Briefing "Bin Laden determined to attack US." spasibo i do svidaniya
we appreciate ur service. We need u  tomorrow as a voice against new Pres who was wrongfully elected
If GOP doesn't take ins from millions it can't justify giving billions to 1% in tax cuts W/O deficits.
We want a new election! Feeling like US has become  republic. This has got to stop now!
PLS MAKE IT STOP!!  Where r the priorities?  This hacking is just the tip of the cybercrime iceberg PS we love ACA
Get the Russian collusion with Trump & hold his feet to the fire! #Treason  #Impeachment
How about the DWS DNC attack on our election process. ?
if @TheDemocrats are too stupid to protect their data,  how is that our problem?  Why no concern about govt hacks?
@ClippednPinned @SenateGOP Backwards people who do nothing in the interest of the country they serve. The people vote in 2018
why are you putting this out. it is not true. Hillary and Obama behind the loss of election, admit it
@Fairy_Gmother @SenateGOP HELP!!!!! #holycrap
AND no ideas how to make it better?
Please set up an independent committee investigate Russia hacking ASAP.
defend the people of USA. Fight Trump every step of the way!

The memes are running out of steam. Don't let hatred of a political party make you lose your honor and soul, you're close...
everyone of them supports Abortion they are the ones with no Honor or Soul #ProLife
So those critiques you had of CIA's torture programs are all forgiven?
Sen. Durbin, I can't afford health insurance without the ACA, and I'm pregnant w/twins. THANK YOU for your work.
RUN. FOR. PRESIDENT.
Please.:)
Incorrect. Not against election.
And you can't do a thing about it!  Elections have consequences I once heard from BHO.
7 Oct.ODNI/DHS statement here.
U are no TRUMP get off twitter, you are an embarrassment
Guess who pays your check. I will not pay for 30 million illegals to abuse our health system!  PERIOD!
thank you, Senator! This is why we voted for you to represent us!
hope you will plan Chicago townhall soon so we can thank you in person.
fact! Self-employed & so happy for first time in many years our rates went down and we have better family coverage for 2017!
We need a new Election like any other civilized country would have done in this situation!  
#FromRussiaWithLove

AltRight Bannon & Putin are in the West wing.  Trump campaign warrants investigation
well they have been practicing so it is their default position  Never moved on to plan however & will be downfall
thank you for stating this view which is where all of congress should be focused
u didn't just get this Intel so what have u been doing abt it? Only time this as been told is after Dem lost
Double standard much? Today in #Syria
So what are Dems going to do about it?  We need a full independent investigation.  If this was reversed GOP would be fighting
Russian hacking is act of war. DT adhering to enemies(Russia, Assange, Putin), giving them aid/comfort is TREASON!
With all the criminal activities ot Trump you respond with war drums against Russia.What a fool.
