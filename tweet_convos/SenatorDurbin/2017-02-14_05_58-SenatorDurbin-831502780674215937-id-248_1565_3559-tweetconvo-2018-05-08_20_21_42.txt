I don't think anyone would be hard pressed to find 2896 reasons to investigate this administration.
That's not sarcasm, it's exaggeration (but as I said, barely). Difference is you can tell when Durbin uses it...
...whereas DT's main rhetorical device is exaggeration. The difference is clear, no two faces here.
Don't stop belivin, then. Have a good life, eggy
Keep pressing! This will not go away!
Who the hell authorized having Flynn's phone tapped & leaked conversations to the media?
PLEASE! Do not allow this to be distracted from with the Trump team smoke and mirrors tactic that has already become routine!
Please keep fighting for an independent investigation! We need you all to stand for truth and integrity
yes, we do, and we need Teumo's tax returns to be released NOW.
I'll give you one guess....45.
no need to investigate. My son loves Vlad.  He couldnt admit it because he was afraid Pence would talk him out of it.
Follow the $$, the $$11B Russian oil deal, Tillerson, Trump, Bannon, Manafort, Perry.....treason, corruption and pure greed.
Absolutely! Tillerson is also neck deep in this. Hes been too cozy w/Putin trying to get shady oil deals 4 Exxon. @JoyLapine @SenatorDurbin
Agreed.  I suspect some GOP have a cut in it too along with Trump's kids and son-in-law.
Trump micromanages everything, how could he (and Pence) not have known everything Flynn did
Yeah, tie up the government while Russia and China have a good time laughing at us.  Deny Trump his people.
@TheDemocrats In December he was still a private citizen.  Show us the rule that a private citizen can't speak to a Russ Off.
A quick Google of the incident brings up multiple news articles, NONE of which name @SenatorDurbin in the attempted sale.
How bout Ms Yates was the only honest person in the room?
Who in the Obama admin authorized spying on Flynn?
@TheDemocrats  lets do see how far conversations with obama, bush ,clinton bring up with russia ,lol
please push for an investigation of Flynn's disclosures, when Trump knew about them and his inaction/concealment.
Please, we need you to make this happen!
... shut up. Bhengazi.  Illegal email server selling secrets to foreign Governments.   You're criminal through and through
@TheDemocrats 
Where is the proof that he discussed sanctions? Let's have it!
who the fuck cares?  It's not against the law and you know it.
Delete your account. Anti-American Globalist
why aren't u leading global the charge # impeachtrumpnow
what's Flynn's severance package? Any famous Trump non disclosure agreement signed by Flynn?
you told us WE DON'T record #Americans phone calls another #government lie who leak prosecute leakers
If u see @RoyBlunt, can u let him know as his constituent, please investigate. I've called, not sure he listens.
Good news for you:
Roy Blunt (!) calling for an exhaustive investigation into Trump-Russia connections! (via @kfile)
http://cnn.it/2lMamTD  
I think gov time & money better spent on other things. Maybe infrastructure.
I love infrastructure-public trust needs 2 b restored or nothing gets done.
As a member of the new POTUS admin it's not uncommon for members to establish comm with other countries.
While you're at it ask the Deranged Dems to RESIGN: @SenatorDurbin @SenSchumer @SenSanders @reppelosi + 20 more
Yes, we need an independent investigation. Thank you!
We all know Trump has been involved with Russia for a long time. His entire administration is dirty & unethical
Exactly. We must have transparency here! The stakes are too great!
you know and we know Trump insisted he talk to Russia investigate!
@TheDemocrats I am terrified !!!!! Stop them now do not wait no more delays strike now !!!
I completely agree, Flynn is a soldier and as such, follows orders even in disagreement, should be called in.
Former Obama Officials, Loyalists Waged Secret Campaign Against Flynn To Protect Iran Nuclear Deal.
@TheDemocrats stop the bullshit !! Get louder this is unacceptable and terrifying
@TheDemocrats you go senator we need an investigation desperately keep digging you will hold the WH accountable
@TheDemocrats Who authorized the Dems to oust Bernie during primaries....let's talk about your discretion!!!
@TheDemocrats Oh Dickie, we know you just like to make it up as you go. How many were killed this weekend in your state? SAD!
who authorized obama to sanction Russia on his way out the door
Please keep pushing #CorruptGOP to investigate Flynn-Russia and how Trump is involved/responsible.
please keep applying pressure. This isn't a party issue, it's about our nation's security!
Thank you Senator! We need answers. Keep the pressure on #Flynninvestigation
you and I both know that question will never be answered. He fell on his sword for the @GOP and it will die there.
I think it's safe to say the so-called president
yes please
#TheIdesOfTrump agrees @SenatorDurbin! How can @GOPSenMajority not speak ONCE re: #russianhacking since Oct! If U agree, join us 3/15!
I swear the DNC is clueless on why they lost the election. Yes she was awful but you offered nothing! To anyone
how can we make it happen?
Can we focus on important issues first, fix H1B, you promoted the bill!!!
@TheDemocrats please continue to demand an investigation.  Thank you from 62088
@TheDemocrats what?Why?Uhave questions about this but not that crazy Benghazi thing where 4 Am died &then @TheDemocrats lied?
@TheDemocrats Duh, 45
@1970Martina you know who. DJT
Definitely! I think Trump used Flynn as scapegoat 2 try 2 save himself. 2 much evidence says so. Maybe a bribe.@SenatorDurbin @TheDemocrats
@TheDemocrats time wasters!  Stop! Move agenda forward and help the economy and protect our nation and immigration system!
@TheDemocrats Flynn also worked for Obama Yes? Take care of N. Korea, Russia + other threats before Dems get ahead...
@TheDemocrats Who can put a stop to the administration costing taxpayer's money.   Wife in NY daughter in WH he's DC or FL
His conversation was wiretapped. What's to investigate? Treason is pardoned here: Manning. Oh yeah gender identity issue.
@TheDemocrats America needs to know the ties between this administration and Russia. Flynn is the scapegoat!
@TheDemocrats how about an investigation into $150B in unmarked bills to Iran. Where were you with American Concerns then?
Is there a petition to get this investigation going? If @jasoninthehouse won't do his fucking job, somebody has to.
@TheDemocrats Giuliani has something to do with Russia too.
Trump knew all about it started with Manafort
@TheDemocrats The list goes on Mr Durban! Can't wait for more swamp drainingMAGA
@TheDemocrats We also find it difficult to believe that Mike Pence knew nothing. Very very difficult
@TheDemocrats Who cares. It's all on wiretap. Did he do worse than Manning? She's out of jail Dem Obama.
@TheDemocrats Not getting it that slime @SpeakerRyan and that tool #JasonCaffetz are corrupt& immoral to do the right thing
Spicer ~ "All of the actions and all of the words in this administration are behalf and at the direction of this president"
@TheDemocrats and what about that sale of Uranium to the Russians from Hillary and Podesta?
@TheDemocrats Why don't you ask Obama and Clinton the same question.  GLASS HOUSES.
@TheDemocrats the president of course, who else has the authority?
@TheDemocrats You're kidding, right? #TrumpRussia #TrumpLies #DworkinReport
Trump will handle it !
@TheDemocrats Who authorized Hillary to have a private server and many unsecured cell devices?  needs investigation now!
@TheDemocrats  Hurray! I have been tweeting this for a long time. Repug's won't do it, take it outside the WH.
@TheDemocrats It's very strange that "Flynn" would discuss "sanctions" on his own. "Independent Investigation immediately.
@TheDemocrats Nobody.  He was freelancing, remember?!?! *wink*wink*
@TheDemocrats Dang now I know why u never called for investigations of Obama or Clinton, only had 2,895 reasons, not 2,896
@TheDemocrats well whip those democrats and republicans into investigating the Russians
@TheDemocrats seems there's a lot of treason going on against America with in the Republican Party and the republicans 45
please!!! Trump knew!!!!  Putin has something big on trump.
yes, his dick in his mouth!!
The American public deserves answers! We need an independent investigation!
please!!!!!!
YES, YES, YES please. Make it so
@TheDemocrats Thank you for the work you do.
It is a pointless investigation. I will fully pardon him if he has done anything wrong
@TheDemocrats ypu did!
please don't back down - we need this investigation - now.
I agree. And in the meantime, all confirmation hearings/votes should halt.
who cares? This is so stupid. All Dems can do is cause fear in their own base of far left. The rest just see divisiveness.
sorry...you lost credibility long ago when you tried to use Gov as attack on free speech.
@xdelmar59 if @realDonaldTrump knew about his talks then didn't he also lie to @VP
45 is crooked, lying and orchestrated to do what he did. As a citizen I demand being protected. I just read the constitution
THANK YOU!
My Senator, demand and get a full investigation of the WH of who, what, when and why. Flynn needs to be tried for treason.
Please investigate this!
Inestigate now!
I also wonder how many tweeting you are actually REPRESENTED by you? If you aren't, go away and talk to your own Senator.
where we're you when the Obama administration was rife with corruption and lies and you did NOTHING! You don't represent me!
Who's on WH counsel & who did they share Flynn/Russia blackmail docs gotten from AG? Wouldn't Trump have seen this briefing? @SenatorDurbin
Yes @SenatorDurbin , there needs to be independent investigation into entire WH cabinet, starting w/ @realDonaldTrump , for Russia collusion
@kkchides only 2,896?
we need this now!
Yes @SenatorDurbin we need answers. @realDonaldTrump cannot pretend not to know. WH was warned 3 weeks ago by AG Yates. Then she was fired.
@xdelmar59 Dems don't let up on Insane Trump & Admin. Americans demand investigations. Keep saying, Americans Demand Answers!
Witch hunt huh?
Yes - and we need it SOON!  Demand an independent investigation and soon!
isnt there anything dems can do 2 jumpstart proceedings? #GOP is NOT going to move forward until their agenda is accomplished
Special Prosecutor
It is interesting that #Trump fired the person who discovered this illegal activity! #SallyYates = #HERO
must assume Putin had Russia's FIS tape calls btwn Gen Flynn & Ambassador Kislyak. Putin & FBI both know Trump's involvement.
please push for an honest and thorough investigation! The country deserves it.
You need to investigate Jerry Brown and California sanctuary money give away. Now they are out of DAM money. Get it?
In the immortal words of Sam Erwin, "What did the President know and when did he know it?" #kremlingate
please keep the pressure on an investigation.
@NSetnan - funny, did not scream from rafters for the need an independent investigation into Clinton's home cooked server!?!?
Try helping to work on a replacement of the unsustainable, expensive, job-killing ACA.
@mwskb As a generally conservative person I still agree 100%.
@MaxineWaters introduced bill for an independent investigation into 45’s ties to Russia. Call your Rep & demand they support!
Who said U should open your mouth 4 more stupidities.
Fully investigate coverup by WH on Flynn. Bannon up to #45! AG told McGahn 1 mo ago. Investigate up to #45 & IMPEACH!
We need the Russian connection to Hillary & other democrats investigated now! Crooked $$ made from secret deals!
get real, she isn't running the country. Jackass!
Yes. Thank you. Shades of 1973. What did they know &when did they know it?
Just want you to know you're making Illinois proud. The stakes are too high for complacency and you're leading the charge.
oh I thought that was the number of murders in Chicago under ur watch?
u claim we r at war with Russia? can we send u2 the front with a rifle? born in 1944- u didnt serve in vietnam!!!!? why? how?
@NatureGuy101 We need an investigation now. So the people of the USA  know what's going on.
Hyper Partisan Blow Hard. No one forced people in the center of the country to vote for Trump. Dems embarrassed by hacks lol.
so when will the independent investigations begin? I beg you Senator, what is your plan to stop this madness Subpoenas coming
What did Trump know and when did he know it?  Did he order it done?  The people deserve to know. Thank you.
go for it, create it.
Thank you, Senator. I'm glad to call you my representative.
does anyone remember Obama telling Russian aide that after election he would be able to do more for Putin
Thank you, Senator. Get to the bottom of this. Follow the $$.
How deep into the ranks of @GOP does this go?  Their silence is damning.
YES!  Proud to be a constituent!
@Deanofcomedy or Uday and Qusay before election?
GOP will not do it
My thoughts, exactly, Flynn, good soldier that he is, would not have initiated. He's taking the bullet for Trump. Look into.
This is just the beginning. Please push for a full investigation. Thank you, Senator!
Good luck  with that you useless hack.  You lost.  Get over it.  It's time for the adults to be in charge.
@Deanofcomedy agree so when do the investigation to impeach trump begin senator? Do ur job we r watching #RESISTANCE
Please google DworkinReports.  Investigative reporting-Putin. Also see Louise Mensch reports.  Thank you for fighting for USA
Time for Dems to flood the airwaves for days with that simple message.
@johnastoehr hello!  Only one person. TRUMP. Hope the GOP investigates trump as vigorously as they investigated Clinton
yes please release the transcript so we can see what really happened.
you know full well who authorized it. Now prove it. Do us all a great service.
All Dems ALL OF YOU on the steps with a press conference demanding it today .. one voice .. do it ..
If Trump can say Christie knew about #Bridgegate, why can't we say Trump knew about #Flynn?
Was the president being blackmailed? Should the White House have security clearance?
Exactly.  He just didn't do that all by his itty bitty self.
Yes. Please keep fighting to get to the bottom of this, senator.
Investigate #russiagate & entire @WhiteHouse How many pple with Trump's ear have to have Russian ties b4 something happens?
