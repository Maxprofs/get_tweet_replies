What happened to GOP "pledge" to give American public 72 hours to read a bill before it gets voted on? http://bit.ly/2pKR5qG 
Here’s what we do know: #TrumpCare would throw 1M Illinoisans off insurance & increase costs for seniors & rural communities
#TrumpCare would kill 60,000 Illinois jobs for working class families and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy
#TrumpCare would allow insurers to exclude coverage for maternity care, mental health, and substance abuse treatment
Don’t be fooled by the “high risk pools”; GOP bill shorts them by $200B & would lead to waiting lists, delayed care, & unaffordable premiums
Last time Illinois had a high risk pool, less than 1% with pre-existing conditions were included & they still faced waiting lists
#Trumpcare is opposed by every patient & health group: @AARP @American_Heart @AmerMedicalAssn @ANANursingWorld @AmDiabetesAssn
According to my report on #Trumpcare, 41,400 people in the 6th Illinois congressional district would lose their health insurance
59,800 people in the 12th Illinois congressional district would lose health insurance under #Trumpcare
53,700 people in the 13th Illinois congressional district would lose health insurance under #Trumpcare
45,500 people in the 14th Illinois congressional district would lose health insurance under #Trumpcare
57,200 people in the 15th Illinois congressional district would lose health insurance under #Trumpcare
51,800 people in the 16th Illinois congressional district would lose health insurance under #Trumpcare
46,600 people in the 18th Illinois congressional district would lose health insurance under #Trumpcare
ATTN @HouseGOP: Trump doesn’t care what you pass—he just wants a “win”. You know who needs a win? Working families, seniors, rural hospitals
Most of us know it doesn't really matter as long as it kills Obama's legacy
And what did Nancy P do?
Ohh sound like obamacare. Remember Pelosi saying we need to pass it in order to read it. Lol. Democrats are morons.
Please don't let anything close to the House bill hit the Senate floor! It is cruel, greedy and heartless.
Healthcare is not a right.  Democrat entitlements will ruin this country.
Sounds just like the democrats did when they shoved it down our throats
With passing Obamacare, You Dems didn't even know what it said, let alone cost. Hypocritical ass clowns.
@SenDuckworth and Senator Durbin, Please fight for us, everyone needs access to affordable healthcare
Unacceptable.   Trumps America is hard on us real people. God help us
you Demos passed ACA before you read it. Whats the difference?
At least the House is doing something instead of your now the party of "NO" shame on you for not trying to help your constituents!
thank you for being my Senator.
PLEASE do NOT let this pass the Senate.
Midterms will be brutal for the @HouseGOP if #TrumpCare passes the House today.
Work with them to FIX IT!! This Illinois constituent has was given 1 plan option 80% premium increase lost all doctors!! FIX IT!!!
You voted on Obamacare without reading it! #doublestandard #patisanpolitics
Hmmm....sounds very similar to a "vote on it, before you see it"  When you all get past semantics, then maybe  you can actually get it right
"Repeal and replace" AND "Improve what is there"  Government health is going to be there, either way.  WORK TOGETHER, forget the semantics
Please talk to your Republican friends Dick, please don't let this happen. I'm a chicago pharmacist and see ACA working for our patients!
Vote NO on repealing the ACA - this bill is irresponsible!!!!
trump plan. Do it prior to a plan
Voting without the CBO score is totally GOP tag.  They are SO desperate for a "win",they will do anything. Are they ""Americans"? It trumps
Did you know they consider being a victim of domestic violence a preexisting condition? NO  #TRUMPCARE
Kind of sounds exactly like the vote on Obamacare. Even your friend Nancy said of Obamacare we can't read it all
Incredible way to conduct national business! Scary too!
Sounds like Pelosi and your dem communist aye. Pass the bill to know what is in it.....
Same as you did. Are you really this dishonest?
That's the purpose.  Don't want 2 know cost. That's what killed last one. GOP chng rules &rush thru 2 get what wld never pass.
Provisions for pre-existing are also insufficient. Risk pools don't work. They just drive up costs.
So maybe you should postpone your vote until you have the facts?  Just a thought, but I suppose you sign contracts w/o reading all the time
please Vote No. too many small business owners count on the ACA to cover their pre existing conditions
#rememberinnovember Irresponsible at the least- conniving more like. Thank you for your active leadership in opposition.
House GOP refused to work w Dems to fix ACA even after knowing that's what 75% of Americans wanted. #RememberInNovember
#voteno
People in Illinois 14th district! In Antioch down to St Charles, call your rep @RandyHultgren and tell him to vote no today!!!
@MoveOn @HouseGOP in their sick minds that makes sense. Are they immune of illnesse? Nevermind, diff insurance for them
typical crooked RepubliRussiaCans .. they want us to sign a blank check for THEM while we get screwed! I DON'T THINK SO!
All néed meds 
So they have to pass the bill to know what's in it. Seems like a familiar quote. Gosh.
The rush to pass this half-baked horrible #AHCA that is a vanity project of GOP & Trump & a tax cut for 1% parading as a bill is #Shameful!
First priority is that the R's who voted for this, will pay the consequences in long-run and not be re-elected! They are soulless filth!
This insurance bill should guarantee that every member of Congress who votes FOR it should be voted out of office. GOP  disregarding voters!

Everything in your thread is true, but that's  their intent. GOP are the most corrupt, cold hearted lying bigots I've seen in my lifetime.
the house GOP is committing mass hari kari
Remember that time when The House represented The People?  Me neither...  House GOP is like a collective malady. #NoAHCA #LetUsLive #resist
Dick Durbin you had a chance to get single-payer when you had the House and Senate . We got Romney care!step down!
We don't need to read it. Make the 1% great again! #RichLivesMatter #MakeShareholdersGreatAgain #FThePoor #MakePoorPeopleDeadAagain
hey ... you tell 'em Dick ...
Thank you @Senator Durbin for all your hard work!!!
Because they are cowards and know most would not vote for it otherwise. Hopefully the @SenateDems can stop it.
And they do know one thing that they conveniently try to forget - it will strip at least 24 million of health coverage #VoteNoAHCA

JUST IN: ObamaCare repeal bill contains exemption for members of Congress and their staffs http://hill.cm/nPH6pef  
The GOP have & will always lie They're NOT for our country or ppl I hope 1 day ppl realize that. Dems aren't perfect but at least they try
That seems pretty fiscally irresponsible...
Everyone that vote yes will pay!!
Nothing has changed to protect the American people. Top 400 rich will only benefit from the tax breaks. GOP is committing political suicide.
To do something so destructive for so many is without feeling. Their justification - "we said we would ". Truly sick!!
@AdamKinzinger is this true?
You cast a vote for Obamacare without the bill actually being written. You have no credibility on this issue.
I do not understand how anyone could vote for this bill.
Rich #Democrats like @SenatorDurbin have their own SPECIAL #HealthCare YET push FAILED #ObamaCare down OUR throats! #Hypcorites
The @GOP doesn't give a DAMN about Americans - unless they are rich. Once again, putting party over people.  THOUSANDS will DIE. Thousands
does it contain an exclusion for members of Congress and their families? And,do I have to keep screaming about separation of church & state?
Yes it does.  They and their employees are exempt.
This bill will literally kill my family. I'm outraged. TY Senator Durbin for speaking the truth.
These swampers do not care. They must save face at the cost of human suffering; not their own, as they exclude themselves from bill.
The CBO scored Obamacare wrong so why would the CBO be correct now?
Like @NancyPelosi said "We need to pass it to see what's in it" right? #MAGA #AmericaFirst
it serves the GOP interests which are to shit on america, so of course they are moving quick
#MakeAmericaSickAgain #MakePatientsBankruptAgain
And they promised they wouldn't vote on anything that wasn't public for at least 3 days.
well that makes a lot of sense...voting on something and they don't know what it will cost?..WOW
