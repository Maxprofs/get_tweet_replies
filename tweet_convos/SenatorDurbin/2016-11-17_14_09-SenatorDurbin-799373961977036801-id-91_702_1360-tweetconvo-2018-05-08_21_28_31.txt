Creating a “Muslim registry” that targets innocent people based on religion is un-American and doesn’t make us safer
Dummy,
First, you're assuming Islam is a "religion".

Secondly, almost all of the terrorist "were" innocent and NON-radical.
what did sen douchbag do? Don't hold back I need truth
@SenateDems @Salon Glad to hear it. But it would be nice to hear from more Senate Democrats on this issue.
@SenateDems. Then you need to start leading the way to protect US citizens, getting rid of existing sharia law & people hater
, with you.
@SenateDems @SimonMaloy how about protecting people from terrorists instead of helping the terrorists?
.@SenatorDurbin #DouchBaggery at it's finest.
America has about 6 true blue states.  The rest of America wants #2A.  Middle America liberal Minnesota has good carry laws.

An immense thank you Senator.  Religious freedom and separation of church and state are integral to the country's foundation.
You are part of the swamp that the middle-American voters hope gets drained.
