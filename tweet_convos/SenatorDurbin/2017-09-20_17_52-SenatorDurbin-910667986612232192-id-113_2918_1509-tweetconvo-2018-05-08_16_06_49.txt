End Obamacare...Repeal....do not replace it. Its a freaking nightmare!
Thank you Sir
Sen GOP, please end Obamacare care!
I am a cancer survivor.  I need my health insurance to be affordable or a relapse could kill me. Justify that to my family.
We don’t need Obamacare but we need something much better than #Trumpcare - revoke Congress’ healthcare and sign them up 4 #TrumpCare 1st!
Tell your idiot constituents you're willing to do NOTHING & DONT CARE about their 100% INCREASES & LIMITED CHOICE
#ACAFail
@realDonaldTrump
The Trumpcare bill sucks big time. It should be called TrumpMurdersMillions
Can't load users info. BOT. 
Wishful thinking little one
This is ACA...if you have to pay for it...
Its there job to provide a strong economy so ppl can take care of themselves and not relying on gov to do it for them
You must enroll in Obamacare? Why do you insist we should have that crappy Ocare? Why are t you on it? You guys deserve it more than we do!
If OCARE is sooooo great why don't YOU and YOUR FAMILY have it??????
Do you have and use Obamacare?


No way no how if your against it I'm for it



Senator Durbin please advise your fe!!ow Dems. To include central tel. # for people to call. Like Congressman Kennedy did
Delusion becomes you. Factual information seems to be beyond your capability. Cognitive Dissonance.
#billionaires & #Boneheads are the only 1s who support Graham Cassidy. @GOP #Lies only make us Mad & #Ready2Fight
Those that LOVE ACA...are NOT paying for it!
You ppl are so brainwashed into thinking its the governments job to provide healthcare.
We stand firm that you and your party passed a bogus health care program that has cost Americans trillions and needs to be Fixed already!
Repeal Democrats disaster aka obamacare





Vote NO Senator! @SenDuckworth
We need the affordable care act
Regular order, please

Because I preexist I will B the ones that die NONE of these R for pain or mood elevated drugs Just a day in the life 
REJECT!
How about the state of Illinois actually run a conservative against you and get you out of office.  #socialism does not work.
Never going to happen 
Not going to retweet, but I'm going to tell you that you need to start fighting for all of your constituents not just Chicago.
Why are women always targeted? Also not good 4 vets. I personally commit both time and money to defeat those who vote for this bill.
Nah! Time to kill that Obamacare crap u forced on us!
I sure do b/c I want full repeal, as promised.
I'm one of your constituents and I am appalled at this massive redistribution of wealth from blue states to red states.
Makes in even lady! What is wrong with fairness? Lolzzz
What is your fix for the failure that is called #Obamacare #Obama @SenatorDurbin ?
No Dick
@SenateGOP please have some sense. Rushing a bill through haphazardly is foolish. And taking away healthcare from 32MM is criminal.
.@SenatorDurbin @SenateGOP I don't get who they think will be clapping if they pass this, since EVERY group I can think of opposes.
@SenToomey @SenJohnMcCain @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer @timkaine @SenWarren @SenFeinstein @SenGillibrand @SenFranken #WeMatter
If you are working to make America Great again it is time for Universal Healthcare for all!
#ProtectOurCare @SenatorDurbin!!
I'm standing against your repeated use of the lie that it's Trump care
Dems& GOP both R stupid& foolish. Back 2009, Dems didn't outreach2 GOP&  Pelosi said "Pass it & then Read it". We citizen R paying the price
If U want2 fix health care. Here is an idea 4u. Senators & Congressmen must not have better health care quality than average American Can
Durbin would be against this if you were getting his ins deal as he is against anything Reps do. He has never done anything but for him $$$
#MedicareForAll or just admit THIS is what you're protecting.
Made 10 phone calls and sent tweets
Every American needs to call your Senator's, tell them to vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill. If it passes 23million American's will be killed.
Thank you, Senator. This seems like a particularly bad bill for Illinois, though it will devastate red states too!
Retweet if senators should have to live under Obama care
If it's worth doing, it's worth doing RIGHT. Stop trying to shove crap through and take the time needed to get this done ethically & fairly.
@GOP GENOCIDE BILL KILLS MILLIONS of AMERICANS!
@GOP does not give a crap about regular Americans. Millions of families wrecked by med bills. $140k+ for metastatic cancer patients.
@SenatorDurbin We need for you to fight for #MedicareForAll
I am for repeal of ACA!!! Hands down.
I hate their #trumpcareKILLS @trumpcare is a disaster!!
Are you people bewitched or what? Democrats and some Republicans have gone off there rockers. Oh yes, MONEY!!! What people, what country?
Dick, you caused the problems they are trying to fix.
Vote NO! Do not repeal & replace. Just work on making ACA better.

#GrahamCassidy
CALL ALL UNDECIDED GOP

Where Republicans stand on Graham-Cassidy @CNNPolitics …
Against Obama care
What's the Democrats plan be against the Republican plan. You cancel each other Out! When will "you" do your job for the American people?
Is
I stand against Trump care
So very proud that you and Senator Duckworth truly represent the BEST INTERESTS of your constituents in the great state of Illinois! Thanks!
They pay millions for trump to golf but take healthcare from children elderly very ill and veterans #GOPDeathPanel #UnAmerican  #CowardlyGOP
They're trying to fix what Democrats screwed up.
Thanks Senator Durbin!
#GOPEnemyOfTheState
I've lived all over this country and Illinois is inches away from losing first world status. Just do what @RandPaul tells you.

We know you stand against #Trumpcare but what do you stand for?
Apparently not #MedicareForAll since he won’t cosponsor it. Guess we’ll have to replace @SenatorDurbin with a @justicedems
Thank you @SenatorDurbin ! I'm so glad my IL representatives care about their constituents
A Decrease in Increased spending Does Not Equal Cuts. You've lost ALL credibility.
Senator I fear that tweeting will not be enough to stop GC. Please tell us everything that should be done to prevent a vote w/o CBO score.
Retweet to tell the @SenateDems and @SenateGOP that you stand against Washington's latest attempt to control your life through healthcare!
Thank you @SenatorDurbin for fighting to protect the right to healthcare for all Americans.
The only question left then is
WTF is wrong with Republicans?

Vote NO #CassidyGraham
#MedicareForAll
The Democrats had no business destroying America's health care. Obamacare kills people.
I understand your position given the terrible financial position of IL but Graham/Cassidy is a good idea. Give states more control.
Thanks @SenatorDurbin.  I'm so grateful we have you and @SenDuckworth doing the right thing for us.
Of course! 75 percent of all Americans hate what the @GOPrepublicans has been proposing all year. Stand up for Americans Mr. Durbin.
#GOPEnemyOfTheState
Thank you for knowing this would destroy the people of IL. We are behind you! #GrahamCassidyMurderBill
