Foreign Aid is not charity. We must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security.
@marcorubio 
Not to mention top recipient by a factor of 2 is Israel. Others help stabilize mid-east.
Wondered that too "Ensuring stable democracies (buys influence), humanitarian"
Leb pop rose 25% in 2y!
problem is Trump doesn't care about true safety. He cares about appearing strong.
Liar. If you have been listening to him for the last year instead of what CNN said he said, you'd know that.
simple question: what's better? Diplomacy or defense? "When all you have is a hammer, everything's a nail"
So in your mind diplomacy = handing out cash or having a weak military? Are you that stupid?
okay egg.
So does cutting finding to the EPA. That needs protection, too, if we are to survive.
Yeah, because those EPA bureaucrats are angels send from heaven to do good work.
Wrong! Foreign aid isnt authorized in the Constitution and perpetuates wars, conflicts, and gets us into entangling wars.#Aid
trump is just to ignorant to have an understanding of the ill effects of his moronic decisions he greatly increases danger
He's not ignorant enough to create ISIS and call it the JV team. Not ignorant enough to draw fake "red lines".
We are such a good Christian country that we think of ourselves before others in need. I'm sure that's what Jesus preached
@SenatorDurbin and of that 1% one third goes towards HIV/AIDS prevention. That directly impacts the US.

can't bring myself to "liking" his comment,  so I'll just like yours 
Isolationism makes us less safe, period. And it makes the world less safe.
@marcorubio Agree. But what you say matters much less than how your vote.
But when it comes time to vote will Marco stand for what he says or fold for Party?
how is Haiti working out Chelsea? It did pay for ur wedding gown!
@mtalpas Where is the proof!! That's the answer they always give when you want to cut spending! They squeal like a pig!!!
Now if only the Repubs felt the same way about health care (Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security).
Marco occasionally has an individual thought but never follows through. Actions speak louder than words. Hold him accountable
now if only he'd stop hiding for his constituents and do a Town Hall.
ok, now that @marcorubio has chimed in, we're instantly suspicious of where the money's really going.
I agree it all comes back to help us OR bite us!
go collect your award for most annoying, and return to corner, you tiresome and petulant chld
But watch @marcorubio meekly fall in line with cutting with that aid. He's all bluster, no balls.
Thank you for standing up for Foreign Assistance. It is truly important for our national security! @USGLC
Why should we spend money in countries that hate America and want to see us destroyed
wow, Rubio finally said something that makes sense & isn't purely Republican
@whoisbenchang @marcorubio #TermLimits #midterm2018 #draintheswamp  stop spending our money on foreigners charity starts@home
But will Marco actually show up for a vote?
@marcorubio   3 Wrong Wannabe Relevant Politicos. Before you assist strangers YOU Take care of family Totally
Having Trump as @POTUS makes us less safe more than anything else.
@ChelseaClinton Yes. @marcorubio talks a great game. But we all know his words are worthless. #Coward #NoIntegrity
@gop @senategop @housegop @SpeakerRyan @leadermitch TrumpBannon trying to get rid of all who say NO to him
.@ChrisMurphyCT @ChelseaClinton Respectfully, @marcorubio, you will have no problems at a town hall if you keep speaking this forthrightly.
Marco is so stupid we need that money to help keep our ground intelligence safe.  It is a small price to pay.
@ChelseaClinton  Rubio will go along with it, like always.
@marcorubio Prob is Repubs spent too much time convincing voters we give too much foreign aid.Short-sighted Repubs now regret
Marco Rubio is a spineless jackass who happens to be right about something for once.
@ChelseaClinton Anyone who has worked in gov knows year end push to spend (waste) every $
We can start with cutting all funds to the welfare state of #Israel
@ChelseaClinton who'd ya vote for, Marco?
If we used a thesaurus...I think Aid & Charity kinda' mean the same thing. Ther's nothing wrong w/ Charity. Dan Rather's FB!
@ChelseaClinton yeah but no trust in Rubio..says one thing and will vote another way..i for just voted in but next time out
@ChelseaClinton @marcorubio Step by step, GOP will eventually come to their good old sense! Keep it up Marco!
@ChelseaClinton @marcorubio he is such a coward he will vote to whatever senate leader tells him.
As you know, @ChrisMurphyCT, @marcorubio often knows the right thing to do. It's getting him to stand by it when the peer pressure starts...
Don't be fooled, this leech will change his tune when push comes to shove on the matter. He's all hot air
@ClaraJeffery @marcorubio but yet he voted against tax returns release- not so good at all
@SenatorLeahy @marcorubio 

if u keep voting with the dictator, your anecdotal objections don't have effective impact
@SenatorLeahy @marcorubio We spend more on defense than the next 10 biggest spenders combined.  Add'l $54B?  Sheer waste.
@Newyorker2212 Add it to the list of things Trump doesn't know. #1452
Why is foreign aid not charity?
@michikokakutani @marcorubio Trump is hellbent (literally, one hopes) on using $ that helps people on new ways to kill people
Listen to your colleagues Chris and Marco, @SenRonJohnson and @RepGrothman . They get it.
@marcorubio wonder how silly this tweet going to look when he votes lockstep with the GOP on this matter?
Good luck with CT elections today #PleaeVoteBlueInCT
Lookie here. What do we have? It even implicates the REPUBLICANS on Intel committee. #RussianDossier

He's such a chicken toad...#RubioChoad
Scared of little old ladies in a townhall says they might yell at him lol
we already know what the prevailing thoughts are in Wash corridors of power; that is why we elected POTUS
USAID is an investment in humanity. Feed, heal, prosper, make safe needs to be our mantra.
Where in the Constitution is the government granted the power to tax US Citizens and give the money to foreigners?
You've got this Senator. With Your expertise on foreign affairs you know foreign aid is a HUGE part of peacekeeping process
.@ChrisMurphyCT oh look! .@marcorubio came out of hiding... won't go to town halls but will tweet 
even a blind squirel finds a nut once in a while. @marcorubio
Yeah, that lip service means nothing. He's never backed any of his words with meaningful actions.
I'm all for taking the $8B we give to Israel every year and putting it into American schools.
This is one more complicated issue that Trump will have difficulty understanding. But Americans get it
$5 says he votes to cut the funding.....
Why would I want to give away my $5 on a rigged bet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Please. After all the grief you gave him before the election. Self Serving
@marcorubio
What good is increasing the defense budget when the country becomes a steaming shithole that no one wants to live in?
He talks a good game but never backs it up with votes.
I have @marcorubio for my senator. If he shows up at work he talks a good game (except at town halls) will vote how he's told
good of you to find policies to agree on with @marcorubio 

We should have more of this, please @TheDemocrats @gop
I can't believe Marco said this.
@ClaraJeffery His ass will vote the way he's told to. He's just copying @SenJohnMcCain's pretend maverick routine.
it's a good thing that @marcorubio drank enough kool aid to put the blinders on
Yes for consensus!  #resist
Israel just got caught meddling in UK elections, sound familiar???
Did ya?
@marcorubio didn't say shit about .0038% of budget for NEA being cut which is just as important
NASA funding is at 0.5% of budget. Which is more important? Science of course! Get your priorities right. Development first.
yet, his words mean nothing, his actions have fallen far short (pardon the pun).
I live in Florida and he is ALL talk.
he's setting up his 2020 bid
But we are increasing defense spending by 50 billion.
thank God.
Little Marco hiding from town halls, tweeting out ideas he's too scared to tell Drumpf about
good for him. Now who will get the Russians out of our gov Mr. Murphy? All of us need to find this out & soon.
