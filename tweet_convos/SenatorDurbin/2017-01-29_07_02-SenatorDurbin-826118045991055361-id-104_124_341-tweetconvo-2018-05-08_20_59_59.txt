.@SenatorDurbin on @POTUS #executiveorders: "Well, I can tell you what’s going on here is that he has established a target on refugees..."
It's the only way to reach the deluded who won't watch/believe anything but fox "news."
you liberal BS spewing hypocrite! Obama ban Iraqi http://truthfeed.com/breaking-the-past-six-presidents-have-banned-immigrants/49400/ … 
@POTUS
Chris, TY for finally posing some tough/hardball questions to a Liberal guest- @SenatorDurbin on @FoxNewsSunday #Hannity #Fair&Balanced 
Too bad the liberals haven't given a rats butt about protecting American citizens in a LONG TIME.
When it takes 1 to 2 years to complete process, that is vetting! No threat from any of 7 countries!
@POTUS den durbin another wrong democrat. Not a rocket scientist.
WARNING:excessive drinking ofKool-Aid causes poor judgment,delusional thoughts and making fatuous statements
LAME to worry on 90day ban When Obama&Congress been sending Weapons to kill em 7 yrs!
Time to Primary Dick!
Impossible to vet folks from failed countries. They'll say anything to get in.
sure they are that's why Obama agreed to take those that were rejected by Australia and used fake fiance visas
Hillary loss Trump picks his SJustice u damn know HRC would have done the same @POTUS 40 yrs  w/conservative
@MaggieJordanACN it is already an extreme vetting process
@MaggieJordanACN @SenatorDurbin @POTUS https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/23/youre-more-likely-to-be-fatally-crushed-by-furniture-than-killed-by-a-terrorist/?utm_term=.7cf903ce9cf2 …
no it is not Senator
That is just a lie.  No one believes democrats or the media anymore.
@NO President Trump is exercising the right to keep America safe!
Do you think Germany should have made a similar decision months ago? I bet THEY do!
from that part of the world?
Does Durbin have amnesia about the testimonies that we could not adequately vet most people
Not a full or factual statement. It's your job to hold him accountable for the lies and spin. Sore losers.
@POTUS Weren't Boston Bombers citizens who radicalized partly on overseas trips?
refugee children? What about taking care of our children here in the USA first What about their parents
C WALLACE IS SUCH A FRAUD HE JUMPED ALL OVER @KellyannePolls BUT LETS  @SenatorDurbin LIE ABOUT REFUGEE VETTING UNCHALLENGED
Lies, lies and more lies
prefers an attack 1st on USA soil vs being an offensive government @POTUS  trying his best w/ obstruction
Interesting... didn't interrupt D.Durbin once!  Could it be because they are both Dems?
Unfortunately the children you reference..have parents...and sadly..some parents WILL use children as pawns.
you're lying, aren't children! FBI and DNI said they can't vet Syrian refugees. Voters said no more!
@POTUS
@POTUS Yet DHS says it isn't good enough. We must help refugees close to their homelands.
vote Durbin out. carefully vetted my butt.
that target is only  to fully vet and block those who are dangerous to the US people!
@POTUS Durbin(my senator) is nothing more than an obstructionist hack. I'm ashamed of him. Dick is aptly named

@POTUS Is Durbin's turban on too tight?
@POTUS   Liberalism continues to kill the country and goofballs like Durbin and Schumer lead the parade.
@POTUS @senatordurbin see my last post 20 so far
Crapweasel extraordinaire
Typical Democrat: stupid, abominable. Refugees cannot be properly vetted as Syria is virtually in total ruin.
BS
Obviously current vetting not good enough  @FoxNewsSunday @SenatorDurbin @POTUS
Durbin is a leftist loon...believed everything Barack told him... please
Ignorance abounds, it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to check records from the demolished ruins of Syria,  It's absurd.
@POTUS they could have a program where refugees get a pre-vet before they travel?
Durbin is a dinasaur and needs to be replaced, he is main reason I want term limits.
@POTUS so it's like the least deadly of all cancers?
@POTUS It's  libs want #extremevetting for @SenatorSessions but not for possible terrorist.
@POTUS Durbin is a left wing hack. He cares about overturning whatever the Republicans approve of. A hack.
Vetting ppl from war torn countries is non existent Safe havens should be available in their own countries so they can return
@SenSchumer  @LindseyGrahamSC  @SenJohnMcCain Does Reince,Conway,Kushner,Flynn, Rudy,Newt,Kingston have Security Clearances?
Reply to @FoxNewsSunday @SenatorDurbin Dems keep saying this is not who Am. is. yep we r no longer suckers or collateral damage!!!
@POTUS 
How do you 'vet' people from countries where gov't and gov't records are in shambles? Questionnaire?
@POTUS
if you agree to defend a Muslim culture, you agree with Shria law in your backyard.
so the senator from Illinois Chicago the murder capital of the US wants to keep citizens safe. Lies More Lies
Durbin, wld lie about anything and everything. He also claimed all kids wld die w/o vaccines during shutdown
Durbin cares more about Syrian terrorist then all the murders in Chiraq!! Help the citizens you work for!
@POTUS Islamophobia in 2017, how bout "No Irish"/"Chinese" & Jim Crow in the 18th-19th-20th centuries. IJS
The FBI and HLS have said in hearings that they are not able fully vet Syrian refugees.
@POTUS This country has become an "occupied nation" due to prejudice of the "selected potus" & hypocritical
@POTUS 

SUPPORT TRUMP !
@POTUS
@POTUS 

I wonder if Durban sees Europe and the piece loving Muslims raping their way across each country.
@POTUS Exactly! America is smart & wise. Protection is already in place. This order is an act of hate.
@POTUS one problem refuge ideology is sharia law vet that by keeping them out!
@POTUS BS. In these countries there are no records. They are failed states which you cannot check.
Durbin would allow terrorists to slip in & cause more injuries & death to Americans. U don't represent us
Unless Sen Durbin wants to divulge intell behind the Exec Order he should SHUT UP...Perhaps we need UAC again!
well @SenatorDurbin guess you missed the testimony of Obama admin saying they did not trust vetting process? 
Where's the leftist outrage in 2011 when Obama banned Iranians?  Oh wait, it's all about bashing Trump...
Iranians?
Make America safe and STOP bringing refugees in! These isn't they're country!
@POTUS evidently deaths of Am citizens is no big deal to liberals. Corrupt media  for 8 yrs
President Trump is making Americans safe again Go live in Muslim countrries if you don't like what he's doing.
Obama's standards and @POTUS stndards appear to be different.Hence the temporary ban.BTW-how about getting him his cabinet, maybe would help
chris wallace is purposely inaccurate. Only 59 syrian Christians wee let in under Obama. SHAMEFUL
And this FOOL fails to tell America there are NO databases or govt sources to check on people from Mideast!
Durbin lives in a parallel universe
@FoxNewsSunday @SenatorDurbin
If that's the truth..we are in deep doodoo.
