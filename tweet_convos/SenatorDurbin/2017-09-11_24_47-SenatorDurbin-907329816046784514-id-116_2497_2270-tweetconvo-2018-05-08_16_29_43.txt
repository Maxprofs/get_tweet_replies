They are not vetted properly of course-lies. Not all upstanding-reality check is needed hete. Stop left brainwashing on #DACA
Dreamers pay taxes. They're also not allowed to collect welfare benefits. #themoreyouknow
#dreamers were brought here as kids, not "popped out". And if you don't like some getting paid under the table get mad @ American employers.
lol you're delusional. You have no idea what #Daca is or the requirements. Look it up.
I'm sorry facing the truth is hard for you. Good luck with life though.
Let's not forget the contributions of those we don't consider "#DREAMers" who raised us to be hardworking. They are your constituents too.
They should not be hereto start with.
Probably what the Native Americans were thinking when the Founding Fathers went to war for Independence.
Oh please stop the nonsense. How about our kids and grandkids who we worked so hard for and ARE NOT GETTING ASSISTANCE INSTEAD GOING TO Daca
Nope. Why would any American want potentially dangerous criminal illegals. Come in LEGALLY.
Durban is a idiot
Stop with your scare tactics! No one is rounding up Dreamers and deporting them! #DreamAct
No! We can't afford it Dick
Explain to the voters why illegal imigration was not reformed 20 yrs ago. Shouldn't you give people a reason to vote democratic?
YES BUT THEY KNOW IT WOULDNT PASS.
If congress can spend 5 trillion a year they can get over there politics and start doing there job for us or we can vote them all out.
Maybe have a meeting with dreamers and see if they treat you have they treated @NancyPelosi that was a wake up call I hope.
They hate America!!
@SenatorDurbin could you please speak for #LegalDreamers as well? Why do they have to get deported or wait for 70 years? #HR392
Those 800,000 illegals can get the Fuck out. Round 'em up! Round up Durban & kick his ass out too.
It is the correct and decent thing to do. It also benefits our country and saves money.
Not
Thank you for fighting for us Senator Durbin...god bless you and please give my thanks to Senator Graham.
There's nothing to vote for.
This dreamers trusted the government, and now we must honour our promise
Have the "Dreamers" live with you then.
It must be done legally, fill paperwork out to stay or go home!!
We want the ungrateful jerks deported. All of them. #EndDACA #Dreamers @NancyPelosi
Retweet if you agree @SenatorDurbin is a globalist POS

FLASHBACK: Obama makes case - multiple times - against #DACA executive amnesty 
One deportation must happen the clown in the white house please
Obama isn't president anymore he was a clown and a joke
Trump is doing lots better his the joke of the world and the king Clown and has his own circus, well done Republicans.
Get a grip we just got rid of the clown in November and yes the Dems are a joke who also need to get a grip and try to work with Trump
All his clones all are crooked, now we have a clown that leads a circus that surrounds him self with crooks, nazis, we are so much better.
I knew you would see it my way now all you need to do is stop trying to make people believe that crap that you do Trump is the best
Good for you congratulations on choosing a looser. Let's see who goes to jail. Not Hilary time will show
My friend they have nothing on Trump tell you how I know if they did the Dems would have leaked it to the press by now
I AGREE.  MICHEAL BLOOMBERG HAS THE RIGHT IDEAS ON THIS SUBJECT
End the Dream Act & DACA. No amnesty!

This might be the moment Nancy Pelosi realized the monster she & the Left have created w/ their perpetual propaganda 
Since the Dreamers 'didn't do anything wrong'...not disagreeing... I guess you think we should deport their parents who did break the law.
Ezekiel 47:22 #foreigners residing among you & have children... consider them as native-born... they are to be allotted an inheritance
If they love it so much why haven't they started paperwork to become legal
@SenatorDurbin  please include Ageing out immigrant children in #Dream act. @gop @TheDemocrats  @realDonaldTrump  stop discriminating legals
How about if I disagree 100%. You are so disrespectful to the 1Million legal immigrants per year. They did it right, & you spit on them!
Hold the horses, concentrate on DACA, trully the violaters of law where the parents
And you will get thousands of votes by leading it by example
Deport them now. Deport them with prejudice. Deport them.
Sorry wasn't Daca set up with an expiration date?
Weren't these people supposed to begin the process to citizenship during that time?
say it like it is illegal foreigners

...Only if stupid amendments are not added by Republicans, just because they know this bill must pass.
Why can't these people go through the process to get legal?
Who is or ever has "rounded them up"?
(r). @DaveBratVA7th says there are actually 8 million #DACA people & they all get paid $100k/year to not work.
How do you reason w/ 'crazy'?

We don't need more immigration laws, we need immigration law enforcement!
Why not address the legal immigrants plight too. #Fairness4Legals
How many have gotten off the government welfare and applied for citizenship
Good question
800,000 illegal aliens protected by a illegal executive action and you want me to support legislation to let them stay.   are you stupid
I don't want my tax dollars supporting illegal aliens anymore.
...and from the only country they know, that's home.
RT if you agree: Congress must pass the #DreamAct to protect 800,000 Dreamers from being rounded up & deported from the country they love.
Nope

This was a fraudulent election. KellyAyotte "lost" by 1,000 votes with 5,500 fraudulent #Democrat  votes counted.   http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/11/new-hampshire-voter-fraud-fight-takes-new-turn.html â€¦
#ProtectDreamers #DefendDACA #UnitedForDreamers
DACA=dysfunctional immigration law =double standards/encourage illegal actsNOT fair for people waiting in line to become legal immigrants
I support DEPORTATION... You and your PARTY need to fix War Zone known as Chicago.I really dont care about Chicago.
Thank you! We must fight and defend DACA and pass something permanent!
You must be one of the dreamers and should go to the back of the and let the people who have been waiting for a long time go first
Pls God..hear our prayer
@SusanJHurley @gop 
@EricTrump ;).
Should have done it years ago.
No I don't agree that you should reward illegals.
800,000 plus family
dreamers or nightmares
from our country to theirs
buses hold 49 plus standing room---leaves at 6am
We need to defend DACA while also pushing for permanent and legal protections for 10M migrants @RepGutierrez @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorDurbin
We need to worry about the people who are in line already and waiting for approval to be in this country
#Colormerainbowchallenge follow me!!
And strengthen law to stop uncontrolled/ illegal imigration.
Oh yes they must pass the act. Don't send our young away.
millions of kids in the US need it far more. Wake up open your eyes and look around you. you may be dumb but not deaf or blind
How is this even fair? You can't ignore people who follow the LAW. #Fairness4Legals #LegalDreamers Matters !
So make it fair
DreamAct should include all DReamers. This bill doesn't do that. It separates out if you are here legally. Ironic!
#Congress must pass #GuaranteedBasicIncome Focussing solely on 800,000 people is missing the mark They can stay & be economically oppressed?
Lets help 800,000 american citizens first
My kids were born and raised American's. Too get an education they had to borrow money. They weren't allowed to "Dream ".
Wrong dickie. All you care about is illegal votes
No
They can SELF deport.
Pass the Kate Steinle act.......she was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Focus on American citizens and their rights, not illegals. Shame.
NO to giving amnesty to illegal immigrants. Every other country, including Mexico deports illegals. You s/be ashamed U care more about them.
To be fair, Dick doesn't care about them at all, he only wants their votes.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump American Citizens built this country; LOVE this country. Rule of LAW must apply. DACA should self deport. MAGA.
You swore a oath to defend the country but insists on selling it out
With all due respect, Senator, it's not about the country they love so much as it's about the promise our govt made. KEEP IT, please!
The government did promise it Obama did it all by himself
Legislating is like making sausage what are you willing to compromise with opponents of #DACA on to make this happen.
So Senator, what do we tell those immigrants waiting to enter legally.  Maybe too bad, we reward law breakers, not people who dont.
Can we deport congress?
If only!!! And #TrumpRussia
They need to get citizenship, but most don't want to be a citizen. Tough for them then.
YOU are dreaming
No, Congress must do its job and stand up for Actual American citizens. Deport these drains on our society now.  #MAGA

America says YES to the #DreamAct and NO to racists @realDonaldTrump & @USAGSessions #DonaldTrump & #JeffSessions are #Traitors #LockThemUp
Senator Durbin, I agree but please add the clause from RAC act by @RepCurbelo allowing nonimmigrant children to qualify for DreamAct.


You focus on the DreamAct, but has no act to address domestic terrorism. Americans dont matter, but illegals do? Protect Americans!!!
@MichaelDTubbs @MiFamiliaVota @CalEndow #STOCKTON AGREES! WE MUST ACT NOW! #DefendDACA #DACA
Lol no.
You will be deported from Congress in 2020!
#Draintheswamp
Don't forget to get your applications in before the 10/5 deadline. You need to educate people @SenatorDurbin; not get fear votes
2% of the dreamers eligible participate.
If they were to follow the already existing laws, they can become citizens, if not then send them back where they came from.
Not to mention the entitlements they crave
Who is being rounded up? No one..........
Only illegals will agree with you
Well thats not entirely true.  Only illegals will agree with him and those that want them to vote Democrat
Hi Mr SENATOR . Yes are all for Global Security and against the terrorism. . .
