Irrational would be calculating orbits without I recon ;o

Pi is profound. Raises lots of questions. Does Pi prove that God exists? Is pi God? Would Malcolm Roberts believe pi exists?
think about pi when you see a pig taking a beautiful shit on the ground. Without pi there would be no pig.
g!
It may be irrational, but pi plays an important role w/ scientists at @NASA: http://go.nasa.gov/2np439R   #PiDay
bona
is the theory of relativity works properly in practical field
Last digit of the number #Pi is 7. Prove me wrong! 
爱你
WHERE IS BEGINNING A ELECTRON
@ramimtulp
Is there really a way to get pi in the sky?
Happy Pi Day guys! @EkspertPL @GoForRm 
Happy Pi day buddy.


is the theory works properly in practical field
we all want a piece of Pi on #PiDay
@captainandros As @ToniaBuxton keeps telling us, it started with the #Greeks 

Looks like lemon merengue. 
I'm down with Pi. A finance guy, I used Pi in a real world money formula in my 50th year. Liberating.
i would like to be a medical  docto
pie* now we're talking
it also my birthday
#PiDay what an amazing #Symbol #Day
How many places out does NASA generally use in their calculations?
as a quick answer, nasa generally uses 3.141592653589793. so 15.
Dear Nasa, there is no 3rd day of 14th month.
According to your own data, pi day is Nov 10. https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/browse/calendar.html …
since when has Pi been 14.3
: @NASA is an American organization. Over here, date is usually in the mm/dd format, hence 3.14

@elaine_perry
Pie are square! Bahahahaha!

@NASA_Supercomp that is so interesting! Is "pi" another name for our God, the Creator of all things?
lots of hidden figures here!
For #PiDay I'm eating #AppleOs
#Pi is a number that's endless, infinite, everlasting, unstoppable, unlimited, continuous
@NASA_Technology Your logo is circular
My 11 yr is celebrating #happypiday with a math party. She rocks! Will break through some major scientific doors one day! #HappyPi
Thankyou
I love pi', especially the cherry and da' blueberry...
OLL...
I love the 'value of', 3.14, too!
Hahahah' ((((*
@ChelseaClinton F
Pi is so beautiful! Thank you Babs and Archie! #PiDay
PI=22/7
pi happy day. 3.1416....
You just confused 46% of American voters (trumplets)
@sciencevs #piday2017 I'm on a 1 man crusade for 22 of July. Surely two decimal places are not enough?
why don't you let your astronauts have sex in space .
Pi's use is very diverse. From humbly calculating the area of circle to number theory, it's one of the cornerstone of mathematic.
@ChelseaClinton 
Happy π Day!

#SongsOfTheResistance
what's #PiDay
XD
there's no THING that Pi doesn't play a large part in
@OfficialHHI I remember til 9.14159 
Nice!
Thx 
So #trump will probably try to end #Pi due to his low #IQ.  #nevertrump #notmypresident #pussygrabber #gop #liarinchief @NASA
Isn't the first line alone precise enough to circumscribe the solar system with just meters of error?
@NASAArmstrong And this is why standardised testing in #STEM should be eliminated. You cannot be a box ticker & be irrational!
Of course, Pi-day only really works in the USA with its frankly quaint way of recording dates. Great job with the Pi-day quiz though!
Happy #PiDay
Math, engineering, & science institutes are the only places where acknowledging pi even makes sense.  Not sure it needs a day, though.
my favorite, right after national donut day...
Have an Irrational day! #PiDay
amazing to knw all this
22/7 is so cool
@alwaysfreevoice @wdfig  Albert Einstein was born on Pi Day.
Perfect
Happy pi day all
Happy Pi Day
How could pi be termed "irrational?" Is NASA on an apology tour for pi?????
I’ve learned all the digits in Pi. ALL OF THEM. 

But not necessarily in the right order.
A happy Pi day to all @ NASA.
Happy Pi Day!
but I get two pies on tau day. :-)
we have not gone Indepth yet the relation with mass of centre of circle with 2pie R unfold many secrets
my name jeff
3.14 = 3/14 = #PiDay long live this ratio day! #LifeOfPi
22/7 twenty two divided by seven
pie is more like it. #flatearth #globelie
I like blueberry

nise
im a studhow to get information about my study?
I'm a student of engineering
I loved doing math with 3.14. Do you know Pi is round n cakes are square. Have a good day
great number!
nice

You meant "hap pi day"? ;)
happy pi day
呦吼
Who decides how many digits of π to bold in the graphic? I am triggered by the number of digits.
I thought Pi day was when fat people ate a lot of pie.
@KSoltisAnderson but as budgets get bigger the people of this country just get another #PiDay in the face...
It was aryabhatt...indian astronomer & mathmatician who calculated the value of pi 3.14 in 5th century at the young age of 23.. Great!
As infinite as the universe.
I prefer the pies I can eat 
Fake!!!
Pi is a lie.
The only number you need to know is u.
1 is the loneliest number 2 is all you need & Pi is a crowd
mmmmmm pieeee! #piday
Nice play on words.
grx y también cumple Einstein

yay
also einsteins birthday
πππππππππππ 3.14 πππππ
happy pi day
kinda like me. Irrational. But not important to scientists. #HappyPiDay
pia adora day!
cool
