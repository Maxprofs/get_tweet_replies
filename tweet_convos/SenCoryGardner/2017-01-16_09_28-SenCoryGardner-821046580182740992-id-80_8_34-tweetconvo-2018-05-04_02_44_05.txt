yet the words of his wife terrify you. Gutless kiss up.
hey, thanks for silencing Sen Warren reading Mrs King's letter. We see your true colors. I'm a constituent.
Empty words, Sir.  Empty words.  Decimating Dodd-Frank, confirming DeVos & Sessions...you stand with @GOP NOT #Americans 
and yet you can't stand to hear his widow's words read to you in a letter. Hypocrite.
But your corporate master told U to block the b*tch reading his widow's letter, so U took the money & obeyed. Good dog!
Wow. But you'll silence @SenWarren for reading the words of Dr. King's wife? How is that impugning anyone? You're a transparent hypocrite.
A great tribute, Senator. Why, then, censure and silence @SenWarren when she tried to read a letter from MLK's widow?
.@SenCoryGardner If you honor MLK then why did you vote to silence @SenWarren when she tried to read his widow's letter? #LetHerSpeak
Sir, you can not silence black voices and honor them at the same time
#letlizspeak
#hypocrisy I'm going to donate and volunteer to anyone who runs against you
if you care so much, why not let @SenatorWarren read #CorettaScottKing letter on the floor? Think we wouldn't notice?
That dog doesn't hunt. You voted to bar @SenWarren from reading King's letter AND from participating. GOP protects donors.
Do not pretend to admire MLK when you silence EW for reading his wife's words. You do NOT represent us. We will not forget.
You'll post about MLK when it serves you, but deny his wife's letter being read when it doesn't. Typical. #letlizspeak
but not last night when you silenced the words of his widow? #CorettaScottKing #letlizspeak #shepersisted
You just voted to silence an elected official for reading a letter MLK's widow wrote. 

We wont forget.
#letlizspeak
This is probably the most hypocritical statement ever, after silencing Warren's statement against Sessions racism yesterday
Why can't you show Coloradoans love? You love dirty money more. #ByeByeGardner
no, no you don't honour the man.  You want the appearance at honouring him.  Your actions in silencing Warren bear you out.
why do you commemorate MLK?
I'd say you should be ashamed of your actions, but you obviously have no shame.
reading the comments here, you come across like the kind of coward who won't take calls from his constituents.
#FixThat
Your hypocrisy is jaw-dropping, Senator. Please remember that the world is watching.
Today we appoint a racist as the AG and you are proud of this. #StopPresidentBannon
You are an embarrassment to your constituents and the memory of MLK #ShameOnYou
#letlizspeak 
then why did you vote to silence his wife’s words? #hypocrite
lip service from a hypocrite
You don't honor crap. You silenced @SenWarren for trying to read a letter from his widow. #LetLizSpeak
and so today we're all going to hope that you don't mark Black History Month by voting for #racistsessions #hypocrisy
You voted to gag Sen. Warren to prevent her from reading letter by Coretta Scott King. You hypocrite
yet you silence his wife's letter.. Can we say hypocrite?
- So why did you silence the words of #MLK's widow yesterday? #BlackHistoryMonth
hypocrite.
And you value him so much you're voting for people like #JeffSessions and #BetsyDeVos . How touching.
help me understand how you can honor MLK & support Trump's racist orders re: ban on refugees, wall?
Please stand up for his legacy and the civil rights of all Americans. Actions speak louder than words.
MLK would detest you, just as most Coloradans do
.@SenCoryGardner Thanks for being at the MLK Marade kickoff. Given your support, can we count on you to vote against Sessions for AG?
what a joke. Support Sessions, gut healthcare, lose your privilege to associate yourself with Dr. King.
you spent MLK day at a photo op. That doesn't make u a civil rights icon. Makes u an opportunist.
You can take away our health care when you get rid of your own, and those of the rest of the Senate and House.
Stand with your constituents

Your statements and votes to repeal the ACA dishonor MLK's legacy.
“Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.” Martin Luther King #saveACA
you are a Russian collaborator who has received over $25000 from Exxon. You have failed Colorado. Go back to home to Russia.
I thought the GOP is the party of voter suppression.
"Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane," Martin Luther King, Jr.
Uninsured rate dropped in CO 49% from ACA. Over 400,000 Coloradans now covered that you want to kick off w/out replacement
given what you and the GOP Congress are doing to his legacy, you are not worthy to stand in his shadow. #ACA #ShameOnYou
you are quite possibly the most duplicitous politician Colorado has ever seen. You share 0 wth the man MLK was.
let's use this opportunity or honor his legacy by keeping a health plan that guarantees the disenfranchised insurance!!!!!!!
Yet you vote to suppress voting rights. You don't see the contradiction here?
If you agree with Dr King then follow his lead & protect all Americans! No ACA repeal without new plan now & No to Sessions
talk talk talk. You're a GOP puppet senator. Why did u put party over your constituents & vote to repeal the ACA? #DoYourJob
as a constituent, I hope that you will honor MLkJr through forceful denouncement of PEOTUS' actions, words. Protect ALL CO!
you don't represent the majority of Coloradans.While this post is honorable, you're a #Hypocrite & a broken clock's right 2x
you can honor MLK by not undoing everything he stood for.
You act nothing like the leader MLK was. You are a straight party line political hack, and we will vote you out.
Lip service isn't gonna cut it.
Please keep talking about the Russia hacks. Please defend our democracy the way that MLK did. (I am a constituent.)
It is easy to honor Dr. King. It is hard to act on behalf of his ideals. To honor MLK is to act for the Beloved Community
Support MLK Beloved Community do not leave us without healthcare, do not support racist divisive language of DT. Speak Up
A statement means nothing if you take away peoples healthcare and support cabinet nominees that want to suppress voters.
You are the def of #hypocrisy. U used CO to advance your career. U care nothing for this state. I was born and raised here 1
to see you disrespect us by robbing us of our health care, letting Sessions threaten a huge industry here, and standing by
I do. They always seem disinterested. I am waiting for those summer town halls. Cant ignore us then.
Mike Coffman ducked out the back of his town meeting
Is this guy going to work at all! Seriously, wouldn't most people be fired? He's horrible
This must be the most hypocritical thing so far in 2017.
