This is what I've called for. We need to make the choice clear to NK's enablers, like China: either do business w/ NK or the US, not both. https://twitter.com/politico/status/910904208001552384 …
Stop trump's pissing contest first.  Both are mad.
Remember this? Where’s the bipartisan debate on healthcare? Pls follow @SenJohnMcCain & vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill @indivisibleden
Colorado will not forget how you voted. Neither will the nation. Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill.
Shut up. Do something courageous for a change. What we want is a NO vote on GC.
Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy @SenCoryGardner - it's bad for CO and harms those who are vulnerable.
Garbage man.
What about your opposition to #GrahamCassidy?  That is a little more pressing.  Stop being a Trump pawn.
And not a peep from you on #GrahamCassidy?
You sound like Trump...why would you want to follow a nut like that? Listen to CO & stop saying yes to everything "Dr. Evil" wants! #resign
Where is your post on opposing #GrahamCassidy? SenGOPshould return to the bipartisan process that was already underway in HELP Com'tee

Please work on bipartisan healthcare!
You said it in @FaceTheNation
You have worked bipartisan on NK
Now do it for CO & US w/ healthcare!
What I want to read about is your NO vote on Graham-Cassidy!!
We also need you to WORK 4 COLORADO. Do we have to beg? Vote NO on #GrahamCassidyDeathBill aka #WhiteMaleDeathBill aka #TrumpcareIsDeath
When you decide to step into the absurd, don’t claim innocence when the consequences greet you.
I want to read about your position on the cruel Graham-Cassidy repeal/ replace bill! Will you put ppl before Party for a change?!
So you refer to your own babble. Nice. Pathetic but nice in a quaint way.
Nothing you say or do will have ANY MEANING until you guarantee a NO VOTE on Graham Cassidy.

We pay you - DO OUR WILL - VOTE NO.
Senator, you use N Korea as smoke to not address healthcare. Suffering & deaths of those w/out healthcare will be on you!
Why don't you show a picture of the state of Colorado once you're done with it. You're policies are destructive to this beauty.
Distraction for his partisan plan to repeal aca for his donor buddies
What about Trump enablers??? 
You mucked up #BCRAP by voting yes every time. PLEASE vote NO on #GrahamCassidyDeathBill or 2020 is gone for you
Why you ignoring Healthcare vote on Twitter? Shameful. I saw The NY Times article where you said you had to do it for "donors."
Senator, words like "enablers" will not resolve anything and instead intensifies the conflict.
This is great. Keep the bipartisan legislation train going by voting NO on #GrahamCassidy please!
Why not what for a bipartisan approach to Healthcare. What the GOP is proposing is basically a Healthcare Holocaust!
And what about #GrahamCassidy legislation that steals money from #Colorado workers and gives it to #SouthCarolina
The majority of coloradans and Americans are against Graham Cassidy… Where do you stand Mr. Gardner?
yes, where do you stand on Graham Cassidy
Plus we need to not bandy around terms like annihilation of an entire country. How do you sleep at night working with #PresidentBombBrain ?
I'd like to read about what our Senator's doing to protect his constituents, the ones who put him in that office, from #GrahamCassidyBill
I'd rather hear about your bipartisan healthcare bill that didn't deny healthcare to 30 million Americans.
Why do you support #GenocidalGrahamCassidy? A yes vote & u're complicit in the murder of millions of Americans, not just those in Colorado.
If you vote for #GrahamCassidy you're going to have to explain how that's good for Colorado. Without lying. Grow a heart, vote No
So what???!  No state dept diplomats who can do the work; ineffective w/o diplomats who can negotiate the terms of international agreements
Vote AGAINST Graham/Cassidy
Where Coryyou don't get it do you? We need healthcare for all!
What is your position on healthcare?
I'd RATHER read your position on GRAHAM-CASSIDY. 
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Read about how every professional healthcare organization wants you to save ACA and work on bipartisan efforts. #SaveACA
Right on bro.  Now kill #GrahamCasiddy !!
Thanks for helping to stop NK. Don't let the naysayers sway you from repealing ACA
My man @SenCoryGardner, trying to kill two populations with one stone!
Thanks. Also vote "No" on Graham-Cassidy & return Congress to normal order by holding hearings, floor debates & consider amendments.
By refusing to return to normal order GOP is hurting our democracy and adding volatility to the insurance markets.
You can stand up and be a voice of reason and CO will back you up. Otherwise, see you in 2020.
Your respondents to NK post are 17 to 1 for Graham-Cassidy rejection. Are you listening?
The GOP DEATH PANEL is back in action!
Why are you pretending that you're "evaluating" the Graham bill, when you've tried to screw your constituents with every other vote?
Please do not vote for the Cassidy/graham bill. Understand the power you have in your vote. You are either for or against saving lives...
.

Cory is gonna sell out his constituents for a GOP money grab & destruction of social safety net 

.
How about bipartisan health care?
the more crucial timeline is Graham-Cassidy. Please expound on this healthcare bill first. #GrahamCassidy
Go to his website and email him about Graham-Cassidy. Th
I believe you are an honorable man. Act like one. Vote NO on repeal!
The people are getting restless,@SenCoryGardner  Be sure to stock up on turpintine to help take off all that tar with feathers.
"Rest assured your calls about health care are ignored.  I don't give a shit and will be voting to strip you of healthcare." ~ C.Gardner
Neat. Now tell us how you will vote on Graham-Cassidy.
He won't because he's a coward.
#GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
Thanks Senator Gardner. Can you PLEASE get Michael Bennet to vote in favor of #GrahamCassidy?? @GOVHickenlooper
#POEsParadox right here.
You talk a lot about North Korea scares and not at all about much greater risks to American lives. Will you vote no on #GrahamCassidy?
Do not support Trumpcare. Graham Cassidy is terrible for your constituents.
How about bipartisan health care? Russia investigation? North Korea isn't our biggest threat to democracy,@realDonaldTrump is you enable him
