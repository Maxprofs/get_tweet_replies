And yet you skipped the opportunity to meet with 100s more #OneTerm #YouWorkForUs
when are you going to meet your constituents? The ones you betrayed! We want to fit your new suit. #fired
You know #CrookedCory gets $ for agricultural equipment and speaker fees. He votes against the environment.
Hold a Town Hall, Cory.
When are you going to hold a town hall?
Did you discuss immigrant workers who are crucial to farmers and ranchers?
Wait, you believe in agricuture?
You do realize science plays an important role in ag productivity right?
Pope suggests it's better to be an atheist than a bad Christian
your environmental score card is 29. Stop voting with polluters. Vote for us!
Town hall???
Standing up against protectionist trade policies would help Colo farmers who export.
do your job and have a town hall so we all can speak to you!
looks like you're talking to a room full of people who don't care while your constituents continue to be ignored.
I am sure they are concerned about trump rounding up their workers
not backing Pruitt would have been a start
super cool for @GovForumColoAg when's the next town hall?
Lol @SenCoryGardner  holding a town hall in Colorado. That's rich! Maybe in Vail or Aspen, but not in Denver. @GovForumColoAg
I mean, @SenCoryGardner knows he's representing a state that didn't go to Trump right? He must not like being Senator.
He knows that outside the I-25 corridor our state is actually pretty red. He's playing the odds of low turnout @SenCoryGardner
great!  What difference is this going to make now that you voted Pruitt to head the EPA? He hates water/air!
no, he loves wate because he can make $billions from its contamination. "BLUE GOLD"
I'll tell U 1 way how 2 shrink exports of Coloag, repeal NAFTA. Let's see how @GovForumColoAg feels about that? -1 for you!
how about not poisoning their water?  Might help, just a thought from 81201
would be great if listened to your constituents instead of just pandering to your $$$ donors
Ah, Cory.  If only you were a true representative for your state.
Why won't you meet with your constituents?  Come and talk with us.
Town hall, please. 80238.
.@SenCoryGardner @GovForumColoAg Not treating their hard workers like criminals and hurting our economy is a great start.
how about showing up at a town hall to hear from a cross section of your constituents?
.@SenCoryGardner @GovForumColoAg ICYMI: @SenBennetCO has got this. You need to answer your phone! Attend a town hall! Talk to constituents!
Can you find time to meet with the rest of us, the so-called paid activists? You work for us, not rump!
To have agriculture you need clean air & water which you killed when you voted for Pruitt! Climate change is real!
You should never have voted for Scott Pruitt if you truly cared about our famers' environment.
<hint> FIGHT GLOBAL WARMING <hint>

The science is pretty clear. Too bad it doesn't speak as loudly as $$$.
You stay in your exclusive, elitist bubble. The real people of Colorado wonder why you hate them so much.
your audience looks super engaged Cory
yes, but when can the restof your constituents see you?  #whereiscory
But yet you refuse a Town Hall with your constituents. Apparently you are #NotMySenator
Pueblo loses 300 jobs thanks Gardner
Pro environment? Votes for Pruitt
Pro education? Votes for DeVos
when will you actually attend a town hall? When will you listen instead of talk? #ineffectiveleader #partyoverpeople
enjoy your last term . Don't reelect Cory coward Gardner. #coryout
look at all these special interest groups getting your attention! If only the common person could see you.
I spoke at a dennys for like 5 people that voted for me
we are building momentum Cory! You should probably listen or we will be voting you out...2020!!
this sounds really interesting. Where will the next town hall meeting be? #YouWorkForUs
Better listen to your constituents. Might find your face on national news SOON
ok, I get it now. Special invitation only for special interest meetings. When will you meet w/ us common folk?
@altUSEPA  I bet we can help the crisis by getting rid of the EPA! That'll help! 

/s
not showing up at a town home & you are home on vacation still be paid and have lifetime health insurance.
stop talking. Start listening.... To your constitutants. At a town hall.
Cory Gardner Chairs the Sen Subcom on Int'l Cybersecurity  and can hold hearings on Russian hacking at any time. #Russia
you want to boost CO farmers/ranchers? Yet, you voted yes to @EPAScottPruitt? That makes you a hypocrite at best.
sure are busy avoiding the people of Colorado. #russianpuppet
But u won't talk to your constituents personally in a town hall. Shameful! You work for us, not big business
climate change is a significant risk to ag in CO.
.@SenCoryGardner @GovForumColoAg nice, now how about a town hall  with your constituents?  Or are ya yella?
Where's Waldo?
we know you are in recess, have left your normal haunts in DC. hold a townhall and face the repercussions
#notpaid
.@SenCoryGardner At this point dude...I have to tip my hat to you. Your trolling is next level. #hostatownhall #whereiscory
Tom Cotton had the guts to hold a town hall. When is your town hall meeting? I am not a paid protester. I'm a CO resident.
How about speak to your constituents--I'm a lifetime R, a vet and zip code 80112. Stop avoiding us
was protecting the environment mentioned?
Cool. Looking forward to town hall meetings with you.
Any news on that town hall schedule? You must have a good reason to vote for ALL of Trumps cabinet picks.  Explain to voters
Hiding from your constituents, I see. If you want to stay in office, you should probably make time for us.
When do you plan on scheduling a town hall meeting with your constituents? I'll make sure to bring my CO ID.
the problem with Ag is that it's all about animal agriculture; plant-based is the answer!
Which crisis, now? Is that similar to the aerospace crisis that you addressed in a recent meeting?
how nice for them.  What about the rest of us!? Stop ignoring your constituents!
You can run, but you cannot hide, Senator. Quit playing cat and mouse and attend a Town Hall. #Colorado
http://ln.is/www.newyorker.com/ne/n53rJ â€¦
The people need to hear from you. Please contact the organizers of Friday's Town Hall meeting. Thanks.
Blah Blah Blah. Means zilch with Pruitt in charge of EPA. You already voted to surrender.
There you are! We've been looking for you Cory. Hope to see you at the town hall on Friday. #copolitics
When are you holding a town hall for EVERYONE in Denver or Colorado Springs?
Senator did you explain to them why you are voting for DJT's agenda of isolationism that will kill exports?
There's a Town Hall scheduled at 5 pm at Byer Middle School Friday Feb. 24. Will you show up? #WheresCory #willcoryshow
How much do your constituents have to pay you to get you to show up to talk to us? I guess paying your salary isn't enough.
you promised updates today on when and where voters can see you. I'm waiting. Or are you simply a liar.
if you have time to tweet, you have time to answer your phone #whereiscory
how about you pick up the phone when area code shows Colorado area code. Do you need a list? 
303
720
719
970
It'll be tough to farm as you've voted Pruitt for EPA chief and the land in our state will now be poisoned
please make time in your schedule to attend the town hall in Denver on Friday
Gosh, how much does it cost to get your undivided attention? Colorado voters would like to know.
how about not supporting a dangerously unqualified pres. who's doing his best to sour our foreign relations/exports?
or supporting the dismantling of the EPA? Do you honestly  think industry will police itself and choose to not poison land?
Do any of these groups know in advance you're showing up? Or are you like Walter White returning to ABQ?
You do know the best way to convince your constituents that you're listening to them is to actually listen to them, right?
Cute! Will you pop by a town hall and talk to your constituents who couldn't pay $100 to see you?
when will your schedule clear up enough for you to attend your town halls again?
Sure are a lot of your constituents who want to talk to you without having to pay to attend an event. Hold a #realtownhall
We are the Unpaid Voters of CO Assoc & ur invited to our mtg. Ur office isn't responding to the request. Would Friday work?
Cory, we miss you. Come visit us. Love, your constituents.
how about ensuring them clean water? We would love to discuss the gold king mine spill here in Durango #EPA #townhallmeeting
How about discussing the ACA with your constituents on Friday?
Yeah.  Let's help Ag by deporting its labor and making its products too expensive to sell. Great job! #whereiscory
wind and solar are plentiful in CO
Are you going to show-up at a town hall in Colorado.  I want to speak to you.
no one cares to see your tax payer vacay across CO, stop posting, unless it is schedule for a townhall!
When will you be holding a town hall in Denver, please? I would like to meet you and ask you questions, without pay.
Missed your comments on health care, tax cuts, immigration, and building the wall. Enlighten us.
As always Cory you are a total phony. No one cares about your bs photo ops. Town hall?
could have done something about the head of the EPA as climate change will make agriculture harder and harder
is very complicit in this whole Trump disaster. Shame on you Senator.
bet there were no questions about Devos or Pruitt there. #safeplace. #unpaid. 80210.
Oh and by the way if you think you will outlast us you are sorely mistaken. It's marathon and we will persist.
wow so you found time to dedicate to special interest groups! how about a town hall? 
I like palisade peaches grown using clean water, no coal particles.  I'd also like a town hall.  Thoughts?
there is no crisis in Ag. Now on to the majority of the state that you have been ignoring, listen to us!
the rest of your constituents would love to have an in person meeting you too, maybe at a town hall???
If you care about agriculture, then why don't you care about climate change?
When and where will your town hall be? Your constituents have a few crises we would love to discuss.
HOLD A TOWN HALL! You are beholden to ALL of your constituents! #wherescory
might want to consider appearing at a town hall. A Lot of people want to talk, Senator.  And guess what? They are not paid!
You can get behind efforts to curb climate change for starters. @GovForumColoAg
Um...maybe make sure they have an earth to farm on. Thx for voting for Pruitt, numbnuts!
#whereiscory
Crisis?  Please explain.  Did the subject of the DeVosfamily contribution come up? #FreeTheDevos50k.  80920
Start thinking about trade. and possible consequenses.
Answer any questions from constituents? Your offices don't even know your schedule. Help them out @CoryGardner
why not meet the voters. Lots of them would like to meet with you.  Most of my neighbors in 80504 would.
