Thanks @SenCoryGardner for meeting w/ CoBank, @AmericanAg, @Premieraca, & Farm Credit of Southern Colorado in D.C. this morning! #FarmCredit 
So banks are welcome to stop by but your constituents are not? Really?
Cory, please issue a statement giving your opinion as to whether Donald Trump is fit to serve as President, given his recent Tweets.
You are not representing us! How can you vote, twice today, against the will of your constituents? https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/us/politics/senate-votes-repeal-obamacare.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur …

@9NEWS @ABC7Denver @CBSDenver @KDVR Since Cory Gardner won't talk to his constituents maybe he'll talk to y'all.
Could you stop by some town halls?
Do you think we will forget by 2020?  Hardly!  We will remember.  And we will remind you.  You don't care about your constituents!
Hear your constituents. I can't believe I'm doing everything I've been told to do just to be ignored. Have you no respect for the process?
You do not know better than the consumer advocacy groups and professional associations rejecting Trumpcare. You do not.
You can't possibly think we are going to let you change the subject from your vote ripping healthcare from millions of people...
You are pathetic Cory! Just quit! You would help this great nation a lot if you do!
Sir you are out of touch with your constituents. We need affordable  healthcare for all. Listen to your constituents and do the right thing
I think he only listens to the Trumpsters in Yuma.
Cory, stand against ACA skinny repeal! Your constituents are calling on you, stand up for us for once!
Can you remind us what the fee is for this kind of visit? Maybe we can take up a collection and you can visit your constituents.
Who cares???   After your vote to repeal the ACA, all these things are mere attempts at distracting our attention from your terrible actions
I call on you to vote no on "skinnyrepeal" & then join with the people who want to fix our HC. Make it Into #WeCare4YourCare not #DontCare

This makes all the major insurance associations opposed. https://twitter.com/jrovner/status/890597282000900098 …
you are a coward cory! Have a town hall, Thanks cory
So, Senator, you're going to let Trump decide policy by tweet?  This is the America we live in now?  Disgusting.
Recall Cory Gardner.

He no longer represents the people of Colorado.   He is nothing but Trump's rubber stamp.
Unfortunately the constant makes no provisions for recalling a senator. We can hope he resigns in disgrace though
The Constitution is silent on recalls that involve pitchforks and torches. #throwingthatoutthere
Super apt analogy. In the movies people use pitchforks and torches to go after the monster in the castle
I keep trying your office but I get a busy signal or direct voicemail, I'm not a paid protester, I'm the wife of a vet I demand a townhall!
I'm a vet myself so I hear you and share thr frustation. Vote him out
You'll meet with banks, but won't do in person town halls? I guess we see where your priorities are.
Makes sense, your Trump Score is 95.6%.https://goo.gl/RDk89Z   Donors OVER constituents.  Can't wait to 2 vote u out #KillTheBill #Recall
How come every time I stop by I get kicked out?!
I urge u to vote no on Trumpcare. Btw, lobbyist tend to stop giving u money when ur voted out of office! U need to remember who u work for.
You ignored your constituents calls to meet about healthcare and you're announcing that you're meeting with banks....? 
YOUARE GARBAGE
Oh! Was someone able to find you at your office mr. cory? Did you show up? Ah I see. They had money for you then? How about constituents?!!!
CoBank's offices are off of I-25 in the tech center. Couldn't have had a town hall while you were here? #cowardCory
I will dedicate every spare minute I have, going door to door campaigning for your opponent.
MEET WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS. Banks are not people!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely. He keeps ducking his constituents.
Who cares about healthcare?  Certainly not you. Voting to strip millions of their Insurance. All why lying about the ACA?  Constituents know
Once again lining your pockets with big money. Maybe you can be a lobbyist for them when you're voted out of office.
Disgraceful. Bankers over sick children, elderly and the poor. We've seen your true colours. u won't survive the next election. #killthebill
I'm noticing something about all the "Coloradans" @SenCoryGardner is meeting with.
We all are noticing this.
Cory Gardner = Shill
Def: an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others
YOU ARE NOT LOOKING OUT FOR OUR BEST INTEREST SIR...  You work for US and you're not doing this AT ALL
Look here Mr Gardner...  I took the liberty of making some changes to your Twitter home page. I think it reflects you a little better, enjoy
It's nice that you post pictures of the people that buy your votes. When will you hold a free, open, & publicized town hall?
While you sold healthcare down the river with your votes?
Treason Gardner not living up to what Colorado asked you to do.  Voting for a disaster health care bill is shameful.  You WILL lose in 2018
don't kill health care for rural Coloradans.  You could be more sensitive to this coming from rural Colorado yourself. SHAMEFUL
OMG @CoBank ! You found Senator Gardener! Can you tell me where he's been hiding? I've been looking for him for weeks.
@CoBank @AmericanAg @Premieraca did they leave the $$$ on the dresser afterward or were you paid upfront?
Coward Cory continues to meet with lobbyist yet thumbs his nose at his constituents. No townhalls, continues to hide behind twitter and FB.
Assertion that O'care is failing is baseless, and GoP replace makes matters worse, esp in Colorado where we took expanded Medicare!
Oh, you held a meeting with corporations but can't hear from your constituents. I'm sure that'll go over well.
Hey Cory! How about you stop by and chat with us??
And thank you for leaving! Couldn't be soon enough .
opposition from physicians, healthcare advocates, insurers, and 87% of the American public to deny healthcare to 22 m Amer's
You might actually be one of the most cowardly people to ever serve in the Senate. Your votes shows your true colors. #explainyourself

CONGRESS,SUBPOENA ALL AMERICAN'S WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP OR STOP RUSSIAN WITCH HUNT
You have doomed yourself in the next election.  Can't wait to vote you out.
What is wrong with you voting to repeal without a replacement for the ACA?
So it looks like we need to be a bank or a $donor$ and bring a shirt if we want an audience with the reclusive Gardner.
Oh so you have time to meet with Banks but not with the people in Colorado? Very interesting.
The only mission you are on is to screw your constituents....RESIGN!
#corythecreep Votes for repeal and replace & Votes for repeal and delay. No matter what, he's against the black president's plan! #racist
TraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitorTraitor
But that would mean you'd have to answer your phone. Also your nose is looking a little orange. Stand up for Colorado not the liar in chief.
Don't bother running for reelection
Cory did not get those lips sucking door knobs.
Senator, Easy one; Will the BCRA have a anti-freeloader provision (only get insured when sick or old)? If so, explain how?
DRAIN THE SWAMP PULL YOUR SELF OUT OF SERVICE!
Bank....shocking. You are so cliche
Can't get CHICKEN SALAD OUT OF CHICEN SHIT!
When is your next TOWN HOUSE METTING a HOUSE DEVIDED 
CANNOT STAND! (ABE LINCOLN)
Resign! You don't represent us
Fearing you have achieved "full Lamborn" - completely unaccountable to constituents/irredeemably useless. Answer your goddamn phones.
Shocker that Cowardly Cory won't meet with constituents.  Only those who pay for access.
Thanks for helping me make believe I'm important! #corythecreep happy to meet with big business while he screws his constituents' healthcare
Town Hall?
Nope!
Another private meeting with his paid Russian backers!
#Resign
You're an embarrassment.
You had people with disabilities camped at your office and rather than meet with them you had them arrested #savemedicaid
Stop meeting with businesses and meet with your voters! Since you haven't done that yet I'll tell you on Twitter: VOTE NO ON TRUMPCARE!!
El Paso County Constituents would love a meeting, say Town Hall.
What do you say to that Cory?
We get it.  You like banks, you don't like voters.  It's cool, voters don't like you either.
At what point will you indulge listening to your constituents to the extent you obviously embrace the special interests? Just asking.
Where's Cory getting paid to vote party lines and not listening to the people of CO???
Oooh. 6 constituents hand picked and approved by the people that OWN YOU! Another town hall? #WheresCory #GOPROT
He meets with his donors regularly. The rest of us are screwed #OneTermCory #CoryTheCoward #2020Vision
Glad you have time for the banks.
craven cory: you are such a smug phony. REAL TOWN HALL at red rocks!!!
I'll thank him when he stops screwing us over for the sake of his party. Remember who you work for, Cory, and it's NOT the idiot in the WH
Thanks for nothing Corey.  Stay close to the monied interests and you can go far, at the expense of low and middle income Americans.
Thanks for nothing Cory. You are, and continue to be, pathetic.
Nice! Another meeting with your congressional office's investors? Good thing the back scratching continues! That way CO folks stay fucked!
Have you ever considered meeting with actual people from CO instead of business groups, out-of-state lobbyists, and 3rd-world dictators?  
Or maybe meet with @aarpco or @coruralhealth or @KPColorado or ...?
Thanks for voting ACA repeal debate.  Skinny Repeal no good = pathway to singlepayer.
Delayed Repeal with piecemeal Replace sounds workable.
But you're too scared to meet your constituents about healthcare.
So nice that you can meet with banks! How about meeting with some constituents for a totally out there change of pace?
#WeWillReplaceYou
These are the people @SenCoryGarnder truly represents, not the people of CO. —> CoBank, @AmericanAg, @Premieraca, & Farm Credit
Money talks. 
@CoBank @AmericanAg @Premieraca Follow the $$ for Cory's attention. Screw the people who are screwed by this.
That is not a Town Hall! You owe your constituents a face-to-face! Given your lack of interest in us, seems you might be job-hunting.
Did you cash your checks yet?
When was the last time you held a town hall, Senator? When is your next town hall scheduled?
How much did they pay you for that visits?
"Paid constituents"
So, if I bring my T1D 4 year old to your office with a t-shirt, maybe we can talk healthcare? @JDRF has some pretty cool styles. What size?
I can bring a Juvenile Arthritis shirt and Duchenne MD so he can identify ALL the children he let down. 11/3/20
Yes!
No average Coloradoans in this group. None of these donors lost their health care with your vote.
Gone in 2020.
Issue a statement explaining how you determine who you'll meet in person, please. Transparency.
#lifeofacoward
@SenCoryGardner is being bought by lobbyists
You voted for Repeal/Replace yesterday.   Will you vote for Repeal today?  We're watching, Cory.  We have a loooooooooooooooong memory, too.
That’s nice, when are you going to have a town hall with your constituents? When are you going to answer your phone?
For the record, here's another thing you've lied about re. the ACA:
What are you thinking? You really do not want your job do you? How about a town hall? Meet with people not banks.
Oh Senator, I love seeing you meet with Coloradans, now about a town hall to discuss health care? Would love to meet you in person
I can't wait to read your book "How To Suck At Being a Senator Without Really Trying".
#onetermcory
#resignnow
Interesting, you will meet with banks but not your constituents. You are a piece of work. Such a shame. #OneTermSenator
Hey thanks for voting to take away my healthcare. You're a complete embarrassment to our great state, 2020 can't come soon enough.
2020
If people are DEAD from no healthcare, there won't be anyone to eat the crops that these banks finance; Wipe the smile off your faces!
See the line that divides Cory's one mission to rip health care from 575K Coloradans, and the many voices that beg him to represent us.
So all people from Colorado are white men? Real cross section of your voters there pal. 80212 #1term
You will be remembered for trying to kick millions off healthcare and lying about it to voters. Live it up now big shot! #1term
Resign.  Don't worry, you won't be missed.
The bigger the smile, the less they need health care. Hindsight is #2020.
You're a traitor to your country, constituents and the human race.

I can't wait until you need health care and can't afford it.
If you do not feel @SenCoryGardner is listening to you or representing you tweet & reach out to local media today.
Can I stop by?
When are you going to meet with your constituents?  Pathetic
Stand up for your constituents VOTE NO ON any Senate healthcare legislation. FIX THE ACA
Vote NO on repealing healthcare, you weasel!
Hey Cory, I am a constituent. You are to vote NO on any bill, motions, amendments or anything related to Repeal, Repeal/Replace, BCRA. NO NO
@denverpost @9NEWS @News4Denver @7NEWSDenver @SenCoryGardner will meet with special interests & donors, but not constituents!
Thanks @SenCoryGardner  for working so hard to take away our health care!!
ONLY meets w/ special interest groups writing checks then flaunts it on Twitter to his constituents #COpolitics #wherescory

 
What planet do you live on?
@SenCoryGardner is a bought and sold fool if he thinks this will sway our resolve to replace him 11/3/2020. Photo ops won't sway us.
In looking at this tshirt, it represents the people of CO. We are many voices (ignored) with one mission, to defeat @SenCoryGardner 11/3/20.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #StopTrumpCare #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
.@ChrisMurphyCT explains how Obamacare isn't dying — Trump is purposefully killing it 
Okay, posing over. What about a statement on POTUS banning transgender people from serving in the military?
REALLY? This is how you are spending your time? What is in the next health care bill you will probably vote for? Do you know? 2020
Please please don't let the most vulnerable in the state of Colorado down.
Fire your social media manager. Is this really what you are going to post TODAY of all days?? So out of touch!
Do not pass heath care
Why don't you meet with the real people who's lives you affect? Or should we confuse the schedule and avoid disagreement.
You have time to meet w/ banks but won't talk to constituents about health care.  Be sure to take the tshirt when you pack your bags
Meet with your constituents
So weak Cory Gardner will meet with the people from the banking industry but not his constituents? Pathetic.
So nice you can meet with bankers and smile meanwhile your boat to kill Coloradans. No town halls. You are trying to hurt that’s sick, poor
I was at Broken Plow in Greeley when you slid out of a side door to hide from your constituents. Meet with us! The people you represent!
Any statement as to your thoughts on voting for the failed straight BCRA last night? You are beyond despicable.
This guideline from @timkaine is pretty easy to understand. What's your goal for CO, Cory? 
@9news @denverpost @KDVR
I'm using this test for votes on GOP health care bills: will it raise costs for Virginians and/or take their care away? If so, I'll vote no
You are a JOKE!!!!!!
Really, this is what your team came up with to tweet about on a day when healthcare is terrifying coloradans. Do better! Be better than this
He's not better than that unfortunately.
Of course you have time for them but not us.
Will you meet with your constituents, please?
Really? REALLY? "I handpicked some constituents for a photo op and all I got was this lousy T-shirt" 
#Healthcare Cory. #HEALTHCARE
Will @SenCoryGardner still accept his TAXPAYER FUNDED health coverage when he STEALS healthcare from 575,000 Coloradans???

#KeepCalling
Coward.
