Stop warmongering and focus on healthcare douchebag 
I'm encouraged that you won't be reelected.
We are discouraged that you vote for a killer HC bill and you hide from your constituents. Your 75% HC subsidy make you deaf!
You should be talking about how your healthcare Vote would be NO !!  Shame on you !  #lnotvotingforyouagain
As usual whenever #Healthcare #diabetes is in the news @SenCoryGardner begins tweeting about #NorthKorea
Senator, we DEMAND a full repeal of obamacare.  Not obamacareLite, not Rinocare but a FULL repeal & free market replace.
Enablers of North Korea's Nuclear Weapons must be sanctioned! 
Hi Cory..Ya looking forward to Voting on the Repeal only TrumpCare bill?
The WH would be too incompetent to take on toddlers holding baby spoons.
Are you encouraged that the Adminstration would still like to throw Coloradans off their health care plans?
Senator, much like North Korea governs behind closed doors, so do you and Trump. Our democracy is in peril.
Hold a town hall for the great people of Colorado. You coward!
now get encouraged and repeal Obama care you voted to repeal it so you spineless double-talking waste of my vote
One term Cory!
hey Senator, some of your colleagues figured out how to grow a spine and vote No on #BCRA... it's safe for you to do so as well
You're uniquely unqualified to be senator. Maybe not like Trumpty Dumpty, but people in public service have to actually care about citizens.
North Korea? This administration is stirring things up with them more than ever. How's party before country working out for you?
Coward Cory, will you hold a townhall and stop hiding behind Facebook and Twitter?
A straight ACA repeal throws sick Coloradans under the bus.  Stand up for your constituents. 80863
What's the obsession with NK? You haven't shown any leadership so far...healthcare,Russia,DJT jr, returning Russian compounds.Why r u there?
Nothing about this administration is encouraging.  We will remember your support for Trump in 2020.
You have constituents arrested to avoid talking with them. You might be happier working in North Korea. I suggest you move there, please.
You're very brave when you risk the lives of others, even as you cower at the thought of a townhall meeting. Hypocritical? Irresponsible?
I'd be more encouraged if you paid any attention to your fellow Coloradans.
What does your healthcare legislation recommend? Because you know, you are one of those 13 MEN writing it. #votenoBRCA
All I can say is ..You will lose in the next election Mr Hideaway
@SenCoryGardner Simply this: you do not represent Coloradans. Hindsight is #2020
Watch Gardner's constituents get arrested for requesting a town hall. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154554618071277&id=552276276 …
Uhhhhh..... HEALTHCARE, RUSSIA, HEALTHCARE, RUSSIA!!!! Stop the NK shiny object nonsense!!!
Are all Republicans in bed with the Russians?
Sen., you do realize if you don't get ahead of this "health" bill as a firm no that you will NEVER hold elective office in Colorado again?
I'd be encouraged if you'd address healthcare with your constituents.
Agree.
Great!  Now stop trying to kick people off of health care.
First think about healthcare for the PEOPLE in Colorado.
You continually make statements about Korea. Your silence on healthcare is deafening. Silence speaks volumes. No town halls. #byebyecory
We've tried sanctions for 11 years how's that been working out? Oh ya, more nukes more missiles; must be the correct strategy. Carry on.
That you find anything about this administration encouraging is concerning.
Really?  And what about the enabling that you are doing with the Trump Administration.  Lies, Collusion, Conspiracy.  Come on Senator!
I am 64 and buy my own insur. And have pre-existing existing conditions, like everyone 60 plus, don't let me dowm
You have a 27% approval rating and refuse to meet with the other 73%. Please just resign. We need representation now.
In Colorado we're targeting those who support terrible outcome for http://Colorado.one  term senator YOU see ya in Yuma
2020
Great news, other senators are stepping up to save healthcare, since you won't. I bet now you will come out against it...
More senators actually saying no to Mitch. Are you a leader or a follower? People not party. Surprise us...
Seriously Senator, this is not in the top 10 issues that concern your constituents. Are your really this tone deaf?
I'd be encouraged if you would resign.
Your State Director, Andy Merritt, gave us a fake phone number. How low will you go to avoid 73% of your constituents?
73% of your constituents were referred to as "terrorists." Any comment on that? http://www.steamboattoday.com/news/county-republican-chair-confirms-gardner-canceled-private-meeting-in-steamboat-because-of-protests/?fb_comment_id=1398461426888886_1399088353492860&comment_id=1399088353492860 …
I wonder if your wife and children are proud of how you are behaving.

Is anybody reading your @'s to you?   Hey intern, let the Senator know, his @'s deal mainly with healthcare.  Maybe tweet about that?
No on Senate Health bill please.  Thank you.
Yet you stand slavishly at the side of those who would lay waste to the health of more lives than NK could in their dreams. #corythecreep
Do the right thing and vote no on the Healthcare bill. Just one more vote need to stop this madness. Remember your constituents.
That's wonderful. Now vote no on Republican wealthcare.  Country before party.
You're doing a great job Sen Gardner.  Please vote to rip and replace the imploding obamacare so we can move on to tax reform.
Be encouraged by holding a LIVE, IN PERSON town hall. Meet us face to face. Ashamed of your votes? Your POTUS? You should be. Gone in 2020!
I guess once N Korea fires at us healthcare won't matter so why bother listening to us??
On another note, what happened to "healthcare is too big, complex for one bill"?  Repeal O'care & fix it in pieces. Sell across state lines?
Where's Cory
@SenCoryGardner is a thug and needs to go I 2020, or sooner if at all possible. #partyovercountry #partyoverstate
That East Asia committee you're on also has to do with International Cybersecurity. You should have at least something to say about Russia!!
Pat yourself on the back, Senator. And then vote NO on the Republican health care plan.
What legislation would you propose to punish @realDonaldTrump for his collusion with the Russians and his overall TREASON? C U at the Polls!
Colorado needs to come together and vote Gardner out!!! The @GOP doesn't care about Colorado constituents. I say #MAGA by voting GOP out!!!
Here's the new CBO!  Vote NO
You're encouraged for anything to take away from #SCROTUS and his campaign's collusion with Russia and heartless med coverage bill - we c u
If you have any courage, resign, and re-stand in the consequent special election.
Give us a break, Senator. We do NOT want to hear from you about anything else (at all) until you address HEALTHCARE!!
You can't be serious. Your #1 priority is healthcare.  Weird I have to tell you that.
Happy ur concerned abt enemies abroad; dont overlook #GOP inside our borders undoing the regs/laws keeping US and CO safe and strong
...and dont forget that you're part of the problem, and not the solution...
It is astounding how deaf you are to your constituents. I have yet to see anybody share your concern about North Korea.
Trumpcare, vote no!  For once, please stand up for your constituents and not for McConnell and party.
Not only have their been no hearings on the healthcare bill, but your own opinions are a mystery. Can you please explain them to us? /1
Can you please tell us—of the people who've called your office, what % are in favor of this bill? /2
Assuming you've seen the national polling that puts the approval at 30%. I promise you it is even less, here in your purple state. /3
And I'm discouraged Sen Gardner continues to target healthcare, while enabling the administration to commit illegal acts w/out consequences
My nephew was in Iraq war vet with shaking brain syndrome from an IED please don't take away his Medicaid!
meanwhile your constituents want to talk to you about the immediate threats faced: 1)proposed healthcare bill & 2)russian interference.
Stop it already!  Do you not realize there is a far greater crisis happening at home that you are part of?  HEALTHCARE
and yet you sit on the sidelines while a Russian Dictator elects an American President. oh and kill people w/ur healthcare.
what about the trumpcare enablers? who's targeting them? REAL TOWN HALL at red rocks!!
Take a walk on the wild side Cory. Tweet about something that your constituents care about. Hold a town hall meeting. Do your job!!!
Look at all the feedback from the other side Cory
Healthcare
I'm not encouraged because you are targeting  the old and poor with your wealthcare... oops I mean "healthcare" bill. Love a town hall...
Your republican health care bill will kill more Americans than will North Korea
Forget that. What's more dangerous to average Americans? Your Republican Trumpcare. Vote NO on the bill or give up being senator of CO.
What about Trump enablers?
I'm discouraged my Senator ignores his constituents. 

(@SenCoryGardner - you're my Senator btw) 

...any suggestions?
#WeWillReplaceYou
Why are you obsessed with North Korea when your constituents are not? Enough already.
It's your #BCRA vote that is keeping me up at night, Cory. Cut the International Diplomat act. North Korea? You can't even face Coloradans.
This is who Gardner can face.
And this is who he can't face. Something is terribly wrong here.
Sir, you really need to either turn off this twitter feed or start paying attention. NK is important, healthcare is more so. We Are Watching
Cory, why do only tweet about North Korea? You live here, your constituents live here. And we're sick of you failing to do your job #WTFCory
@SenCoryGardner what about Healthcare, Russia, Colorado town hall?
Oh good grief, Cory dear! What about the death panel enablers? Y'know, the Trumpcare legislation? Your constituents deserve an explanation!
I'm disappointed that BCRA targets 400,000 Coloradans on Medicaid.  Expansion.  What do you recommend there?
Well thanks Cory! Now who is writing the legislation to target Trump enablers like you? You people must be stopped.
Yay. You wrote a bill. Gold star for you. Now start talking in person to us about ACA and the Russian invasion. 80517. #unpaid.
In 2020 we'll be after the Donald Trump enablers. So it works out.

The N Korea tweets are seriously some kind of weird joke. NO on #Trumpcare, and WTH is with #TrumpRussia! That's what we want to know about
That's nice bit what about that tax break to the 1% that will cost 22 million people their health care. #fixit
I was put on hold for 2.5 hours on your DC line on Friday. Kept hearing lines are busy I finally gave up. Wow no time to hear from  us. Sad
We have you been? Come talk to us, 80246. VOTE NO on this terrible health care bill!!!
What are your thoughts on the Russian enablers? Because your office has no statement on #TrumpRussia, #BCRA, or basically any other policy.
Susan Collins cares about her constituents more than she cares about her political party; why can't Senator Gardner have those values?
No one cares. As many as 22 million Americans will be critically vulnerable to bankruptcy and increased mortality by the #GoPHealthcarebill.
Shut up about North Korea and hold a town hall. Your constituents want to speak to you
The GOP Senate & House are paralyzed by ideology: "gotta repeal Obamacare". Is there one courageous Senator who will vote NO on BCRA?
Still not talking about the healthcare bill.
Stand up for your constituents. Vote note on the Senate healthcare bill.
Are you encouraged to see the most corrupt administration of modern times in action? Don't its victim in 2020. Speak up NOW! #25amendment
I'm not encouraged by your silence on  healthcare stance.  Please vote NO on the disaster known as Trumpcare.  Millions of Americans need it
Oh please. Hold a town hall, take care of our health care, stop pretending to hate dictators.
Why are you concerned with dictators, when you're visiting duerte and supporting trump?!
I'm discouraged that you are a champion for the rich, a coward and think the top 1% deserve a tax break on the backs of Medicaid recipients.
I'm concerned about you taking health care from over 0.5 million Coloradans, having lifetime caps, and rules not applying to you. Vote no!
You've talked more about North Korea the last month than you have about Trump's treason, or your health care bill.

Resign.
Don't cower. You stood behind McConnel when he announced the vote. Are you saying yes or no to the BCRA?  Be a leader say what you will do
Senator Gardner
What do you stand for?
Who do you stand with?
Eagerly awaiting your response since 7/5/17
#Indivisibleden #ADAPT #AHCA #ACA
Don't hold your breath...... he's too much of  #partyovercountry Senator. He'll never answer you.
I'm discouraged  you won't attend CO town halls & appears you're going to vote to repeal #ACA.  Careful voters are watching!
Even on a Fox poll ....
Please vote NO on the healthcare bill. Colorado is watching.
I'm discouraged by you not having townhalls and taking away our healthcare
I would like you to explain why you are going to vote yes on the healthcare bill.
While NK is a concern,  it isn't a immediate threat to the health & wellness of the US as the current #Trumpcare is.  Vote NO on this trash
Attn: Commercials aired to have you vote against the healthcare bill, b4 the bill came out. Please do what is right for Co.
COME ON already! Misdirection and distraction. Why are you clinging to this broken strategy? You're not a smart man.
Forget this and vote no on Your cruel health care bill
You are the worst!  Get off the trump train. You're one of the senators who absolutely has to go.  And all you want to do is talk about NK.
#jrSen #GOP #waterboy how about some action on #RussianCollusion #russianBanks and #agentOrange #enablers?!? #Oligarchy #cronyCapitalism #CO
Why have you never come to Denver? You know you are doing a horrible job and have been sucking a traitors ass! Colorado voter!
Don't take our healthcare! Colorado voter!
I'm encouraged that now that McCain is on sick leave we have time to debate your replacement for Obamacare. When does that convo start?
I'm encouraged when this WH does anything other than repay their Russian indebtedness.
what about Russian enablers eh? Think we might need to work on that too...
Encouraged? We have entered the dark ages of Am  politics under u & ur  party's leadership.  Listen to CO voters and vote NO on Trumpcare!
Yes...we voted for REPEAL and that is what we expect....not Obummercare light!!!!  Get govt and my tax dollars out of healthcare!!!
Please vote "NO" on Trump care.
Do you feel you can make a statement on #Corycare? Will you throw your constituents under the bus to appease the GOP?
100% for sure @SenCoryGardner will sell out his constituents. He won't meet with us and has us arrested if we gather @ his (i.e. our) office
Oh, his moral compass was demagnetized long ago. The siren song of a consultancy after he leaves office is his driving force.
Way to take a stand on such a controversial issue. How about your stand on Healthcare? Not controversial enough?? You are Mitch's enabler.
Is work to do at home.  Pass health&tax reform to create climate for good jobs.  Reduce nat debt so we don't dump it on future generations.
Well I continue to be discouraged by your lack of concern for your constiuents' health care needs. #2020
Hey Cory, where's your no on BCRA? Why don't you want to discuss the healthcare bill? You seem to be talking about everything but!
CO uninsured rate increases by 131.7% under BCRA, Senator!
It's time to put you and Kim Jong-un in a ring and you two "titans" can duke it out. Meanwhile ...
Do you ever and I mean ever address the people of CO we are all so looking forward to seeing you on Friday
Cool. What are you doing abt the Russian govt enablers?! Tell @realDonaldTrump to revoke Kushner's security clearance please.
And what she said.
Awfully glad to hear that  Senator. Now as for your position as head of NRSC...2018 will look dim if  ACA remains in tact. Cop Chop !!!
Thank you!

Please comment if you are going to protect CO?
We have the largest # Cystic Fibrosis patients in CO?

What will happen to US?
We have CF in our family too. I have called and emailed him about this.
Thank you! So many young CF pts fighting4their life&families losing everything.Ur tweets can make some of the most difficult days brighten!
@SenCoryGardner is the worst
Yes!He was able 2 slither by without ANY comment one way or another!No Town Hall meetings,nothing!

We know, we remember & US is the winner!
Healthcare. Russia. In person town hall. 80015
What she said!  80537
