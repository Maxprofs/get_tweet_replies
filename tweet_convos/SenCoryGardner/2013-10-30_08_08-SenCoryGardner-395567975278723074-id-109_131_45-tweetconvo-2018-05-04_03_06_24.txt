@repcorygardner You are a Congressman, if you were cancelled all members would be. I don't think you are telling the truth.
@Jpete008 @repcorygardner opted out of his federal health insurance plan when joined Congress. Buys insurance on private market.
@jasiciliano @Jpete008 @repcorygardner that's his choice.  And of course he provided no facts because he is lying.
@elevate53 @jasiciliano @Jpete008 @repcorygardner What is your evidence that he is "lying"?
@Layla1951 @jasiciliano @Jpete008 @repcorygardner - what is your evidence he is telling the truth?
You made the accusation. Must admit, I'm curious, too. Evidence? @elevate53 @Layla1951 @jasiciliano @Jpete008 @repcorygardner
@DrMakChu @Layla1951 @jasiciliano @Jpete008 @repcorygardner - Mr Gardner, can you provide proof to media of your claim?
No, no - I was asking you ~> @elevate53 to provide proof of ur accusation.  @Layla1951 @jasiciliano @Jpete008 @repcorygardner
@repcorygardner would it kill you to tell the #truth once in a while?
@GWSMayor What is he not telling the truth about?
@jasiciliano 140 characters isn't enough to cover it all | fact check him yourself to see a distinct pattern of pernicious statements
@GWSMayor @jasiciliano - it was also great to see the Sec school him. Doesn't even know the law why she can't go on exchange.  Dumb.
@elevate53 @jasiciliano well I for one am sick of the dog and pony show we had an election now it's time to govern!
@GWSMayor @jasiciliano - absolutely. this hearing is nothing more than a chance to create sound bites.  He is obviously lying.  Not one fact
@repcorygardner bullshit.  She tried to explain it to you but you are more interested in talking points than facts.  You are an embarassment
@repcorygardner Thank you for the line of questions put to Sibelius showing the true hypocrisy of Liberals!!
@repcorygardner They are getting better insurance! My family is one of these who will have better insurance!  #Obamacare #ACA
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin  not true if he had his own personal insurance.
@repcorygardner post your cancellation letter along with the details of your coverage.prove you're not lying as usual.
@repcorygardner Where's the proof that your ins was cancelled?
@repcorygardner Gardner your a loser 44 + times and still don't ge itt and how did you get elected!  Teaparty seminare on liar focus/scare
@repcorygardner What we heard you say was, you bought a piece of crap insurance policy, and wasn't smart enough to know better. #getoverit
@repcorygardner How can you help constituents when you haven't even read the law you opposed? #ACA #Obamacare @Ajblivits @missb62
@1whoknu @repcorygardner @missb62 bait and switch is when you take an oath to uphold the constitution and then close down the government.
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin DO NOT FUND ADVERTISING DOLLARS FOR OBAMACARE
@repcorygardner it's not just about the policies anymore, now it's about our PERSONAL & Private Security...you all better FIX this BS >FAST!
h/t My Congressman @repcorygardner

a #myCancellation statistic

 #makeDClisten
@repcorygardner  I am so disheartened by USA Politics but I saw you stand up for the American people at the hearing. Thank you for caring.
@repcorygardner #Lies !!!! http://instagram.com/p/gEf6sGgG0a/ 
@repcorygardner Policies canceled are sham policies that cover nothing, and those discontinued by insurance companies. Are you listening?
@repcorygardner u never let her finish answering a single question u dope
@repcorygardner well sign up for #aca you silly man.
@repcorygardner You spoke for many of US who ask why that all Govt. Officials arent subject to the ACA...the law should be equal for all!
@repcorygardner do not listen to the idots. keep going brother. signed: crying in lib hell chicago illinoise......spelt wrong on purpose
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin of course Sebelius wouldn't admit to that crooked salesman never admit to bait and switch
@repcorygardner she also refused to say she would and will sign up for Obamacare
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin OBAMA THE LIAR. DESTROYER OF AMERICA.
@repcorygardner Bait and switch is illegal in comml industry. I propose prosecute and incarcerate those responsible.
@repcorygardner you would rather your constituents kept bad "insurance" policies?
@repcorygardner @gopconference BS!  Stop the rhetoric!
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin This is what media should focus on. A poorly constructed website can be fixed. Losing ur insurance is huge!
@repcorygardner Mine insurance is dropping me Dec. 1st.
@repcorygardner Stop complaining. You still have insurance. It's not all about you and your rich compadres. Let others have access too.
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin government lies both sides #EnoughAlready let's do something
@repcorygardner you should have read the ossamacare law before you voted it.  Guaranteed we voting all you out.
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin The why didn't you vote to DEFUND this hideous assault on freedom???
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin way to stand up!  Great job. She didn't know she could sign up? Illegal? Really? Her coach behind was wrong!
.@repcorygardner Good job this morning!
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin And how many will die as a result?
@repcorygardner If they DID Cancel it WASN'T b/c of #ACA. If they cancelled you THEN YOU had an ACTIVE PART in it! NOW Tell the Whole Truth!
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin Great question Cory!!!
@repcorygardner @gopconference Tell us more about the policy you had.
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin   Most of outside DC saw this coming.  I can't understand how all you brilliant statesmen missed it.
@repcorygardner @gopconference your only being slightly true, why not be honest and admit that what they had was worth hardly anything.
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin Make her tell the truth!
Your cheap policy got cancelled! Deal with it! @repcorygardner
@repcorygardner @Chelygirl77 And nobody is even talking about the losses to the insurance companies. How are they going to react?
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin America apologizes to the world because we had no idea how ignorant, misleading & hateful the  @GOP are, sad
@repcorygardner @gopconference Millions will lose their overpriced underperforming ins. products ripping off people for better cheaper #ACA
@repcorygardner I salute your presentation to the House Committee!
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin Obama reminds me of the snake oil peddler in the old west...
@repcorygardner @gopconference I smell bullshit
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin they never asked about all the doctors dropping out?
@repcorygardner Good job today! Sebelius says new plans better, but as senior, I dont need birth control or abortion coverage, not upgrade
@repcorygardner Guess you are actually clueless about the bill and the changes for the better ...
@repcorygardner Disgustg treatment of HHS Sec @Sebelius  Shop CO xchanges: http://www.coloradohealthinsuranceexchange.us/  We pay ur 6-digit salary for wrk'g 124days
@repcorygardner Why did it get cancelled -not a good plan-not up to standards-how much is better plan on ColoradoConnect.
"@repcorygardner No. She refuses to admit to ur LIES!
#GOP is master of bait/switch
You only want smaller gov so it can fit into a vagina"
@repcorygardner HW MUCH MONEY HAVE THE KOCH BRO GAVE U TO MAKE A FOOL OUT OF URSELF
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin  I received notice my healthcare will go up 500% in the next 3 years. Just a retiree. Thanks O'Liar
@repcorygardner @RepublicanStudy Is there anyone who supports govt control of health insurance who is NOT exempt?
@repcorygardner Stop bitching! Ur on the gov payroll. And if u take healthcare frm ur constituents, I hope they vote ur selfish ass out #aca
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin that was a great challenge!
@repcorygardner U JUST MADE FOOL OUT OF URSELF
@repcorygardner @hughhewitt I'm surprised you didn't get a #whatever on your request for a district-wide waiver. It never hurts to ask ..
@repcorygardner Nice performance ..childish..petulant and obviously ill informed as well.
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin thank you Rep Gardner Hopefully we will wake up in 2014
@repcorygardner thanks for asking the hard questions. Impressed that you carry the same insurance as the people you represent. Keep pressing
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin   Refreshing voice of reason...thank you for asking the valid questions and listening to us commoners!!!
@repcorygardner Since u have private insurance & not govt insurance, u now know what millions of Americans r going thru
#ObamacareFail #tcot
@repcorygardner You are disingenuous, dishonest, & dishonorable. You should be expelled.
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin More Lies from a Republican, misleading their constituents. They should be under oath before ask questions
@repcorygardner GOP lost 2012 election, we the people voted for PBO and #ACA which is a law! Stop fighting it & help to improve it.#ASSHOLE
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin Wow. What a poster
@hughhewitt @repcorygardner @michellemalkin Take it up with the state of Colorado.
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin Saw Rep Gardner question Sebelius. Good job and right on target! We in WA were cheering!
@repcorygardner TYVM for your honesty in the #ACA hearing today. Pls keep up the good work.
@repcorygardner get Obamacare, the mental health coverage you need is included. #gopfail
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin right. Policies that do not cover pre-existing conditions are now not legal. New law.
@repcorygardner stop lying, you are a government employee, you have insurance.You knew that the ad was being posted on tv, You Knew!
@repcorygardner you need to present yourself in a professional manner, your attitude, i choose to keep my employer coverage, chew me out
.@repcorygardner I can't believe she lied to you and said it was illegal for her to go into Exchange and buy her own coverage.
@repcorygardner @michellemalkin I like the keg sign.Don't like Sibelius.
@repcorygardner LIAR!! Post a FULL pic of your letter! Tweet it! Until then, stop your lies and shut the hell up! #Obamacare #ACA #GOPFail
@Jambreman How about some of those Californian Rep's post the letter for there constituents??
@nogger_us Either way! Ive yet to meet one single person with cancelled policy! #ScareTactis
@Jambreman It's not the cost per month rise that shocks me it the deductible increase and people SHOULD not be forced to get insurance!
@repcorygardner you need to offer more fact and less rhetoric... if plan was cancelled then problem would rely on policy of company.
@repcorygardner You probably shouldn't have bought a cheap, rip-off insurance policy if you didn't want it cancelled.
@repcorygardner The insurance compainies are responsible for their decisions on plan kept & discontinued, surely you know that.
@repcorygardner Nice job in the hearing with @Sebelius Rep Gardner.  We support your efforts to expose the truth about the #ACA.
@repcorygardner  We learn to be brave and patient, knowing there are asses in the world. I don't expect you will apologize to Sec @Sebelius,
"@repcorygardner You don't even know what the law is! You're a JOKE of a Legislator & a total #ChauvinistPig #ASSHOLE! #GoodbyeGOP2014 #ACA
@Latinatude @repcorygardner His ad thats out now in #Co is paid for by the Koch Bros.=Americans for Prosperity real grassroots he is a joke
@repcorygardner Sec Sebelius cannot join exchanges, that is illegal, has employer insur. Only insurance being cancelled is junk insurance.
@repcorygardner Perhaps you lost it bc you're a babbling & incoherent lunatic? Are you on drugs or off meds?? You are embarrassing. #GetHelp
@repcorygardner Keep lying you POS. You are a joke of a politician and a bigger joke of a man. Go back 2 Colorado and stay there.
@repcorygardner NO - YOUR insurance was cancelled because you selected a policy that did not comply! YOU are the problem - not Obamacare.
@repcorygardner BTW, Sebelius busted your smarmy ass. #ShutDownTheGOP
@repcorygardner My letter from Aetna saying my plan grandfathered & I can keep but no ACA protections & no subsidy or go shop on exch
@repcorygardner another intellectual lightweight embarrassing himself on full public view at congressional hearings.
@repcorygardner YOU ARE A GRANDSTANDING CUNT! I hope your constituents are not as stupid as you say they are
@repcorygardner You've had 3 years to READ THE LAW. You proved nothing but your a loud mouth. Hope you got a good clip to play back home
@repcorygardner People who have health coverage don't enter the exchange. Try to learn about the ACA (or are you just being an asshole?)
@repcorygardner So u are upset that u are eligible for a better plan @ the same/lower premiums, just because you have to fill out paperwork?
@repcorygardner join the club
