oppose Tillerson.  I am a constituent.
go to http://moveon.org/jan24  come out on the 24th for #ResistTrumpTuesdays 
Focus this week: stopping nominations
on the MoveOn call right now.  
going to Gardner's office at 4pm tomorrow.
I don't live in the area but will be there in spirit!
He is unqualified and conflicted. Please do not allow this.
Gardner just oversaw voted for and hushed those voting against ACA repeal-Colorado deserves better
Please vote NO on Tillerson. Sincerely, one of your constituents in Lafayette CO.
Did the Koch Brothers tell you to confirm Tillerson?
WHY ARE YOU IMPRESSED THAT SOMEONE FORGOT TO BRING A NOTEBOOK TO A SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING?
Tillerson is not fit for 21st century government challenges. A Russophile and fossil fuel addict--responses were so 1980
Tillerson's ties to Putin and indifference to Putin's authoritarian actions are worrisome. Vote no.
No to Tillerson, dangerous
how dare you go against your constituents? Repealing the ACA is not in the country's best interest.
Make sure to call him and make your voice heard - I did today! @KarlyStein @SenCoryGardner @foxandfriends
I already have.
great, thanks Karly! I have too - Colorado will make @SenCoryGardner a one term senator.
look forward to Cory killing himself to better mankind
I thought Republicans were pro-life. Denying life-saving healthcare is not pro-life.
And another constituent.
He's a threat to our nat'l security. Please hold your stance to protect US from Russian influence #rejectREX
PLEASE don't vote for 
COMRADE Tillerson. He is UNFIT & 
COMPROMISED. #EXgop
you voted to repeal ACA work no replacement. What about vets? College students?
Call him and let a staffer know your concerns.  Local numbers: https://www.gardner.senate.gov/contact-cory/office-locations … @SenCoryGardner @foxandfriends
I did that too yesterday. Left messages.
Awesome! Thank you :)
what you just did today, voted down the ACA, you toe'd party lines and against the will of the people of Colorado. #shame
we must vote him out in 2020z Colorado deserves better representation.
Talk about  Jason Chaffetz more interested in protecting Trump from Ethics Committee than holding Trump accountable !!!
No on Tillerson. We will hold you accountable. And you're accountable for you ACA vote already.  #LongMemory.
Exxon swampdweller.
@BennetForCO if it comes to a senate vote, you must not confirm Tillerson! @BernieSanders @elizabethforma @alfranken
http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/exxon-needs-us-policy-change-to-cash-in-on-big-bet-on-russia-853063747565 … #notRexTillerson follow the $
Your DC inboxes are full. Your constituents are FURIOUS about your role in ACA repeal. Be ashamed; You're hurting Coloradans
Tell them only boot lickers would accept Exxon mobile Russia guy to be Secretary of State. Don't embarrass CO
Colorado allows a recall on federal congress. You really think less than 25% of your voters abhor your recent actions?!
are you actually listening to the PEOPLE of Colorado?  I don't think so.
the way you treated your fellow senators on the floor was disrespectful. I am ashamed that you represent CO.
how can you repeal ACA w/o a replacement ready to go? #SaveTheACA
Cory, Trump has time to meet w/ Kanye....but not discuss Russia with Tillerson?
Putin gave REXXON the friendship medal only 2 other Americans have received this. Follow$$$$$
CORY!!! WTH!!! REXXON is only concerned about reducing sanctions on Russia. Pro Putin
You mean REXXON Cory?? HE does not know anything outside of Russia and Oil.
Tillerson is completely inappropriate for this job--conflicts of intetest
Perhaps you could reveal further conflicts of interest? He cannot remove sanctions to benefit Exxon. I mean, my God!
Never heard a Sec of State nom require more info on all the critical items facing our country. Tillerson not qualified.
Uninformed. Doesn't understand the constitution. Coloradans expect a NO vote on this terrible candidate.
I look forward to joining a majority of Colorado in voting you out. You do not represent me or my State.
.@SenCoryGardner Shameful, voting to repeal CHIP, taking healthcare from children & parts of ACA to hurt people. CO needs to vote you out.
I am a constituent. Vote NO on Tillerson and protect our country.
ur oil/gas contributions=$1+mil. Bought & paid 4 by special interest. U drowning n the swamp? 1 term senator!
Tillerson's lying about Exxon's lobbying against Russian sanctions proves conflict of interest. Vote NO on Tillerson.
As a Coloradan, I am asking you to vote NO to Tillerson's confirmation. We need someone who puts USA over Russian interests.
like you are looking forward to pulling the safety net from under the feet of the most needy in our country?
. Wow, I thought you were going to stay tough on Russia! Colorado is a Blue State! You aren't listening to us!
must be nice to have your healthcare paid for by the American people while you dismantle theirs.
Gardner's symbiotic back scratching relationship with Tillerson.
What, no blurb about your proud moment leading the attack on health care reform?
Better stick to the safe zone of @foxandfriends
why did you vote to remove protections for pre-existing conditions and veteran's Health?
repealing healthcare = death. @foxandfriends #ACA #GoldenShowerGate
Tell one of his staffers, make sure your voice is heard. Local numbers: https://www.gardner.senate.gov/contact-cory/office-locations ….  @SenCoryGardner @foxandfriends
The special friend of Russia and Putin? Cory, you a Putin Lover, too?  Putin is a war criminal.
You got steamrolled by the Senate Dems today.
support your constituents!!!
Call @SenCoryGardner here: https://www.gardner.senate.gov/contact-cory/office-locations ….  Most effective way to make your voice heard!
I actually reached a live person last week at his Washington number!
Wow! My mother in law called the D.C. office yesterday and his VM was full.  So I gave her the FoCo # :)
Really.  Fox and Friends.  Talk about fake news.  How about someone more reliable.
Cory Gardner receives big NRA $, is instrumental in repealing ACA. You be the judge.
How can you do something that will effect millions of Americans over night. & don't lye and say its collapsing. I,m a colo
selling out our state and our country. We will make Gardner a 1term senator
we can do better than Tillerson.  He has questionable ties to a hostile nation. Will also lead us to climate chaos
As a Colorado voter who supported your candidacy,  asking you to vote NO for the confirmation Rex Tillerson.
Make your voice heard via a staffer.  Local numbers here: https://www.gardner.senate.gov/contact-cory/office-locations … @SenCoryGardner @foxandfriends
Big Oil owns Gardner
so Tex's company is where Cory is going to get his lobbying job, right?
Voting against the will of us Colorado Voters won't bode well for Cory in his next election. You're fired.
Call him up! Local office numbers: https://www.gardner.senate.gov/contact-cory/office-locations … @SenCoryGardner @foxandfriends
Forgotten something? CO is a blue state and you were elected to represent our views. #stoptillerson
Please remember CO is a blue state and you were elected to represent our views. That means #stoptillerson
Janet, call him up! Local numbers for him are here: https://www.gardner.senate.gov/contact-cory/office-locations … @SenCoryGardner @foxandfriends
because you think Putin a good leader? Keep conflicts of interest out of Gov
@ you can't fool us. You were bought by big oil. They own you.  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/11/rex-tillerson-big-oil-trump-cabinet …
this image won't be forgotten- your betrayal of Coloradans. You need to be fired
you better ask about ties to Russia, how much does this cabinet owe to them? Not just $$ wise?
I am a constituent and urge you to oppose the confirmation of Rex Tillerson.
Watched Rex on C-Span. Not easily manipulated. Sure knows a lot about Foreign Policies.
Knew nothing at all about PI problems although Duterte is a clone of Trump. @balboatennis2 @SenCoryGardner @foxandfriends
I voted for you because I believe you represent Colorado. Rex T doesn't align with our values.  Iran - Russia - say no.
Do you mind if we start referring to you as Single-Term Senator Gardner right now? @foxandfriends
Three months ago you publicly denounced Trump, now you're doing his bidding...strong principles @foxandfriends
You mean "TrumpTV"?
when are you up for reelection?  We can't wait to replace you.
I think that what you are doing with obama care is bull. And you are a hypocritical jerk.
the majority of Colorado voted against trump. U have had 6 years to come up with a new plan. U are wrong in this.
Talk to a @SenCoryGardner staffer, make your voice heard.  I always get through with Ft Collins office:
look forward to hearing your case for conf. and concerns re: conflicts
fox yea alright replace ACA don't leave millions of Americans without insurance dumb Tillerson
Please ask him why he lied about sactions
T-Rex did great!! Calm, cool & collective...just want our country needs right now!
thank you for asking about #religiousfreedom in #india. Will u ask more
You mean this guy?
No more Russian Assets in our government.
I have been watching and listening to his hearings. He is an unacceptable candidate.
