Colorado voters! Please RT and call Senator Cory Gardner 202 224-5941 and tell him to vote 'NO' on the #GrahamCassidyBill
Do not Vote yes For Trump Care, Because he doesn't care? Be Wise.
#lying
We with PRE existing conditions and special needs pray for all & we pray America survives your own devastation thx 2 #GrahamCassidy #VoteNo
I'm thinking of the day in 2020 Coloradans send you to the unemployment line
Do the right thing, NO on #GrahamCassidy senator. Do something for the people of Colorado not the insurance companies
It would be nice if you voted no on Trump care because its the right thing to do THE BILL IS TRASH !! And we vote !!
How about praying for Coloradans who will lose healthcare under Graham-Cassidy bill? You can change this - vote NO!
Are you praying for the hundreds of thousands of Coloradans will lose essential benefits under #GrahamCasiddy? Also devastating & deadly.
Preach the truth 
That's Great! NOW SAVE OUR HEALTHCARE!!!
Please, please do not vote to pass Graham-Cassidy.
As nice as that is, at the same time you are trying to kill millions by taking away their health ins. Do what's right for the country
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy. Fix & fund ACA. #loser drug costs #HealthCareReform
How about the devastation Graham-Cassidy will wreak on America? Do you care at all about how many people that will kill?
Devastating is Graham/Cassidy Devastating to Colradans is you got elected Devastating is you do nada for Colo Relief is when you are gone
And what will you do to protect healthcare for Coloradoans?  Please say and do something on this topic.  You are SILENT.  NOT OK!!
Yes, it is devastating and sad. You do realize, though, that the passage of Graham-Cassidy is likely to kill more people than the earthquake
Preach
Why don't you think about the thousands of Coloradans who will lose healthcare if Graham/Cassidy bill passes?
And this is your fault that our law enforcement spends more time pursuing parents than criminals
Please say NO to Trumpcare
Resign or vote no on #CassidyGraham. Re election not looking so good for you.
Together we’ll let @SenCoryGardner know the cost of voting for Graham-Cassidy bill. Thanks for speaking up in defense of health care!
Of course you are. You can wave when you visit the site of the wall. Remind them they aren't welcome. They really aren't white you know.
save your prayers for all those that will get screwed over by #GrahamCassidy vote no and do the right thing!!
12% of Americans supported BCRA, this one is worse. Senator, u represent us, pls vote NO & seek bipartisan solution.
Are you also praying for the people that will be devastated if yet another attempt to kill Obamacare passes? Your hypocrisy is stunning.
Do something constructive to help the Mexican people and vote NO on Graham-Cassidy 11.3.2020 https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/renewed-obamacare-repeal-effort-dealt-a-blow-as-governors-come-out-in-opposition/2017/09/19/499478fe-9d51-11e7-9083-fbfddf6804c2_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_healthcare-430pm-winner%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.e24272fbd7dc …
Will you do more than prayer? Actions speak louder than words.
Hearts out to Mexico. 
Now do your job  #NoGrahamCassidy !
Here's what #GrahamCassidyDeathBill does to women 
Please Senator! Vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Hurts pre-existing, seniors, women. Lifetime caps mean baby with heart condition out by age 1!
Have been looking high and low 4 a tweet to u supporting Graham-Cassidy. Zero found.  If u vote yes, I hope you get hit with a FOIA request
Now think of our citizens and how they will be affected by not having healthcare, please.
SHAME SHAME ON YOU passing $700 billion to fight wars when we can't even help our hungry, our homeless, our poor and our sick. SHAME ON YOU
Yes, the earthquake is devastating, and not in your control. Healthcare for all is within your control. NO on Graham-Cassidy.
Your constituents want you to answer your phone!!!!!!!!!!!
Vote no! Americans need healthcare. Do what Colorado wants you to do. Show the guts John McCain had and stand up against wrong legislation.
Vote no on deadly Graham Cassidy death sentence.
As r we all.  We would also appreciate it if you would think and pray 4 all of your constituents that will be devastated by Graham Cassidy
No #GrahamCassidy!
No on #GrahamCassidy #Healthcare
Your silence on Graham-Cassidy indicates that you KNOW it's wrong. Do what you know is right...vote NO!  From zip code 80127.
How bout you do some praying on what it means to be a decent human to others less fortunate and vote no on the atrocious HC bill?
Vote no on Cassidy Graham
Good. Now please vote against Graham-Cassidy.
Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
Vote "No" on #Trumpcare proposal - listen to your constituents!
No on ACA repeal #one term senator
I appreciate you thoughts and increased public engagement. Now how about u share your stance on Graham Cassidy & why. #GrahamCassidyBill
Stop praying and start paying attention to what scientists are saying. Climate change is real and you can't pray it away.
Very kind ... but many of us are more concerned with the devastation you and the GOP are causing with the latest #Trumpcare proposal
Please vote NO on Graham-Cassidy which is being rushed thru w/out real hearings or CBO scoring. It is irresponsible & will hurt Americans.
Grandbaby's heart surgery was delayed another yr.. pls vote NO on Graham-Cassidy as medicaid  cuts will harm my children & kill grandchild
Prayers for everyone affected by your decisions regarding healthcare.
Where are U on the important issues though? Stop dodging what your constituents care about

TRAIN WHISTLES! 

WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THEM?!?
Let's hope you are thinking about everyone who will lose their healthcare.
NO ON ACA REPEAL
Please please do not support Graham Cassidy. Please!! I can't believe I have to beg my government to not throw millions of healthcare
Shameless Pandering - how are you going to vote on the healthcare bill ?
Vote NO to Repeal or Replace. The ACA.  Fix it.
Weak try, dope.Once your vote takes healthcare from 30 million, Hispanic voters 4 U will be less visible than your conscience. #corythecreep
I am, too. Appreciate your compassion. You'll display that same compassion for your constituents when you vote No on #GrahamCassidy, right?
And healthcare?  Don't abandon us. Vote No.
While I agree with sympathy should be given to the people of Mexico City. You're going to kill more Americans with this GOP healthcare bill!
How about standing up for COs rather then   Take away healthcare for them.  Be a leader and vote no for G-C bill.
Please keep your payers out if the public square, we are not a Christian nation, and they do no good.
Yes this is a horrible tragedy. We are praying for their safety and recovery.  Please support the repeal of the atrocious ACA. No bail out!
Now if u only prayed 4 the millions of those uninsured and paid  4 ur own health insurance, shallow "Hal"
Your vote for #GrahamCassidy is WAY more devastating. #StopSellingUsOut
Good. While you are praying & feeling compassionate, how about you vote 'NO' on the revocation of the ACA? C'mon, man, look after us in CO.
If #GrahamCassidy passes - millions in this country will be impacted with  devastating results.
Thank God Mexico has universal healthcare so any injured won't have the added distress of life altering medical bills after this tragedy.
"Jaime and I are already planning how to spend our tax cut when I vote to deprive thousands of Coloradans of health insurance."  ~ C.Gardner
Graham-Cassidy is devastation.  Shut it down, my man.
Vote NO #GrahamCassidy
Thank you for what appears to be genuine concern for those affected. Please have similar concern when voting on ACA repeal.
TY for your gracious words for Mexico. Now - Please keep the lives of all Coloradans in mind and VOTE NO on ACA Repeal!
What? You and Republicans hate Mexicans
@SenCoryGardner  Apparently you have more compassion for the devastation in Mexico than you have for the citizen of CO &a their healthcare.
Are your thoughts and prayers with everyone  whose healthcare you're trying to take away?
So dude please get off my tv an stop talking crop you all behave like our country is any different with Trump at the elm
Dude bear in mind Trump is no different from Kim they both crazy people we have at the top one is a rocket man other is a groper
How about you think of all of us HERE and vote NO on the "new" wealthcare plan...the one the idiot won't even put his name on, it's that bad
yet you have no problem voting for a health care bill that will devastate millions and millions of americans...
Think about Americans that will be devastated by diseases that are not caught until too late coupled with crushing medical debt. Keep ACA
Why is it no one is urging you to vote yes on this absurd "healthcare bill"?  Take a hint from the people you represent and vote NO!
Earthquake is devastating but so is Graham-Cassidy.  We need health insurance that will cover medical issues not force us into bankruptcy.
Is that going to be your answer to millions of Americans you will sentence to death if you vote for #GrahamCassidy - pray???
Thank you. As a senator that is helpful that you show support. Please also show support for all Americans. Say NO to #GrahamCassidy #ACA
Pray for Mexico and help Americans who need more healthcare, not yet.
Are you praying for the Americans who will be wiped out by the GOP new Trumpcare bill?
Thank you. Can you also think about and pray for those who will die if #GrahamCassidy passes?
Vote NO on Graham Cassidy, Senator
Please pray for Coloradoans too. If we lose our healthcare at your hands we will need prayer.
Governor Hickenlooper has taken a stance against #GrahamCassidy bill. Will you stand up and represent Colorado?
Devasted by an earthquake: Cory cares.
Devasted by a pre-existing condition: Cory laughs and supports ACA repeal.
Are you thinking of 400,000 Coloradans who would lose Medicaid under graham Cassidy?
No. No he isn't
This tweet will save lives. Or do anything, really.
Yea think about the people you will killing if this bill passes,vote no sir do the right thing please.feel deep inside your heart and soul
Thank you!  I am your constituent.  Please vote NO on Graham/Cassidy!
Devastated- when instead oh helping you help build a useless $20 billion wall? So this 80212 voter does not believe you.
Vote no on the #GrahamCassidyBill. It's great that there are doctors that will provide quality care but if the patients can't afford it.....
Thanks!
NO ON ACA REPEAL
What about the IMPACT of you and the ORANGE BEAST on our healthcare Cory?
Are you thinking of me and my daughter dying if you cut Medicaid ???? 80751 I'll have to die 4 life insur to care for her. #NoMedicaidCuts
What about the devastation Americans face if you vote for Cassidy -Graham?
@SenCoryGardner you are a good man. The healthcare vote is to preserve a private system w choice for future generations.
Don't believe the hysterics of those claiming people would "lose" healthcare. My colleagues and I cared for the indigent at 2am pre Ocare.
And we will be there taking care of them at 2am p Ocare. No questions asked quality care.
Why do you care about the welfare of those in other countries and not the millions of Americans you are helping strip of their healthcare?
Vote NO on that tricky underhanded #CassidyGraham bill to repeal the #ACA
Thoughts and prayers are a lazy way of doing nothing. Take action if you actually care at all. You are the king of platitudes.
U hit That Nail square on the head !! The 3 most Infamous overly used words of Absolutely NO Substance!Proof of limited working brain cells!
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy! Also how about maybe sending some relief? You can take it from the enormous military budget you just approved.
I am glad you are! Think about (and act for) the Coloradans you represent and the healthcare they will lose with the #GrahamCassidyBill
He can't do that,Has 2many Problematic Issues in his DNA &A Severe lack of knowledge of the word EMPATHY! He'll have2Google the word 2C now!
How about thinking of your constituents like me and vote against the Graham-Cassidy bill?  Thank you
That's good. Now be sure to vote NO on that sneaky repeal of ACA.
Quick to chime in with "thoughts and prayers" but what have you done for the people lately? Will you oppose #GrahamCassidy for Coloradoans?
Thoughts and prayers. Nice.
Voting on a bill without a CBO score is not conservative

Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions.

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans.
