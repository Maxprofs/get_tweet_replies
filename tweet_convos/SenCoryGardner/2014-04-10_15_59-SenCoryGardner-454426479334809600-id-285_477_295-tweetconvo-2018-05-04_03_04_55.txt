Congress repeal Obamacare. "@GOPLeader: I thank Sec. Sebelius for her service. She had an impossible task: nobody can make Obamacare work."
@tatereeves so you want to repeal a law that 8,000,000 have already signed up for? You don't even have a viable option to replace it.

@GOPLeader I know, Republican ideas just never pan out.
@GOPLeader @Bodhi1 . Sure. Are you attending the Watergate Reenactment tomorrow morning in Washington? Bring tools!! See you there 3 a.m.
@GOPLeader Instead of voting to repeal the law, you should have made it stronger as Congress did previously with all new major legislation
“@GOPLeader: I thank Secretary Sebelius, She had impossible task: nobody can make Obamacare work.” Says guy leading dysfunctional congress.
@GOPLeader time for you to step up and advocate for the death panel states to expand Medicaid. Ppl are dying in our SW Virginia backyard
@GOPLeader @RepJohnDuncanJr "It's too complicated so let's give up trying." said no one worth voting for ever.
@GOPLeader Well if anyone would know about things not working, it's the Majority Leader of this do-nothing Congress #jobs
@GOPLeader re:sebelius, that was such a sweet response, however, no mention of the lies and deceit she presented.
@GOPLeader Venomous hate is all U've got. Americans know #ACA is working, like we knew Romney wouldn't B POTUS. @HouseGOP @SpeakerBoehner
@GOPLeader newsflash dude.  Obamacare is working.  #GOPFactFreeWorld
@GOPLeader Eric Cantor lies again...Mr Cantor, PPACA is working.  The HOR is not working.  Ms Sebelius had a challenge and she completed it!

@GOPLeader Eric Cantor I appreciate for your concern but you're the last person to tell the truth and Obama Care has work 7.5 million
@GOPLeader #sebelius #UnderTheBus now try & get answers! #UNelect #democrats who voted for #OBAMAcare #2014
@GOPLeader @BresPolitico You obviously do not believe in the power of marketing, dialectic and Ministry of Truth
@GOPLeader god you're gross
@GOPLeader @dollmj27 can you make Congress work?
@GOPLeader So you are saying there is NO WAY Americans could make a system to make insurance affordable for poor people work? Really?
@GOPLeader you, my friend, are a top-level douchebag.
@GOPLeader Someone form the Ofc of Management and Budget is going to run Healthcare? That's pretty weird!
@GOPLeader tell that to the cancerous cells I just had removed on ACA.  If you had your way I would be dead.
@GOPLeader what was your plan other than to criticize?  Any alternative from your party for the 7.5 million who have signed up for ACA?
@GOPLeader it is working despite all the attempts by u & republicans to undermine it @ every turn to try to keep people from getting insured
@GOPLeader @ophidianpilot - That's called polishing a turd, Eric.  You shouldn't be thanking someone for their ineptness & wasting TP money
@GOPLeader #RiseAbove

@GOPLeader @KatiePavlich That must be a hell of a blackmail file they have on you.
@GOPLeader It does work dumbass.
@GOPLeader Really? Is this how a congressman should act? A joking highschooler? Have some respect.
@GOPLeader ACA works! 7,1 million people got insurance and pre-existing conditions will not be denied for millions!  stop your lies!
@GOPLeader you are all so phony.  Too bad she, you and about 99 percent of DC don't quit/retire.
@GOPLeader Yes, but how did she help?  Incompetence at the least, cover-up and lies at the worst.
“@GOPLeader: I thank Sec. Sebelius for her service. She had an impossible task..." It's THIS kind of poor judgment that dooms Republicans.
@GOPLeader @mwickens this must be a joke....

@GOPLeader @Gormogons Thank her for the stonewalling and the lies too.
@GOPLeader @davidwebbshow Thanks?She forced nuns to buy birth control, lied and seemed fine with the displacement Obamacare caused.
@GOPLeader  I hope you were being facetious and not sincere in that remark of "thanks"!
says the ill-bred hairless chimp @GOPLeader
@GOPLeader You sir, are a fool! Sec. Sebelius is a criminal & traitor! Impossible task? It did what it was suppose to do! Single payer???

#Dem operative in hiding > @GOPLeader I would like to have Eric unemployed this time next year!

@GOPLeader That type of childish, sarcastic remark from someone who is in a Congressional leadership position is shameful
@GOPLeader YOU SUCK!! Virginia deserves better.

@GOPLeader @eclecticbrotha especially when GOP is fighting it
@GOPLeader @KatiePavlich He didn't say that ? What a complete asswipe and out of touch GOP elitist ! Please cantor retire
@GOPLeader agree she had an impossible task but pres knew chaos would ensue and will continue single payer is the goal!
.@GOPLeader @KevinWGlass Normally I wouldnt respond. But 7 million signups, jackass. Funny time to be such a smartass.
@GOPLeader sucks to lose doesn't it. You tell 7million plus people to just give back their insurance see how that works out.
@GOPLeader You are so wrong ACA will be successful ! God does wonders!
@GOPLeader 
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to lie?
@GOPLeader @Sebelius, yeah and the sad part is Congress doesn't work either you #freeloader. Sponging off the government but hate government
@GOPLeader 7.5 million is working, sir. I'm on one of the exchanges and I'm perfectly happy -- better than the employer-based plan I had.
@GOPLeader @you never fail to say stupid things!
@GOPLeader @KatiePavlich Her service? Effing RINO
.@GOPLeader What are you talking about? It's working for millions of Americans already
@GOPLeader How's that ACA replacement coming?
“@GOPLeader: I thank Secretary Sebelius for her service. She had an impossible task: nobody can make Obamacare work.”  I see you trollin
@GOPLeader 
You never offered an alternative. It's easy to just be a hater.
@GOPLeader Classy. Also, "nobody can make Obamacare work" isn't a task.
@GOPLeader @KatiePavlich @SNAFOO2012 @JessieJaneDuff @jjauthor Awesome comrade Cantor! Now stop F-ing round W/pseudo-amnesty & kill this dud
@GOPLeader @whpresscorps Advocate for child murder. Spit.
@GOPLeader She never met an abortion she didn't like.
How do these women react & interact w their children & grandkids - do they tk about killing them -  ok 4 theirs 2 live @GayDick2 @GOPLeader
@GOPLeader HAHAHA, I am not even a republican and I think this is funny.. It was impossible
“@GOPLeader: I thank Secretary Sebelius for her service. ” Typical RINO response: weak and pathetic
But you're the guys to pull off amnesty. Got it. Top Men on the Job. #Confidence RT @GOPLeader nobody can make Obamacare work. @DrewMTips
@GOPLeader @RedAlert so when exactly is it going to be working to you
“@GOPLeader: I thank Secretary Sebelius for her service. She had an impossible task: nobody can make Obamacare work.” Shut it RINO
@GOPLeader Why is it that Romneycare is good and Obamacare is bad? Tell me the difference.
@GOPLeader @RedAlert
@GOPLeader Actually, we could make Obamacare work if we could only use OPM - Other Peoples Money. Just ask Margaret Thatcher....
@GOPLeader @rorycooper hahahahahahaha! I mean, ouch
@GOPLeader @RedAlert Then start working on a REPEAL!
@WoW_Mom67 @GOPLeader @RedAlert Obamacare is here to stay. Just like medicare and social security.
@Are2row @wow_mom67 @gopleader @redalert Here to stay perhaps, but all the useful idiots/pendejo's will blame all future Presidents.
Well said!!  RT “@GOPLeader: I thank Secretary Sebelius for her service. She had an impossible task: nobody can make Obamacare work.” #tcot
There is no comity, @EricCantor. You will never be #Speaker, @GOPLeader.

This is fight to the death. You just do not get it.
@GOPLeader @RedAlert Yeap, she can now go and collect her prize: A Platinum plan on ObamaCare.
@GOPLeader i think you're mistaken, sir.
@GOPLeader You're a total moron.
@GOPLeader Thank her?  She helped put the Obamacare monstrosity in place which is strangling our economy.  GOP is doomed w leaders like you
@ReinsuranceM @GOPLeader he was being sarcastic...
@TerriSkidmore @GOPLeader  I don't think so.  Cantor has sold out. He likes DC and his job.  He's not a fighter.
@GOPLeader Not a huge fan, but you're pissing off a lot of degenerates, so I love this tweet.
@GOPLeader @whpresscorps so wrong you are.
@GOPLeader @whpresscorps Really? Wow.
@GOPLeader @margaretvmorris Especially with such half of Congress working in such an uncooperative, unpatriotic manner.
Amnesty will not work either, but you are determined to do it. @GOPLeader @CatholicismUSA
@GOPLeader Hopefully a trial and prison sentence awaits...
@GOPLeader @whpresscorps True Conservatives do NOT thank you for attending anti-Tea Party conference in FL with Soros and unions. #RINO!
@GOPLeader @DublinMimi Guess what?! Too late. It's working! Still no GOP Plan. #NothingFromRethuglians
@dbwilljr @GOPLeader   so sorry you are ignorant i
Of the facts..low information
@DublinMimi @GOPLeader Then you need to up your narrative. If you can and I am highly doubtful.
@GOPLeader seriously??? you are such a sellout!!! say bye-bye to your life as a 'rep'...you will NEVER by speaker!!! we will vote you out!!!
@GOPLeader U and Sebelius actually have a lot in common. Neither one gives a rat's ass about Americans! #noamnesty #corrupt #sorosbootlicker
@GOPLeader thank her? For helping to destroy our healthcare system? Hope this is your LAST term! #Teapartyhater #Soroslover #obamacare
“@GOPLeader: I thank Secretary Sebelius for her service. She had an impossible task: nobody can make Obamacare work.” Priceless.

@GOPLeader @KatiePavlich In all due respect, she defended, lied in support of it and failed under the heat and got no help from BHO.
@GOPLeader But now POTUS can wash his hands and point to Sebelius when REAL NUMBERS are revealed
@RightGlockMom @GOPLeader Truth. It's a chess game. Pawn sacrificed to save the king.
