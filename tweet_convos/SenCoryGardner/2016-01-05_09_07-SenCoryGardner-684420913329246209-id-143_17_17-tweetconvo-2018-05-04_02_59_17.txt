@ryanWneal @LaurieSpoon @SenCoryGardner if he has trouble reading here is a picture
@Maggyw519 @ryanWneal @SenCoryGardner thanks Maggy!
@SenCoryGardner you are an embarrassment to Colorado. Please do not run for office ever again. #NotGoodAtCivics #GOPFail
@SenCoryGardner but can legally issue Executive Orders directing his cabinet and govt. agencies to perform specific tasks E.O's are not laws
@SenCoryGardner - Not true - read the constitution you idiot
@SenCoryGardner So when is Congress going to do something, other than talk about it!!
Still WAITING!!!!
@SenCoryGardner Well, actually ... Since your Congress hasn't really written any laws ...
@SenCoryGardner problem is Congress has taken no action to reduce gun violence in the face of public outcry for action.  BHO just enforcing.
@SenCoryGardner take your fake rage and shove it pal. The American ppl are on to you, and they have PBO's  back here
@SenCoryGardner @schotts exec orders r fine. Changing law is not. If something I do today is legal, but not legal tomorrow, law has changed.
@SenCoryGardner how did you get elected?
@DC_Douglas @SenCoryGardner evangelicals and lots of lies
@SenCoryGardner is embarrassing CO. Executive orders are common and useful when you & lobbyists support gun policy that kills Americans.
@SenCoryGardner  EO by Pres>  Nixon = 62 Reagan= 47 Bush =41 Dubya=36 Obama=33 << STOP EMBARASING YOURSELF.
@SenCoryGardner  You ignore us. You disrespect us. You do not speak for US, and WE will vote you and all the others like you OUT. Expect it.
.@SenCoryGardner Your ignorance of how government works in the context of the Constitution is appalling. Please keep quiet.
@SenCoryGardner Neither are Canon City Police
@SenCoryGardner your press release does not say what laws the President has made up.  Sounds to me like he is just enforcing existing law.
@SenCoryGardner The Repig congress is sitting on it's thumbs, not writing laws. Stop the bullshit and do your job. #StupidParty #Teanderthal
@SenCoryGardner sure, apparently only Republicans get to say what laws are and how they are enforced.  What laws did the President make up?
@SenCoryGardner Read OUR American history on executive orders, dummy!
@SenCoryGardner you haven't done ANYTHING, try to tell the truth - just once
@SenCoryGardner Oh you poor dumb sap. Do you have ANY IDEA how many EOs Bush & Reagan made? You are a silly little drone.
@SenCoryGardner 
look up executive orders dummy . It's nothing more than a band-aid waiting for congress to make a bipartisan law .Clueless!
@SenCoryGardner Why don't you try to pass a few laws besides repealing the ACA.? Isn't that your job?
@SenCoryGardner So who is gonna stop him... Not you or McConnell... 
You're two of the Demobats Butt Buddies... Just ask Uncle Joe Biden.
@SenCoryGardner  Who you Represent, happy you're not New York Senator shouldn't be Senator Representing Nothing period
.@SenCoryGardner Well, you've lost my vote. You apparently have no plan to tackle gun violence. Please prove me wrong.
@Cheesemeister3k @SenCoryGardner how many executive orders did regan do again? George W?
@Muyricosuave @SenCoryGardner That would be 381 and 291, respectively.
@SenCoryGardner you're stupid.
@SenCoryGardner Have you never taken a civics class?
@SenCoryGardner ".....terrorists with guns and BRADY WILL HOLD THEM PUBLICLY ACCOUNTABLE.” Dan Gross
@SenCoryGardner "Make no mistake, any politician who opposes the President’s approach supports arming criminals, domestic abusers and even..
@SenCoryGardner POTUS is trying to save lives. I ask again what is your solution? #ENOUGH
@SenCoryGardner Maybe if you all tried 2 legislate,  do your job for once. Stop complaining and work FOR the people! Thank you Mr President!
@SenCoryGardner It scares me that someone as deeply ignorant as you actually holds high public office. Or are you just mendacious?
.@SenCoryGardner True, but he is empowered to direct exec. agencies on how to enforce those laws, which is what XOs do. #Civics101
@SenCoryGardner you dingus, the louisiana purchase was an executive order.
@SenCoryGardner 
A president can enact executive orders, but he'd need less if you cared about reasonable gun safety, not NRA propaganda/$.
@SenCoryGardner Tell that to GWB
@SenCoryGardner So you are saying that executive order's are unconstitutional?
@SenCoryGardner But yet Obama continues to usurp Constitution & congress continues to allow it. GOP big talk then capitulate. Pathetic.
@SenCoryGardner Congress doesn't make any laws on guns because they're paid by the NRA not to. Do ur jobs and POTUS won't have to do it 4 u
@SenCoryGardner I disagree.  Having all sellers of guns use same rules makes sense.  If executive order is an overreach, challenge in court.
@SenCoryGardner Then stop him senator....like you did on this latest grotesque spending bill--or not-I'm thinking not.
@SenCoryGardner might be a good idea to retake GOVT 101...
@SenCoryGardner congress has had ample time to address gun violence and has chosen inaction. Seems to me, he's doing YOUR job and his.
@SenCoryGardner  TIME FOR YOU TO RESIGN ,MR ONE TERM SEN. OR MAYBE A RECALL IS IN ORDER ??.
@SenCoryGardner How did you get elected as a Senator without a basic understanding of how our government works?
@SenCoryGardner hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
@SenCoryGardner emancipation proclamation  Louisiana purchase were pretty big executive orders
@SenCoryGardner maybe you can take some night classes in American government, and learn how things really work
@SenCoryGardner @DavidShampoo  he's a joke Hahahaha another dumb senator
@SenCoryGardner How embarrassing for a US Senator. Was this statement written in the memo line of your NRA check? Colorado must be proud
@SenCoryGardner the presidents #1 job is to protect the American people. Do ur job and he wouldn't have to!!! How much did the NRA give u?
@JohnTDouglas @SenCoryGardner got $2.1 million from the NRA for the 2014 election! Despicable!
@SenCoryGardner you have to work in order for people to work with you. People like you are why POTUS had to take action.
.@SenCoryGardner Too bad you didn't make it through high school or you'd know how the legislative, judiciary and executive branches work.
@SenCoryGardner What law? They've had 7 years to do something about gun control, which most people want, & they've done nothing.
You @SenCoryGardner should be required to understand how congress and the presidency works before ever running for office. #DumbAzz
@SenCoryGardner You ignore us. You disrespect us. You do not speak for US, and WE will vote you and all the others like you OUT. Expect it.
@SenCoryGardner If you on the Hill stop twiddling your thumbs and DO SOMETHING, maybe the USA can be even better #Obstruction
@SenCoryGardner if you represent our government I'm actually terrified
@SenCoryGardner What laws has congress written?

I'll wait.

#114thCongress #Election2016 #COPols #COPolitics
@SenCoryGardner Bruhhhhh, you really think this? LOL. How uneducated are you? And you're a senator?
@SenCoryGardner to you:  When someone says something so stupid, it makes you squint....
@SenCoryGardner The President is certainly entitled to take executive action just like every POTUS before him. You have done nothing good.
@SenCoryGardner You idiots have singlehandedly destroyed what once was a great country. WHY ARE YOU NOT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS INSANITY?
@SenCoryGardner are you that much of a clown? Good lord dude...
@SenCoryGardner Despite the fact that virtually all presidents since Washington have used executive orders?
@SenCoryGardner Did you write this tweet yourself or does the NRA do it for you?
.@SenCoryGardner Less executive actions than any president since the 19th century, but please continue.  @Mint_mulatto @DFlexmatrix
@SenCoryGardner you are actually an idiot
@SenCoryGardner Guess what?he just did it to protect innocent human lives.Where were you when Bush issued executive orders?
#doublestandards
@SenCoryGardner based on the above comments, Sen. its better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt
@SenCoryGardner Really?
@SenCoryGardner Just because you don't agree with them doesn't make it illegal.
@SenCoryGardner You do realize that EVERY president issues executive orders. EVEN your sainted Ronny.
@SenCoryGardner Um yeah that's wrong and the fact that you don't know that is mind boggling. I guess your constituents are as dumb as you.
@SenCoryGardner Aww such a well trained NRA puppet. Good job Senator!
@SenCoryGardner interesting fact base lie. You must think your supporters & the rest of us are all ignorant fools to believe that. We're not
@SenCoryGardner Yes he is. That's why it's called the EXECUTIVE branch.
@SenCoryGardner A stupid statement from a stupid man.
@SenCoryGardner 
Do we sell humans in the town square any more?
Maybe you think the Emancipation Proclamation was an act of Congress...
.@SenCoryGardner Here's a handy list of George W. Bush's executive orders--291 of 'em!. Maybe you can give W a call and he can explain it
@SenCoryGardner And this is a Senator who obviously needs to take PoliticalSci 101.
@SenCoryGardner How much is the @NRA paying you for your vote?  And to pretend you don't know what is an Executive Order?
@SenCoryGardner Is that what he is doing here, Senator? Please explain in detail. Then how about some of your own solutions as a leader?
@SenCoryGardner Your colleagues haven't worked in almost 8 years. I'm glad the President is working for the American people.
@SenCoryGardner executive orders senator, every president has made them. How you are an elected official and don't know that, blows my mind
@SenCoryGardner Learn about executive orders. They aren't 'laws' and he can issue them. Read a book.
@SenCoryGardner Derp derp derp suck that @NRA teat!
@SenCoryGardner your days as a senator should be numbered. The people need to vote for senators who will do the will of the ppl, not the NRA
@SenCoryGardner
@SenCoryGardner another RW illiterate in congress who doesn't know shit about government.
@SenCoryGardner So Senator Gardner do your job & not the NRA's kids over guns & safe places in America again not guns,guns, & more guns.
@SenCoryGardner Except, you know, every President ever except one (Washington).
O STFU @SenCoryGardner you are a disgrace to this country.
@SenCoryGardner Did you take Civics Class in school?
@SenCoryGardner I mean,  they kind of all do that..
.@SenCoryGardner Actually, that is a blatant untruth.  EVERY SINGLE PRESIDENT in the history of this nation has issued executive orders.
@SenCoryGardner What about when we don't like laws that the NRA has underwritten?
@SenCoryGardner fact is Congress is lame and does not uphold smart laws, make Colorado proud and support these gun laws!
@SenCoryGardner most people want adequate, consistent background checks on gun purchases. What about that is objectionable, exactly?
@SenCoryGardner someone should learn more about the presidency that's what executive orders are about!!
@SenCoryGardner I know your NRA rating is important to you but that was an odd statement.
.@SenCoryGardner should extract his tongue from the @NRA's bunghole for one moment & support sensible polices that 90+% of Americans support
@SenCoryGardner But he is empowered to enforce the laws, sounds like he's doing what many of you have urged, enforce the current laws.
@SenCoryGardner POTUS damn well is empowered to issue EO/s.Don't like it?Get off your ass & do your job.Otherwise,sit down & STFU.Asshole
@SenCoryGardner  Are you what the NRA money buys?  A fool tweeting nonsensical lies?
.@SenCoryGardner So you don't know how Executive Orders work? Pretty embarrassing for a Congressman.
@SenCoryGardner what laws are you proposing to keep us safe?
@SenCoryGardner Maybe your car crash of a political party could try winning a presidential election then? Oh, that's right - you can't!
@SenCoryGardner And Members of Congress aren't allowed to lie just to suit their agenda.  #shameful
@lkhtmn @SenCoryGardner They may not be allowed, but do it on a daily basis.  How do these people actually sleep at night???
@SenCoryGardner how are you in politics without basic knowledge like the fact that every POTUS since Washington has issued executive orders
@SenCoryGardner So you're admitting you flunked your high school government class.
@SenCoryGardner Reagan 381 Exec Orders!! Learn to read or have a seat
.@SenCoryGardner assuming you are not endorsing Marco Rubio, Senator? http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/marco-rubio-senators-cannot-fix-america?utm_content=buffer0ca75&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer …
@SenCoryGardner Thank ! Now maybe more will see why they need to vote; you out Senator.
@SenCoryGardner that's just it, despite the will of the people, u lazy, feckless, NRA prostitutes won't write any laws.
@SenCoryGardner > @POTUS isn't making his own laws. He's asking U bums in #Congress to fund enforcement of current laws. #StopGunViolence
@SenCoryGardner only someone who knows literally zip about American history would spout this nonsense.
@brensweets @SenCoryGardner he talking to his constituents
@SenCoryGardner wanna bet? Reagan issued over 300 orders
@SenCoryGardner Only when he's of the same political party and skin color as you right?
@SenCoryGardner Someone should tell him that! Oh right, the courts already did, several times.
@ParkerTechGuy @SenCoryGardner Go look at the history of Executive Orders. The Emancipation Proclamation was an Executive Order.
