@SenCoryGardner ENOUGH! There is no reason to block the nomination. #DoYourJob Seriously, you need to do the job you took. ENOUGH!
@BooksThings @JohnTShannon @SenCoryGardner Advice & Consent. Not sure if OB asked 4 advice, so far they don't want to give consent   #bork
@BooksThings @JohnTShannon @SenCoryGardner Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bork_Supreme_Court_nomination …
@SenCoryGardner Justify why this "point" is more pivotal than others during which Supreme Court Justices have been nominated and confirmed.
@SenCoryGardner or you could #doyourjob and consider the nominee now.
@SenCoryGardner Baloney. You are obstructing functional government and you damn well know it. This is a dangerous and irresponsible.
@SenCoryGardner That's absurd. It's @POTUS' job to fill vacancy. Americans elected him to do it, and you to #DoYourJob: Hold a vote.
@SenCoryGardner That's because Cory Gardner is told what to do by the Senate Republican leadership.
@SenCoryGardner Thanks you! And thank for doing your job. And allowing the people to have a voice!
@SenCoryGardner no. Senate should fulfill its constitutional duty and hold hearings/vote. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob U R on the wrong side of your oath (to the Constitution) & the wrong side of the People
@SenCoryGardner your duty to the Constitution and your constituents is to do your job: Vote yes or no on things and explain why. Man up!
@SenCoryGardner We will remember U at election time! #DoYourJob #obstructionist
@SenCoryGardner Have the courage to #DoYourJob and represent the will of your constituents which is not blind obstructionism.
.@SenCoryGardner your refusal to #DoYourJob will not look good when you seek to be reelected. Coloradans hate this.
@SenCoryGardner not sure why everyone is so upset. Hillary will get to pick the next justice thanks to Sen Gardner!
@SenCoryGardner You are violating your responsibilities.  #doyourjob.  Also, the email contact  on your website is broken = angry voter
@SenCoryGardner
@SenCoryGardner I like you. I voted for you. Do your job. Give him a hearing! #DoYourJob
. @SenCoryGardner if you won’t #DoYourJob you should resign. #DoYourJobMonday #recallGardner
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob  up and down vote is what you were voted in to do.
@SenCoryGardner CO voted for current @POTUS twice. If you're waiting for "the people" to speak, we have.
@SenCoryGardner So, you're saying The Constitution only applies when it suits you? You are a disgrace and should be fired. #RecallGardner.
@SenCoryGardner You swore an oath to "support and defend the Constitution." You're breaking that oath. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner in 2012 the people elected a president to serve a 4 year term, not 3.5 years. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner I would be surprised if you said you would actually do your job, but you're acting as expected. #DoYourJob #parasite
@ShellySure @SenCoryGardner OK, Will Be A Far More - Liberal - Choice...#ALLBlue2016 #TakeBackTheHill #SweepTeaRedsBackToRedneckville
@SenCoryGardner conservatism is dying, thats why y'all are fighting tooth and nail for the sc right?
You have to be kidding @SenCoryGardner! This is an absurd position for someone as bright as you to take. Remember your roots!
@SenCoryGardner What rubbish. Plenty of time & PRECEDENT for you obstructionist shitbags to #DoYourJob  (That's why we PAY YOU. Really.)
@SenCoryGardner No! There are 300+ days left in Obama's term. #DoYourJob & have a hearing - it's in the Constitution, look it up! #jerk
@SenCoryGardner Please don't use the Biden Rule when thinking about the nomination made.We don't play that crap in Colorado. Have a hearing.
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob or #LoseYourJob
@SenCoryGardner You accepted your job, with your hand on a bible, to uphold the US Constitution, please do your job.
@SenCoryGardner #doyourjob and confirm the nominee.
@SenCoryGardner you should be ashamed, that's not why we sent you to DC #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner I hope you lose the Senate and Hillary nominates a hard core liberal. #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
@SenCoryGardner Please enumerate the other Constitutionally guaranteed powers the POTUS loses in his penultimate year?
.@SenCoryGardner You are the one playing politics with our judicial system. Do the job your state elected you to do.
@SenCoryGardner Call Senator Cory Gardner 202-224-5941 and tell him to #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Do you think Obama should only get 3/5ths of his term?  Is that the message you are really trying to convey? #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner No, it doesn't work like that.  The people's choice from 2012 is still in power, let our voices be heard.  #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner The people had their say when President Obama was elected 2nd time! He nominated Merrick Garland so time to #DoYourJob
.@SenCoryGardner Colorado chose THIS President. Twice. Do your job.
@SenCoryGardner Funny that you don't want the current president to do his job. Or to do your own. Or rather not funny.
@SenCoryGardner you're playing a dangerous game of chicken at the expense of constituents who voted you in to REPRESENT THEM. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner 
Cory you are such a stooge - you and your circus friend.
@sencorygardner since when do “pivotal” times call for a dereliction of duty? People of #Colorado expect you to advise, consent & #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner  we're always at a "pivotal point", Follow the Constitution, not some ever changing arbitrary "rule". Simply just #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner WRONG!  Your statement is DERELICTION OF DUTY and OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE!  Extremist actions have doomed the GOP!  RESIGN!
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob . Enough obstruction. We voted for President and he has done his.
@SenCoryGardner I remember attending CILT w/ you. Too bad you didn't learn any true leadership skills. Please #DoYourJob or find a new one.
@SenCoryGardner you're an embarrassment to Colorado... #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner You are the one at a pivotal point. Follow the constitution and #doyourjob #COvoter
@SenCoryGardner no I think MY president should fill it! Do your f$cking job or get out!
@SenCoryGardner Partisan hack or United States Senator? Looks like you answered that question today.
@SenCoryGardner How about instead if you do your job?
@SenCoryGardner You should go back & read the entire Biden quote. The part about confirming nominees named before summer of election year.
@SenCoryGardner Don't march lockstep w/ldrship that is ignoring the CO people. Be your own man, stand up & ask 4 hearing & vote. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner You are my senator and I expect you to #DoYourJob I'm going to start calling if this isn't resolved and I'm not the only one
@SenCoryGardner Americans are sick of political maneuvering and vote for a good man.#DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Coloradans want a Senator who fulfills his role under the Constitution -- remember that document you swore to uphold? Serve!
@SenCoryGardner Don't pander, don't obfuscate. Don't be a dick #DoYourJobSenate #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner I'm a politically moderate Coloradan and stunts like this make me feel like NO ONE represents me. #DoYourJob
No, @SenCoryGardner: I am one of your constituents and you need to #DoYourJob and consider the nominee. Uphold the Constitution.
@SenCoryGardner your constituents disagree #DoYourJob and listen
@SenCoryGardner President Obama has the Constitutional duty to nominate Supreme Court justices.  You should adhere to the Constitution.
@SenCoryGardner Listen to the people... #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner are you refunding the CO taxpayers for taking rest year off? We voted 4 years for Obama not 3 #DoYourJob #respectwethepeople
@SenCoryGardner I'm more concerned about my voice not being represented by those elected to congress. #DoYourJobSenate
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob
.@SenCoryGardner Something tells me if we had a Republican president this would be a nonissue. #DoYourJob
Dear @SenCoryGardner, Alternative view: At a pivotal point in our history, it is important that you and your fellow #senators #DoYourJob.
@SenCoryGardner Except you were elected not to defer responsibility, but to #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner No precedent for refusal to consider a nominee because it's an election year. You are not representing your constituents.
@SenCoryGardner No, Gardner. You need to #DoYourJob. You can't bash @POTUS for not doing his, when you're too busy keeping congress corrupt
@SenCoryGardner You have a job to fulfil. You can either complete it or step aside for someone else to do it in the next elections
@SenCoryGardner assume you are looking forward to #HillaryClinton more liberal choice?!  Or #IvankaTrump ?!  Seriously. #DoYourJob
Hey @SenCoryGardner, your party is in shambles. Be brave and advocate for a fair process. Coloradans will appreciate it. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner I can't wait till @BernieSanders is the next president and he nominates @BarackObama for the new #SCOTUS #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner The people have spoken. We elected Obama twice. He's still the President. It's time to #DoYourJob, Senator. Now. Not later.
@SenCoryGardner We have a sitting president who has nominated a well-qualified justice. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob, sir.
@SenCoryGardner DO YOUR FUCKING JOB
@SenCoryGardner no. So your damn job. President did his now do yours. The only job where you don't have do your job. Pathetic
@SenCoryGardner no. I'm your constituent and I want you to do your constitutional Duty
You are my Senator & represent Colorado, not the GOP. #DoYourJob @SenCoryGardner
@SenCoryGardner  Stop pretending to care about anything besides politics and #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner How long is a President's term in office?  A Senator's? A Representative? At what point are they no longer to do their job?
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner That is ridiculous and transparently political.  Your precedent is? Do you job, Senator.  Do your job. I am ashamed of you.
@SenCoryGardner I'm not sure how Joe Biden being wrong in 1992 helps make Gardner's obstructionism right . #DoYourJob
.@SenCoryGardner Please #DoYourJob and your constitutional duty by voting on the president's SCOTUS choice. #RecallGardner
@SenCoryGardner #doyourjob Republicans continue to behave like petulant children
@SenCoryGardner Colorado is not paying you to not #DoYourJob . If you actually gave #POTUS a chance you might get things done!
@SenCoryGardner disappointed new constituent here. #DoYourJob and consider the #SCOTUSnominee
@SenCoryGardner 
The people elected Obama TWICE #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner Remind us Senator where the Appointments Clause says the President shall appoint "except at pivotal points?" #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Do your job Senator! Or do the Koch brothers still own you?
@SenCoryGardner Why is THIS point more pivotal now than 12 months from now? Why don't Americans deserve a full court for the next year?
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob and consider Garland. He is more than qualified
@SenCoryGardner if you're having a hard time with this basic duty, Ill be voting for some else to #DoYourJob asap
@SenCoryGardner Colorado is a purple state, but your actions (or lack thereof) will help turn it a nice, solid blue. #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner This is ridiculous. #doyourjob or lose your job.
@SenCoryGardner No excuse not to do your job. Shameful. GOP will pay in November #GOP #SCOTUSnominee
@SenCoryGardner The American people elected a president who has 307 days left in term. It's disrespectful to us not to vote. #doyourjob
@kimleonard @esd2000 @SenCoryGardner 
disrespectful is putting it mildly
@SenCoryGardner Meet with Judge Garland, vet him and confirm him. Do your job!
@SenCoryGardner @SenCoryGardner Constituent here! Do your job! Obama wasn't elected for 3 years! Confirm #SCOTUS nomination! #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner You swore to uphold the constitution which direct you to perform the confirmation process not obstruct it.
@SenCoryGardner uh, no. how about you #doyourjob now since you're being paid to do so now. stop with the childish partisan obstructionism.
@SenCoryGardner You are not representing the wishes of the people of Colorado. Stop towing the party line of BS and #DoYourJob
@Rickandgary @SenCoryGardner  ALSO A ONE TERM SEN .
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Latest poll:  63% American ppl say hold hearing and vote #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner DO.YOUR.JOB. The people spoke. They elected President Obama. Time to get on board or get the hell out.
@SenCoryGardner What % of Coloradans support denying SCOTUS hearing? Convince me you are representing us - your constituents!
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Please don't pretend like you are doing this 'for the American people' #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner @SenatorIsakson NOWHERE in the constitution does it say wait for next Prez. #DoYourJob or lose your job next voting season.
@SenCoryGardner The PEOPLE spoke in 2008 & 2012, by Electoral and Popular vote, have the #SCOTUS hearing.  #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Merrick Garland deserves a fair hearing.  He's a good, qualified nominee.  #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner Stop playing politics and just #DoYourJob please.
@SenCoryGardner Coloradans didn't vote you in to be another obstructionist. Stand by your campaign promises of bringing two sides together.
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner We have @POTUS, freely elected by the people, and he has fulfilled his responsibility. Time for Congress to do the same!
@SenCoryGardner Do your job and tell your colleagues to do theirs, too. Coloradans have a long memory.
@SenCoryGardner ha ha ha; no. Now stop posturing and do your job. Merrick Garland deserves a vote and an explanation if that vote is no.
@SenCoryGardner This nominee deserves a confirmation hearing and vote. The President did his job — it’s time for you to do yours.
@SenCoryGardner nice long-winded reason why you choose not to do your job. #fraud
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner the constitution says otherwise. We the people are being disenfranchised by the GOP. All citizens remember this in Nov
@SenCoryGardner 1/2 As your constituent, I am extremely disappointed in your highly partisan decision to deny Judge Garland a hearing.
@SenCoryGardner #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner Am a Colorado voter and strongly disagree with your stance on SCOTUS vacancy. Give the man a hearing and vote. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner What if Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is the next president?   I'd sooner let Obama pick someone.
@SenCoryGardner I'm ashamed a CO senator is behaving so immature.  I will vote for any opponent of yours in the future.  #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner Shame on you, sir!
.@SenCoryGardner This is willingly obtuse. We elected @POTUS for a 4-year term for a reason. Respect him and #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner no, actually you are wrong. It is the job of the incumbent president to appoint the SCOTUS #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner in polls the majority of Americans polled want this president to fill the vacancy
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob Even Dems would say fill the vacancy if it happened under a Repub. President #TheConstitutionMatters
@SenCoryGardner WRONG! #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner As a constituent I want you to #DoYourJob and represent Colorado by giving the nominee a fair hearing.
Orrrrr... @SenCoryGardner Here's an idea, you #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Or you could, you know, actually #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner have you considered returning your paycheck if you don't want to do your job for the last year of the current #POTUS
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob. As a CO resident and active voter, I will remember this.
@SenCoryGardner No, not the next, THE CURRENT president must fill the vacancy. Have you not read the constitution Senator(?) Gardner?
@SenCoryGardner 
No, you're hoping Ted Cruz bcomes Prez so he'll appt someone who will rollback wmns rights & rstrct nonChristian religions
@SenCoryGardner well it looks like u will b stuck w/#Trump. At least w/current Prez there's a chance at a sensible appointment. #DoYourJob!
@SenCoryGardner If this is a pivotal point in our nation's history, then we need #SCOTUS at full strength. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Bullshit. Knock it off and do your jobs for a change. This partisan stupidity is why Trump is winning.
.@SenCoryGardner So very sad about your position. You represent Colorado, which wants THIS president to fill vacancy.
@SenCoryGardner you will not have my vote if you refuse to consider Obamas nominee
@SenCoryGardner Just delay until November - if Clinton win, have hearing for nominee - she would pull further left
TY @SenCoryGardner for doing your job and standing for principle and common sense at this time in American history. #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Refusing to #Doyourjob for 309 days because you don't like the letter next to the president's name is a disgrace.
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob
#Democrat #Precedent should be followed whether they like it or not
They Set it
@SenCoryGardner
@CPBacon4CO @SenCoryGardner that's not precedent, that was a speech that had no affect on anything 
@SenCoryGardner Obama would do the same if he was senator. #nomoreliberaljustices
@SenCoryGardner This is another example of the obstructionist actions that has led to a 16% approval rating for Congress.  Please #DoYourJob
.@SenCoryGardner Actually, you need to do #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
@SenCoryGardner Thank you Cory
@SenCoryGardner do your job, you hack
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob you skeevy mess
@SenCoryGardner Republican's love to talk about the Constitution, if you really believe in it, do your job and Vote. You are a disgrace.
@SenCoryGardner . As a constituent I want you to #DoYourJob  and represent Colorado by giving the nominee a fair hearing.
@SenCoryGardner Do your job Senator, obviously no appointment to Rubio admin. in your future.  Then again, I'll take a Clinton appointment.
.@SenCoryGardner would you propose that I not do my job for 25% of the time I am at work like you are proposing the @POTUS do? #doYourJob
.@SenCoryGardner the @nytimes did not take an oath to uphold the constitution 1/3rd of your statement is irrelevant.
@SenCoryGardner do you actually think you're going to get someone more palatable from Pres. Trump or Clinton?
@SenCoryGardner #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner Couldn't disagree more. This nominee is the best choice for a moderate middle ground. Don't be on the wrong side of history.
@SenCoryGardner Since election you consistently obstruct governance. You sold us a bill of goods, bait and switch flim flam man #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner @JoeBiden said to wait for the same reason you are: to get the justice you want. Stop with the constitutional shit #Tantrum
@SenCoryGardner If @realDonaldTrump wins, he would likely nominate another clown anyway, let's put a real justice on the highest court!
@SenCoryGardner I am a constituent. elections have consequences. do you teach your kids its ok to change rules of game whenever they please?
@SenCoryGardner  my Vote for Obama 2012 was placed knowing he could fill a SCOTUS vacancy. Like every prez election! #DoYourJob
@SenCoryGardner Wrong!  #DoYourJob or step down just like my boss would say.
@SenCoryGardner : voted 4 U-pls do NOT block SCOTUS process. People need position filled- Delay makes Repub lookSTUPID-Stop petty politics!!
@Reince @SenateMajLdr : I am Repub-DoNOT blockSCOTUS process. People need position filled-Delay makes Repub lookSTUPID-Stop petty politics!!
@SenCoryGardner please #DoYourJob! I'm a constituent and I would like to see this vacancy filled.
@SenCoryGardner Doesn't actually matter. The opening is now so it gets filled now.
@imnotasnowflake @SenCoryGardner Vacancy should be filled by President who was voted into office for FOUR years, not 37 mos.! #GOPGames
@AKRNHSNC @imnotasnowflake @SenCoryGardner Obama was elected for four years twice love, what on earth is your point? #DoYourJob #SCOTUS
@mycotropic @imnotasnowflake @SenCoryGardner The GOP is essentially saying President Obama's 2nd term is over @37 mos., not 4 yrs.
@AKRNHSNC To be fair, it took me a few reads to realize that's what you were saying.
@imnotasnowflake  Sometimes have difficulty with putting thoughts accurately into 140 characters, still a work in progress at 55! :)
@SenCoryGardner Do your job. This absurd, petty politics isn't benefitting your consituency, and moreso, it's pathetic. #doyourjob
@SenCoryGardner Constituent here. #DoYourJob and give the president's nominee a fair hearing. We're not paying you to sit on your ass.
@SenCoryGardner #DoYourJob
.@SenCoryGardner If we are at such a pivotal point in nation's history, get the fuck out of the way!
@SenCoryGardner You are ignoring the Constitution. #DoYourJob
