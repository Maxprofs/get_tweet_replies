Pueblo, why not a big city like Denver where you can get more done and listen to the majority? Oh wait, you don’t give a fu*k...chicken!
You want to hear from us??... Do you want to hear about the 20, 6 year olds and the 6 adults who died trying to protect them... or should we talk about the 3.8 million ways in which you let them die in vain...?pic.twitter.com/wyxANkAA17
Gardner, who is up for reelection in 2020, received $3,879,064 from the NRA. Colorado deserves better. #TimeForAChange @MarkUdall
How about town hall's when most folks can attend without taking the day off from work? Scared much? How is that @NRA money spending today?
In addition of praying what about passing sensible gun laws or you don’t want to lose the NRA $$? #GunControlNow #ThisIsCorruption
Senator, You want to hear from me? Don't start or leave till I can get there. You might have to wait like a long time.

Get Trump out of office before he takes our country down
What are you going to do about healthcare and gun control!!!
I can answer that... In order - gut it, nothing. He has sent his thoughts and prayers, what more could you want?! (Last sentence is sarcasm)
I've never once gotten a real human to answer the phone at any of your offices. But you "want to hear from us". Lol, okay.
I've talked to humans. No more help than a shoebox and some scratch paper for comments. We pay for all the offices, and the worthless staff

He has a higher approval rating in Pueblo, that's why he's going there.
Stop taking money from the gun lobby
Can't get to Pueblo, but do something about this 'moron' Prez. Also, improve ACA with a public option.
I'd be interested in hearing how 3.8 million dollars from the NRA is not blood money.
Cuts for the rich? It's IMMORAL.
By cutting Hundreds of billions from Medicare, Trillion dollar cut in Medicaid that hurts seniors, disabled, & children. All this for tax
The tax plan hurts hard working Americans, many paying higher taxes, while the wealthiest citizens & corporations get billions in tax cuts
I listened to your lies today in the Senate Budget Committee. You are LYING if you say this budget isn't just a GOP tax cut for the top 1%.

It's also a crime that it took you this long to come to Pueblo. I hope you come with listening Ears and stop being
Your track record is not great though and I am unhappy with the way you represent me
Which includes healthcare and gun control and do not reduce our public lands
Call and leave you messages all the time so all you have to do is look at my ZIP Code 81023 and you can track what I have to say to you
I didn't know you were going to be in Pueblo and my week is already scheduled but I do have a lot to say to you and I
and I want gun control. Are you listening
No you don’t. I emailed you a month ago about a concern. Your people couldn’t even take a minute to email me back.
Can’t make it but hear this - PLEASE do something proactive about gun control. I beg you. Just try. #representme
Gee. That's a novel concept. We want you to listen and act in the interest of your constituents! Your track record isn't very good. 80026
500+ people were injured within mins from 1/3 a mile away. We need solutions that start w/ common sense laws. Where is your support?
You need a real spine to stand up to the NRA. @SenCoryGardner has shown time and time again that he was born without one
Just called you @SenCoryGardner. I understand that you've accepted more than $3M from the @NRA. All eyes on you for the vote re: silencers

Will you accept constituents' opinions over donors'?
Review the Gun laws, protect my Grandson’s healthcare, defend preexisting medical conditions, and immigration reform that works.
Why not come to Denver or a more localized area? Scared of your own constituents? Pueblo is a long haul for many to be heard.
Support & strengthen Obamacare. Gun control NOW. Yeah DACA! No stupid wall. Stop supporting Trump.
Nobody supports @SenCoryGardner. He does not represent his state at all. That's why we have to have @CardboardCoryCO instead. Sad. #sellout
Let’s open a conversation that includes us people that understand high end public policy but only may have a high school diploma. #respectus
I view Cory as a brother because like me, he understands the values & virtues we represent in the Rocky Mountain West; as Colorado natives.
Mr. Gardner is aligning himself with the far right representatives that normal hard working blue collar people are losing to....
Stop taking $$$ from the NRA.
We need better gun laws Cory. And we believe in protecting and helping the less fortunate.
Two days of notice isn't enough for working guys like me. But here's mine: stop being a shill and a party insider. You represent me, no?
If you listen to one argument about gun control today, let it be this one. #LetsTry #GunControl #GunControlNowhttps://youtu.be/73GicaeMo_E

I got a question: how many of THESE will $3.9 million from the NRA buy your silence on? Big thumbs up, Cory.pic.twitter.com/MBnLujoFXs
Why don't you host a REAL town hall in Denver's west side? Go ahead Cory, I dare you. I triple, double-dog dare you.
If I could be there, this Independent would ask you to PLEASE #rejecttheNRA
You represent ALL of us Coloradans. The MAJORITY of whom voted sensibly for @HillaryClinton or @Evan_McMullin

Trish- is that question just directed at Sen Gardner?
You are more than welcome to reply as well! Conversation is good! :)
Why you don't listen to us about our needs and wants.
Then why have you been running away until now? Why are voters having to use your cardboard cutout? Scared of the truth?
Oh, you will. Even if you're holding it on a weekday morning. We're done with you, Cory.
We want penalties for health care mandate to be ELIMINATED. So tired of the incompetence of the Senate.
I’d be able to get off work if you can come closer to Ft. Collins? Thanks for considering
I will not be able to attend, so here are my remarks: 1. DO SOMETHING to prevent the nearly ONE MASS SHOOTING PER DAY. Some suggestionspic.twitter.com/uF1Y9EkYzw

Are you seriously thinking this #BogusTaxReform is good for the nation? #ImpeachTrump #ImprisonTheRest
@KOAA So, How much money have you received from NRA? More than from DeVos? Kock Bros? Rx Co's? Fix Campaign financing now. Gun control laws. Stop Gerrymandering. Impeach Trump NOW. Stop our nat'l nightmare. Have a FAIR tax code. Univers. healthcare. Those are my thoughts. Yours?
How about doing one in a blue county as well? Might not be the love fest you get elsewhere, but we ARE your constituents.
I've tweeted & called your office & given my thoughts. Never a response. Just silence on the outrageous acts, and behavior of Trump. Stand Up. Have courage & you can see a healthy dialogue. Otherwise, you're just a chicken wimp Not worth my valuable time or vote. Integrity.@KOAA
Don't take away our healthcare and don't take campaign donations from the NRA
How about scheduling one of these at a time when all of us folks with day jobs can attend? Or giving more than 48 hours notice?
What's that? That would require you to talk to people who are less likely to resoundingly approve of your systematic robbery? Too bad.

Unfortunately, I work for a living. My $10/hr job cant't give me the time off with such short notice. Fix DACA, Pass gun control laws.

Ah, another town hall in a @GOP strongholdale.sure you talk about your pro-life contributions from the NRA.
Ridiculous. You are disenfranchising your voters by blatantly ignoring the primary places where your constituents live. So offensive.
Will you toss out paper towels like your shitbag boss?
Our voices/opinions matter less than your big donors/GOP positions. You continue to ignore constituents regardless of how much we speak out.
Nothing will change until there is campaign-finance reform.
What're you going to do to: A) Protect the middle class from tax hikes? B) Regulate firearms so people like Stephen Paddock can't get them?
Ok. Don’t deny people health care. Don’t stonewall gun control reform. Don’t give Trump a tax break. Don’t let Russians influence Govt officials. Stay out of my private life and parts. Stop sucking up to DONORS. Otherwise, great job.
Ditto that.
Double ditto.
