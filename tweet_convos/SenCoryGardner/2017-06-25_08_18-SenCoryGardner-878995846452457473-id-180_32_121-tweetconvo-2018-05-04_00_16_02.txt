Update: #CSPD motorcycle officer is in serious but stable condition. He was supporting VP Pence motorcade. Keep him in your thoughts/prayers
But I hope this Officer reminds us we must ALL help when ANY of us needs help. @SpeakerRyan, @SenateMajLdr, & I did not expect to need help.
[A]
But @SpeakerRyan, @SenateMajLdr McConnell, & I did need public help. Somehow, despite. McConnell recognizing how incredibly blessed he
[B]
was to receive that help (& lucky b/c of where he lived, as he stated in his autobiography I'll quote), Ryan - who relied on Social Sec
[C]
death bens at a time of great need & to help him gain the education to be where he is today, now that he "is there" wants to dismantle
[D]
Soc Sec & other public welfare programs (but an ardent supporter of the tax cuts for the wealthy that will now aid him again) &
[E] McConnell's views are simply incompatible with my views of Christianity, humanitarianism, helping others, ESPECIALLY for one (also Ryan)
[F]
who was, like I, struck by the proverbial bolt of health lightning. McConnell was Blessed to recover w/public help. I hope to one day.
Look what you did in YOUR office instead of meeting with the people who pay YOUR SALARY. Shame on you.
shame on you  & all who work with you putting party before your country. shameful & dispicable.

Suppose the injury is disabling? No Medicaid for you amirite?!
His next ambulance ride or ER trip won't be covered. #freedom
The hypocrisy demonstrated in this tweet is boundless.
praying is not the equivalent to providing affordable & expert medical care, including insurance, cory.
God bless the officer. God damn you for this:

Too bad your prayers are completely and utterly ineffective—"Render unto Caesar" means doing your job: protecting the public. #GunControlNow

Senator, the GOP healthcare bill is downright immoral and puts profits ahead of people. Vote No.
Fortunately he had access to a trauma center and insurance. Will he have that in the future?
Again, my family & I pray for, thoughts with, injured Officer, her or his family & friends. We'll help as we can. Thank Officer for service.
Hey, social media staff: learn grammar. People take "who." So "officer who was injured." Also: every day is two words.
Answer your phone my dude and hold town halls. Why are you hiding for a bill you helped write? BCRA and AHCA are both terrible the reason?
Are you praying for the disabled people you plan to remove from Medicaid?
I'm praying for him, too!
So when are you going to pray for the millions of Americans losing their healthcare under your healthcare bill?
Fantastic news, we all hope for a speedy recovery through great healthcare for everyone #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA
Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  
Come on the friends of Gardner need to buy more Gorsuch furs and paintings!!  Hitler emptied out the hospitals and killed weak/disabled 1st.
The Republicans are worse than Hitler!
How about praying for the wheelchair bound disabled young woman in your office you had arrested? She was trying to inform you! SHAME ON YOU!
We must pray for this Officer & his family, & we must find ways to give them any other help they may need.

Congress tearing apart ACA to force people to accept AHCA.

Protecting Pence in #COSprings for his meeting w/ Koch Bros. at the Broadmoor?
Governor Hickenlooper said today your AHCA unhealth bill will hurt hundreds of thousands of Coloradans! Amazingly mean. Why so silent Cory?
You're utterly quiet about GOP AHCA death bill. You hide from constituents, but the truth of the matter is, this isn't going away! Face us!
Active military, Vets & fams, will be hit hard by more than Medicaid. Hurts , CAUSES MANY TO CHOOSE NOT TO ENLIST.
7,000 CO Vets & 441,000 in lose Medicaid, their insurance of last resort (most on Medicaid do NOT have VA bens).
Your choice. Can't blame @GOP, other Congress Members, politics, etc.

Rural areas hit hardest if you vote "yes."

So now he will have a pre-existing condition.  How are YOU going to protect him?  #SaveTheACA

So the rich get a tax cut we 23 million people lose insurance, hospitals close jobs loss and patients die. 
#AHCAKills 

I'm not sure everyone grasps how direct a "tax cut bill for the rich" AHCA is. This isn't a small part of the bill: it's the focal point. https://twitter.com/princessbravato/status/878650602284138496 …
Pray for Officer & his fam. Pray for millions "yes" vote will harm to further enrich wealthy

I pray for the Officer, his fam., millions whose lives hang in the balance w/your vote.

CO:
24% support
53% oppose
Congress Members tearing apart ACA to force us to accept AHCA:
Vote for it, you own its unpopularity
We won't forget
…
And when my nieces no longer have health coverage will you care? They already have enough problems as it is.
What is your position on the bill?  It is cowardly to not take a public stand- people of colorado voted for you!
I pray again for & thank the Officer and his family, offer what help I can give, & pray you will vote NO to help millions who need help.
If you vote "yes," my family promises:

Every year my wife will send you a pic of my children at my grave.

No diffusion of responsibility.
@CSPDPIO Don't just pray! Do something about it! Don't take their friends/fams healthcare away! It's $4 a day!
Vote NO! We can each give up a cup of Covfefe a day to keep the weak insured. Stop killing people!
a/
Sen. Gardner, despite the humanity and compassion I see in the above tweet, the questions I raised in my long thread re: you/AHCA seem to
b/
be answered with you leaning more toward an economic analysis, or perhaps a very human (but NOT humanitarian) balancing of the votes you
c/
would lose b/c of direct AHCA harm to the public and fact AHCA IS HORRIBLY UNPOPULAR vs. $ and public promotion from which you'd benefit
d/
if AHCA passed, whether that would make up for all the votes you WILL lose from direct AHCA harm.
e/
It saddens me greatly to learn that you are making ANY sort of calculation other than the obvious ones, which, if you truly are
f/
serving the public from a humanitarian perspective AND one not based on either DIFFUSION OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, Sen. Gardner, or giving
g/
to the wealthy instead of asking all to help each other (& finding a way to do so consistent w/all the President's & @GOP's promises of
h/
true universal healthcare), would result in the conscience of any true public servant to cause her or him to vote "NO" w/o hesitation.
1/
I (& my family) continue to pray & send positive thoughts to the injured Officer, his family, his friends. We offer any help we can give,
2/
and given my family's unique and fragile health circumstances, if he or his family want someone w/whom to confidentially discuss health &
3/
related matters, I can provide my info to @SenCoryGardner. I worked for the federal government my entire working life, can outline health
4/
issues re: most major organs, including many of the types of injuries and recoveries one in a motorcycle accident might face.
1/
In this tweet, you seem to show the appropriate humanitarian response that all should exhibit: you care about the officer's health and
2/
life, & you mention nothing about cost or insurance, whether the Officer will be able to pay for health care, return to work quickly, etc
3/
As a public servant, your thinking should be the same. Every life is sacred & equal, rich no more valuable than poor.
4/
All can contribute to society if cared for, prayed for, thought of, helped as in your tweet regarding the injured Officer.
5/
You represent all those people, & if your role as a politician diverges from that humanitarian view & your role as a public servant --
6/
remember, We the People own Government, not the other way around; it's wonderful you are TEMPORARILY holding an Office the People own,
7/
but that is your Constitutional function as a public representative & servant -- so if you are not viewing each person as you view that
8/
Officer, something is amiss. If you do not vote "NO" re: the Senate AHCA bill (which will kill me within a year w/almost 100% certainty),
this officer is in stable condition because we have good hospitals. #Trumpcare would change that.  #VoteNoAHCA
When are you coming home to face your constituents Cory?!? What are you going to tell us about the CBO score?
VOTE NO! On the #TrumpCareKills bill! We will remember how youvote and ourvote will be with those whodon't want to push 22mil off healthcare
Can't pray for him and also be willing to take healthcare away from millions. CO is ready to make sure your term is short if you support it!
So encouraging to hear you care about the common man! It's difficult to glean that from your policies. Actions speak louder than words 
@CSPDPIO Senator, yes thank goodness he will be ok. But how would he be under the proposed GOP healthcare.  Vote No!!!
Gardner, do the honorable thing and resign. Too cowardly and weak to lead.
I hope his healthcare is in place!!   What about this bill you've put forward?!  We're watching YOU and vote in CO!!
When people get hurt or sick they need healthcare. Put yourself in someone else's shoes who depends on Medicaid. Empathy. Grow it. WWJD.
Cory are you going to come out and defend your health care plan? 22 million lose care. So cruel. Who hurt you? #Trumpcare
How about praying for 22 million people who will lose access to healthcare under Better Care Reconciliation Act you helped write? #BRCA
Vote NO on trumpcare!  22 million less people will be insured according to the CBO.  Colorado is a blue state which has expanded Medicaid.
Praying you don't vote for this disastrous health care bill.
When are you having a Town Hall Meeting with the people who pay your salary and great Healthcare?
Hey Cory how about that CBO score? Does it make you proud of your work!
22 million people (4 times the pop. of Colorado) stand to lose their healthcare based on your vote. Vote no, Senator. Have a heart. #NoAHCA
are you both willing to ruin your careers over trumpcare?  We will vote you out in 2020
CBO numbers out. Vote NO on this abomination, ACHA!!!!
Please vote NO on the AHCA.  Stand up for Americans and not special interests.  #NoAHCA
https://twitter.com/kennethn/status/879367091953868801 …. #HealthcareBill #HealthcareNotWealthcare Vote No #TrumpNoCare
1/ I haven’t tweeted much about healthcare because it’s a painful subject for me. But it’s important, so let me tell you my story 
Hopefully you vote down this piece of crap healthcare bill that maybe you helped craft. Medicare for all without company is the only answer.

The American Medical Association, the group representing doctors and med students, came out against the Senate bill. https://www.axios.com/largest-doctor-group-opposes-senate-health-bill-2448599849.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=textshort&utm_term=healthcare …
Praying not good enough if he needs long term care under Medicaid.
Let's hope he can get affordable healthcare since the elites want to rape the middle class into a 3rd world country and civil war.
Vote no on the healthcare bill
Speedy recovery, officer!  Please show the same concern for the rest of the country & their health! Vote NO on #TrumpCare! Thank you!
Of course the p.o. will (and should) get government, taxpayer-paid care.  You know, the thing your health plan destroys! #corythecreep
Here is a memo from your supporters get on board with the president or we will send you home !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where are you on Health Care? Party or people?
Glad he's stable, did your pimps the Koch's pay for him being there, along with paying his Med bills?
Vote NO on the horrible AHCA that you helped draft!  Don't remove healthcare from millions!
How bout doing something practical for him & MANY others who need healthcare. Vote no on the republican healthcare bill #80123constituent
You should protect us from the idiotic and dangerous #AHCA
No on ahca
Terrible. I hope he has health insurance. Please find your moral compass and vote no on this Terrible bill.
Do either of you really even try to represent people any more or is it really now just all about the donors?  #youworkforus
Does it feel weird to talk out the side of your mouth and act like you care when you go and kick millions off of health insurance?
Thank you Sen Gardner
We are praying you DO NOT VOTE for trumpcare. You will injure and hurt more than one heroic officer.
Good thing he has health insurance, unlike thousands of your constituents if you pass the Senate bill.
Prayers are great. In this case, almost as good as quality health care. Will you protect it for all Coloradans?
Where's Cory
CELEBRATE TRUMPCARE !

@GOP @SpeakerRyan @RepAdamSchiff @steveknight25 @RepTimRyan @stevescalise @RepStevePearce @stevekingIA @RepStefanik
And be dure all victims have affordable health care
Please vote no on the Senate Healthcare Bill, CO is looking for your leadership
Protect the constitution you all swore to protect! NOT ILLEGALS or CRIMINALS! #ALAC #ACTForAmerica  #AmericaFirst #VeteransBeforeRefugees
Let's pray he still has health insurance when you two are done
& pray 4 my bestie who's ovarian cancer has returned. W/ your plan, her benefits would likely run out ... after 12 months of cancer care
It's great he's getting the needed health care. Are you going to continue ignoring #Trumpcare and its effect on Colorado's public heath?
Jesus Christ, Cory. You are willing to do this just for a team win and to get more money for wealthy donors? 

https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/science/medicaid-cutbacks-elderly-nursing-homes.html …
Can't wait to send you packing in 2020 Cory then you can work for the Kochs full time.
Poor cory must be tired from working 2 jobs senator and employee of Koch industries.
$152,000 in contributions from insurance & big pharma paid to Gardner is more important than his constituents 
#TrumpCrimeFamily #wealthcare
Are you going to protect your constituents against an abhorrent health care bill? I would be much more thankful for that
Agree.  Also hopeful you protect 400,000 Coloradans on Medicaid expansion.
You should be voting against Trumpcare to show your support for the health and welfare of the people of Colorado!
Thank goodness for our brave officers!  Can you be brave too and stand up for Colorado? #justsaynotoMitchandtheboys
Yes hope if he has lasting injuries he will have access to affordable care.
Hope he has good healthcare! Under #TrumpedUpCare he might hit his max coverage!
Hope he doesn't have to depend on your lousy healthcare bill
@CSPDPIO hope you support the new health insurance in Sen. Do not bankrupt our kids by Medicaid increases for life
Read the bill & you'll find that it's a travesty that will leave millions with next to no care at a prohibitive cost. NO on Trump NoCare.
And we are praying for our health care while you cavort w/ ultra rich donors. We pray you locate a moral compass in a morass of immorality.
Senator I hope you know that if you vote for Trumpcare you will be voted out of office. It's that simple.
I'm sure your tax break/healthcare plan for wealthy is considered a sin in the eyes of Jesus! Such a little man hiding behind your tweets.
Knee jerk reaction? Ughhh no, your AHCA will hurt 271k Coloradan's! You should just resign now!
Great. How many of us in rural CO lose health insurance under your plan?
And how many of us in rural CO will lose our hospitals due to Medicaid cuts?
Cory, this is an immoral bill.  Vote no for all Colorado.
But he met with Blue Cross and *they* are really excited about all their tax cuts. Of course he hasn't met with a single poor person.
I question the voracity of this statement. His staff has blatantly lied to me. So, I think he will say whatever is politically expedient.
Good point. He's a shifty and craven. Can't wait to see him lose his job. Would *love* to see him lose all his govt healthcare benefits.
He's greedy too. He won't give a damn unless people pay him off.
Vote NO on trumpcare
Prayers
So how did that meeting with the Koch brothers go? They bribe you to vote yes on the #healthcare bill? Will that be worth it to the officer?
Sen Gardner, please vote note and protect all of Colorado
Vote NO
Stop praying for them and make sure that they have health care!
Jesus must be really confused to hear from you when cops get hurt but then to watch you screw the poor to help the rich. That's called 'sin'
How did the Koch meeting go? Plenty of reelection $ headed your way? Maybe a nice "consulting" fee coming your way after office?
Don't worry Cory, you won't lose your insurance until 2020. Just everyone else. Stop hiding behind cop stories & unanswered phones. man up
I hope he isn't near his health care benefit cap, Cory
Hopefully he gets treated and out of the hospital before #TrumpCare starts.
"I thank this brave officer for giving me something to talk about other than my plans to take away healthcare from millions" ~ C.Gardner
If you had that kind of caring for your constituents your re-election would go more easily. But you don't -Just the very wealthy ins cos
How was your meeting with the Koch brothers did you get big donations?
Prob covered by workmans comp but if it was a random accident for anyone & GOP repeals ACA, ppl would die/be in debt bc of no/lack insurance
I think the injured police officer needs health insurance more than he needs prayer.  If GOP bill passes, he may end up with only prayer. 
Amazing that @SenCoryGardner cares about a resident of Colorado...did the officer offer him money for his reelection?
@CSPDPIO @VP bet he has insurance.
Prayers for speedy recovery. Glad he's got good insurance; sadly many of us may lose ours if your bill passes. 
PS-how are the Kochs? $$$$ ?
how about we make sure they all have good healthcare?
Good to hear. If he's covered by your GOP healthcare plan, will he have to declare bankruptcy b4 leaving the hospital?
And in the meantime, the GOP is trying to make sure when this happens to the next officer he will die from his injuries without insurance.
Your constituency's urgent concern is your vote on the senate healthcare bill. Stop avoiding it and start talking with constituents!
What happened?
He fell off his bike...
He was trying to dodge some bundles of Koch money that fell out of Pence's pockets.
LOLOLOLOL
Use twitter to talk about policy. Not this feel good bullshit all the time
