@cachick1111 @CommerceGOP @HouseGOP @Senate_GOPs http://www.savetheinternet.com/sti-home  #NetNeutrality has been advocated for by the public since 2006.
@CommerceGOP @SenRonJohnson @FCC

@CommerceGOP @NetAdvisor @FCC Always secret - that should tell you something right there !
@CommerceGOP @Senate_GOPs @FCC You have to stop this.  If not, Obama will control social media and our freedom to communicate safely/freely.
I can't believe we are even debating this: all #NetNeutrality will do is provide an @FCC driven tax base @CommerceGOP @mmmonk53
@CommerceGOP @FCC the most transparent administration ever!  HA! We are looking at the New Fascism!

@CommerceGOP @SenTedCruz @FCC @ChrisSalcedoTX. This summarizes the Obama FCC and the Internet
@CommerceGOP @SenTedCruz @FCC Why does the Federal Gov't feel they need to "regulate" every freaking thing? Feel free to defund the @FCC
@CommerceGOP @DarrellIssa @FCC That they should release it but the alternative is to sell us to the highest bidder and crush the internet.
@CommerceGOP @SenDeanHeller @FCC I hope it includes provisions to mandate broadband deployment in rural areas.
@CommerceGOP @DarrellIssa @FCC Whose 'fault' is this? #DemLibCommunists ! Say it, again! #DemLibCommunists ! Say it,again! #DemLibCommunists
@CommerceGOP @FCC @SenTedCruz

@CommerceGOP @Senate_GOPs @FCC tie fcc funding to the repeal of obama executive actions actions instead homeland security. let fcc shut down
@CommerceGOP @SenTedCruz @FCC And what can we ordinary people do about it? If U GOP congress don't take any action to stop it we are scre**d

@CommerceGOP @FCC the GOP is an old dog with no bite.  The only thing they can pass is gas.
@CommerceGOP @SenTedCruz @FCC After the IRS took over Joe Conforte's whore house," Mustang Ranch", It went bankrupt?? Now the internet?
@CommerceGOP @SenTedCruz @FCC someday people will complain about how bad it is.  Like Obamacare ,,but we still have it.  same here.

@CommerceGOP @Senate_GOPs @FCC NO to Title X/Thune-Upton bill
@CommerceGOP @Senate_GOPs @FCC Stop this madness now. NO Net Neutrality. I do not want my access to independent thought censored by the govt
@CommerceGOP @Senate_GOPs @FCC tweet all you want. You are doing nothing anywhere to stop anything. You have or are caving. You won
@Blob_Fish @CommerceGOP @SenRonJohnson @FCC The Government are the ones who will censor the internet not business.
@Blob_Fish I see almost 400 pages of secret regulations. If they don't want it changed then why 400 "secret" rules?
@Blob_Fish @Hydraman40Black after they vote on them? What's the point?
@Blob_Fish @SenRonJohnson t-mobile does not count Pandora or Spotify against your bill.  And that is a blatant disregard for net nuetrality.
