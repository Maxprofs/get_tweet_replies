You are looking foolish endorsing Trump and his political ignorance. DeVos is wrong for children.
Not a paid protester, homeowner and voter  @JoeHockey
@POTUS treated our ally @TurnbullMalcolm like crap. How much incompetence & instability will you need to see to impeach him?
Your Cheeto Jesus doesn't. Quit bowing to Washington and start taking care of your constituents, you liar.
I see you're willing to clean up @realDonaldTrump's mess. It sure'd be nice if the legislative branch actually legislated.
Tried calling, emailed, now tweeting, #DumpDeVos #ScotusStolenSeat We want Merrick Garland for women's rights!
We're sorry Joe. We're trying to fix it. Cory doesn't listen to his people either, thinks we're paid protesters.
but the President you are supporting does not listen to your CO voters!!
Tell that to Trump
So phones work calling out, but not in? Because yet again there was no answer in Denver, DC or now GJ. Why no love for CO?
And by the way - I'm a constituent (80223). And not a paid protester. Just sad that you won't represent our state.
I'm not paid either! 80127.
You're trying to clean up a mentally ill president's mess. Focus on CO or pay the price in 2020. #resist 80403 Gilpin CO
Vote NO on #DeVosHearing. Colorado did not vote for Trump's bucket of hate, and our kids shouldn't have to pay the price.
if so, then denounce Comrade T....
I'm #notpaid from CO. You claim protesters aren't real but won't take calls &  don't know how many in CO oppose you (a lot)
Then impeach @POTUS He is destroying US with his fake news, lack of knowledge, rascism. Loves Russia more than US
Trump is a mess.
Hello there! CO resident here(80219) - hopeful that Mr. Gardner will rep USA better than our prez. #trumpfail
Only money doled out is for Senior Cowardly Garbage special interest AstroTurf arguing mouthpiece. #draintheswamp
Where are the "checks & balances"? Do your job and represent All Americans! DeVos is unfit & Unqualified! Don't be a hack!

Good work mates
then silence the idiot in charge
good call, now block DeVos!
glad you had time for a foreign call, unfortunately you ignored all the calls to your office on DeVos.
you should remind prez of the crucial friend
It is absurd that you have to state we stand w Australia. Trump can't be trusted to deal with allies or enemies.
Playing cleanup, eh?
You wouldn't have to patch up our relationship with a natural ally if you didn't support a loose cannon in the White House.
liar
Please vote NO against DeVos.
Thanks for taking steps to try and repair the damage done by our president.  Keep up the good work!
Trump is insane! Invoke 25th now. Save us all.
could you have someone answer the phone when your constituents call? @SenBennetCO office figured out out!
when will you stop the #alternativefact that the high volume of calls to your office are "Paid protesters?" Oppose DeVos!
DeVos campaign $$$ 

http://endcitizensunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Web-DeVos.pdf â€¦
Oh, I see.  $46,800 + $5,200 + PAC $ in donations from #BetsyDeVos to Gardner.  No wonder he does not answer CO.
climbed through a Pueblo phone tree to leave a message.  STILL NO on #BetsyDeVos.
Then do your part to dump Trump. The whole world shouldn't have to suffer because of his mental health problems.
thank you Senator for reaching out to our friends. I also hope that you will vote against DeVos, Pruitt, Sessions
Yet you can't answer the phone for constituents? I'm sure the Aussie Gov't can answer a phone should I call them?
constituent here (81054). Vote NO on DeVos who demonstrated her ignorance(sad!) on fundamental education policy.
Thank you, Senator Gardner, for trying to right the massive wrong of @realDonaldTrump .
Corey, please don't spend weekend in FL trolling for fat cat $$. Come back to CO & speak to folks. 80205 #imnotpaid
You are a liar.
Really? Just a day before the president insulted their Prime Minister? Hope you're embarrassed now.
, I hope you fixed the mess #Trump made. @JoeHockey, I am sorry for our President. The majority of us did NOT vote for him.
@hlnkim this is so weird/ such a small world...Joe is my uncle by marriage (ha!) - His brother Colin is my uncle!
ok well it sounds like you are well positioned to put in a good word after all 
Gotta clean up that crapstorm that your Republican created, huh? Welcome to your new job.
Tell the President to shut up then
https://youtu.be/cml78dSpVGo 
Tell Donnie T.  He seems to have forgotten the many Aussies who fought & died as our ally, especially in Viet Nam
I appprecjate your statement, I hope you stand up to tRump and let him know his behavior toward PM Turnbull is unacceptable
but your President is to tired to care!!!
You mean he answered his phone?
Then stop voting 100% with Trump!!  NO to DEVOS!  NO to SESSIONS!
yeah you have to call your Aussie friends to make peace because Trump is an asshat
BTW my best friend @AwkwardAya is Australian. Should I ask her to put in a good word for the USA?
Alarming that you to do this at all. Cleaning up after @POTUS? Sad!
Sorry we have to apologize for our President's behavior. Thanks for reaching out.
How about u tell Comrade tRump then to NOT piss off allies!?
#nobetsydevos
too bad POTUS does not. Stand up to him Cory!
your president doesn't seem to think Australia is such a useful ally based on his treatment of their PM
[Robot Voice] ?   ;)
vote NO to DeVos, NO on Sessions, get Bannon out! Or you will be enjoying your last term! CO is fed up! 80206 Voter Not paid
.@SenCoryGardner @JoeHockey You might want to tell this to your boss.
maybe we need to march on your office to get you to hear us?!?!80027
me and my children (11 and 17) hv made effort to call u multiple times. No answer to our messages. Pls represent
isn't it fun having to clean up baby Trump's messes?!  Maybe you should try standing up to him.  No integrity.
pls review devos success in school performance. Below average.  Awful! Protect us here in Colorado!take a stand!
senator please vote no on devos. Colorado schools are excellent.  We do not want her approach! Pls represent us!
Oh, and I've sent you emails but I live in Highlands Ranch and am not a paid protester. That's your excuse to ignore us.
I'm glad you value our allies. What are you & other Reps going to do about the mad man in the Oval Office? Stand up 4 us!!
cleaning up Trump's mess. Thank you.
Senators have to do DOTUS job because he's INEPT & politically incorrect?? Enough is enough. Repubs 2018 RIP.
that's awesome, Cory. Please vote no on DeVos. I'll be calling your office later today :)
Blaming "paid protesters" for the backlash against the Muslim ban is a copout. Let's primary this idiot.
are you tired of mopping up Mango Mussolini's messes yet?
you can take his call but not calls from Colorado??  What about a relationship with the people who can vote for you - or not
Thank you !!! Now PLEASE VOTE NO ON DEVOSS!!!
I am a real Colorado voter. 81635.
Why are Senators cleaning up Trump's messes? Not your job. We deserve a POTUS that can serve the people without babysitters.
Thank you. Our sincere apologies to Australia for the juvenile behavior of @POTUS. So embarrassing for al of us.
strong work. Now vote no on Betsy DeVoss!
Thank you for cleaning up yet ANOTHER #trupastrophe. But, when was the last time you called your #constituents? #represent
Well obviously your leader doesn't value that relationship and likes to bully our allies! Get smart and get rid of him!
Count this. No to immigration executive order. Evergreen Co. Let me know when you are coming to town! #representcolorado
Important
How popular is war w/ China in Colorado?
War w/ Iran?
Trump is INSANE and must be impeached immediately
Cory - forget party, remember the people of this nation.  Check Trump before he wrecks everything.
Do your job senator!!! You work for us not your party or trump. Please do not stand for legalized corruption.
Australia has great schools! America will only have great schools if you vote NO on DEVOS!
He's picking fights wherever he goes.  He's going to end your career because us sane Repubs dont agree with him and u do
Senator, we need American apologists thanks to Trump! Good work.  Now please, for your country,vote NO on DeVos!
great! Now could you please vote no for Betsy DeVos like any sane human would? For some reason today you voted to proceed.
Great- maybe you can convince your boss as well.
Please vote NO on DeVos!!
thank you!
Really
Constituent from Loveland. No on DeVos
a more important phone call would be that of your constituents.
good to know you stand w/ Australia now will you stand with CO? #noDeVos #noSessions #NoBanNoWall  #notpaid 80501
I am a Colorado voter, hear our voices, vote no on DeVos she is unqualified and unprepared to be Sec of Education
Please vote no on DeVos.  I am a registered Colorado voter 80209.  Not a paid protester.
we pay your salary. You work for us! #SwampCabinet #YoureFired!
.@SenCoryGardner @JoeHockey Strong relationship w/ Australia = good. #DeVos = bad. #NoDeVos
you need to answer calls a little closer to home. Build relationships with the people of Colorado. We will be heard.#Resist
Glad to see you representing us well with Oz... now keep it up by voting NO on DeVos! #80111
from Fort Collins - vote no on Devos
try to be a better Senator. I'm not a paid protestor. I'm your constituent. #nobannowall DeVos is unqualified. U know it.
Oppose Devos & Sessions. Colorado did not vote for this regime. Stop lying and listen to us.  #notapaidprotestor
I'm a constituent... 80128...And a public school teacher...Vote no on DeVos!
I hate when I have to clean up after unwanted and uninvited house guests. #doyourjob
THIS is the point where @POTUS crossed the line for you? Really?!?!? #haveyoubeensleeping
Great, now vote NO ON DEVOS!

I am not soros paid, I am a Denver native.
well Thank God, because after Trump hung up on the PM somebody needed to do damage control
Vote NO on Devos. CO kids deserve better.
too bad your boss doesn't.
after all the bullshit trump says and does and you PHONE him not in person?
- smart to smooth things over with Aussie land - also vote NO on Devos. Our children deserve better
Did you tell the administration (little a) to do the same? Likely not.
Oh, and I'm real. 80011
please value our public education too by voting "no" on Betsy DeVos! #NoDeVos #RuralED #ColoradoProud
Are you planning to clean up every phone call Trump makes? Is there enough time in the day?Now you know my pain?
then why are you supporting a president who insults them?
Try convincing your Cheeto President of that fact!
The American people value and respect our Australian allies. I would have hoped POTUS treated them the same.
did you apologize for @POTUS shameful behavior?
goodluck w/ that since you've allowed an illegitimatementally unstablelunatic to run r country/people in the dirt
Deeply troubling and truly pathetic that @POTUS needs his international messes cleaned up.
Cleaning up Trump's MESS? What is the GOP going to do to keep America safe from war. Trump offends every country he talks to
<<<<< Former US Senator
Interesting....how many times did you call him during the Obama administration? Counting your seat under Dems next term.
VOTE NO ON DeVos!
Then do something.
I'm a Coloradan, not a paid shill like you claim. When will you disavow our reckless president. Country first, not party.
People of your state deserve respect- not accusations that they're being paid. When are you up for reelection?
you'll find out that people contacting ur office are not paid when ur up for reelection. U don't get it u work for us
sorry you don't deserve to clean up these messes
then talk to YOUR president. The calls etc that you are receiving are from real constituents. Stand up for us,
not the party. You guys need to come up for air. There is a real world and it's not in DC. Get out more!!!
I'm glad you're running cleanup on this mess!  We want to support you as you represent us.  Colorado voter, not paid.
And they drive a significant amount of tourism (export) dollars into the state of CO in the month of Jan.
how about valuing our democracy and constitution by impeaching The Fascist @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
#copolitic @mtnresistance Now we know how much you care about the Great State of Colorado. Way to show your respect for us
So @SenCoryGardner @JoeHockey How many times are you going to clean-up after Trump before you admit he is not doing a good job?
thank you for working to investigate Russian influence in our election. CO resident 80224
Australia is a crucial friend but concerned constituents are paid? You have lost you flipping mind.
might want to talk to your buddy @POTUS before he starts WWIII.
so you shoveling after the trump now. Beware the rump of the trump.
Hello Cory - Australia is NOT a county in Colorado. Represent Colorado kids: vote NO! on Betsy DeVos.
NO ON DEVOS NO ON DEVOS NO ON DEVOS
Did you undo any of the damage that @POTUS did earlier? #LooseCannon #PetulantTween
Thank you. We need people to hold for governing and positive global relationships.
Most of these comments do NOT represent how all of us feel...but do wonder if you wanted to refugees from Australia
frustrated constituent here, unpaid. NO TO DEVOS!  And no repeal of ACA until there is a reasonable replacement.
the Nation needs a DOJ now. Berkley was about telling consertatives are open game/ go will not defend. Same in Denver
VOTE NO for DeVos
unfortunate you have to do damage control for the President  #notpaidprotester #taxpayer #80113 #teamsanity
I'm not paid. Do your voters know you voted today to allow dumping of mine waste into streams? Zip 80603
just want to assure that I am 77 years old and no one has to pay me. Vote no on deVos. Respond
Thank you for calling. Should've thought of craziness when you voted. I will fight for your opponent. 80247
Crucial to what? Its kinda fun playing trump and asking,  "What do they bring to the relationship?"
time for Australia to grow some balls
gotta fix the mess
you might want to remind our President of that allegiance!
Thank you for your courage to stand strong for the principles and values of USA.Please vote no on DeVos and Sessions
I had an uncle with a drinking problem we always had to clean up after. Finally gave up on him.  Don't enable DJT

U should NOT have to mop up after Trump! Thanks! It's time you all grew Balls and stand up to Trump, NOW!
How about all Republicans standing up to Trump before he kills our Democracy! He is a phony and a charleton!
Please listen to your constituents and vote no on @BetsyDeVos.
they don't like you http://www.kotcb.com/2016/12/an-idea-called-america.html â€¦
Talking of dumb deals, OZ should follow Canada's lead & cancel #verybad F35 strike fighter order. Worst deal Eva!
Thank you Senator Gardner. We hope there are more like you. Did you mention the spiritual "Prayer Breakfast".?
Of course they are! Is Trump trying to destabilize the world on purpose? This is not normal!
before or after the house got rid of gun limits for mentally ill? You are from Co! How many mass shootings will it take?
then stand up to Trump
.@SenCoryGardner @JoeHockey You value strong relation/p with Aussies, but will you bow to Trump's idiocy? Need tougher language.
Tell our President to quit embarrassing us! 80227 voter and respectfully, vote no for Bannon on NSC.
Glad you did this. Now, please listen to the majority of Colorado and hear their disdain for DeVos. #opposeDeVos
Now punish the Trump admin for making you clean up their mess by voting no on DeVos and Sessions
thank you for showing some common sense. Australia is your biggest ally in Pacific Rim
What possible sane motive would a President have for saying what he did...shame. #imnotpaid
Thank you, @SenCoryGardner! @JoeHockey, please know that #Trump does not define #America! #TheResistance is working hard to fix!
Thank you for this. Australia is an important ally.
unfortunately our President doesn't agree
Good to hear. I'm profoundly embarrassed by the actions of POTUS. Thx
constituent here (80020) #noDevos - where are congressional checks/balances for mess Trump is causing? #disgusted
if you vote yes on DeVos it'll look like u were bought for the 30K she donated to your campaign. Cheap date
So are u going to spend the next 4 years fixing tRump's mistakes? This is not normal. This is not normal. Fix it please!
Thank you for doing your part to maintain a positive relationship with a long-standing & faithful ally.
You are standing up finally! Keep going!
#imnotpaid 80134
Thank you Senator for representing our Country well.
Vote no to DeVos!!!
