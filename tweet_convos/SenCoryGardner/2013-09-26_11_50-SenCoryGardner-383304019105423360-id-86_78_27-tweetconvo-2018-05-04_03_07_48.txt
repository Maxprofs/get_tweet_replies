@newtgingrich @Bill_Orielly How do Dem leaders get away with blaming shut down when their stated position is "we will not negotiate..."

@newtgingrich @CrossfireCNN @stefcutter @repcorygardner @keithellison CNN make Stephani and S.E. wear push ups for the home page photos?
@newtgingrich I would've watched but can't figure out why you gave your time to someone who swore to defend the Constitution on a Quran.
@newtgingrich @CrossfireCNN @stefcutter @repcorygardner @keithellison When you move to FOX I will watch :)
@newtgingrich PLEASE DO US A FAVOR, GO COLONIZE THE MOON!!
@newtgingrich @CrossfireCNN I'm only 28 but remember a man that knew how to make DC compromise. You need to get back in the ring.  #newt
@newtgingrich @CrossfireCNN @stefcutter @repcorygardner @keithellison Why? You lost, Newt. Get over it.
@newtgingrich Defeating ObamaCare is easy!   The ultimate power to stop ObamaCare is with the people.  Don’t participate.
@newtgingrich @CrossfireCNN @stefcutter @repcorygardner @keithellison   Obama care aside would like to see all you lose your fee ride & pay
