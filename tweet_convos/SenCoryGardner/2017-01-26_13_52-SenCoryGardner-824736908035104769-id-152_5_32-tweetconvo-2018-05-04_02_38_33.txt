can you please listen to your constituents?  Don't lie to the news and say that we have been paid!  You should be ashamed!
he's a disgrace to Colorado!  #resist
yes he is!  He needs to listen to his constituents and not make up lies for his own agenda.  Shameful!
- look me up if you think I'm not a constituent. And I'm going to do everything to get you out.  You're not an American
I'm with you.  Gardner is going DOWN in 2020!
“Either you’re going down with a disgraced president,or you’re going to be complicit in the death of democracy"
Where the protestors made a great country. The #GOPSenate is trying to move us toward totalitarianism.
Friendship with Trump is a pariah. Will be her and anyone's downfall.
Not so fast @SenCoryGardner
Senator, if you support DeVos and Pruitt it is a clear sign you are just a political hack.  Show leadership!
.@SenCoryGardner NO #Pruitt! OKU H2O had>80xsafeconc carcinogen ChrVI #PruittcleanH2O=COdirtyH2O Pls RT @j_r_mitch
Does it scare you the Theresa had to explain the Geneva Convention to @realDonaldTrump?
#ImpeachTrump
I've been calling your office. I am NOT paid, and find your comment offensive. You SHOULD be listening to your constituents.
as a Coloradan in UK am pleased our countries remain close. Close enough to condemn prejudiced #MuslimBan
after all, many of our ancestors were religious refugees from Britain & Europe. We weren't turned away
Special relationship will only last until she doesn't follow O's orders and he hangs up on her.  Listen to us!
and now over 1,000,000 of her citizens don't want @realDonaldTrump  in their country.
did it inspire you to reinstate your relationship with the people of Colorado and actually represent our interest?
of course not. Gardner is a teabagger who pretends to be moderate in order to get elected. We need to kick him out in 2020
I'm with you!  I will be a part of giving @CoryGardner the boot in 2020!  #resist #futureisfemale

thank goodness.  We're going to need all the help we can get when @realDonaldTrump gets us in a war with China!
I live in Lakewood CO. You MUST oppose this immoral ban. Or you become immoral. We are watching.
Thank you for being one of the few Republican lawmakers to call for a more sensible and humane immigration policy.
CO will never forget that you didn't speak up against the #MuslimBan. You are a servant of the people!
he's a servant of himself, the Tea Party, and the #illegitimatePresident #resist
did you actually hear what she said? Have you gone full Trump crazy on us Gardner!?
yes, yes he has.
That's nice. Want to maybe listen to your constituents now?

your constituents should be concerned with the fact you're as delusional as trump is.  https://www.google.com/amp/denver.cbslocal.com/2017/01/27/people-shouldnt-be-afraid-gardner-on-trump-policy/amp/?client=ms-android-americamovil-us …
you're in a blue state Gardner. We expect you to act like it. #answeryourdamnphone
you need to urge @POTUS to not go and fuck it up! He is walking a very fine line on starting WWIII. #youworkforAmericans
Did you apologize for POTUS spellling error? SAD
May knows he's a liar. "100% behind NATO" Muslim ban is disgrace His cabinet will destroy country. #ImpeachPresidentBannon
Thank you for upholding American values & freedoms & speaking up for legal residents denied re-entry under Tr0mp's EO.
Another resident of Co. asking you to oppose Sessions, DeVos and Pruitt. Stand up to Trump and listen to the people of Co.!
Cory Gardner mimics trump as he said to CBS: people calling his office are "paid protestors." Poor excuse 4 rep
you've been silent on Trump's exec order re: #muslimban. Please make a statement to your constituents on your (OUR) position
you might want to get a plan on how to reign in Trump...he is really messing with your future.
Still NOTHING from you? Great job putting party over country. 
Why are you dodging your constituents?
liars!
listen to your constituents
so there are some women you will listen to - just not ones in Colorado? And staying silent IS condoning racism.
you are a coward and you will go dow on the wrong side of history. Stand up for your country
And now she's regretting it, as she DOES NOT agree with the Muslim Ban/EO.
You seriously have nothing to say about the POTUS violating civil liberties? Hello? Where are you??? Cricket cricket??? @SenCoryGardner
We will be heard you work for us. STOP lying about the protesters. #Youaretheproblem
she does not speak for ANY majority in U.K. Look at the petition and look at yourself history will judge
when will you do the RIGHT thing and speak out against @realDonaldTrump ..travesty to this country
I'm a constituent. I am not being paid to contact you, but you are paid to represent me. Do the human thing and #DumpTrump
that's why #TheresaTheAppeaser has been trending all day with a 600,000 petition to bar trump from uk
Was your flight home free of unexpected detainment?  Anything to say about the Refugee EO? Do you support or condemn it?
so you put out a tweet but you don't respond to ANY of your constituents who comment ha into you on twitter?!?
You have all the correct positions - - to get un-elected
Let's make a major effort to #RecallCoryGardner Take back the Senate! Petition needs to blow up!

I live in Colorado. You must take a stand against Trump's unconstitutional order against immigrants and refugees.  Do good.
STAND UP AGAINST TRUMP's EO Muslim ban. Don't be such coward- the GOP=Vichy Government!!!!
your silence on the immigration ban is deafening. Coloradans are watching and we will remember.
http://ln.is/www.coloradopols.com/A50o6 …
How about your constituents? You plan to renew your relationship with them by denouncing the ban?
You should be standing up and saying something. Being quiet is giving approval. The next act of terror is your fault.
#NoBanNoWall #RefugeesWelcome
apparently the senator would prefer to be in the private sector. Can't serve his state. See ya cory.
your career is done.  Maybe you won't be arrested for treason
do something about the madmen in the White House. Trump/Bannon. Sen Gardner, you took an oath & not to Trump!
arrest any disabled protesters today? Eyes of history are on you #RESISTANCE
What SPECIFIC actions are you taking to stop #trump and his illegal, illegitimate orders? Not a damn thing.
Gardner, have you bothered to object to the thrashing of our US constitution? We are watching you.
The people of Colorado are watching you and we will send you packing in 2020 if you don't represent our wishes. #resist
Stand up to TRUMP!  This man is already out of control!
Does your social media intern even bother reporting to you how many demands to talk to constituents you get?
the birthplace of our nation founded on religious freedom by boatloads of immigrants? Speak out against Trump. #copolitics
Here are some actual facts for you
no word from you condemning the ban today. Shameful.
One Term Cory what you are allowing to happen is UNAMERICAN. It is disgusting that you will allow this to happen.
voter fraud? Sanctuary cities?  Why were you elected?  This GOP voter is disappointed.
Wow nothing to tweet?  What about how trump is destroying our country?  Immigration? Wall? Obamacare? EPA?  Do you agree?
Get yo DIA and fight for Muslim rights.
so are all these protestors today getting paid too?
Turn the news on. Any channel. You may want to rethink your blind following of Mr Trump. You do not represent Colorado.
Are you sitting quite today as we enforce our new religious ban? Coward.
And your GOP'ers in the White House could not spell her name? PS-Why aren't your phones being answered anymore?
Where do you stand on Trump's Muslim refugee ban? Please be clear.
"Paid protesters from out-of-state" - Any proof??  Or a lie to ignore your constituents?http://denver.cbslocal.com/2017/01/27/people-shouldnt-be-afraid-gardner-on-trump-policy/ …
I'm not paid and I'm sure as hell not from out of state.  I'll be here in 2020. :) @cbslocal
please stand up for refugees. Please stand up for American values and speak out against Muslim ban. PLEASE.
Okay, awesome Now get your ass back to CO, we are your bosses and instead of listening to us you lied about us.
So all of us who are calling your offices are paid activists, huh? I'll show u my CO drivers license, you liar!
POTUS latest EO regarding refugees is tragic, Un-American, and not Christian. I urge you to take a stand against this.
Still consider the majority of your constituents as paid agitators?  >675k of us: https://ballotpedia.org/Laws_governing_recall_in_Colorado …
Senator, do you support what this president is doing to refugees?

Yes or No

@denverpost
So Coloradans are now "paid protestors"?  SCREWYOO!! Where's my check? Answer yer phone http://denver.cbslocal.com/video/category/news-politics/3613629-coloradans-reach-out-to-congressional-leaders/ …
I'm a constituent  offended by your labeling us as "paid protesters" -we have legitimate concerns and you obv don't care.
I am waiting to hear more substance about which EOs you oppose. Colorado is watching you.
You are LYING Cory. Outrageous

watch the above interview Cory says people are being paid to call him from out of town.
perhaps now you'll have time to answer calls and emails from those of us in CO who've been trying to get in touch.
saw you on CBS 4 Denver, claiming the calls you've been getting can't really all be from constituents, bad news, they are.
Oh so you can bring back austerity to both our countries?! How special. Can't wait! Will we be paid??
- all those ppl u said were paid outsiders calling ur offices? Nope! ALL LOCAL. Want to listen now? #IndivisibleFRR
No torturing people, no big walls, no banning of refugees, no restricting women's right to abortion. No, no no, no, no!!!
REJECT Betsy DeVos for Dept. of Education! She's trying to "advance God's kingdom" in schools! WTF? http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/308616-trumps-education-nominee-said-she-was-trying-to-advance-gods …
Great. Now can you vote no on Tillerson?
Trumps lack of moral compass to understand why torture is wrong. That will damage our relationship with the UK.
hope you listened!  Russia=threat. NATO=good. And #AnswerYourDamnPhone
our special relationship now means a joint interest in discriminating at the expense of our economy.
Republicans should be worried - doomed to lose in 2018 https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2420 …
Address the civil rights infringements and violations of freedoms of speech perpetrated by your party's president. Now.
while you were renewing special relationships & kowtowing to Trump, here back in CO just wondering where we stand w/ you?
I hope that u will reconsider ur plan to destroy healthcare, Medicare, Medicaid and SS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_hisXNDZkY …
Not everyone in Colorado is a Democrat, keep up the good work.
Hope @POTUS doesn't ruin the relationship.
enjoying a beautiful day in Colorado!  Hoping that you, senator, are working to protect our environment. @colorado
Do all you can to stop this crazy POTUS idea of launching voter fraud investigation!!  Crazy idea!!
speaking of our nations birth, do what you were elected to do, defend our const the 1st 8th 14th amds under attack by #trump
Yes thats uplifting but when fed employees are under gag orders&pres advisor Bannon tells news media to shut up-calls for response from you
These tweets are pure fluff. Our democracy is in crisis. But fine with you?
I'd like to enjoy a "special relationship" w my own body wo the GOP. Can you work on that for women?



Here's hoping DT didn't ruin this relationship for is as he has done with Mexico.
we don't care about @theresa_may, we care about the dignity, rights and agency of US citizens. Stop licking Trump's boots.
-her speech was inspiring. Now how are you going to stop the war POTUS is waging against middle & lower class Americans?
Dear Global Leaders, pls cancel ALL meetings with Trump. We are trying to clean up our mess. #cancelmeetings
Hope you got a chance to step outside to see what the locals think of your little mtg..
@ReSister2016 @SenCoryGardner @theresa_may Gotta love Philly- they do the fight for Liberty well.
#AnswerYourDamnPhone
Just heard today of someone who sent messages to her sen via pizza bc the phones were shut off. Trying to think of a food
I have plenty of horse manure.
Sure wish you were working for your constituents instead of #PutinsPuppet and your big oil donors
I hope you caught our big 'ole gay dance party right outside the hotel last night. We dance and we fight. You're on notice.
Are u working on saving health care for the people of Colorado? We voted for Hillary. We are watching what u do
Did you want a participation trophy?
Too bad about Mexico though. #tradewarsareawesome #americawillpayforthestupidwall
WHEN WILL YOU EVER LEARN CORY ????? .
Are you ducking, or are you covering in the City of Brotherly Love?   Don't be #spineless.
we don't want a wall, or torture or black sites, the U.K. Doesn't either!

that was a powerful speech. Greets from Golden CO
could have been with Mexico too but you're idiots about that lame wall. Try to talk sense into the insane Pres
And they're ceding Pacific Rim to China pulling out of TPP.   Trump is "Tough on China" my Aunt Sally.
