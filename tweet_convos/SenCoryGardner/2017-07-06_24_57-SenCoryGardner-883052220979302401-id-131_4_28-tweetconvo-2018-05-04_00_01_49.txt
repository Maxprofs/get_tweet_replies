Where are you, Senator @CoryGardner ? People with disabilities and their families have been trying to talk with you about health care.
What are you going to do about Trump talking in private w Putin? https://twitter.com/ivohdaalder/status/883051186135367680 … #copolitics @denverpost @indivisibleden
Total government experience in the room?

Russia: 80+ years…
Oh noes! I bet Trump & Putin are going to work out their 2020 election strategy!     #Trump #Trump2020 #Putin #TrumpRussia #MAGA
Ah the routine farm tour with folks hand-picked who won't ask anout hc or jailing the disabled
What a joke! How about an in-person town hall to hear from all of your constituents? Health care for all
I look at that picture and I wonder how many of those people won't have health coverage if GOP proposal goes through. Plz Say no to it, Sen
I wish YOU made Colorado proud.
Didja roll up yer sleeves to show yer a regular fella? Didja have the right work boots? Didja nod vigorously to show ya care?
I'm glad you had fun. When are you available for a tour my few hundred friends and I would like to give you of our local city hall?
Now stop this tragic and poorly designed illness bill
Thanks for ignoring the citizens in your population centers. #voteoutgardner2020
Thanks, Zay & Leah, for making CO proud! @SenCoryGardner - You do exactly the opposite, . Hope you got a cushy job lined up post-senate.
Koch brothers got him covered
Do the Koch bros offer healthcare when hiring former GOP leaders?We know most Americans won't be able to get coverage.#whereiscorygardner
Yes AND nations health & wellbeing at stake. Rrealize youre US SENATOR, dont U?  No AHCA, no war, keep net neutrality
400,000 rural Coloradans will loose their healthcare.Are they going to be affected?Could the Senator explain that? #whereiscorygardner?
Ouch
But you, Cory, do NOT make us, your constituents, proud. You hide from us, ignore our requests for in person Town halls & Zero transparency!

Cory is not saying anything about HC. He hides from us,@KamalaHarris! @SenBennetCO @indivisiblefrr @denverpost
Republicans are acting like this is about health care. This is about a tax cut for the wealthiest 0.4% at the expense of 22M Americans.
Your photo ops worthless. Meet us face to face in a LIVE, IN PERSON town hall. See whose lives you'll destroy when you vote for Trumpcare.
Wow, does @SenCoryGardner even realize that trumpcare will be voted on soon? Maybe he needs to be evaluated along with trump?
They may "make Colorado proud", unfortunately I can't say the same thing about my jr. Senator though...
rural CO isn't going 2 buy your campaign photo ops. Stop destroying healthcare 4 rural communities
If we keep seeing more extreme heat and more extreme draught then these farmers will lose their livelihood. Sad that you do nothing to help!
Peddle, as in try and pass off some Covfefe?
Don't take your eye off Russia. You've been had. Trump is not a Republican, your goals are not his goals. Listen to our goals, the people.
How do they provide healthcare 4 themselves & employees? Any insight how to improve #ACA & not give GIANT tax cuts to super-wealthy? #NoBCRA
Your constituents want to talk to you! Please set up a town hall this weekend!
Wow, I was going to get on here to gripe to #corygardner but you guys have said it all. Way to suck for our state and country Cory. Congrats
Still no town hall with your constituents??
"Healthcare schmealthcare" - Cory Gardner
That is the tiniest town hall I've ever seen.
You are useless. These posts only illuminate the fact that you're a coward and terrified to face your constituents, particulary urban ones
Another Standing Room Only turnout!
Whatever dude
Make CO proud by voting against the healthcare bill #Healthcare #healthyCO
But you won't meet with ADAPT, will you, you coward?
Where's Cory
Not even a peep on healthcare? If Dorathy had you as a sidekick instead of the cowardly lion, we'd all be ruled by flying monkeys.
When are holding a town hall with the rest of your constituents? #coward #oneterm
Drivel.
#WeWillReplaceYou
Hold a town hall!
So a produce peddler and a dairy farm.But you're just not really interested in what those of us in the big city have to say to you, are you?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if you did? Make us proud, that is. Oh, well. Go take the social security from some old lady, or try. Oh, you did.


Still waiting Senator. 
What do you stand for?
Who do you stand with?
I'll wait.…
Coward! #whereiscory
WTF??? How about meeting with your constituents? Town hall now!!! I want to know why you are for ruining people's lives
No offense to Zay and Leah, but don't you have something more important to do? Like protect people, Colorado, and the US?
Have you heard of the Propaganda Peddler in  Command? Your boss? 
Do they use that pesticide that causes birth defects, that your EPA approved?
Great.  How about taking a tour of the people you will kill if you vote yes on AHCA? We could meet at a thing called a town hall.
2020
You could make Colorado proud by listening to citizens at a town hall.  You are supposed to work for us. Can't represent if you don't listen
Did they ask you to vote NO on trumpcare? Did they ask you to save their insurance?? Did they ask you when you will hold a town hall??
Look, it's Corey avoiding town halls in the middle of a field!


@DSAdenver and @OurRevolution demonstrators sit-in at office of @SenCoryGardner demanding a 'No' vote on #BCRA @DemSocialists #copolitics 
Did you get permission from McConnell to release this photo op? Better make sure it wasn't secret meeting kinda stuff. Cowardly Cory
Cory and @RepKenBuck, are you OK with Trump meeting in secret with Putin?  #DoYourJob and protect our country.
This fact, in itself, is evidence of shenanigans. Only the two most pro-Russia Americans are allowed in the room. https://www.axios.com/coming-attractions-trump-putin-meeting-2454467032.html …

We are here to #StopTrumpCare. Vote "no" @SenCoryGardner 
We want in townhall on healthcare! We want improvements not repeal and replace. Your new bill hurts Coloradans
You know who the people of Colorado aren't proud of?You & your refusal to hold townhalls or have a discussion about the "health care reform"
Did they pay you for that visit as well?
How about you make Colorado proud by voting NO on the disastrous Senate healthcare bill? Or holding a town hall?
Thanks to fellow Coloradans for suggesting @SenCoryGardner make Colorado proud and host an in-person town hall!
Stop the bs trolling... you get worse by the day...sad!
Meanwhile in your Denver office there are a few constituents that would like a moment of your time. It would behoove you to pay attention.
But what's a few hundred constituents when you can play Senator to a dozen or so and eat fruit.
In your heart of hearts @SenCoryGardner do you believe we are going to quit? You do have a heart right? Might need to prove it pretty soon.
And this is why your approval rating is at 27% because you don't represent us! Koch givesyou $ but they can't vote for you!
Another meaningless post while hundreds are clamoring for your attention. The contempt you are showing for your constituents is staggering.
Why won't you be a man and state your position on the health care?  Are you afraid of the voters?
Have you had a chance to read the  bill you wrote in secret yet?  Stop being an ASSHAT and Listen to your constituents - VOTE NO!!!
and your constituents are trying to save their medicaid while you get tours of farms. nice to know where your loyalties are,
Hey! Social media intern! There is no universe in which these tweets aren't doing more harm than good. Healthcare or nothing. Seriously.
Not sure u know how 2 "make Colorado proud," but I'm sure u know how to make many of 'em dead. Stop killing ACA, stop killing Americans.
Do Zay and Leah have healthcare?
 town hall 
He is Trump's Lap Dog.  Good boy Cory, just do what Don wants and ignore your Colorado constituents
No one should be one illness or accident away from financial ruin. Stop avoiding my calls and letters and emails and speak against brca
I've worked my entire adult life. My friends have too. I've had three friends have to declare bankruptcy for knee surgeries--before ACA.
My son was premature. Would have used his lifetime cap in the nicu. Can you explain to me why you would take his health care away?
Can you give a better script to the poor interns in your office about why you refuse to hold a town hall? Or vote no on health care?!
You're not on vacation from duty. you should be meeting with constituents, rather than having interns answer your phones "I don't know"
Not one single positive comment Cory. But you just keep plugging along like you're working for Colorado.
Hey Cory. What up with healthcare?  What's your position?  Most of us in co are against the @GOP plan which does nothing to fix the problem
Shame on you for turning your back on your constituents. We deserve answers on healthcare as much as Zay and Leah deserve a photo op 
You, unfortunately, are not making Colorado proud. We're pretty damn angry you are ignoring us. Man up and face your constituents.
Why don't you take a tour of Children's Hospital in Aurora? I'm sure plenty of parents w sick kids would love to talk to you about Medicaid
I know we're in the west, but I'm pretty sure our population density would allow for meetings of more than 5-10 people at a time.
@SenCoryGardner do the right thing. Health care is for everyone. Listen to your Colorado residents! #SaveMedicaid #ThursdayThoughts
A key question to ask them is their healthcare safe with the new bill you are proposing to replace ACA? Medicaid for All!
Vote no on the #AHCA bill, please.
They do make Colorado proud, unfortunately we can't say the same about you @SenCoryGardner . If only you stood with us!
I am happy you're visiting your constituents, would you please now hold a town hall to talk about healthcare?????
Nobody's buying your pretend statesmanship so just stop. You're embarrassing yourself. P.S. Vote NO on that healthcare shit show.
Will they have health care insurance?
Call his offices!! Show up and demand he represent your voices. This man is a dirtbag!! Vote him and his cronies out!!
More from soft Cory Gardner. Still refuses to meet with his constituents and take ?'s regarding the 150/K he got from insurance lobbyists
Cory, I'll gladly give you tours of multiple event centers across the state capable of hosting town halls. DM me and we'll get some set up!
Hey, I'll travel to attend that event!!!
Me too!
How about you listen to your voters instead of having them arrested or abusing them when they come to your offices? Vote NO on Trumpcare
omg, I read your tweet before I saw who you were speaking to.  I thought it was to Pat Toomey. He did that yesterday. Two peas in a pod 
You're in CO! That's cool. Does this mean you're scheduling town halls to meet with your constituents? No? Why not?
So about that town hall...?
Doesn't look like a townhall - doesn't sound like a townhall - must not be a townhall. You know what those are, right?
here is an idea, set up a REAL town hall, The Produce Peddlers could make a fortune selling rotten tomatoes...#wealthcare
Any discussion of relative ease of finding agricultural workers these days?
Very sad for our Country that elected officials are afraid to face their constituents .  We must fix this to preserve our democracy. 
Dude! Stop posting pictures of yourself enjoying Colorado when you refuse to meet with protesters or hold a town hall! No on health care
HEY, Trump supporters are threatening journalists with violence. You going to address that?
The parents and wife of Andrew Kaczynski received around 50 harassing phone calls each by Wednesday http://thebea.st/2supCbz 
You know, telling Trump supporters to knock it off with the violent threats BEFORE someone is killed would be great.
Awesome, can they show you to a town hall next?
So you only meet with the people you subsidize and tell everyone else you are against government spending?
On another planet where you have no constituents and no one wants to know about how they will obtain health insurance? #ProtectOurCare
Have you seen your generic polling numbers, Cory?
Thanks for that public forum Sen Gardner.   Oh wait … there wasn’t one.

Hey! I'm close to Mesa county! Can I come see you and discuss health care??
I'd like to go!
I'd love to go see @SenCoryGardner ! It's easier to find the ghost of Christmas past! Or Casper! Or a compassionate Republican! Or free $$!!
I'd love to have him for dinner. Mom has cancer & hubby is wounded warrior w/cancer. Would live to talk about healtcare.
