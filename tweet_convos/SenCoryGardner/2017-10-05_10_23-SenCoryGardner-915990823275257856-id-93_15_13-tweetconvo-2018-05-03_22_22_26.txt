^^^ exactly.
Im sure he will.
Sad!
Please, declare the NRA a Terrorist Organization or at least don't be bought by them. http://petitions.moveon.org/s/FZOEPF  @MoveOn
Ha! On both counts!!!


Guess #TownHall meetings just aren’t s priority. 
Can you explain our goals in all these unauthorized wars? https://twitter.com/ccluster99/status/919813100030844928 …
Don't want to answer ??s about the blood$$ you take from the @NRA???  #Coward
Thanks but no thanks. Pueblo doesn't need your kind of representation. Hindsight is #2020.
Perhaps you can convince PR you'd be a great moderate GOP voice for them, and make this your first campaign stop! Get a beachside place. GO!
Informative & timely read. 
"Blood Pact With the NRA"... 
They along with Koch brothers, own Cory Gardner
Read my column, "Blood Pact With the N.R.A.," and let me know what you think. https://nyti.ms/2yJFNV8 
#scared #littleman you are @SenCoryGardner.  Represent or get out you crony.
Stop with all the complaints! A legitimate scheduling conflict occurred- Wayne LaPierre wanted to be fellated on short notice. #corythecreep
AHAHAHA.!!
COWARD
See you on Election Day. Get your time with Mitch now.  Your NRA money will not save you.
How about assurance @VP didn't just wantonly waste our taxpayer dollars for staged pre=planned racist inflaming act?
I *assume* that *no* taxpayer funds were spent to help Mike Pence pull his asinine, juvenile prank at the Colts game today. Right? *Surely*?
Please do some good for the people in Puerto Rico while you're there. And, PLEASE don't throw paper towels at them.
And please be honest about the PR situation/conditions, Senator. This is a humanitarian trip NOT a photo op.
I just threw up a little. It tasted like you're a coward and of course you're not showing up to meet your constituents face to face
Convenient.  We're still going to ask the same questions and not going to forget anything.

You should be arrested for prostitution. You take money to screw America!
Totally didn’t see that coming.  I can’t wait to vote you out.
SAME
Living up to your name 'Cowardly Cory'!
@SenCoryGardner I'd love to hear your response to this video
Watch this. 
Yeah, right!
Wonder why...
Another grotesque waste of our tax dollars. What will you affect except sweating like a fat guy on a trampoline.

Coloradans: Tell @SenCoryGardner his vote to open the #ArcticRefuge to drilling is unacceptable 202-883-6199 #ProtecttheArcticRefuge


Why?????
Where’s Cory you’ve got a lot of blood money on your hands how much  have you taken from the NRA. They own you don’t they?
They ABSOLUTELY own him AND his compadre, Mike "Stinkin" Coffman!!!

Hope you enjoy shooting paper towel jump shots.
We are all shocked by this news.
Donkeys (broncos) have a bye week, this weekend Denver would have you
I called you again today. Like always. I spoke with an aide. Hope he tells you my message. Vote No on abortion bill Graham is writing.
Little con man Cory hiding as usual. #2020 your big money loving ass will be voted out. #conmancory #colorado
You took $3,879,074 from the NRA. Who do you work for, Donors, Trump, McConnell or the people of CO? You won't be getting a 2nd term.
Just "guess" who he works for . . . NOT constituents! Next guess!! Starts with an N, ends with an A. Oh yeah, there is an R in the middle!!!
He & the skipper, I mean Mitch McConnel know what is best for our citizenry  I have some advice Mr. Gardner, disassociate or get voted out
Thx heads up- approve DACA & PR relief. No wealth xfer via taxes. Control weapons & WH traitors. Constituents more important than DONORS
You people don’t understand that Gillian, I mean Cory is making the important decisions that we cannot comprehend.
Oh shoot, no talking points tour for Cory. Luckily we can ask an inanimate object questions and get the same response we do from you.
Oh and take paper towels, I hear they need more to sop up all the flood water. Another case oughta do it. But you have to throw them.
I’m sure Sir, meanwhile please  STOP #BogusTaxReform & #ImprisonAllTraitors
A man walks up a hill with a case... he opens the case and pulls out a trombone; a sad one. He puts it to his lips as the sun sets. WAH-waah
Alright, it's for a good reason. But you're playing dirty pool with tweets like this, Cory...
That’s ok. We won’t forget 2 take u 2 task abt the $ you get from the NRA & tax cuts for your rich donors when you do decide to face us.
Coward.
Ahhh you trickster gth
Lunch with the NRA instead?
Will you ensure that #PuertoRicoRelief is done effectively?  Will you vote to remove #jonesact that hurts PR (and Hawaii)?
You scared huh
@indivisibleden typical Cory Gardner cowardice - you knew we'd call you out on your NRA ties
Grab as much cash and goodies as you can get. Because in 2020 we are going to vote your ass out of office! #AmericaDeservesBetter
Ask Dotard Donald on tips for hucking paper towels.
No surprise. I never expected you would really come anyway. Sad
Time for common sense gun laws
Im so surprised! . I was looking forward to hearing what you did with the $4m the gun lobby has given you.....
Leave the hair products at home-roll up your sleeves-go to the interior areas of PR. Tell the paper-towel-thrower-in-chief what you saw.
Thank you for going to #PuertoRico. Please go to the mountain areas and the south to get a sense of the real catastrophe.
Wow surprise!!!!!

No shocker there
Coward.

Running off to hide from this disgusting news?
Maybe because of this? The Congress Members Receiving the Most N.R.A. Funding
I will be voting #colorado members out
Same!
Thank you for going to Puerto Rico.
Yes, thank you indeed! 

The Top 1% get nearly 80% of the Trump tax cuts.  Top .1% get nearly 40% of the cuts. This is absurd. 
Whoops! Get some distance between your NRA backing and wait for this Las Vegas thing to blow over.
Safe travels.
such a load. Either you weren't showing up in 1st place or you chickened out! 80212
I dare you have it not in the middle of the work day so I can attend, coward
Of course it is, why would you want to talk to the people you represent, you coward.  Maybe you could send @CardboardCoryCO in your place.
#shocking
You're awful.
:) what just happened ?
Did you ask the donors if this is okay?  Or did they order it? #Owned
Why?  You don't want to face your constituents?  The clock is ticking, 2020 isn't far off and you'll face the FULL electorate.  Break w/NRA!
We need to see you, we need to know what you're doing...you don't care about PR anyway, so why are you going?
In your own press release you admit >90% PR still w/o power. Trump said flashlights no longer needed on Tues. Ready to call him a liar yet?
I'm sure you were looking forward to sharing your ideas on gun violence and affordable healthcare.
Pueblo is very gun friendly
I don't know, but it is far more D than Colorado Springs.
"Has been asked by the White House to attend a bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Delegation to the hurricane-ravaged territory of PR" LOL!
Probably will still have time to meet with donors
Shocking.
2020
