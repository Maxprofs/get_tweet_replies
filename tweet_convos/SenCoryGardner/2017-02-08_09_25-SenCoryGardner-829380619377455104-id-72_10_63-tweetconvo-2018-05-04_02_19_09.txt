until someone pays you to change your mind on NATO!  Blumenthal, look out for the shank in your back!
Vote NO on Sessions. Vote NO on Gorsuch. Stop taking bribes. I live in 81623. #NotPaid #Resist
Shame on you for voting for DeVos. Vote NO on Sessions. His history fighting against voting rights makes him unqualified.
#crookedcory decided sessions was awesome. So much for his constituents.
Yup, called one of his offices today. Said he should've listened to his constituents on DeVos. 1/2
Was told, "there is a big difference between listening to constituents and doing what they want." 2/2
#crookedcory well now. I think that makes up our decision for 2020?  Thanks for the heads up.
My thoughts exactly. 2020 here we come.
Dear @SenCoryGardner, Thanks!  I don't always agree with you, but I want to let you know that I am with you on this one.
Thank you for doing one thing to represent your constituents. Hopefully not the last.
We see nothing from you Senator regarding reigning in your president. M. Bennett is doing a great job representing Colorado
yet you keep voting yes with Trump. That's two faced. You can't play both sides. We know what you truly believe.
Yes you're going to be busy the next four years cleaning up Trump's mess.
thank you
Can't wait for 2020...don't let the door hit you in the...#RememberDeVos
Will you stand up to Trump and McConnell...and Putin?
thank you Senator
thank you @SenCoryGardner @SenBlumenthal
Awww...isn't that nice! Now...stop posing for photo ops & do your job. 80127
Thank you, everything action and words that trump speaks appear to be against NATO and this is dangerous
Thanks for doing your job, I guess.  Can you please tell the President to get on board or get out?
Good.  Now stay with it.
cannot keep walking the fence with Trump
I'll need to see this in action, I don't trust you as far as I can throw you right now!  #iamnotpaid 80923
So how does voting for Sessions who *will* block any Trump/Putin investigations advance NATO?
I appreciate this stand.  Now, if you would listen to your constituents on other topics, Mr. Gardner...
Neocon lackey @SenCoryGardner & @SenBlumenthal push Zionist PNAC Neocon line vs #Russia & #Putin: http://america-hijacked.com/2014/02/24/us-has-neocon-agenda-in-ukraine-russia-analyst/ â€¦
Too little too late. I voted for you. I won't make that mistake again. You have lost CO by standing with ignorance.
and if 45 writes an EO to withdraw will you just let it go and move on?
How about investigating so-called President's Russian ties. Could be....Treason?
your vote to stop Senator Warren from reading Coretta Scott King's letter shows your lack of a moral compass.
Thank you for that. Would you please consider not voting for Sessions, Price, Pruett, Mnuchin?
Nice try! We see right through you! #CrookedCory: you're out in 2020.
In other words, a tacit admission that POTUS is compromised by Russian influence, right?
the definition of Bi-Partisan: "cooperation, agreement, & compromise between two major political parties". #ProveIt #Fraud
Denver Post.  Gardner for hire.  And I am not talking about your lawn.
Members of NATO are publically insulting @POTUS and you want to legislate US bowing to their denigratory talk
What about the kids of America you sold out for $46,800?
How about bipartisan support voting against Sessions?

Thank you
Great work, keep up bipartisan cooperation! But Trump lost CO, please oppose his crooked admin loudly for us!
cool.  How do you plan to spend that 50 grand DeVos gave you?  Crook.
How about vote #NoSessions or #NoDAPL or #NoTrump - who cares about NATO when you allow DeVos to bribe you  @SenCoryGardner @SenBlumenthal
thank you
Have you checked with @POTUS first to make sure he is on board with this, today?!
or even this second?
Do you expect DJT to support this resolution? He seems rather unlikely to do so.
Can't wait to vote against Cory Gardner.
Are you sure you want to go against Trump? You certainly took the cowards way out on the DeVos vote.
I appreciate this effort, but will you stand against this republican administration's racist AG nominee?
More feel good crap while your VOTES show you are fully on board with trump.  We see through this crap.
Ok. And now please vote NO on #Sessions. And answer your damn phones! Also, we'd like a town hall with you.
If our president wasn't a Russian puppet, we wouldn't have to stress NATO support.  Investigate him.
Too little. Too late. #CrookedCory
NO ON @JeffSessionsrbx FOR AG PLEASE
Did @SenBlumenthal have to donate to you to get you to work with him too? Just curious how deep this goes.
