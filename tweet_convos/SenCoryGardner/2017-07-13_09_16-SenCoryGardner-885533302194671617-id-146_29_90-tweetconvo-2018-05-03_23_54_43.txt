Interesting, what backing of historical efficacy did you base this legislation on? How much did you and your writers studied Korean culture?
You obviously do not read your tweets. Otherwise you would do the right thing and represent your constituents. Your demise is imminent!
Meanwhile Trump is trying to ease sanctions on our enemy, Russia 
How about growing a spine and do the same for Russia
Where's Cory
https://draftable.com/compare/YQqISKezkQIt …  follow this link to know about what is the health care bill
You should do something to support our President. Why are you not speaking out against the Dems? MGA now please! I will vote to replace you!
You have to vote no on healthcare. Cruz amendment does not make economic sense!  Puts the word "freedom" in and thinks we will be happy! NO!
How about Russia?
Now what about Healthcare?
BRIGHT OBJECTS OVER HERE. Don't pay attention to the fact that your President is treasonous and obstructed justice to cover the fact
Why didn't you introduce bipartisan legislation for our healthcare? #priorities #wherescory
Yup...@SenCoryGardner is doing nothing for #Colorado.  Every legislation he sponsors is about Korea
@SenCoryGardner NO on healthcare #ProtectOurCare #VoteNo
You suck. Go cuddle up with Donald.
Shut Up! You power hungry ego-maniac!!!
Vote no on Murdercare that you wrote.
Well at least you are doing something Cory
Today you choose to further punish an oppressed group of people. Economic sanctions on a people already deprived ???
1. We imposed sanction on NK in 2006
2. We still don't have healthcare that covers everyone
3. this is a distraction
4. We need a Town Hall
So, you're willing to engage in sanctions with North Korea, but are also willing to screw your own ppl with healthcare...pathetic
Or, you could invest your time in issues that directly involve Americans: opposing the new health cafe bill
Mr. Gardner, perhaps you should work on healthcare rather than North Korea. Your bipartisan embargo is another stunt.
How about representing your Colorado constituents... respond to our concerns on healthcare. Hold town halls.
You better vote NO on that ridiculous Republican plan you want to call healthcare. "Better Care" my ass. Lies. Vote NO!
You work for the people of CO. Trying to make a name for yourself with this N Korea BS? You can just stop. You'll never be president dude.
Look like Cory is spiking the ball, that was dumb grandstanding.
What about health care!!
Vote no on healthcare bill!! I live in Greeley CO and it will hurt patients here
Warmongering again are we? Sounds about right. Kill em at home or abroad you don't discriminate. #wherescory
Today, you continued to avoid explaining your indefensible position on healthcare to your constituents who have been asking for months.
If you vote yes on the health bill these sanctions are for nothing. Either way we will die!
Get your priorities straight in healthcare Gardner. Your bill sucks! #VoteNo
the DMZ wire plaque behind you nice touch.Please support Kate Law
Really, they're starving and destitute already. All the sanctions over the years have done is zilch, nada, nothing.
NO to #TrumpDeathCare
W/o State Department staff doing the work/managing international negotiations, how will sanctions be put in place? Deal? Diplomacy is needed
You think it's funny huh?
This is a distraction from his real embargo on the citizens of Colorado.  People will die and this guy doesn't care. #Trumpcare
annnnd healthcare lol
Concentrate on fixing the ACA.  Your party's plan is a disgrace to millions of Americans.
Hey, how 'bout introducing your mouth to the word "no" & not supporting a Republican healthcare bill that doesn't help people's health?
Nobody cares.  Vote no on the Senate healthcare bill.  Everybody cares about that.
STOP IT!! Start talking about healthcare and a town Hall meeting.  We want you to talk about Colorado's healthcare.  Talk to us.  Coward!
Seriously your healthcare plan is ridiculous! Just stop already
Sir, fascinating, and if you wanted to fight against North Korea you should have stuck to military work. You're a senator, answer us. #daily
You are so out of touch. Focus on Russia and health care.  Pay attention to your constituents.  You would know if you met with us. #sad
350 domestc flights carry weapons for terrorists what abt invest Awan Bros

Sigh....that's great Cory, now man up and talk to your constituents about that 900 lb elephant of a health care bill please.
2020
And Russia?????
Can you please have a town hall meeting to discuss the shit show of what #Trumpcare will be like. You do know you're on that panel right?
Still don't like you... for all appropriate reasons.
Sen. Gardner the bill intro to HC is nothing but a cost shift to those w ins for those that choose a cheap policy. #voteno still a tx brk
Make a statement on Health Care.  Your silence is an embarrassment to Colorado.
Great. Now investigate Trump and Russian ties. Also, stop giving the fossil fuel industry a free pass.
Your refusal to acknowledge the thousands of constituents demanding the most basic communication is mind boggling.
HOW about health care, chicken @SenCoryGardner? When are you meeting with us about voting no??
Checked twitter to see if you are telling concerned voters about healthcare. Talk about healthcare, that is what voters want to know about
I'll try not to buy any North Korean goods. Speaking of embargoes, do you think you'll be running for office again without town halls]?
You should be talking to @RepMikeCoffman about spearheading the impeachment process. Last people on that bus don't get re-elected...
You could answer my email about the proposed budget and useless wall or the one about health care.
somebody actually answered at the DC Office. I have been calling for weeks and only got vm. Requested the Senator speak on healthcare
Senators need to focus on the domestic. Do you want to see your constituents needlessly die so billionaires may enjoy a tax break?
OK, fine, you want to talk about North Korea.Tell me this: What does North Korea want? Let's start there. I'm serious, I want to understand.
Focus on Colorado first!
This is all well & good but you continue to ignore your constituents and the issues that are important to CO.  What about healthcare???
Ignoring and avoiding the healthcare issue does not instill confidence in CO voters. If you are supporting the bill own it. Don't hide it.
@SenBennetCO Healthcare?How about that being bipartisan?New version is even worse for our state! We will repeal you, if a yes. #2020vision
Stop trying to distract. The issue is health care. Are you going to vote to get rid of Coloradans' healthcare?
HELLO ..... MCFLY! 

HEALTH CARE!

Gonna start calling you Marty.
Please acknowledge that only 12% of Americans support the healthcare bill. We want you focused on preventing it.
Who cares? What your constituents care about is your silence on  Trumpcare, your Koch pow-wows, and your invisibility.
So you are trying to protect Americans from a foreign gov't but you are willing to have our lives threatened by your HC policies.
useless
How about the healthcare bill?  Read it?
Coward Cory continues to avoid constituent townhall and hides behind Twitter and Facebook. Who works for a coward like Cory?
Hold a town hall in Colorado.

Impeach the traitor.

Resign.

Shut up about North Korea.

How are you so bad at being a senator?
That's lovely, Cory dear. Now how about cancer patients like me and special needs people like my kid? BRCA screws us over. NO to Trumpcare.
No one is concerned about NK. Support Single Payer or be prepared to move into your lobbyist career phase. #SinglePayer
Very nice how about a town hall? How about legislation that won’t kill Americans by taking away their insurance. #TrumpcareKills
This is so typical of you.  Ignore the 76% of Coloradans trying to get you to meet with them and focus on something stupid.
That's nice.  Now for the third time, what is your stand on Colorado Healthcare?
Yeah, because that's worked in the past. How about use your time to keep the FCC from screwing us with the gutting of net neutrality?
Does #NorthKorea have better access to healthcare than we would under #TrumpedUpCare ?

Taking the directives of the Koch Bros. to try to distract us from #trumprussia and your awful #healthcare bill, eh?
toDaY i IntRoDUced bipArtiSAn LegISLatioN tO IMpoSe AN ecONomiC EmbaRgO on #nOrTHkoREa
We want HEALTHCARE!
Do the right thing, right now.
#NoBCRA
Cory is a pretend King, issuing his pretend Foreign Policy. Never mind what the Colorado peasants say.
Sanctions and a smart bomb up Kim's backside will put a halt to the problem

Still waiting Senator. 
What do you stand for?
Who do you stand with?
I'll wait.…
Today's word is "BullSH&^%" ....... Gary Said "bipartisan"...Gary has NO idea what that means.
Vote NO on this new horrible healthcare bill.  Work for Coloradans, not the Republican Party
whats the point if you keep rubberstamping the agenda of a known russian spy?
You are so out of touch. The people of CO want you to vote NO on Trumpcare. We need lower premiums not tax cuts for the wealthy.
Still not talking about the health care bill.
For all nations in the world? Espescially China? A US embargo is meaningless. I would hope we already refuse to do business with them.
I have a daughter with special needs who depends upon Medicaid for her life. Let's take care of our own! Meet with us in person!!!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now how 'bout that healthcare bill? #voteno
And the #brca? How will you vote on that Senator?
As we all know, your healthcare bill is a far bigger threat to your people's lives than North Korea. We will not be distracted.
Your job is to stand up to Injustice you need to stop hiding from your constituents talk to us or we will vote you out
What a #Leader! Took a lot of guts to do this... How about @FCC trying to give the Internet to his former boss @Verizon. #healthcare?
ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR THE HEALTHCARE BILL?
And your vote on the failing Trumpcare which is resoundingly rejected by the American people is??????
So grateful ur protecting us from NK as you decimate the state's healthcare. Tone deaf Sen., CO sent u to work for us. Now do your job!
You've already embargoed citizens of Colorado from speaking directly to you.
All while taking healthcare away from millions. You are a Coward. You do not stand with the 271k in our state that will lose insurance.
How bout Russia big guy
Cool. Now what about Healthcare? I just called all 9 of your offices to urge you to vote NO on the BCRA. No one answered. Try to focus.
"Today I once against ignored my constituents, refused to comment on my health care plan, and worked to cover up the Trump family crimes."
Great. Now when are you going to face the people you clucking chicken?!
Okay, I'm good with that. YOU MUST NOT VOTE FOR ANY ITERATION OR REVISED VERSION OF BCRA(AHCA)! I am 1 of your constituents! COUNTRY FIRST!
I WAS VERY UNHAPPY TO HAVE GONE TO YOUR COS OFFICE MONDAY TO FIND "NO STAFF" DOOR WAS LOCKED ! WELL WORN SIGN = "OUT IN THE COMMUNITY" FUCK
Interesting timing for this. Desperately trying to deflect and avoiding constituents.  You *know* BCRA is devastating to CO and indefensible
You will own this if you vote for it (let's call it "CoryCare").  And we will not forget.  Political suicide.
WE DONT CARE. We want answers on the tax break for the wealthy (aka healthcare bill)... Stand for your constituents and vote no!
I forget. Was it an embargo that brought down the USSR, & free trade that opened Cuba, or the other way ‘round? #copolitics @SenCoryGardner
Today, I introduced bipartisan legislation to impose an economic embargo on #NorthKorea. 
Great! Now repeal Obamacare!
And Russia????
So, how about healthcare?  Gonna protect medicaid or gut it?
While you’re at it, vote AGAINST this atrocious healthcare bill that will make insurance HARDER to get and cover LESS.

Ridiculous!
Glad you care more about holding them accountable than holding our treasonous President accountable. Or yourself. #2020
Senator, I was sent here by North Korea, which supports your candidacy.  I have some dirt on your opponent.  Can we meet?
You also unveiled your terrible "health care" bill, which continues to just be a tax break for the rich and let poor people die.

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ …

The push for a bipartisan repair of the ACA grew over July recess. This week, we must fight to hold onto it.

POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
Your healthcare bill will not decrease costs or improve quality of care for most people. You have a duty to oppose this cruel legislation.
I'm in favor of imposing an economic embargo on the annual salary increase 4 Congress. You've not done your job 2 oppose BCRA, per CO wishes
