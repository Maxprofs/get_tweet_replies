Then ask your boss to nominate some non-controversial folks. I mean, Betsy DeVos? Please.
nobody you're confirming cares about the American people, only how much they can get for their souls $$
Senator Gardner, your suggestion that this Cabinet will act in the interest of the American people is offensive.
We however, will act in our best interest come 2018.
Don't pretend you give a crap about the American people or environment. You just go put you nose back up McConnell 's butt.
Qualified candidates. You forgot qualified.
Qualified, ethical cabinet officials must be able to get to work for the American people.  Fixed it for you.
where is your call to investigate Michal Flynn and his crime of Treason?
Cabinet nominees nominated by "president" who should be investigated for treason #CountryB4Party
oh. No, no Pudzer, a guy who steals from his employees & prefers robots to humans. We're waiting for you to act 4 us not P T
we want you to come to GJ. I love your staffers in Junction (yep, I'm real, not pain, & angry), but we need you here!! Now!
sorry, meant paid. I keep reading your statements & understand you ARE a Repub, but not everyone who supported you was.
Mnuchin's "experience" comes from building a robo-signing empire that condemned thousands into a spiral of poverty.
so ignoring real constituents and being bought by special interests is cool now?
You did not do honest work for Colorado when you sold our children to #BetsyDeVos for less than $50,000.
I surge you to listen to your constituents Hold. Town Hall in every district.  Face Us
when will you get to work for Coloradoans? #TownHall
Why were you in an uproar about HRC bringing in Wall Street but now you fully support it? #Resist Hold town hall to explain
Senators must be able to represent their constituency, or they will not be re-elected.  DO YOUR JOB.
Because you work so hard for the American people. Hypocrite
Voter from 80133 wondering if you represent CO, Goldman Sachs or Russia. #ImpeachTrump
Especially for only the top 1%, to hell with the bottom 99% right Senator? Man up and schedule a townhall.
shame on you for putting party ahead of constituents. I will remember.  #resist 80301
what do u feel CG has not accomplished-what about Bennett? Your neighbor #80302
So why are you supporting people diametrically opposed to the goals of the dept they'll lead?
you betrayed Colorado and voted for a known racist to become AG.
but will they work for ALL Americans? I'm one begging you to vote NO on Pruitt. Be our representative! 80211
Not if they're horrible people!
You represent people, not party, not corps. Do your job & support cab picks with high integrity, not those who rob people.
Why would you side with people you know will bring harm to Colorado?
Elected officials must get to work for the American people!
Wait, you are not working for the people. You ignore the people
must be able to get to work for the residents of #Colorado and not his corporate sponsors.
CO=bipartisan state/balance works best/I lived in CA/IL/DC/VA/CO - sis in OR.  Don't want CA/IL/OR probs. 80302 (Boulderite)
Work for your own people. WE WANT A TOWN HALL.
vacuum of power in executive branch due to qualified people resigning, retiring or not interested. Not Dem delays.
You guys are in a short timeline - no time to waste!
@koaa You are a disappointment to your CO constituents. Education & Environment are CO issues You continue to disregard them
We want your position on #Russia @SenCoryGardner - and what you and the @GOP will be doing to investigate @realDonaldTrump #FlynnResignation
You are a sellout and an embarrassment to the GREAT state of Colorado. #imnotpaid #whereiscory
will you be asking for an investigation of Flynn?
Remember to accept their bribes, Senator. $49,800 is your price and I won't forget.
You mean taking away from the American people not working for them.  How many Coloradans did he foreclose on?
You seem to accept anything trump puts in front of you. Picking out a Colorado public school for my kids? Suggestions?
Really?  I see  Corporate and the wealthy people playing the game Risk. Come. Town Hall.
then perhaps demand cabinet officials that will work for American citizens!
Which people? I think you mean "corporate persons", a logical inconsistency.
Your boy Flynn worked out so well. #whereiscory
why are you silent on the Michael Flynn story? Perhaps he's clear evidence that you should take more time on nominees.
there needs to be investigations into the #Flynn issue. you'll be calling for that won't you?
another rubber stamp from the great avoider. #townhall
time to come home and meet with your constituents. What's got ya so scared?
Oh , I forgot, you only comment on meetings with interns.
Where is your statement on the resignation of Michael Flynn and a call for an investigation into his contact with Russia?
thank you for your urgency.  There is so much to do.
I would love more information on how a wall street insider is going to cleanup corruption?  Munching is part of the problem.
unlike you. #WhereIsCory #LookInBetsysBackPocket
and senators must listen to the people they represent.
Shulkin, yes, but not Mnuchin, a vile Snidely Whiplash villain, foreclosing on Nell (USA), tying her to the RR tracks! Boo!
are you working for us? Feels like we're not being heard. 80211
AND THEY SHOULD BE QUALIFIED, not just donors to the Trump (or Gardner) campaigns.
on the brightside, calling out this fool was a reason to learn twitter. Makes me sad to have been a republican.
The coward tweets while ignoring Colorado. Busy counting your Rubles?
I can't for the life of me understand why you would put someone lik Mnuchin into the federal government.
another BS ALARM  Watch as these guys line their pockets at our expense SHAME ON YOU
and nominated Supreme Court justices should get a hearing, right?
Cabinet Confirmations need to stop NOW. We need to find out: "What the President knew & when he knew it?"  Déjà vu (Nixon)
Like your supposed to do? HAHAHAHA you a comedian now wtf? 1 term and done, you dont care about our vets. 1 term and done!!!
but what kind of work will they get to if they are not qualified?
Flynn has been proven corrupt. Do what is right and not what Trump wants you to do. Show some courage and integrity.
press for unbiased investigations into Russia ties at all levels and appropriate disciplinary action. @GOP is compromised
your votes are putting terrible people in. People who benefit from the misfortune of those they're supposed to represent
while it's true Mnuchin has experience in business, foreclosing on seniors is not the experience we need in this role.
And so should you. Townhall NOW.
Senator when will you start working for Colorado?
would you ride in an airplane flown by someone without experience? Why would you confirm unqualified nominees? Outrageous!
How is DeVos supposed to work for the American people? She knows less than a 6th grader about education.
Mnuchin IS part of the problem. We will remember your vote when we vote.
please let all of us know about your town hall meetings and schedule on weekends!!!
It had nothing to do with getting to work for American ppl! You could give a crap about the American ppl. It's being GOP!!
and senators must listen to their constituents
you never fail to disappoint. Where are you in support of Coloradans? - tax paying voter who's not paid to care from 80112
Yet again...so disappointed in you.
I didn't even have to read this to know you voted yes on Mnuchin.
oh yeah, almost forgot... 81321
so happy to know Wall Street finally got representation from the "HRC got paid speaking fees" basher and repub hypocrites
Get to work screwing over the American people? Oh they're really good at being quick at that! Do your job, Cory.
your partisan votes on nominees of the poor quality we see speaks volumes about poor Senatorial character.
constituent from 80216 wondering when we'll see you in the area for a town hall.  I haven't been paid to post this.
your constitutional duty is to advise and consent, not advise and rubberstamp
abysmal Sen. Mnuchin a believer in same strategies that nearly ruined this economy.Dishonest confirmation.Not a vote for CO
#WhereIsCory. Called, msg, emailed, rallied;still no sign of you. Being a GOP obstructionist easier I know. Time to show up
Representatives must do their job and represent their constituents.
none of these nominees are of or for the people.
you're talking about the guy who threw people out of their homes? I doubt he'll be working for us.
Disappointed that you voted "YES" for Steven T. Mnuchin treasury secretary. Omissions of personal $ holdings in hearings
even the news can't get a call through to your office. Stop hiding from your constituents! #whereiscory #makeadatewithco
#whereiscory it's impressive you can walk considering you have no backbone.
you may have been voted into office by primarily republicans but you work for COLORADANS! We are bipartisan. #diversity
these cabinet officials do not work for "the American people." These cabinet officials aren't even qualified for their jobs.
Great statement....I hope you didn't spend all day working on that. Probably just wanted to let us know how hard you work.
Getting to work for the people, eh? When will you heed your own admonishment, Senator? Face your voters & get to work for us
Great - more pointless, ineffective, & useless press releases #notpaid #81212 #getarealhaircut #GFY
like Flynn
you mean the American (and Russian) RICH people, don't you? Your votes can't make it any more clear than that!
key words FOR the American people. I'm one of those people, doubt they'll work for me. Come on man
I think you need to take some tips from @SenSanders and @SenWarren. When they say things on #twitter, it has substance.
@indivisiblefrr Get to work and support ACA you FRAUD!
yet another decision (Mnuchin) that does not reflect Colorado. Such a shame that we will be cleaning up yet another GOP mess
these cabinet officials will never work for the American people. They only work for themselves. Just like you. #whereiscory
Cory, why are you scared to talk to your constituents?
"work for the American people" or manipulate policy to benefit banks & wall st? You dont represent CO just your own interest
those cabinet people are only interested in lining their pockets...sort of like you. 80112
Looking forward to your town hall, whenever the hell that's gonna be. Will bring my tax returns to show you I'm not paid!
Work over the American people, apparently. 

@SenCoryGardner still not listening to his constituents.
My statement on tonight's nomination votes: https://goo.gl/ItBJDy 

Cabinet officials must be able to get to work for the American people.
Colorado is waiting for it's other half of representation to show up. When will you come to talk to your constituents?
u have seriously lost contact with the people who elected u. Im a constituent from 80904 and expect to hear us vote u out!
that would be nice if they weren't scum of the earth billionaires out to rip off the American public
Translation: Get to work enriching their corporate pals & looting the commons.
Where's my $ billion Denver area VA hospital, draft dodger boy? Coffman for US Senator 2020!
.@SenCoryGardner You are more concerned with giving Pres. Trump's donors & friends jobs instead of doing your job representing CO #80207
80014 here where are you?
SHAME ON YOU!!! How much did you get paid for this vote?
Indep. 80122 you guys have not done one thing to help the people! Just making things worse everyday with the fear mongering!
SAD
You're doing a spectacularly bad job representing the people of CO. To use the language of your fuhrer: FAIL!
you need to man-up a face your constituents.  You got some 'splaining to do & we're not going to go away. We #JustGetAngrier
believes Foreclosure King Mnuchin will do good work for poor & middle class. And, presumably, green aliens from outer space.
Mnuchin has already worked us over. Would have been nice if you remembered that!!!
issue is: nominations are working in their self interest /big business interests - not for the American people
so you voted yes on Mnuchin, who participated in shady banking practices that nearly brought our economy down. #ShameOnYou
You know as well as I do that Mnuchin works for his Wall Street friends, not The People.
I feel the same way.  When you find someone qualified, let us know.
forgot to say...80127.
They must be able to get to work for WEALTHY American people, you mean, bc rest of us are getting screwed. Thx for nothing.
Will you have a town hall meeting during break?
you should be ashamed for your complicity in this horrific cabinet
How much did you get paid for your votes? #paidactivist
Once again, you toe that party line and disregard the concerns of your constituents.
he is the foreclosure king, just remember in 2020 we are definitely #VoteGardnerOut as you are against Colorado values
Dissapointing how you're representing your constituents!! 
Not a paid protester. Wait til you see how real my vote is!
Follow Colorado values instead of party line
how about you get to work for Colorado?
Lots of full statements lately. Missed the one on 200,000 or so constituents marching in Denver 1/21/17. Please repost!
constituent from 80911, curious if you remember the way to Colorado? Town hall please, #whereiscory
I hope they will work for ALL Americans.  Not just the top 1%
how many times have you sold us out now? How long until you answer to the people you are supposed to be representing? 80831
You campaigned against Udall saying he voted w/Obama 99%. Were you mad it wasn't 100%? (your record w/Trump)
we are talking to you cory. Don't act like your not getting this. Get talking.
Got your email about Republicans wanting to repeal Obamacare without a plan to replace it.

GOP = Death Panel
These people are only working for themselves - NOT US!  Who do you think you are kidding?  We are not stupid!
at the very least to look my son in the eyes everyday. He deserves better then you.
I have to thank you cory. You have got me more involved in politics then ever. I really want to see your  career over.
Hey Colorado get ready for another Republican Recession!!!!
writing letters to the President is nice but it is votes that matter.
not the type of people we want on the job.
then maybe you should get to work for the people of Colorado! #wherescory #notpaid 80504
How about  you start working for your constituents and listen to us? At a town hall would be even better.
They are there to work for you & your high power Republican friends. Stand up for what is right. Vote NO!!
Great. So you think that a man who was in charge of questionable foreclosures would be good for the people of CO? #TownHall
clearly you see a big $ lobbying job in your future assisted by these unqualified cabinet members you're passing. Disgusting
But they won't work for the American people - only the 1%. If you'd meet w/ us, we'd ask u about that. @indivisiblefrr
you sincerely don't care about your constituents, do you?
Many of Trumps picks are horrendous choices, DeVoss, Mnuchin, Price, Sessions, and@you are not listening to us at all!
you're filling the cabinet with idiots and terrible people. You are part of the problem, Cory.
When is your next public event? We would like to communicate with you, but you are hiding from your constituents!
you don't even do the work of our state. you just vote along party lines like a puppet. you embarrass our state
WE WANT A TOWN HALL! You are completely betraying your CO constituents by giving Trump a 100% pass on EVERY cabinet pick.
My statement on tonight's nomination votes: I have never felt so unrepresented. @IndivisibleTeam #resist
How many Coloradans did Mnuchin foreclose on, Senator?
my sister who has MS!
I hope you enjoy your one and only term. We will not forget and we all vote!
Townhall! Has voting against your constituents made you shy?
I know you fear a town hall because you don't want to have to explain your selling out all the time.
#bye2020
well that's nice. NOW, what about your statement on Flynn and Russia Cory ??????
FOR the American people or in spite of?
#45 needs to select cabinet officials that will work for the American people, then they would get voted in. Not drn swamp
You are simply a politician. Wouldn't it be great if you actually did the job you were elected to. Make a difference.
