@Rev_Jackson @SenCoryGardner @POTUS well there's no proof so...
then an #IndependentInvestigation will prove that
but a week ago a Russian inversion was ridiculous ridiculous, right?
inversion?

Nothing about Russia for weeks has been beyond imagination
What are you going to do about this President Senator? Real problems with Korea & He sits in WH tweeting lies. So reckless!
We have asked for investigations - is trump capable of making safe decisions for our country in light of his rx w/Russia?
do you ever read your own twitter replys. It's amazing how much people hate you.
Sanctions and show of force exercises have proven again and again to be ineffective in deterring North Korea's ambitions.
you seem distracted
I'm sure your statement will terrify them.  Bravo.
when will you make a statement on Russia? Our country is under attack.  What side of history are you on? #resist
APPALLED by the fact that you remain silent on Trump delusional tweets & obvious incompetence. What will we do in a crisis?
is hiding behind North Korea because he wants #Colorado to forget that he voted for #devos #pruitt #sessions
I'm definitely not going to forget.
you can bet most of us aren't going to forget! And in 2020? I'll be reminding those who have.
.@SenCoryGardner I'm not reading a damn word until you meet with your constituents, face to face! #SoCalledSenator
Pres. Obama warned trump that N.Korea is our largest threat.Did he listen?Be Brave, hold him accountable for attention to it
we are not going to forget that you could have stopped the confirmation of Jeff Sessions
and Betsy DeVos, Scott Pruitt, not to mention voting to silence Senator Warren!
I'm more worried about the madman much closer to home who also has access to nuclear weapons. #StopTweetingStartLeading
He is too busy being paranoid, playing golf and banning Muslims to worry...
How are we to stop our own madman? This admin is a circus.  Call on Trump to release tax returns.  What is he hiding?
Have you noticed that the president doesn't seem to care?  The GOP needs to call for a special prosecutor.  #TrumpRussia
The madman in the White House is too obsessed with wiretap and voter fraud conspiracies to respond to a foreign crisis.  
Are you listening to us.  The Donald is delusional.DO SOMETHING ABOUT HIM!!! Trump is fiddling while US burns!;
still silent about Trump, wiretaps, and Russia?  If you don't condemn it, you're part of the coverup.
.@boomking69 @SenCoryGardner This guy is a complete empty suit. Read his banal, look-good tweets. Shaking hands and  phone town hall/ Weak.
What about latest DT Admin ties to #Russia? Flynn, Sessions, Kushner. Our National Security only as strong as @POTUS 
This is what we should be talking about. Instead we are talking about crazy President and his endless conspiracy theories.
You think @POTUS is smart enough to know what to do? You're as crazy as he is!!!
investigate #TrumpRussia ties. It is your duty. You work for us. #DoYourJob
How about a full statement on Trump-Russia ties? History is watching you Cory. Be on the right side here! Country over party
Madman in WH first.  You are responsible for his actions if you choose to ignore them. #Trumprussia
we cannot afford to get into another war. Do not support such moves from the insane clown that occupies the White House
When will you schedule a LIVE in person town hall? What are you afraid of?
what exactly are you expecting from the madman in Washington?
Coward Cory hiding behind twitter, Facebook and his amateur staff. Too scared to face his constituents. CO deserves better.
why don't you put out a statement for plans on a town hall meeting or having 1 out 9 senate offices we pay for answer calls
let's Not do nuclear war- enuf to blow up planet. 1st find out IF Putin running the WH from sidelines
This is super work @SenCoryGardner, would you also put out a statement about the @realDonaldTrump lying to the American people every day
Show of force? The madman in North Korea? U'r just itchin' 4 more war, more bullying, more reasons 2 expand MIC.
What about #trumptaxes #trumpRussia
what do you recommend we do about this?
.@SenCoryGardner Serious threat. Strong words. But "immediate" and "determined" actions from trump admin? DO YOU HAVE A PLAN B
how about a full statement on our lunatic President and his corrupt administration? #trumprussia
Why don't you stand w/the #AmericanPeople 
Your #alligance to #Trump is repulsive TY @SenBennetCO @RepDianaDeGette @RepJaredPolis#resist
Maybe you can tear Da Boss away from Twitter and Alex Jones long enough to, you know, at least comment on this aggression?
thank you for taking this stance on N Korea.  Also, please support SB 291 to get Bannon out of the NSC
Sit down and Stop talking! We do not want a freaking war!! Meet with your constituents to see what we want!! COWARD!SHAME!
please follow through on your word & start holding the Trump administration accountable. This may mean breaking party lines
unless they donate 46k to your campaign
YOU ARENT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL!!! You need to lead!!! BASELESS LIES, RUSSIA, ETHICS???  Come and on...really??? No lol-ing here!
You honestly think NK is our country's biggest threat?? It's at 1600 Pennsylvania DC, not across the globe! #DoYourJob!!
You Voted % 100 with everyone of the POTUS nominees and rules.  You have to own it all!!
How does it feel to be on the WRONG side of HISTORY with your POTUS?  I Will Not Forget!
.@SenCoryGardner Any comment on  @POTUS's plan to gut funding for @NOAASatellites & deal a huge blow to CO-based aerospace & space research?
the #madman is in the Oval Office, BTW. War is imminent as #45 and cronies have ZERO diplomatic skills.
The intern you have in charge of this twitter account must secretly love seeing how much people dislike you.
I wonder, could we get you to tend to this other madman with nukes in the White House before you yak about the DPRK?
don't bother Trump. He's concentrating on another more important alternate fact.
And this scares you, look at the WH, that should scare you!!!
Do you believe the crazy stuff @realDonaldTrump is tweeting? Are you ever going to investigate his ties to Russia?
what's the matter a Russian Kot got you tongue when it comes to treason? Makes me want to тошнить #Trumprussia
Supporting that YUGE military build up but can't be bothered to meet with constituents about healthcare #People 4Bombs
to bad YOUR so-called president is too busy spreading FAKE NEWS!!
MY full statement on Sen Gardner: gutless Trump Sycophant Senator doesn't like North Korea, ambivalent to treason. The End.
looking for leadership from Trump? Good one! His admin is a dumpster fire. Any tweet on that? 80210. Unpaid.
might as well issue a statement against pedophiles! how about real courage and stand against 45's treason! #Trumprussia
Good for you!
Well, I'd like a full briefing outlining the actions it will take to stop the madman in Washington, D.C.  From 80127.
@realDonaldTrump Great statement!! Too bad @POTUS is too busy tweeting big, fat, orange lies. DO SOMETHING! INVESTIGATE!!
full statement on NK? We would settle for partial statements on Sessions/wiretap slander/Russian ties to 45's campaign/ etc.
NK shoots a few missiles and you're compelled to respond, Russia subverts our democracy you're mute? pathetic! #Trumprussia

what 'new' sanctions do you want to impose? No state other than China deals with DPRK. Are you wanting to sanction China?
it is more important to first stop the madman in our White House.
be careful with the mad man in the White House. Constituents before party.
how about a Pueblo Town hall meeting??? #DoYourJob #investigatetrump #TownHall #TownHallMeetingPueblo
.  What are you doing to stop madmen in the WH? Bannons destructive agenda? Haven't heard a word from you rants on Twitter
i'm sure the north koreans are quaking in their boots after reading this. now: what about a real town hall?
If it's not reported in breitbart, it is fake news.  Our Donnie is cuckoo.
how about your statement on calling for investigation into #TrumpRussia? Or unprecedented delusional tweets?
Before that can be done, we must get to the bottom of whether Russia interfered w/ our election. NK may be taking advantage of our probs.
I suspect @POTUS will send them a mean tweet. That's all he seems to be good at. Well, that and lying. #nomandate #fraud
anything relevant to anything in your own country? Your own state?
Yeah, no #townhall meetings just a peak outside your #Denver downtown window #novote #GOP=Trump
Interesting that one of our Senators is breaking this news and not the President.  He's too busy tweeting about nonsense.
maybe @POTUS shouldn't offend all our allies.And realize hubris doesn't equal respect. Be a sane voice for R's please
How about the madman in the White House? 45 makes unfounded claim to divert attention from the real issue: his ties to Russia. Investigate!
Our president is ignoring a real crisis while he tries to promote conspiracy theories to distract from Russia connections.
Tough position to be in when your president is half nuts
How about a statement on Sessions, or @realDonaldTrump's infantile accusations? Or deVos $, or a townhall? ANYTHING? #coward
you think you want to stand up to North Korea, but you can’t stand up to your own constituents?  Wuss move, Cory.
isn't it interesting that now out of a sudden the other little man ist starting to act weird. So much for .........
What about Trump's crazy early morning tweet storm?
And any comments about @POTUS complaining of being wire tapped? Seems like a big deal. Might want to look into it.
nah. Got important busy person productive meetings to do and photos of me and two people to take.
you're asking for a madman to stop a madman.  That's how we get wars. #TrumpRussia @GardnerTownHall

This is h*ckin great! Ty
