Then he flew to the Philippines to meet with a murderous dictator.
You should read a book.
This Colorado Vet wants to know why you are letting this flag fly  at out White House? Are you an American?

If you love veterans so much, PROTECT THEIR HEALTHCARE.

They're not cannon fodder you can kill when they return.
The bloated $4.1 TRILLION budget is an infringement on our liberty. Government is not Daddy. #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom

They made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could have a democracy, where our reps hold real town halls and listen to their constituents
And listening to your constituents does not mean rubber stamping unqualified nominees for this administration
Hey don't worry!

@SenCoryGardner now supports murdering dictators. Yay 

He's an upstanding guy, isn't he Cory?

Today I am reminded that you are shaking hands with a brutal dictator who murders his own people.
That's disgusting.
EPA & BLM are not a good steward of your lands in CO! It's time to defund useless overreaching programs. #UnitedForFreedom!
Time for you to man up as we combat veterans did. Country first, remove Trump before irreparable harm is done.
Just saw the Denver post article showing you and Dutarte shaking hands. Why is that not on your twitter???
As U.S. backs away from climate pledges, India and China step up!
Did I read somewhere that you were meeting with PM of the Philipines #Dutuerte the dictatorial leader of the philipines?  Surely not!
And on May 31, you shake hands with a mass murderer of his own people, Duarte.
And yet you meet with the murderer Duterte? Have you no shame at all? #resist
I support you Senator, but it is time for the party to support our President. Your majority depends on it.
Trump is a disgrace and all Cory does is follow him. Disgusting.
If you ever see POTUS thank him for whistle blower EO better than any pay raise. No one should not be able to be fired
来台湾访问啦？兄弟？
China-US relations will be closely related to the development of the world. I hope your words and deeds do not add to the trouble
Your recent meeting with Taiwanese leaders is a very dangerous decision. Your actions may create a small problem between China and the US.

Fuck you, Cory Gardner. You're supposed to represent Coloradans, and you don't. I can't wait til 2020.
you serve one day in the military?
Where's Cory?
to help our military we will do a hiring freeze, so enlisted who use onbase child care are screwed over.  GOP does not care
When will you remember us, who are about to lose affordable health coverage and be banned for preexisting?
CO war vets are rolling in their graves over the way you shame your constituents and your country by selling your votes. #DeVos #2020
Your tweet today is arguably the most brazen empty platitude you've given us to date. You are pure money/party over country. #2020
They died for their country. You and your GOP cronies put money over country. Shame on you. Hindsight is #2020.
This video is out of focus, just like you are with your support for 45's reckless foreign policy. Future wars. More deaths. Your hands.
Brave men and women fought and died for liberty and justice for ALL. This idea is lost by today's Republicans - including YOU. Shameful.
Yes, we are. Including the men who were murdered and injured recently while defending 2 young Muslim women - for democracy.
Thanks for all you do Cory. *Pic Honoring Sgt. & US Federal Judge H A Mentz, Jr. in Austria 1945, Bronze Star Battle of Bulge.
yes, they were brave. they faced bullets. you won't even face your own constituents, craven cory. REAL TOWN HALL! at red rocks.
Yet you "honor" them by voting 95% with a man who squanders what their sacrifice gained. Stop him and save #NATO and save our republic.
Are you willing to sacrifice your career to investigate Trump's ties to Russia?
Yes and they didn't fight and die to have our country sold off to RU entities& secrets revealed in the Oval Office
I am reminded of cowardly politicians who post for political gain on Memorial Day.
But you'll make a great game show host in #2020
best thing you can do for future/current/past veterans is to stop making more...
#nomorewar
Cont to borrow the valor of our warriors for a photo op, while disrespecting their memories and sacrifices with your policies? Shameful.
You are a poor excuse for a Republican. Republicans used to treasure our European alliances.
Honestly, I wonder when Germany will stop manufacturing in the US, and other nations start pulling their troops back from the Mid.East.
If you really support the military why would you support trump? His reckless actions are putting them in harms way. How about a town hall?
Don't let our country be destroyed by folks who prefer dictators over allies.
While others sit back, vote party before country and enjoy the full health benefits of public office.
If you really feel that way, then back them and stop cutting funding for them, be a real man, not a party hack
The sacrifice was for freedom@and liberty - something your party is all too willing to give up now.
It's time you sacrificed for the people that pay you and show up in person instead of continuing to hide. You appear weak.
You only care about the fetus unborn, and the soldier dead..
That's not true. He also cares about where the BLM office is and the ability to spew methane over it public lands, along with photo ops.
True.. let's face it, Gardner really sucks as a human being.
Yet here you stand, backing policy to close their clinics, cut their benefits, and pretend they didn't come home alive.
U, Senator Gardner, disrespect every one of them by ignoring Russian attack on our democracy. Time 2 sacrifice party 4 country #MemorialDay
What attack?
Well said.  Too bad you shame them with your lack of leadership and promotion of horrible policies.
#resign
#lasttermcory
#gopfraudster
Including 3 men in OR who stood up to bigotry. 2 paid with their life. They are heros. This President hasn't said a word. He is a zero.
In fairness, the President did condemn this terrorist act. But used his POTUS handle... A clear sign to his racist base.
thanks Cory.. pls speak out about the rape, murder of Europe caused by refugees caused by all of the dishonorable wars in the M.E.
