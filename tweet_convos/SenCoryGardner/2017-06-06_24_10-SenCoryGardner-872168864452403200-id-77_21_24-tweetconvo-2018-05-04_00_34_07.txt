Cory, this is your daily reminder that if you vote to take away Healthcare from millions, you are politically dead come 2020 in CO....
Wish that @SenCoryGardner listened to his constituents? So do we. Follow @indivisibleden: if we band together our voices *will* be heard.

We'll be thrilled when you get recalled or votes out of office.

We literally loathe you, Cory.
You really don't understand that "from Colorado" doesn't by default mean good for Colorado or the nation as a whole.
For example Senator, you're "from" Colorado but haven't been good FOR Colorado, in the House OR the Senate. #2020

Colorado needs to join the US Climate Alliance. Climate change is real and our obligations under the Paris Accord are obvious.
Big job growth is in green energy - that's a thriving industry. Fossil fuel is a dying industry. Get with the program, Cory!
Resign
You are thrilled for some reason while @SenBennetCO is holding three town hall meetings and you are ... Where?

"Will there be a hearing on the health care proposal?" Senator @clairecmc asked today in the Finance Cmte. You should watch: #Trumpcare 
another one how much money did you take for this vote?  Betty DeVose vote was $52,000
Cory voted against Colorado in favor of Anadarko, Noble & fossil fuels... Shameful
We count on Cory Gardner to support oil gas and other fatal fossil fuels thanks to contributions from Anadarko and other oils
You're a joke. #Resign
I sure miss Mark Udall.
Nice fake picture in the background. Maybe get out more
Thrilled about #cronyCapitalism! Faux public servant, faux enviro backdrop, espousing faux enviro values #fauxNews #conflictsOfInterest #GOP
Which by-the-by, this guy is a nightmare for everyone but oil. But you dont care cuz thats just more money in your pocket, right? *winkwink*
These replies tho

We should not have to be wondering Day in and day out if you have the backs of US citizens with #AHCA by voting it down
I'll be thrilled when you no longer have the opportunity to represent CO.
#CoryGardnerMustGo
Let's hope Coloradans vote @coreygardner out of congress. I'd never vote for him again. He's backed Trump way too much for my liking!
Why dont you meet with the people you're "representing" and see how they feel? #2020
So are you gonna hold a public town hall at any point during your term er what?
Are you from Colorado Cory? We never see you.  But we see you in DC kissing Trump's ass at every opportunity. #TrumpsPuppet
Is he going to sell our public lands out from under us?  That's the reputation that the Republican party has.
Where's Cory
Why would you recommend anyone in Trump's cabinet.  Their career will be ruined!  Shame on you!!!!
Kinda hard to do when we're not even part of the Paris Accord
I'm not thrilled at your plans to strip 23 million of their health insurance.
Interesting how you follow Trump's lead. Only communicate via Twitter. You should hold a mtg with your constituents, a**hole!
#WeWillReplaceYou
You're joking. Right?

Why do you think that a person who's represented energy companies his entire career will suddenly turn around and treat them even-handedly?
It's not news that you support this corruption of govt oversight when your 2014 campaign had 2nd highest funding from petro-$, after Boehner

Highly smart & able guy.Last time I saw David was 22 yrs ago when we broke bread & cracked crab legs at Fred's on US 29 in Silver Spring MD.
Corey Gardner=The only Colorado MOC who has not held a town hall #wherescory #corythecoward #copolitics
Now if only you and GOP get off your arse and support Trump

Duarte is thrilled too!
Cory, what's in the Senate AHCA? And why are you not willing to discuss it with your constituents? If you recall, you work for us.
You're so gross.

I will be thrilled when you're out of office and Colorado has some real representation.

Bye

2020
I remain un thrilled but not surprised at your lack of responsiveness: your position on affordable coverage for preexisting for CO
Please don't assume to understand Colorado values if you won't meet with Colorado citizens.  It's cheep and tacky
Your political choices are highly disappointing. Another lobbyist, another rubber stamp on the Trump administration.
Why do you support a president who moves money meant for children's cancer work to his own business? @Forbes
U r thrilled u dont have to do anything
Vehemently disagree with you; Bernhardt is a gift to oil & gas and will not protect the public interest
Great. Another lobbyist trying to undermine environmental protections. What a sham.
Why are you so afraid of your constituents?
Unbelievable anyone would willingly join this administration. A career-limiting move.
Speaking of career-limiting, how is that Cory Gardner authored healthcare repeal law coming along?

Hey Cory, why don't you meet with your constituents face o face?

Has lobbied for gas & oil. His answer to question on climate change/science thoroughly unconvincing. Nope, not thrilled.
And the fact that an energy committee is tasked with confirming DOI secretaries scares me.
I'll be thrilled when you're up for reelection. At this point I don't trust anything you're thrilled about.
As thrilled as you were to meet with DUTERTE over constituents?
