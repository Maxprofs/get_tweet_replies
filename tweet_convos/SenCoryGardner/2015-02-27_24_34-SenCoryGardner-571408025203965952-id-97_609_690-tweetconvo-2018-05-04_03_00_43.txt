@SenCoryGardner @KeithTheCarver @netanyahu America WELCOMES the Prime Minister with open arms. GOD BLESS ISRAEL!
@SenCoryGardner @netanyahu of course you are. Standing with Israel is not the point. Dissing the President is the real point.
@snowman @SenCoryGardner @netanyahu Barak HUSSEIN Obama is soooo easy to dissent with.
@SenCoryGardner @ScarlettDear1 @netanyahu I stand with Israel Everyday
@SenCoryGardner @Plmyers @netanyahu standing w/ Bibi and Israel.
@SenCoryGardner @WayneBogda @netanyahu I hope he tells it all to us and doesn't get sensored
@SenCoryGardner @WayneBogda @netanyahu does anyone have the time when the address is scheduled for?
@SenCoryGardner @netanyahu I think you should be standing with Colorado, NOT Israel, an Apartheid State.
@SenCoryGardner @WayneBogda @netanyahu it will be the first time a real leader spoke in congress in 7 years
@SenCoryGardner @WayneBogda @netanyahu As is the majority of Americans, who trust Bibi's leadership more than the Prez's.
@SenCoryGardner @WayneBogda @netanyahu You'll hear exactly what he hates to hear from Iran! Do you think Iran has a right to defend itself!

@SenCoryGardner @seanhannity @netanyahu Where is all the support for Israel on Twitter?Stand with Israel
@SenCoryGardner @seanhannity yes we are the proud nation that turned away the transatlantic liner St. Louis. Now we persecute Moslems.
@SenCoryGardner @netanyahu figures you'd stand with Zionist child bombing pigs
@Sawulll @SenCoryGardner @netanyahu You're a complete moron. Go move to Iran and see how wonderful they are.
@whatAworld1234 @SenCoryGardner @netanyahu what does Iran have anything to do with Israel's subjugation of the Palestinian people?
@Sawulll @SenCoryGardner @netanyahu they're trying to protect themselves from being OBLITERATED from the psycho Palestinians and Iranians!!
@whatAworld1234 spare me your Zionist sob story. Any time you land-grab and deny human autonomy to anyone you'll be met with violence
@whatAworld1234 and Iran has nothing to do with Israel's crimes in Gaza so it's disingenuous to even bring that up
@Sawulll Israel is God's chosen nation, like it or not.
@whatAworld1234 typical Zionist scum, rather than face the truth about your war crimes you insult and block #coward
@SenCoryGardner @netanyahu --> he's a monster who continues to commit crimes against humanity. He should be arrested!
@tdhump @SenCoryGardner @netanyahu Hes a war criminal. Hope iran gets its nuke so israel can learn to respect its neighbors.
@1939dani exactly!
@SenCoryGardner @seanhannity @netanyahu I hope he spells out what Obama hasn't been able to!

@SenCoryGardner @netanyahu If you believe that israel has a right to claim ancient lands then you must agree to giveback #StolenNativeLands
