Imagine, Senator Gardner, that you had the misfortune to be stricken with a life threatening illness. 1
Under the plan you are considering, your family would then face the choice: 2
Treat your illness at the cost of total financial ruin, or? The question mark is there because, cruelly, the bill has no answer. 3
This is a barbaric approach, especially from the country with largest bounty of resources in human history. 4
There will b probs with any new healthcare plan but Obamacare needs fixing and Medicaid needs limits.

Dear #corythecreep , Thanks for creating sneaky tax shelter for the rich in new nasty healthcare bill. Sincerely, your wealthy masters.
Trying to divert from your horrible health care bill
Focus on the bigger threat to our state: #Trumpcare. #VoteNo on this bill that is too awful to even wait for CBO to score. #KeepKidsCovered
And moving forward on such a major vote without a CBO score is a threat to our democratic process. As is handing slush fund to @SecPriceMD
Colorado has a senate seat filled by a champion for the rich, a supporter of a treasonous admin and he who is too cowardly to face his peeps

Still not true https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-called-democratic-voters-stupid/ …

Vote no on bcra
Congress seems to have arrived at a new level of dysfunction. Plz stay in DC till confirmations, tax cuts & budget done, wall funded.
Senator, Trump is tearing apart the fabric of our democracy & you do little to nothing but hide from your constituents. Why?
Repeal obamacare. Cut taxes. Cut spending.
Please insist that the bill gets a CBO score and allows for discussion before a vote.
how about informing the people you represent that you're going to vote no. #voteno #YouRepresentMe #colorado
Trying to get thru to you. Line has me on hold for 35 minutes now regarding health care. Will u vote with Mcconnell? Hope not!!!
Wondering why you ignore queries on healthcare and environment? CO wants to hear what u will do to protect our health & natural resources



Part 2 on the amended plan
Getting more analysis on Trumpcare revisions in Senate bill now.

Doing a press call & then will tweet what I've learned. 1
Good thread on the amended plan. No CBO--no vote
1. The Senate Trumpcare bill amendment was just released & it went from very bad to unworkably bad. First analysis.

Please try and be a good human, #NoTrumpCare
Stand up for those in Colorado who are fighting for their lives. Coloradans deserve good healthcare and responsive representatives.
Another critical issue is healthcare #healthcare
As a result, people will become seriously ill & others will die out of fear from horrible #BCRA Senator you're complicit if you support it
Cory, waiting for your tweet on the new Healthcare proposal. Oh yeah, I forgot, you never tweet about things that actually matter. One term.
Through discussions w/ CO constituents, learning many are NOT seeking medical attn for fear of having new pre-existing cond. added to charts
You seem to have a hearing problem to address what constituents have ?s about. Clearly the salary WE pay you = nothing to your corp donors

This is what it looks like for Senators to make statements sharing opinions & concerns on Health Care Bill(s).
So you've exempted yourself from the BCRA, huh? You're such a brave, bold, & principled leader! https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2017/7/13/15966034/senate-republicans-exemption …
more bland pabulum from craven cory. REAL TOWN HALL at red rocks! vote no on bcra! fix the aca! quit hiding from your constituents!
Senator, you're either blind or ignorant if you're missing what people want to hear from you: make your stance clear or leave represenation
PLEASE do the right thing for America and Colorado. PLEASE Vote NO on the ACA Repeal bill. PLEASE !!  #VoteNoBCRA
But where do you stand on #BCRA ? #VoteNoBCRA #NoTrumpCare
GOP = DEATH PANEL
Senator, your COSprings constituents set up a Town Hall for you! 8/24 6pm @ Library 21C. You're invited! Just show up! Constituents too!
Priorities!Your constituents MOST care about their healthcare!Per @TopherSpiro  Here's the consumer protections the Cruz amendment wipes out
those phantom jobs are not more important than healthcare for all
there aren't 10,000 cybersecurity jobs open in the whole of the USA

Employment Change, 2014-24     14,800
I wish this meant you were considering a midterm career change.
Still talking about everything but healthcare and Russian collusion. GROW A SPINE.
Will they have good insurance or will these new hires have to deal with the bill you and your Party proposed today? #trumpcare
.@voxdotcom reporting that Senate has re-inserted Congressional exemption to health bill. Senators protecting themselves, hurting Americans.
Just made 100th call this year to yr COS & DC ofcs. Spoken to real people maybe twice. Hiding from health bill: not a great strategy.
if they get the job will their health insurance be sufficient, fix the ACA - better yet, Medicare for all!
What the Cruz Amendment destroys:
 Here are the consumer protections the Cruz amendment wipes out: 
Healthcare? Town hall?
NJ & CU have patients fly in from around  millions in research money.
Will u fight 2 protect this?
Call 202-224-5941 ask him fight for US!
Please vote no on BCRA
How do you feel about the new health care bill?  Do you feel a vote should be held before the CBO score like @RepKenBuck does?
Taking apart #NetNeautrality will probably take care of those tech jobs. No or slower access will see alot of those jobs go over seas.
CO also has largest # of patients w/ Cystic Fibrosis!
Will you fight for US?
Please vote no on the new health care bill. My life depends on it.
He will, but there are other senators who haven't sold out to the Koch Bros... hang in there!
"Thanks to @9NEWS, @CBSDenver, @DenverChannel, and @KDVR for not holding me responsible as I vote to take health care away from CO" ~Gardner
Colorado will have 10x that many people uninsured if you have your way Cory.
Vote NO!!!!
That's the critical issue? LOL
Colorado also has about 500,000 people who will get royally screwed over by the #Wealthcare bill. And millions of kids hurt by DeVos.
How true that is!! WOW, can you believe what we actually have in the government right now??

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ …
