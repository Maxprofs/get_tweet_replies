McConnell is the most corrupt politician I have seen in decades.
I will do everything in my power to kick you out of office.
How is it you think you are representing "all" Americans with this list of horrors? #YourConstituent not happy
You are kidding me. Since Congress came back, I, #YourConstituent, am ashamed of GOP. Govt out of the way?
you, Sir, must uphold the law of the land and investigate #russian interference in the 2016 election with a Select Committee
independent of traitors
what a corrupt government we have now
Did you vote to get rid of the Ethics Committee tonight? Ethical behavior is our expectation. Explain.
Environmental destruction to benefit the wealthiest Corporations on planet, at our expense.
already trying to gut ethics and hide behind rules, sounds slimy as can be
Did you see what Obama the communist dictator just did to Ford's investment plans?  Oh, wait, I'm ...uh
You're done in 2018. This. Dismantling Ethics committee. Social Security. Medicare...we are watching. We'll be voting. Suicide.
you are both shameless little men
... because EVERYONE knows the Dems want to keep and fix Obamacare - only REPUBS want to repeal...
Colorado voted for @HillaryClinton. Yes, let women manage their own health care & bodies. #YourConstituent
You need to get ahold of yourself. You REPUBS repeal Obamacare, you will reap the whirlwind...!
You threaten your first acts will remove healthcare rights of citizens, + SS Benefits we paid into.
Funny that your "proudest moment" is being a racist obstructionist. Your proud moment will be your families everlating shame.
Yes, a new direction: you eliminate ethics office so you and #Putin have even more power to destroy #democracy. #Nazi!
.Trump is nuts.
Threatening American companies like GM and Boeing now?
Conservatives must move to impeach him.
Yep you will continue your focus on destroying the poor, seniors and middle class

Breaking:I just found Tillerson Holdings-a company based in #Russia-owned by #Trump's Secretary of State nom #trumpleaks #msnbc #cnn #resist 
Nice job by Senator Gardner!
Keep the affordable health care act, Investigate Trump's ties to Russia, have Trump disclose his tax forms
do your damn jobs
@SpeakerRyan Mhmm a pro Trump leader caught lining his pockets;  us in 6 months
... gonna get screwed big time by REPUBS on the ACA issue. Republicans are NOT problem solvers, just whiners!
#DONOTREPEALACA I get HC via Medicaid Expansion. Caregiver for 24 YO daug w/Autism Epilepsy 24/7 care reqd
really all i see y'all doing is grabbing power and obstructing.    shame on y'all.
We expect you to deny any cabinet members who are bad for the Colorado economy.
Sen McC, watch Recess Loophole! POTUS may attempt Garland appointment to SCOTUS!

There needs to be a special hearing about the Russian hacks and Donald Trump needs to testify.
what's up sleestak
so you will kill social security, make sure 20 million people will not have healthcare.
by getting rid of the ethics in congress means you are not held to high standards anymore.
#whatstohide #TheResistance 
Investigate Russia. Americans deserve truth and protection. That is your job!!!!!
You represent all America, yet I find it unbearable to even tweet you. Why do you negate so many. God has no favorites. STOP
Trump knows more than our professional agents? NOT unless he got it from @PutinRF / @Kremlin NO #trumpPUTIN RT
you have no shame
Apparently ethics are the 1st casualty of new Congress? Way to lead, McConnell!
Pelosi statement on GOP gutting Office of Congressional Ethics. Ethics are the first casualty of the new Congress. http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/12172/  
Support Kates Law and 100 percent sup0ort Trump . Happy 2017 MAGA.
#Trump is psychologically unbalanced. Please, stop him before he blows us all up.
@realDonaldTrump Most importantly, a NEW President Trump. Pass his agenda. Approve his cabinet before 1/20!!
You are a traitor. The work of Congress should involve sending you in shackles to a federal prison.
You are a SenateMajorityLeader, you owe it to the people that voted for you, and we are  trusting that you'll do what's right
your in Congress to do good things for all the people - so far you have failed miserably
Its the peoples health care-make it better but DO NOT REPEAL IT, too many people, repubs & dems depend on it!!
It's not Obama care, it's people's care, make it better, don't dismantle or repeal. Shore it up!!!
#whystartnow
And the more you fight an independent investigation into Russian hacks the more guilty you look,
A BAD YEAR, the WORST congress, WRONG direction. Why can't the GOP compromise? In order to make the country better COMPROMISE!
I need directions would be a mass suicide by the GOP they are going to ruin America with Trump
Yes the US people have spoken. 3million more voted for Hillary. Democracy should mean vote by the majority No?
Senators, please don't ruin the country with your hoary, bankrupt ideas.
@HouseGOP Your BetterWay is NOT what the American people voted for.Your extreme plan will backfire politically
in which the new president, congress, & senate will drag our country to hell.
Just as worthless as the people on the other side of you party system. You all serve un-American masters .
New Year: we must take Russia seriously!! They are the enemy!!
I really hope you keep the affordable health act.  Happy new year.
A *NEW* direction? Does that mean you're actually going to do something?!
#SenateMajorityWhiner
#ManofInaction
Saudi Arabia, too, should be held accountable for supporting terrorism. @TeamTrump @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
stupid rhino

.@SenateMajLdr @SenCoryGardner @YouTube I only hope this new direction moves is towards Universal #TermLimits
Saudi Arabia, too, should be held accountable for supporting terrorism. #copolitics #Senate @SenBennetCO

@2tammytodd @SenCoryGardner @YouTube traitor
We will come together to work with Dump the way you were willing to work with President Obama.
Senator, you took an 8 year rest, now get to work.  Don't  cry if Dem's do as you did.
How about confirming Merrick Garland?  How about investigating comrade @realDonaldTrump?  Burn more coal?
We, Americans, want a bolder & effective congress that dares to support BIG PROGRAMS TO #MAGA
Yes we will be expecting some affordable insurance. Ball in your court.
traitor
THIS NEW CONGRESS IS COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT JUST AS THIS NEW SO-CALLED LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. WE'RE FUCKED.
IT IS UNFATHOMABLE TO THINK THAT WE STARTED WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON AND NOW WE HAVE DONALD TRUMP.  WE'RE DOA.
Voters expect you to work with not against @realDonaldTrump. Say it & do it!
A new year, a new congress, and a new direction. @SenCoryGardner explains in this week's #GOP address. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSw_GUq6ato â€¦
Trump is praising Putin!! KGB Putin..... This is a crossroads moment -2017
U hav been put on notice Senator; MAGA or move on.
New year, new congress, SAME OLD FAILED DIRECTION you mean?

#FuckTrump Leave SS, Medicare, Medicaid and ACA alone. You should be tried for treason.
