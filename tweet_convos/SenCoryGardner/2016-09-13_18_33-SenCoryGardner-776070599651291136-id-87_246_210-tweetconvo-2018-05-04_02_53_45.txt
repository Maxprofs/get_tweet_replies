THIS is another lie by Repubs. IT'S why you have the liar in chief as your leader. When will you learn, these tactics don't work?

um but congress pays the bills…
@genuke1 
We The People,the American citizens,are so done with you politicians,both Dem & GOP. There will be a reckoning!

#bahrain : yet another Obama disaster! USA deserves better.
You do realize after decades of litigation the Shah's money US owed had to be returned: Iran Deal or not;hostage return or not
Another lie. Separate budgets.
use funding our troops as an opportunity to criticize & divide us instead of working together as Americans. Pathetic party.

That is probably the dumbest thing I have ever heard by a sitting US senator.
lies, lies and more lies.  He paid Iran back THEIR OWN money. Why do you rethuglicants tell so many lies?
How do we know even if this money went to Iran or some gangsters ? Did they get a receipt? Can the US people see this receipt?
its *uck up. But that's how obamas America works. Screw our vets, screw Americans. 
Spend it like its not yours.
he cares about the power his political correctness has put a Stranglehold on our very first amendment
1.7 billion given to Iran is beyond disgusting. Is that why Obama said no raise to our deserving military? Obama sucks.
I really don't want to hear your sob story on this. Where the fuck have you been all year? How was Obama able to pull this off?!
UNBELIEVABLE! TRAITORS!
-Of course Obama will pay the Islamic terrorists first, that is what he has been doing all along.

2/2 outlet.
We owed Iran longer. Also Congress has been neglecting troops and vets for years.
