I missed any effort by you to protect 400,000 Coloradans on Medicaid expansion.
@SenCoryGardner, this bill is heartless, and thrown together halfhazardly. Vote NO! #GrahamCassidy #HealthCareDebate #rightsideofhistory
@realDonaldTrump sabre rattling is making things worse.  Enjoy Randy telling it as it is:
@SenCoryGardner, this bill is heartless, and thrown together halfhazardly. Vote NO! #GrahamCassidy #HealthCareDebate #rightsideofhistory

Be sure to read this article about how Susan Collins decided to vote against #grahamcassidy. https://goo.gl/x6j6eU  #VoteNo
Be sure to read this piece about when @SenCoryGardner tried to revoke Hillary Clinton's clearance b/c of emails. Where's the bill for Jared?


Lol if you want to take credit for 's North Korea policy go right ahead


No talking about your involvement in this healthcare bill huh? You should see the writing on the wall, even your Republican friends See it!

Well I'm certain POTUS will handle this with all the grace and nuance that he displayed with the NFL players. What could go wrong?
How's it working out for you Corey?
You clown.
When are we gonna read about your work on healthcare?  Or at least what's in the bill....

How about you read the CBO report for the latest #trumpcare bill?



@POTUS And don't forget there is no record of anyone in the Chumps Family background as ever serving in the Military. Their all COWARDS!
War Pigs

You stink

Why won’t you discuss #GrahamCasiddy ?
How about voting no #GrahamCasiddy.
COLORADO WANTS #MEDICAREFORALL
Why RU more concerned with North Korea than with lives of citizens of State of Colorado who you swore an oath to serve? #GrahamCassidyBill
Where's Cory do you not get that as long as you don't support your constituents we don't listen or support you?
Senator, first you need to tell Trump to shut the hell up about N Korea and then you need to stop threatening N Korea.
In case you missed it,  vote no on GrahamCassidy.
A Noble country takes care of its people when they are the most vulnerable!!! Period!  Medicare for all! SHAME ON YOU TO REPEAL THE ACA!!!
How about going to bat for Coloradans. U support #GrahamCassidy. U don't care about the people who voted 4 u. U fall in line like a 
Your solution is name calling Kim Jong Un" the Forgotten Maniac.” ala Trump. World is more dangerous b/c of middle school antics like this
Stick to your core competencies: raising money from billionaires & lying
ICYMI: my son (your constituent) is 9 yrs old, and lives with Down syndrome. Pls protect his LIFE. Oppose the vicious Graham Cassidy bill.
ICYMI: we want you to vote NO on #CassidyGraham
He finally responded to me. It was in my spam folder...even outlook knew his response was unacceptable. My fav is the key terms he uses.
Like "failed ACA". 
I do what I can. 
#one term senator #take health care from the poor# tax breaks for the rich
Nuclear war is serious. 
& so is our healthcare. Kill this abysmal bill. #NoOnGrahamCassidy
#ACASignups UTTER DEVASTATION: Updated to include @avalerehealth estimates of per capita impact: http://acasignups.net/17/09/25/update-graham-cassidy-20-bullsht-piles-so-fast-you-need-wings-stay-above-it … #GrahamCassidy 2.0 
It takes an extraordinary act of white male hubris to make a nuclear showdown with DPRK all about yourself.
Could you just focus on getting "good" healthcare coverage for your state, a bi-partisan tax overhaul or infrastructure bill thru ?
Shame on you and the GOP for trying to kill 23 million Americans
Cory is more worried about his donors than the people of Colorado
What about healthcare? Take a stand!
Are your staffers letting the phones go to voicemail? NO ON #GrahamCassidy DEATHCARE.
If you're not getting Colorado more money then vote no #GrahamCassidyBill
You pledged to protect Medicaid expansion. Now keep your word ... vote NO on Graham Cassidy! Be a hero like Sen McCain You work for Colorado
Where's Colorado's extra money in the latest healthcare bill? How come Alaska and other states get extra but not Colorado? Vote NO!!
Sorry. Busy reading about your angst with donors and your -donors, personal $ and Party over the people of #Colorado-stance.
Maybe you can get a handle on our dotted president! I'd really like it if he'd not get us into war with North Korea!
So what page of your "playbook" caused NK to interpret his words as a declaration of war? You're full of something, but it ain't peace
Does the article state that you’re a freshman senator with no brain, no power, and you were put in office by the Koch brothers?
This is great but we also need you to represent us for healthcare. Please vote against this bill and work on a bipartisan solution. #fixACA
Thank you. Now please vote NO on Graham-Cassidy. Fix the ACA, don't replace it.
Be sure to read the transcript from Face the Nation to see how much you lie to Colorado voters.
Shameful how the ADAPT protestors are being arrested at hearing. Vote no on Graham-Cassidy and show you care for CO not "furious donors"
TLDR. How about just take away @realDonaldTrump’s cell phone and have someone with a brain approve his tweets?
Instead of negotiating for #Colorado he is allowing the #GOP to take our tax dollars and give them to TX, SC
Other republicans who knew that they were getting a bad deal for their state negotiated a better deal but not @SenCoryGardner
Cory's loyalty is Party, then country, then Colorado.
@SenCoryGardner refuses to make comments about #GrahamCasiddy
Great. Now focus on healthcare for Colorado. Bi-partisan. Involving your constituents.
Unless you propose 2 censure @POTUS & stop him from provoking war on Twitter, not interested.  Still waiting for 'more info' on healthcare?
Vote AGAINST Graham/Cassidy!
Which is never going to happen, unlike ripping healthcare away from millions - which might.
Tell Trump to be quiet, then vote against GC 2.0.
"Please stop calling my office about health care.  I don't give a shit about you, and need to make my rich donors happy." ~ Cory Gardner
Hand over the nukes, get on diet, exercise, learn to play the piano, and let us video monitor you 24/7.  Sign here now open your border.Done
It might help if you could convince that fat buffoon to shut up. Have you ever considered speaking out against him... or are you complicit?
Vote NO on G-C. It's sort of important not to deny Healthcare to your CO Constituents.  Your silence on HC speaks volumes. Appalling
Wish you worked for Colorado citizens as much as you work for dotard Donny and N.K. 
#conmancory
We are watching your actions on Graham -Cassidy with more interest. What's your big Plan for those you are supposed to represent!?
How about you do your job and end Obamacare
ICYMI CORY-most folks in Colorado think YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!
Whatever you are trying to do, Trump not helping; poking the bear every chance he gets. Impress me. Speak out about diarrhea of tweets!
Does this summarize your health care plan, Cory?
The people will not be allowed to interfere with donor profits.
Tell @SenCoryGardner a Yes on #GrahamCassidy will NOT bode well for his reelection.
(When I called Denver not accepting VM; FtC and DC were)
I wish you cared about protecting the lives of your constituents as much as you care about what happens in DPRK. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
Easy solution to our problem.
#impeachtrump
Get busy.
Maybe having an ambassador to South Korea would help- someone who can try some diplomacy and not resort to school boy taunts?
No, creep. It's actually an exposé on how you're distracting constituents from your secret work to whip Senate votes to destroy healthcare.
UNLESS the article advocates, at min, taking away Trump's Twitter acct, gagging him or impeaching him, the article is on no interest.
So what? What #Colorado & the nation will remember is how you voted to repeal the #ACA & take healthcare from those who need it most.
Can someone please explain to Kim Jung-Un that:

1) Donald Trump is not our "REAL" President
2)  A Twitter war is not a "REAL" war

Thanks,
Wow
Please....remember You FAILED on ACA with the the 51(R)s.  International crises is WAY beyond your shallow depth
Cory. You're dumb. Let Mattis handle NK. You need to stop w/ the bullshit and vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill

This is Colleen of ADAPT.

I have no idea what this country is supposed to be 
45 has no policy on NK, or anything else.    His habit of tweeting angry insults at world leaders is bringing us to the brink of war.  
p.s. how about letting some real diplomats with experience lead on this issue, since you clearly have no clue what you're doing.
We want you to vote against the Graham-Cassidy bill
Somehow dying from a nuke is preferable over dying slowly without insurance.
U have some real nerve posting this right now, while yr @GOP colleagues have #ADAPTandRESIST protesters arrested in health care hearing.
Arresting people in wheelchairs is what Gardner is best at. It sure isn't doing the will of his constituents or governing in any way.
We clearly need to feel ashamed for him, since he's obviously forgotten what it's like to have a conscience.
He spends all his time representing his donors from out of state as well as the rotted to the core GOP. Morally bankrupt and reprehensible.
I read the New York Times piece about you that said you’re more concerned about donors than your voters. See my pinned tweet
What’s your playbook for ensuring all Coloradoans have accessible, afforadable healthcare?
It's all for naught while we have this loose cannon of a president.  GOP, help preserve our country. #ImpeachTrump
#GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE.
