A few tour groups were visiting the @WhiteHouse earlier today, and I stopped by to say hello! Enjoy your visit to D.C! #MeetTheVP 
You are as unamerican as isis mr. Gardner! #adiosIN18
Way to go comrade!!!!! Russian terrorist you are Mr. Gardner #adiosIN18
You would be well advised to make plans for YOUR LIFE AFTER POLITICS because your unavailability to constituents is a powerful force!
Pence-1, Gardner-0
Well since Pence is a Zero... Cory has to be Sub-Zero. #ColoradoDeservesBetter #GardnerHasToGo
That is great!  So WHY don't you follow suit and HAVE A TOWN HALL MEETING? 2018 is just around the corner....
what an embarsement for these school kids to have to meet with russian traitors while visting the white house
Harvard disagrees with your party lines @SenCoryGardner https://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/articles/faculty-react-to-trump-on-climate-agreement?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=hks-facebook&utm_source=facebook …
This INFURIATES me
Thanks, Cory, for taking time to play patty cake with a brutal dictator.
Seems he is meeting with the public more than you are willing to do. How about a legitimate #TownHall? Are you too #scared of voters? #Out20
Lets get this straight. You got time to meet Duterte, from another hemisphere, but no time to meet constituents.
#CoryGardnerMustGo
#loser
You won't be representing colorado next term.
Where's Cory?
At least someone acknowledges @SenCoryGardner's constituents.
So it was bring a fascist to school day in Yuma?
Did he explain why the American Republicans are the only political party in the world who somehow think #climatechange is up for debate?
It's fascinating that you only seem to have time to meet with people who didn't vote for you.
Oh, he'll meet with anyone. It'll cost you ... at least 1 comma & 5 zeros. Cory don't come cheap! #ColoradoDeservesBetter #GardnerHasToGo
Did he take away their school funding & their lunches, while they died from lack of insurance?
No, I think he took away their Health Insurance,  while they died of hunger.
What? He went to a PUBLIC SCHOOL to speak? The thing that Betsy DeVos wants to eliminate?  I hope you see the irony in this.
Rhino @SenCoryGardner won't stand with @POTUS or America on issues but will gladly pose for positive press with @VP at any opportunity.
Please start standing up for your country!!!
If you really cared about children you would support sound health care & environmental policies, not short sighted policies based on greed.
Stop being a worthless Trump lapdog and use your brain. Hold an in person town hall and listen to your constituents. You would learn a lot.
You're kidding right? When will you stand up for America?
I hope they asked @VP some questions about this pesky climate change issue that's got liberals in a snit. I'm sure they could school Pence.
Is @VP the Jesus-loving guy who was caught using campaign funds to pay his personal expenses, and denies a smoking/cancer link?
You sure that's someone who should be around impressionable kids?
I don't want Pence anywhere near my kids. He's a liar and a snake.
Super
Thanks... @SenCoryGardner ... for meeting with your constituents???
Did you associate with more murderers today?
While you're smiling and shaking hands with the tyrant Duterte, he is busy murdering his countrymen.  That's a great look Cory!
But he loves Manny Pacquiao.
Why bother? By the time they're adults, it will be too late to turn back climate change, and restore trade with our allies (if any are left)
We are so sick of you!
Cory when will u standup for Country over party! Why do u support this Presidency which is destroying our county? #resist  @POTUS of hate
@SenCoryGardner did he mention the policies that will hurt their public school? 11/3/20
#WeWillReplaceYou
You're a sell out @SenCoryGardner and an embarrassment to the people of Colorado.
what about you taking time out to meet with your constituents please? #whereiscory
Dear god. Were there counselors on hand? Exposing children -- children! -- to such horrors is just cruelty. What was the WH staff thinking?
Corey still carrying water for this Trumpshit repugnant party soooo did you get any of that Putin money? Sad
That's what you got? How about something on Paris? Russia?
Omg I hope he didn't tell them anything stupid like don't read or learn science
I hope they gave him an earful of why they are concerned about climate change and how he is personally impoverishing their future potential.
were ya'll surprised they still learn science?
2020
Did you tell them to hug a teacher who just might be lesbian -- like the students?  like me??   We're everywhere and Pence will not stop us!
I wonder if @VP made time to explain why working with others to protect clean air and water isn't important.
Hopefully the students were able to educate Pence on the science and consequences of climate change!!  Sad.
Where are your town halls?
Did you explain how @BetsyDeVosED, whom you helped confirm, is going to defund all public schools including theirs?
That's your topic for today?
Jesus, is Pence back in CO again... He spoke 100 yards from my desk and I didn't bother to check it out...
"I proudly stand with anti-science nut Trump and mass murderer Bashar al-Assad of Syria in denying climate change"~Trump Sycophant,C.Gardner
Your last term!
I wonder who he will talk to when climate change destroys our planet?
Did you guys tell them to enjoy their middle school years because the GOP will have the planet mostly destroyed by the time they're grown
How cool for them !
Yes, thank you for telling the students they will not have a planet for their children.
You are complicit in the forfeiture of American leadership. Our allies are mocking and abandoning us while you're silent on climate change.
That’s more that you do when you’re in the state, @SenCoryGardner…
Thanks @VP for making time to talk with the students from Yuma Middle School! https://twitter.com/VP/status/870711766556172289 …
Did the kids ask @VP why he's okay with decimating our planet?
vp is a theocrat pulling policy from a 2k year old myth. Put out real statements on Paris, kushner, healthcare.  shilling for trump
When are you going to take time to have a town hall and hear from your constituents?
Funny you haven't thanked that brutal authoritarian you met with.  Don't even see the vacay photos of you two.  But the denver post had them
Maybe you should be talking to Americans, especially in Colorado, instead of dictators
How about taking some time to meet with your constituents?  We would like to discuss health care.  Will you protect Medicaid or sell out?
We know he's already sold out. Weak leadership at its finest.
I bet middle school students ask more difficult questions than your staffer's do on your tele-conference town halls. 
You back from cozying up to murderous dictators like Duterte?

What's next, Kim Jong Un? Going back in time for Pol Pot?
Hey, nothing like fantasizing about snuggling with Hirohito and Co. to take one's mind off that pesky healthcare nonsense.
You should take the time to talk with your constituents, Cory!
