@SenCoryGardner Please hold in-person town halls. Listen to your constituents. Represent us. You r out of touch, sir. #WheresCory
@GOP voted for FULL REPEAL under Obama.  You knew he would veto! Don't be afraid of TRUMP! #UnitedForFreedom
This is going super well for you
I'll be on the call asking why you won't meet us in person. And how you justify your vote on Wealthcare. #TownhallSham #Bye2020
Will you actually listen to constituents, or is this just a waste of our time?
A women from Western Slooe just gave it to him big time
Crazy idea.. meet your constituents in person!
Why not hold an in person town hall?!
This is a joke. Face your constituents.
Hold a face to face town hall meeting, coward.
What will you do if Trump refuses to make CSR payments as the Constitution requires
When are you going to have a face to face town hall?  Shame on you.
Shame on you @SenCoryGardner  for not providing more notice and failing to do this in person. Colorado voters deserve a face to face session
OK it's going to cut into my @maddow time but I guess I can record the truth and listen to lies live.
#Cardboardcoryco
Can't stand the idea of facing constiuents in person? No problem. There's a Cardboard Cory town hall here tomorrow night.
Please provide call in phone # for #NotATownHall!  What if we get disconnected or auto-dialer misses us? @CardboardCoryCO @indivisiblefrr
The people demand an in person town hall. You work for us.
That would be a great question. 

@SenCoryGardner who do you work for? 

And then listen to him lie.
Listen to him because, you know, he is too gutless to appear in front of his constituents. #CowardlyCory
I have grown weary of you lack of support for Colorado so will miss this one.
Phoning it in doesn't cut the mustard. You need to face your constituents, no matter how much you fear them.
Meet your constituents in person, your telephone townhalls are equivalent to self-felatio. If you can't serve us, you should not have run.
Have a town hall meeting live in person in Denver
Time for FULL REPEAL like you voted for under Obama. The gov has no business being in healthcare. Be the TRUE @GOP! #UnitedForFreedom
That's great your doing this Sen Gardner. Do not hold a in-person t-hall. Everyone knows the loser libs just want to yell at someone.
Why are you so afraid to face "your people" in person? You were entrusted to listen to us and hear our concerns, not hide away in fear.
Your telephone town halls are worthless. Staged. Phony. Fake.
Meet us face to face-LIVE, IN PERSON town hall. What are you afraid of? Shame!
NO! Do it live so you can see our faces.  Hiding from your constituents is cowardly.  Stand up Cory and do the job we hired you for!
T-minus 2 hours until we get a good "Gardnering". 

Screened ?'s. 
No back and forth. 
No answers. 
No engagement.
No accountability. 
Sham.
@SenCoryGardner Telephone conference calls are NOT town halls. Ur constituents want discussions, not lectures. Listen to US. Represent US.
You can't face the people that voted for you
Try meeting with citizens in person #ChickenAss #Coward #Outin2020 #BetrayerofTrust
Why can't you meet in person? Phone town hall, are you afraid to talk face to face?
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! U take ocare TOO! #UnitedforFreedom!
Face us you coward. Look us in the eye and tell us why you hate poor and sick people?
Coward. #yourlastterm
I bet @johnelway regrets endorsing you. You're an establishment coward Cory.
Oh man up and meet your constituents face to face.
Have you even ever listened to your constituents?  You are Colorado's top sell out.
Thanks for the inadequate notice. I have to work, so can't attend.
Lick 's Cory. Your out in 2020.
Afraid to meet his constituents face to face.
In the interests of transparency, please tell us how you choose the questions?
If we register, do we have to declare our income and donations to your campaign? Will that change our chance of being allowed to speak?
Seriously?! You just don't get it do you. Man up @SenCoryGardner and meet your constituents face to face!
2020 can't come soon enough. #byebyecory
Too afraid to go face to face with people who elected you? We will remember in 2021 when you come up for reelection. 4 more years only.
You are so brave! Having a telephone town hall AND voting the party line. Way to represent Colorado, schmuck.
Still doesn't have the guts to meet the people!
Going to let anyone talk ? Wimp have a real one
Now that healthcare has failed you think talking to us is a good idea...?  would have been nice to improve that!
Lame
Pre-Screened Phone Call doth not a Town Hall make, Sir.
Coward.  How about standing up and having a live town hall?
THANKS FOR THE ONE DAY NOTICE! #wherescory
Not in an in person Town Hall in Colorado? You can't get away from Moscow???
#Resign!
A townhall in person, in front of the camera would be much more appealing and meaningful. You've been on the run some time now
You won by <2% in 2014... by not facing your constituents, it doesn't seem like you want to keep your job. #trumpchump #2020 #doyourjob
How about an in person town hall?! I have been part of your call in meetings, no person to person exchange. Stop hiding.  #2020vision
WtF. No notice, what a sham. You are violating your oath of office.
Telephone?
Another town hall where you will not actually see your constituents...you're a real winner Cory. Your time is limited...
Coward
One more question Cory for the #FakeTownHall. Why / how is #medicaid not sustainable?  

@BrandonRittiman @9news http://www.9news.com/mobile/article/news/local/politics/gardner-well-see-if-i-vote-to-repeal-without-replacing/459633455 …
"You must register first so we can filter out the 77% of Coloradoans that think I'm a complete failure" 

COWARD CORY!!!!!!
#OneTermSenator
Be a man and have a real town hall meeting boy. Face the people of Colorado. #trumpspuppet #russianpuppet
Throwing us a bone @SenCoryGardner?
Hey Cory here's another topic for #FakeTownHall. Check and balances vs complicit? Party over country?
The Constitution anticipates a President like this. It does not anticipate a Congress so indifferent to a President like this.
On 7/28/17, @SenCoryGardner voted to STEAL healthcare from MILLIONS of working Americans to give MASSIVE TAX CUTS to the RICH!!!
Chicken!
Coward. Through and through.
These are a farce, a useless waste of time where you answer what you want to.  Let me know when you get serious and quit fooling around.
Doesn't mean anything. #wherescory 80503
You're too much of a snowflake to have a town hall, huh?
Not. Good. Enough. 2020
Why bother? You don't listen to your constituents.
How about a venue where there's opportunity for dialogue and follow up questions, @SenCoryGardner ?
Hey here's another topic. If ObamaCare is fatally flawed what is better alternative you propose?  @LindseyGrahamSC
I agree with  President @realDonaldTrump, Obamacare can't be repaired.  It's fatally flawed.  

It must be replaced.
QUIT BEING A DOOFUS.
2020
You are on break and you can't show up in your own state for an in person? What BS.
This is nothing more than cowardice. Own your cruelty and face your constituents like you actually have a spine.
We deserve a face to face conversation not prescreened questions. What r u afraid of? I will attend with the faint hope for a real dialogue.

A telephone town hall is for cowards who do not want to face their constituents. Why don't you just resign now?
aka Fake Town Halls...
-- no face-to-face connection with Coloradans
-- no authentic, unscripted questions
CowardCowardCowardCowardCoward.....get the picture
A cowardly show of your inability to answer to your constituents. We see you. You are an embarrassment to our state.
All your new friends in GOP leadership aren't going to help you a bit come 2020. Where does your loyalty lie, Senator? #wherescory
Telephone townhall not a real townhall. Colorado wants access to its Senator.
What. A. Coward.     (but we knew that)
Another idea for kick off statement. Pls watch this then talk to us about how funny police brutality jokes are.
Watch until the very end. Good work from @Trevornoah 

https://twitter.com/thedailyshow/status/892378494541365248 …
Too scared to face your constituents.  Some conservative you are.
Meet us in PERSON, coward.
No,no,no. That's not how it works. Let's all meet in person. Come back to Denver and hold a real town hall. Not this phone bs.
Will you be able to talk about healthcare or will you pretend like you don't know anything?
Total waste of time! I've joined 2, you repeat he same vague answers over and over. I want to see you in live and in person!
You're pathetic! Too chicken for regular townhall meetings, & you went  along with the Trumpster & pals, stupid evil healthcare bill!
Phone Town Hall? Find your guts. Face the ones you work for v
.@SenCoryGardner Still hiding from constituents
Meet in person?
An in-person one would be better. Are you aftaid your constituents will fling poo or something? We are housebroken. I promise.
Cowardice is a trait wherein fear and excessive self-concern override doing or saying what is right, good, and of help to others
what a coward. I'm done with your pre-screened telephone performances.
Please have a real town hall. What is wrong with you?????
Not a town hall @SenCoryGardner
Why are you frightened to do this in person?
I just signed up and I want to know why you want to take insurance coverage away from my child born w/pre-existing condition #ProtectOurCare
Last tele townhall 3,000 constituents called in to hear you answer 20 questions, that is not adequate representation!
1) this is a conference call
2) this can't be the only method you're using to hear from Coloradans, right?
3) http://gardnertownhall.com  
#Chickenshit town hall
Telephone town hall? Face your constituents, coward. #copolitics
Thank you Senator for your hard work, looking forward to the discussion
So we have the choice of/access to a tele town hall like he wanted us to have the choice of/access to healthcare we can't afford. Coward.
No thanks! I've heard your lies already. Not interested in hearing them again.
It's just like you to ruin my dinner plans.
.@SenCoryGardner I'm sorry to see you are still too afraid to face your constituents face to face. Phone in town halls are a joke!
You're a disgrace Cory. I trust you know that.
Telephone bahahahahha you are a Cory!!!!!
For opening statement, how about explaining why exactly you want to  de-fund #Medicaid and why you feel that way.
Or any @SenCoryGardner interview. He doesn't get enough credit for pioneering the know-nothing caucus.

#copolitics https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/892488596627873792 …
This is why you will only serve one term. Enjoy it while it lasts! #OneTerm #DoYourJob #WeDeserveBetter
It's not a townhall. Not in a TOWN. I assume you're in the SWAMP LOOP. And NOT in a HALL. Screened telephone call. #CONFERENCEcALL
Lame, sir. Have a real, in-person town hall meeting. This is just embarrassing for an elected official.
I'm referring to you as 1 term Cory from now on
@SenCoryGardner, a "Telephone Town Hall" is an absurd way of connecting with constituents. Don't be shy, do your job!
Where's Corycan't show up in person? Spineless!
Repeat of script from last one - take a sometimes-good question, cut off caller, recite flashcard talking points, no followup allowed.  Lame
Sir, why are you afraid to look your constituents in the eye?
Nice try. These still don't count as real town halls.
How about doing an actual in person Town Hall.
Phoning it in yet again. Will you phone in your reelection campaign? At some point, you will need to face us in person.
Is cardboard cory Gardner going to be on the phone?
You did not back up Jeff Flake. Instead towed the toady line
A Russian-Republican hiding in the Swamp.
Still too scared for face to face town halls I see

I no longer want to hear anything you have to say. I'd rather YOU listen to US! Like in person. 80127
@SenCoryGardner no thanks. Been there - done that. Repeatedly. You don't listen. You schmooz and lie. I'd rather visit a gynecologist.
token sudo town halls will not help, cory...
you sold us out, we will vote you out
single payer now
#singlepayernow
Always with the telephone. Show up, Cory.
Filtering out anyone that disagrees with you ?
Glad you are hacing a town hall, but man up and meet with your citizens!
CORY!! 
hi!
In person, man. 
Let's do it at the Pepsi Center and make it a whole-day thing. It would be fun!
He's chicken. Scared of his constituents holding him accountable. We know he's just a cock holster for @realDonaldTrump
Senator, man up & stop screening these telephone TH meetings. Take the time & explain your platform. Your cowardice sends the wrong message.
Coward! Have a real town hall. What are you hiding from
How about you try a real one. And yes I'm a constituent.

Talk to your constituents! We pay your salary and deserve the chance to see you in person. I'll buy you a beer afterwards! Don't be scared!
Why can't you hold a Real town hall meeting and face your constituents in person? Telephone town halls are chicken shit .......
Can't you face the people like a Man because you know you aren't doing their work and work for the rich........
Grow a pair and face the people in person!!
Hey coward!  When will we see you in PERSON?  Too afraid to get REAL feedback?
I'd rather stick a meat fork in my neck than listen to you take screened calls and lie.
People expect their representatives to have the courage to fight for them. Stop hiding, face your fellow Coloradans. Explain yourself.
When will you hold a real town hall and a reasonable time where you can't prescreen questions, you abysmal coward?
You need to start listening to your constituents. You need to start looking at people/country over party. This is a crucial time to unite.

Telephone town call? Coward.
Chicken shit.
Hiding behind a call screener.  Coward.
This is BS! Hold a town hall in-person.
Oh man I hope you call me. I'd love to hear you defend your despicable healthcare vote.
Weak.   Be a man and look us in the eye.   What are you so ashamed of?
.@SenCoryGardner all we ask is that you meet w/ us in person. You can't have selective hearing as our Senator. @CardboardCoryCO understands.
As does @SenBennetCO
Who's a scaredy widdle swamp monstewr? Hindsight is #2020.
I understand that not all Coloradans can make it to one location. So, either hold an additional, real-life town hall. Or be a chickenshit.
How come I have the feeling the calls have been already picked and staged?  Telephone Town Halls are not an acceptable alternative.
When are you going to have a real town hall? Why are you ducking your constituents? #cowardlyCory
No thanks. Did it once and all you did was spew talking points, no follow ups allowed and generally an infuriating waste of my time.
Such a cop out. We'll be there anyway.
How about in person....  face to face instead?
Everyone knows you're cherry picking questions. This is a sham, like when you said republicans would hold public hearings on healthcare.
Sen. Coward, how about meeting ur constituents face-2-face? U have plenty to answer 4 & ur "town hall" doesn't let all speak their needs.
We want an in person town hall... don't be a coward. Your president is barely treading water, and you follow him like a blind dog. #SHAME
What are you afraid of? Angry voters? That's nothing. Try being afraid you can't afford healthcare for your loved one's serious illness!
My impression of @SenCoryGardner and his "telephone town hall"
Because you're too afraid to have one in person. Got it.
Lol
and will you be canceling this, or changing the time like you have done in the past?
show up in person or not at all. we've had enough reading your statements.
No thanks. I'll wait until you have the courage to meet with us in person. When will that be?
Likely never. Unless you are bringing sacks of cash.
Why? So we can listen to the screened softball questions being lobbed at you? No thanks. Not good enough. #charminsoftcorygardner
