Congrats to my friend @AjitPaiFCC on his confirmation as Chairman of the @FCC.
do not support a corporate tool.. keep the internet open and neutral
And now all your constituents east of I-25 that voted 4 you will suffer worse access due to net neutrality ending. #NetNeutrality

Coloradans: Tell @SenCoryGardner his vote to open the #ArcticRefuge to drilling is unacceptable 202-883-6199 #ProtecttheArcticRefuge
#netneutrality
Total bullshit.
2020
Now is NOT the time for Republicans to push gun silencers!
Or even tax reform.
Now is the time to make Colorado safer!
#GunContolNow
The best way to help the digital divide is to uphold net neutrality
SenGardner:The NRA paid you $3.8MILLION dollars. You support the NRA& profit frm weapons sales whch includes your profit from machine guns
And this is another one of your tone-deaf cater to the rich "mistakes" which you will pay dearly for. #2020 #SneakyPete
Colorado wanted you to vote NO on Ajit Pai - the internet should be open. He'll create a digital divide btween the haves&have-nots #MISTAKE
But where are you on gun control????.....silence....
Of course he's silent- he got almost $4 million from the NRA.
Wow, what will the loss of net neutrality do to your rural constituents?
Many called asking u to not re-confirm. Kind of tired of being ignored. At least you could try to refrain from flaunting your terrible votes
I've never seen a more corrupt admin & Congress who is supposed to be a check on a corrupt admin. This one is complicit. You'll be voted out
Are you going to hold his feet to the fire on #NetNeutrality? An open internet is essential to a free society.
Really? Thought he was a lobbyist for Comcast. Odd.
How much are telecommunications conglomerates contributing to your campaign?
He's a telecom shill
You support so many issues at odds with your constituents well being. #NetNeutrality 
And fracking in neighborhoods
@AjitPaiFCC has dedicated his life to enable telecoms to make more money from my data this isn't fair play it's pay to play! #NetNeutrality
Vote no on net neutrality, Cory. Don’t open floodgates of digital divide.
Not surprised he’s your “friend” given his similar disdain for the public interest and blatant favoritism for corporations.
Also, I’d love to hear your definition of the “digital divide” and what you think Ajit Pai has done to help close it.
Nice going Cory, This guy makes deals on the sly w businesses he supposed to regulate, then makes decision. *cough* but You already know it
Bull. He's a corporate lackey like you who will destroy Net Neutrality.
Nice distraction. What about the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to the 58 people who died in Las Vegas?
In all do respect, repeal Obamacare and stop taking the Obamacare subsidy which taxpayers are paying for.
In
Well you and he did get lots of money from providers. Not surprised you object to keeping the internet free.
@SenCoryGardner, you do not listen to us or represent us. You are an embarrassment to Colorado. You sold out! #VoteHimOut #Resist
Automatic weapons are not necessary for self defense! We want common sense gun control!  #guncontrol
Once again your vote is bought and paid for. You are a disappointment. #GunContolNow
The amount of blood on your hands = 5,950
That is the $ amount you have taken from the @NRA. They are about gun sales not rights.  #shill
This is a travesty for consumers and net neutrality
Now he can work on destroying the internet as we now know it. #NetNeutrality
How much more damage will you inflict on constituents before #2020?
You know nothing, @SenCoryGardner. This dude is working for the cable company $$ that lines his pockets. But those are your morals too. 2020
Despicable! You are contributing to the destruction of our democracy.
Sad to see you so quickly moved past the murders of people in Las Vegas. There is no other news today for the families who were impacted.
Automatic weapons are not necessary for self defense! We want common sense gun control!  #guncontrol
He wants to strip open internet access from everyone? How...thoughtful? Fair?

You, sir, are the embodiment of the Peter Principle.
NOW IS THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL
Lol!! You hired a Verizon lawyer to protect consumers. The wolf is guarding the hen house you dotard.
Leave it to YOU to be happy about it
Apparently you are in favor of anything that the majority of your constituents oppose. Taking bribes from Big Cable now?
He wants to make the internet a toll road do you even know what you’re talking about?
Spoiler alert: No
GUN REFORM NOW!
When @SenCoryGardner shows you who he really is, believe him. #paidforbytheNRA #corporateshill
As one of your constituents you just lost my vote due to your short sighted vote today.
That's too bad. Your actions sure don't point to a 2nd term for you.
Bullshit. He’s a fox guarding the henhouse. But I’d love if he’d prove me wrong and preserve net neutrality.
Ajit and #corythecreep - bought and paid for.
#NetNeutrality
We American citizens DO NOT appreciate this appointment.
The only thing you both have dedicated your careers to is lining your own pockets.
Pai is not a supporter of #NetNeutrality. He's a sellout who panders to corporate interests, and so are you. 2020
Will even work on a per vote basis. Get it while it lasts.
HE IS CHEAP! HE IS CHEAP AND CORRUPT! HE BENDS OVER & WHORES 4 ANYTHING @GOP TELLS HIM 2DO!  HELP COLORADO RID THE STATE OF THIS ABOMINABLE ASSHOLE!
Never understood how "closing the digital divide" meant "discriminating against small biz and consumers".
#netnutrality is not a digital divide. Stop selling our interests to the highest bidder #Gardenerforsale
The guy that wants to destroy an open internet and kill net neutrality. How much will you make on this one? Sellout
"Thrilled to rubber stamp another incompetent person into a leadership position and look forward to screwing over consumers." ~ Cory Gardner
You know what else divides us? Mass murder, like the Aurora shooting. Is the $3,939,199 the @NRA gave you worth their lives? #GunControlNow
The fact that CO has been through a FEW mass murders, has done nothing to stop Gardner from being the NRA'a bitch. Vote him out!
EXACTLY. They care about the @NRA $ more than the constituents who elected them. VOTE THEM OUT. Here's a start + ol' Corey. #ByeCorey
"Look forward to seeing Net Neutrality Regulations eliminated and more power given to cable companies to raise prices." ~ Cory Gardner
Thoughts and prayers.
Closing the digital divide by proposing to remove current consumer protections. It is possible to keep them and stimulate growth.
RIP #NetNeutrality
@FCC He refused to answer important questions. He should not have been confirmed without those answers.
Hope everyone enjoyed the open internet while it lasted. Big corporations win again.
He wants to end #NetNeutrality you moron.  Why are you always against your constituents?
