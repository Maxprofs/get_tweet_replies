Moving the BLM headquarters out west would be a misguided. Keeping HQ in Washington so BLM has a presence on The Hill!
How about an op-ed explaining why you can't give a straightforward answer to simple questions.
Vote NO on the skinny bill. Your children will thank you.
269,000 Coloradans could lose their healthcare if you don't vote NO on the skinny bill which the public has not seen yet.
Join the @TheDemocrats and fix #ACA
You are really so out of touch.  Why not leave the Senate and join the PTA? Your skills are perfect for it. They aren't for representing CO
Resign.  It will be a better use of your time than moving federal office furniture.
I was shocked at your vote on ACA yesterday (not really). I had a sneaky feeling that your game of hiding had purpose.
Wild horses must be afforded protection for the future--our children & grandchildren. I represent a CO nonprofit, The Cloud Foundation.
Too bad you have no integrity when it comes to Heath care...makes all your actions worthless!  Work to together my a$$...
With all due respect, Colorado needs you to concentrate on voting no on ACHA health care revisions.
We need a town hall meetings for all well people can come
No one cares Cory. This is a BS non-issue and you keep blowing us off on the things that matter. you are SO GONE in #2020 #BoyBye #GFTOCory
But you don't know the first thing about working together, at least with your constituents you don't!
Dear Sen, called you today to discuss healthcare. Again. 2 offices, got 2 VM. Still have 0 replies. Please do the right thing. #KillTheBill
How many days since your last town hall? No time for us, but time for an OpEd?
I'm sorry but ... what?!!!  We're all still paying attention to the health care bill!
I manage a page of 500,000 wild horse advocates who are concerned with public land usage and our protected wild horses.
Are you so spineless that you can't issue statements on why you support bad legislation? Your social media team is punking you big time.
VOTE NO ON HEALTHCARE REPEAL/REPLACE!!!
Show us the healthcare bill
Our public land belongs to every American, not just the residents who happen to live nearby. Our wild horses were protected by the 1971 law.
Where's Corybaaa baaaa
DO YOUR JOB!! LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS!!
In case we missed it? We're worried about healthcare, lgbtq rights, environmental protections being rolled back. But kudos on the op ed bud
I believe you delight in ignoring our concerns about healthcare.
But, you have been in total silence on healthcare!  Talk to us.  We are watching you. No!
You voted to take away the health care 22 million Americans, Senator. Why should we trust you at all? #CorytheCoward
#CantWaitToReplaceYou
ya, that's not what we're waiting for a statement on #BobsBigBoy! #republiCON #cronyGardner #GOP #TrumpCare #blueState #jrSen #CO #waterBoy
your platitudes & claims of beneficial work are negated by your willing commitment to kill us via TrumpCare death panels.
Sorry Senator. Mike arisen pointed out how unfair Denver Post is being toward you. You have my full support.
Vote to SAVE OUR PUBLIC LANDS!!!!
Will you be stripping health care from millions of people too?
Healthcare buddy! Quit deflecting and listen to Colorado voters. 80212 will not forget come vote time! #1term
Maybe Senator Cory could focus on more important issues like not killing Coloradans for a tax cut for the rich! #TrumpcareKills
What is it you don't get Cory? The People of Colorado expect answers. We didn't vote for you to be a lackey for Trump. STAND UP FOR COLORADO
You need to work on setting some town halls where YOU answer OUR real questions. WE'RE  not happy YOU'RE ducking us. #HindsightIs2020#Resist
Meanwhile, back in Grand Junction: VOTE NO. Don't betray us by voting for a bill that would cause us to lose insurance. Be brave.
Stand with our President
Vote no on skinny appeal;  it does not kick enough Coloradoans off health ins and does not give the rich their much needed tax cut.
I’m beginning to think @SenCoryGardner is just trolling us. What a disgrace to CO.
Also, you could reduce partisanship by not slighting your Democratic colleagues every time you refer to them as "Democrat officials."
You seem obsessed with the physical addresses of fed offices and staff. Public lands belong to all 300+ million Americans, not just West.
If your only focus is land management and open space, can you just not vote on things that affect people's lives?
Oh...I DID miss this! Maybe I also missed your statement on why you are so intent on killing your constituents.
How about an op-ed explaining why you went back on your word that you would protect the Medicaid expansion?
Don't pretend you care about anything but money after your Trumpcare votes.
#Resign
Will you ever work by answering our questions?
I don't think you're from around here - haven't seen you, Gardner, in a town hall for what seems like, dunno, has it been years?

Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
Senator, you have done great things for CO. But your legacy will be overshadowed or even wiped out by a yes vote for Skinny Repeal. We asked
u to repeal & replace w/something better, and Skinny Repeal is not that. It is something worse. Please oppose this bill tonight. CO voter 
You rank very high in the categories of 1. Ineffectiveness and 2. Lack of interest in your constituents. Congratulations!
#SkinnyRepeal will increase premiums 20% for all Coloradans and 575,000 will lose healthcare. Vote NO! This is a disaster!!
That is much smaller increase than Obamacare. Ins is lost by choice. Choice what a concept
Actually, the score says it would increase 20% ABOVE the annual increases seen during Obamacare. You're spreading misinformation.
No you lefties are spreading lies. No worries. Solution for them is to get a job, less time for spreading chaos!
Go kiss Corys butt then
Lol, is the CBO is spreading lies?  Keep believing the #alternativefacts.  20% increase includes those on employer plans; job wouldn't help.
What's your position on the death spiral bill? Oh, sorry, the "skinny repeal" bill.
How about working together to improve health care for Coloradans, instead of taking it away from them and making it more expensive?
ICIMI: Where can I find your statement on why you voted for full repeal of ACA?
Because You Keep Missing It: Coloradans need affordable health insurance and the Koch bros don't need more money.
It must be nice, you don't have to worry about the state of your healthcare! Lots of free time to write BLM op-eds #VoteNo
The people of Colorado don't have that luxury. There are thousands of people worried they won't have ins soon. I know u don't seem to care
Your interview on Denver's channel 9 was pathetic. You're a condescending, smug, clown. A complete embarrassment to Colorado
@GOP #SkinnyRepeal Senator, don't you have a "Skinny Repeal" bill you should be blocking?
Absolute BS. You want to diminish the role of BLM and turn our public lands over to the special interests.  You Sir do not represent CO!
Trust me, Cory, I didn't miss what you've done.
2020
Do you remember what the West looks like? Haven't seen or heard from you around here in a long time
Check your voicemail.
Better yet, instruct your staff to pick up the phone when it rings.
Oh, and your Denver office phone is broken. Can't imagine why.
Meanwhile, you're screwing hundreds of thousands of Coloradans out of health insurance. You're a failure to your constituents.
PERFECT timing for this, @SenCoryGardner #noskinnyrepeal
.@SenCoryGardner 

Keep calling, Colorado!!!

Have some free time right now, do ya? #copolitics #cosen
Will @SenCoryGardner still accept his TAXPAYER FUNDED health coverage when he STEALS healthcare from 575,000 Coloradans???

#KeepCalling
"Quick! tweet out other things I have kind-of accomplished so people forget that I have no spine on healthcare"
