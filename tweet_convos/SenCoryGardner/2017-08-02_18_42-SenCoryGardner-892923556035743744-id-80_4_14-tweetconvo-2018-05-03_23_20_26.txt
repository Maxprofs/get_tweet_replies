No wall! Healthcare for all!
You are so afraid of meeting with your constituents that you only speak on the telephone. We can do better than you, and we will.
Stop discussing and start listening
@SenCoryGardner, on this we agree! We can do better! And we will. Hope you have a backup job. #2020
We know your thoughts - you think it's ok to vote against interests of thousands of CO voters. Hold a #RealTownHall, listen to OUR thoughts.
If we can do better, why are you voting for plans that would make the system worse and kick millions off of insurance? How is this better?
We're still expecting #RealRepeal! #FullRepeal #FreeMarket #KeepThePromise #UnitedForFreedom 
Don't think we aren't watching!
Then why did the CBO score your plans so low & why we're you part of the 13 all white men coming up with these plans?
I hear  about making sure we don't disrupt Medicaid but what about lower income older Americans that depend of the subsidy for healthcare?
Stand #UnitedForFreedom & stand w/ #FreedomCaucus! #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal. #FreeMarkets r the answer! Innovation! Not gov't monopolies!
Senator, your thoughts on healthcare, bahahahaha. Sucking up to the elite rich does not count.
We can sure the hell do better than the crap you tried to pass @SenCoryGardner,
You are a GOP puppet spouting GOP propaganda and not properly representing CO on major US policy issues.
YOU should do BETTER-stop sabotaging ACA & work with Democrats to FIX parts of ACA that aren't working for people!
For those who missed your "gutless" town hall meeting, can you tweet your stance? Does repair ring a bell? Your replacement plan was a joke.
Better doesn't mean get rid of and hope for the best.  The last bill's you voted yes on would have devastated families -  you work for us
It's harder to arrest your constituents for calling in. Still, kinda surprised you didn't find a way.
And the crap laws you wrote and the 3x voted yes to kill Coloradans to improve the tax home pay of the .5% is better. You should be ashamed
You may as well start voting for the people of CO as of now you have no chance in 2020. At least go out not looking like a tool.
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED ONLY! NO trumpcare either! #UnitedforFreedom!
you voted against the American people.  Thank goodness for the 3 Republicans who stood up against your ideas
I will not participate in an "online town hall" where my questions are edited by your staff and there is no opportunity for follow-up.
Hahahahahaha "Town Hall" hahahahahaha *wipes laughter tears* hahahahahaha

Ahem.

What a joke.
Hold a real public town hall, your constituents want to talk to you in person.
, with due respect, doing better than it is right now could have begun with #GOP reaching out to Dems from the beginning.
Keep federal government at a minimum. Send health care to the state's with some safe guards.
Every GOP candidate promised FULL repeal. #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal Get with it or get out!
Truly support improving healthcare for for everyone But not at the expense of vulnerable people with minimal forethought @CardboardCoryCO
Might be a good idea to spend more than a week trying to put a bill together that won't kill those who need healthcare the most.
Along with trying to screwing us on GOP healthcare bills that are complete crap with tax breaks for the rich.
How long was this town hall?You tweeted @ 7:42,as of 8:07 event has ended.I've left messages to call me back 2 verify you listened. CRICKETS
He tweeted *during* the town hall?

Here's what happened when a Republican senator challenged a Canadian doctor on their single-payer health care system. 
Staged Q & A in a phone call (with a fake "sign up")? Now a town hall in Durango? @SenCoryGardner, this is not how you communicate! #Resist
We have to do better! People living w/intellectual & developmental disabilities rely on #Medicaid. #NoCutsNoCaps
2020
Agree but you don't have to throw the baby out with the bath water. Fix ACA!
please see Senator Burr's interview of Canadian doctor regarding #SinglePayer. https://www.facebook.com/senatorsanders/videos/10156196140087908/ â€¦
Hahaha, you have thoughts? You just voted straight down party line!
The senate as a whole let us down.
Why have you voted w/ GOP to destroy CO marketplace, Connect for Health Colorado by withholding subsidies? You're out to sabotage ACA. WHY?
Discussing with who? Ryan? Paul? Freedom caucus? Tea party idiots?  Better get serious reach across aisle. America deserves healthcare.
#cardboardcoryco
Repeal and Replace Cory!
Call-In #townhalls are a joke and not a true Town Hall. Be courageous and face your constituents
In order to get a chance to be on the call you want us to provide phone# & email.Why?So you call sell my info & inundate me w/crap?NO THANKS
You're literally hiding in the bushes during this tele-town hall, aren't you?
You voted yes on Skinny Repeal which would've caused unspeakable turmoil for ACA insured ppl like me. You refuse to work w/ Dems to fix ACA
You said you are categorically against a single payer system. Is this the result of real inquiry or is it ideology replacing inquiry?
What a great way to have a "town hall" w/o actually having to see constituents in person. More ducking and dodging. #CowardlyCoryGardner
Willing to meet with you! As is many other constituents. Left many voicemails. How bout showing up to face us? @CardboardCoryCO
deep.

your idea of better was the three horrible alternatives that came up for a vote.
your judgment is poor.
Maybe you should STOP putting @GOP party before your constituents and country! #notrumpcare
I know you can't see the #resist signs and the thumbs-down, but they are waving. I'd be shocked if you ever did a live townhall
Nice canned answer.  Everyone's followup question, if you weren't too cowardly to answer would be "why did you vote to make it worse?"
Ok so you and your republicans all go on whatever your "great" plan is, if you ever get one. Include your families as well
COLORADO IS DONE WITH YOU CORY
And the Skinny Bill was the "better way"?  What "experts" did you talk too?
The RAT Cory Gardner is jumping ship

You should discuss compromising party values for progress towards 60 votes on anything. Literally anything.
Why in phone Cory, makes you look spineless!
Um, I'm on the call, and one caller was frustrated bc #ACA saved her when she got sick and the other was frustrated that @gop isn't unified
Who are the experts u talked to? I know that multiple public health directors sent a joint letter to u saying how bad a repeal would be!

Who's quote is this?  Yes, we can do better - agreed!  That means IMPROVE, not repeal and replace with something way worse!!!
You need to be engaged with constituents and not blindly defend the GOP while disregarding your CO voters.
How about you face your constituents live. You have not hosted an in-person Townhall and over 450 days
On 7/28/17, GUTLESS @SenCoryGardner voted to STEAL healthcare from MILLIONS of Americans to give MASSIVE TAX CUTS to the RICH!!!

#COWARD
Who are you discussing them with? You're not even in Colorado...
