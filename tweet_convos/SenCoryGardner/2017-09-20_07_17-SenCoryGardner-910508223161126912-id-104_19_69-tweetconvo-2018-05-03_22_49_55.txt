Thank you.
Well if she’s like you Cory Gardner I keep a sharp eye on her and continue to work as has against you as you do me !
Blue collar working man says don't support a hardline right-wing judge for #senjudiciary #senjudiciaryamd vote no on #GrahamCasiddy. Hooah
Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
You can make Colorado proud by voting against the #GrahamCassidy sick children's death sentence.
If she has your support, that must mean she's on the side of big business and not for the working person.
What has to happen to get you GOP senators to WAKE UP and start protecting the US, instead of taking advantage and stealing appointments?
Vote NO on Trumpcare and work for bipartisan improvement to ACA. Stop Zinke from taking our public lands. Colorado
Under GrahamCassidy bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
Just like Gorsuch and his stolen seat has shamed Colorado and the nation?
Hope @SenBennetCO refuses to turn in blue card. Blocking rw extremists is important
Tell us again about those upset donors that you're more worried about over your constituents' health care
How much are Koch brothers padding your pockets for a yes vote. Will this Judge stand up against corruption?
That's neat.  Now don't screw coloradans over by supporting the #GrahamCassidyMurderBill
Yes, the judge who feels that her faith comes before the law.  No thanks.
Now that you've got that intro out of the way...read G-C legislation. Or ask Susan Collins - she's read it. #noGrahamCassidy #ProtectOurCare
You want to make a difference? Turn in you resignation. Your constituents will thank you! No on Graham Cassidy!!!!!
Like Gorsuch is gonna make Colorado proud? That isn't working out so well.
Too extreme. She is unfit for the job.
Quit trying to obliterate a black President's program just because of black. You have lied about every detail of previous bills. Vote NO!
Sen Gardner, does this make you proud, or do you have any idea what he's talking about?
I'd be proud to have you join @SenBennetCO in fighting for affordable health care for Colorado. Keep our citizens safe & our hospitals open!
Vote NO on Graham Cassidy bill. It is the right thing to do. Your children will thank you.
Does THIS make you proud: #GrahamCassidyBill cuts $6 Billion from CO by 2026. BILLION! Vote NO on this disastrous bill!! #SaveOurCare
And according to @SenBennetCO it could be as much as $78 BILLION !!!
NEWS: Colorado could lose up to $78 billion (that’s BILLION with a B) in next 20 yrs if #GrahamCassidy becomes law. http://avalere.com/expertise/life-sciences/insights/graham-cassidy-heller-johnson-bill-would-reduce-federal-funding-to-sta …
And in addition to the devastating impact on CO healthcare, thousands of jobs will be lost
Oh, good - another ideologue. She was bad on the Colo. Supreme Court - what makes you think she'll be a better jurist at the federal level?
Stay legal, just, and fair.  And, then help my state (#Texas) to do the same.  At least towards cannabis...
Vote no on the repeal of ACA !

Please vote NO on the #GrahamCassidyِ healthcare repeal bill.  Coloradans are counting on you to #SaveOurCare
Corey --  show your decency vote no on immoral health care bill. Any good you do will be negated by your cowardly partisanship.
If she is a friend of yours - she is most likely as dangerous to our citizens and country as you.
Your vote against #GrahamCassidy would be best proof of ur commitment to ur constituents and not to Koch Bros who will give $400M to @GOP

You know what doesn't make Colorado proud? You, we are ashamed of you. You're an ineffectual rep and rubber stamp everything Trump does.

Where's Cory
Speaking of making Colorado proud, could you please vote against #GrahamCassidyِ, which will gut maternity care, infant care, mental health?
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy.

Stand up to the Kochs.  Find funding the old fashioned way, from the actual people you represent.
"It's an honor to ignore my constituents and vote to deprive them of health care.  Screw you all." ~ Trump Rubber Stamp, C.Gardner
As your constituent, please vote no on Graham-Cassidy. It's just not working and it won't work for Colorado. Bipartisan repair of ACA! Do it
So sad
Too bad Judge Garland was cheated out of a hearing! #GOPTreason
Too bad you aren't doing the same. #OneTermCory
You could too! Don't vote for our death, k?
Too bad you haven't made Colorado proud.
For who? Not good for a progressive state.
