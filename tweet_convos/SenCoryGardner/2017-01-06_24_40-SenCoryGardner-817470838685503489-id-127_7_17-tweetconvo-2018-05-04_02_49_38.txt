- Shooting in baggage claim http://cnn.it/2ikGrRb  
@CNN please do something to stop gun violence
@CNN nope, you don't get to say anything but "sorry."  THE BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS.
Hoping this tragedy encourages you to join in passin responsible gun regulation legislation #neveragain @SenCoryGardner @CNN
Why haven't you addressed the mass shooting in the Quebec City shooting?  Shooter not the right color?
How about some sensible gun control instead of sympathy?
Stop praying and start taking ACTION against gun violence. Take a stand against the NRA.
how about prayers for your constituents? You just voted to kill the ACA. #gophypocrite #1termcory
@CNN you don't have a heart you lying, incompetent idiot.  You don't give a damn about everyday people.
Cory Gardner does not care about his constituents. He receives NRA blood money and repeals the ACA. Disgusting.
hey cory, how is that blood money u got $3,879,064 from NRA to support expanding gun access
@CNN You faker. You received $3.8 MILLION from the NRA. If you care about victims, pass strong gun control legislation.
Prayers don't do shit. We need sensible gun laws NOW!!
@CNN instead of just praying all the time could you introduce some gun sense legislation?
@CNN Faith without works is dead!
why don't you do something constructive  like fund mental health and support universal background checks
hope you do something other than just pray about this with the power you hold.
CO won't re-elect a $4m NRA puppet. We're coming for your seat, Cory

21st GOPer to tweet #thoughtsandprayers

he got $3,879,064 from NRA2support expanding gun access which makes shootings like this more likely https://twitter.com/SenCoryGardner/status/817470838685503489 …
4 million to donate to offset their medical expenses! The American and decent thing to do!
.@SenCoryGardner So last night you began the process to kill Obamacare w/no viable replacement. Your actions speak louder than your prayers.
he got $3,879,064 from NRA2support expanding gun access which makes shootings like this more likely
@CNN Thanks for that, but was was wondering if you are going to take people's Healthcare away and let them die?

Thanks
@CNN vote for guncontrol then. Stop with the platitudes.
can you pray while trying to FIX the problem of rampant gun violence?
you going to give the NRA back the $4m you took from them?
How about starting by returning $4M Donations from NRA?
You received a lot of money to assist in getting them killed. Save your prayers. Resign
why don't you enact laws to pre ent such tragedies? Praying doesn't seem to work. You keep failing God's test
enough rhetoric. Prayers don't stop people with guns! Stop the murders.
@CNN As an elected official, you must do more than pray. You must take action to solve our gun violence problem in America.
prayers wont do anything about gun control. What are you going to do about it?
if I were you I would start praying for American people whose insurance you were going to take away and screwup.
no "cg". He can't even give fake condolences himself, this is staff written.
Anyone can pray for victims.  As a legislator, shouldn't you be doing a little more to help curb gun violence?  Guess not.
@CNN
Your "thoughts & prayers" are worthless. You took dirty gun $$$ from the NRA. Gun violence is on you.
Maybe try doing something about these senseless tragedies.
@CNN  stop taking blood $$ from the @NRA and pass gun safety laws.
I disagree with you on many issues and on your NRA bond, but I believe you are sincere in this instance.
You must be praying to the wrong god, because this shit keeps happening.
you made this possible @CNN
@CNN how about a little control over people flying with GUNS. We don't need your prayers we need you to work to fix this
Surprised you can remove the @NRA from your ass long enough to offer a thought or a prayer.
Do something that will actually make a difference like responsible gun laws.  #boughtbyNRA
The GOP praying about anything is worthless. Just knowing that the NRA keeps your pockets greased is more important.
No it doesn't
Why didn't a Republican NRA member stop him? 
That is there motto, 
More Guns = Safer Merika. NOT very "Intelligent" are u.
You aren't elected to pray, you are elected to legislate on behalf of the best interests of US citizens, do your job!
You are bought and paid for by the NRA.  You have blood on your hands.  #FortLauderdale
@CNN I'm a voter in colorado. I want to see an independent committee to investigate hacking.
@CNN You took over 3 MILLION DOLLARS from NRA. You are complicit and an enabler. #Hypocrite
the blood of the victims should be on your conscience, sir.
Over 3  mil from NRA.  Easy to see who owns you.  Pass some common sense gun reform.
How about acting like a law maker and make some laws that might address these issues? Your prayers are useless.
@CNN how's that $3million from NRA in your pocket? Not fooling anyone.
do something Cory, you fool. Like pass gun control legislation!
Really? So, stop taking $ from the NRA.
Take the 4Mil you get from the NRA and give it to the victims! You are part of why this happened, your hands are bloody!
prayers wont do anything. How about not taking $$ from NRA and pass some worthwhile gun regulations?????
doubt your heart goes out to the victims, given how much you take from @NRA. And certainly not your brain. @CNN
@CNN give them some of the money the NRA game you.
@CNN you are blinded by greed (3.8 million from NRA); what audacity "sending prayers". Look in the mirror..like what U see?
prayers don't stop bullets
Your prayers are worthless, much like your soul. How about a blood money donation to help those affected!?
@CNN If your prayers do not move you to action - besides stretching out your hand for more NRA money - they are worthless.
@CNN but your hand goes out to the NRA 
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
Prayers without action=meaningless tripe
That's a nice start. Now stop taking money from the .@NRA to look the other way every time this happens.
Are you kidding me with this? What about that NRA money. USE THAT MONEY TO MAKE GUN CONTROL LAWS!
Your prayers for the victims is a slap in the face to them. You rec'vd almost $4M from NRA. Hypocrite!
stop accepting campaign contributions from the @nra
@CNN you are a disgusting citizen who's soul will rot in hell for your non actions and money hungry ways you are a disgrace
@CNN Stop praying and do something about these mass shootings
but not really though. If it did, you wouldn't have taken $4 million from the NRA.
@CNN Cory. You're bad.
@CNN $3,879,064
$4 million from @NRA and you help this carnage continue.  I sure hope the voters boot you out. #endgunviolence
Hypocrisy and Crocodile Tears - You are pathetic.
Wipe those tears using that 3.8 million dollars of NRA money
@CNN you've taken over 3 million dollars from the @NRA and we're supposed to believe that you actually give a shit?
Prayer harder & to a different god because it's not working.
@CNN might need more that prayers ..... ya know what I'm saying ?
Prayers are pretty empty, when you take nearly $4M from the NRA.
@CNN Fact you have taken large amounts of NRA makes you such a huge hypocrite. Do your job and back common sense gun laws!
@CNN what a despicable opportunist you are. Exactly how much was the check for that you cashed from the NRA?
if only there was something you could do to prevent incidents like this from happening...
How far can your heart travel on the $3.9 million you took from the @NRA last year? #Hypocrite #Enough

You already have #guncontrol. It is illegal to carry a gun in Florida airports. #FAIL
we already have thoughts and prayers too. Gardner can shove those up his ass
You've received more than 3 million $ from the NRA! What will prayers do?!!
only prayers? No thoughts? Geez, $4m doesn’t buy you much these days.
@CNN Cory!  Great time to use that $3.8MILLION in NRA money for hospital/funeral costs for victims. #thoughtsandprayers
3.8 million!
Could you actually do your job and help put laws into place for sensible gun control? Oh wait, the NRA owns you. Nevermind.
you're gross.
