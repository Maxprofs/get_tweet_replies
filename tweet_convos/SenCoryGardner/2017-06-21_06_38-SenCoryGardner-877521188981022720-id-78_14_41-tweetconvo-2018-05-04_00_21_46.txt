Thank u @SenCoryGardner 4 supporting #LWCF #OutdoorRecEconomy #VoicesforNature @Nature_Colorado 
Your voting record on public lands conservation is terrible. Please vote and take action for public lands. #ArcticRefuge #StandWithBearsEars
You'd sell our land out-like you sold out public education to DeVos if it bolsters your campaign funds-who do you think you're kidding?
Are you committed to preventing #climatechange?  Because there have been a lot of wildfires that hurt Colorado's public (and private) lands
He's committed to whatever Mitch McConnell tells him to do... @SenCoryGardner knows he's a #OneTermSenator
Donâ€™t let Colorado lose $40M in vital CDC funding. Oppose the AHCA & #ProtectPrevention http://bit.ly/2sQwQcy 
You made time for this visit... #ADAPTandRESIST but not constituents with disabilities... @SenBennetCO we must protect human rights #CRPD
@RepDLamborn @SenBennetCO @realDonaldTrump Vote NO on Trumps tax cut for the wealthy AKA Trumpcare Process is disgraceful! The swamp reeks!
Might want to quit cute posts until you actually meet with people on the significant issue, the AHCA. Hard to visit public lands when sick.
So public lands good
But being healthy enough to enjoy them is still behind secret closed doors?
Please protect Colorado, more important than your normal vote to trash the environment.
If you don't fight for health care there won't be anyone to enjoy the land
So you care about lands, but approve climate change deniers... this doesn't add up. Sincerely, a constituent.
Great, now fight to protect our healthcare! VOTE NO ON ACA REPEAL; VOTE NO ON TRUMPCARE! We need healthcare more than partisan politics.
When are you going to fight to protect Colorodans health care?
I guess ADAPT didn't have the PAC money you extort from any group before you meet with them.
Hopefully you feel the same about Protecting the Lives of Colorado By voting NO ON HEALTHCARE
And protect our healthcare. No repeal & replace!
Hey, why not hold in an person town hall so we can all stop by? You represent us, after all
Where's Cory
Thank you @SenCoryGardner ! Your leadership and support is much appreciated!  @Nature_Colorado #VoicesforNature
Leadership means actually showing up not hiding behind a telephone. He is a pencil pusher for McConnell not a leader!
I too seriously wonder what form of leadership you refer too
Any chance you'd meet with your constituents?
Why did you threaten tickets to concerned constituents ?
When will you meet to discuss healthcare, sir? Secrecy on 1/6th of our economy is beyond absurd.
Hard to with Zinke in charge. Did you vote for his approval?

#WeWillReplaceYou
#HealthcareBill
How come I get turned away when even I stop by your office?
You didn't arrest them?
Thanks for protecting our public lands! Now please work to protect healthcare for vulnerable people. Medicaid expansion is important!
Cory, when will you put your tax returns up for the public to review?
Vote no on the AHCA!!  Or are you alugned with Trump and the GOP to give top 2% $600B in tax breaks. Stand up for 271k COs who lose Care
Fight to defend Our President.
How do these people get in to see you when the rest of us can't? What's the secret?
2020
You're getting it right on land. Please treat people just as well.
I hope you stand up to the hot mess in the WH. Our future depends on u. Healthcare and environment need senate 2 fight
Hello @SenCoryGardner when are you going to hold a town hall. The people have questions for you. We demand answers! Or are you scared?
As a breast cancer survivor now on fixed income & Medicaid, I want to know what AHCA will do to me and those like me. Show us the text.
You are killing children, the poor & the elderly. You don't represent us. You are a traitor to Colorado and the country. I'm ashamed of you
He will be if Cory votes for TrumpCare....
When can I stop by the office to discuss affordable health care w coverage for preexisting? When?
I wonder how the #outdoorRecEconomy feels about your vote to approve Scott Pruitt and other climate change deniers to important positions?
How about Colorado's public? Are you fighting for the people? We deserve to see the AHCA bill. We deserve healthcare.
Please make sure public lands STAY public and funded. Also that Colorado people healthy enuf to enjoy. NO AHCA
Hopefully this extends to all public lands. Your stance is good, but just a few more words you could be a strong leader! #MonumentsForAll
Of the folks who visit you from CO, what percent loosing health insurance is acceptable to you?
How about also protecting our current healthcare.. Colorado does not want to loose our current plans, unless we go to single payer.
Cory, you certainly aren't protecting healthcare. You refuse to meet constituents b/c you have been acting unamerican. #colorado
Maybe you could support not kick hundreds of thousands of your constituents off healthcare too. Do you care about that or nah?
If for every four negative responses to your Tweets you have one positive response, that shows you're doing something wrong
please listen to us and send us the language for the healthcare bill. Or else, protect what we already have.
Hey Cory, will you ever have constituents in to discuss health care? Coward.
Updates on the Senate health bill is conspicuously absent from your tweets and weekly emails.   Frankly, it's aggravating me greatly.
What's your position on AHCA aka GOP-DOESNT-CARE, sir? I pray you are honorable and bold and Vote NO. 23,000,000 of us are counting on you.
Soft Cory Gardner won't even meet with his constituents. What's going on with the #GOP health care bill? You approved Devos?
Your cognitive dissonance knows no boundaries, does it? You can't simultaneously say you're protecting CO lands while destroying environment
Why won't you meet with the rest of us that come by your office?
It would be great if you would try to protect our healthcare. Show us the bill little guy.
Spending time outdoors recreating gets to be a poor decision if you don't know where or not you have health insurance
