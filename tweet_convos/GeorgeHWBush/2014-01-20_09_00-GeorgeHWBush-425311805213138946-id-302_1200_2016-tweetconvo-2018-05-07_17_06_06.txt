@GeorgeHWBush @DLeonhardt "Read my lips, no new taxes" -- too bad you set that *trust* on fire and torched to to a crisp, breaking promise.
@FriedrichHayek @DLeonhardt  its a common mistake Friedrich, study what actually happened, the Dems.  withheld funds to defend Kuwait.
@raylks2thesky  Never heard of that -- which is another problem with both of the Bushes, they don't fight the left or speak to the people.
@FriedrichHayek don't know which bushes your speaking of,  the ones I research speak their minds. H.W. can be left leaning and Jeb, no way
@raylks2thesky Read Karl Rove's book - he admits it was major error to never answer "Bush lied, people died" & other leftist talking points.
@GeorgeHWBush sir u became president 20 January 1989???
@GeorgeHWBush @TomProvenzano
