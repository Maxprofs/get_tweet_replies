Thank You President @GeorgeHWBush and former Governor Jeb Bush for you call and supporting the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. #PRStrong 
All 5 president prior shouldn't be smiling, everyone had a hand at screwing this country up now president trump got 2 clean your mess up
Plus I wouldn't give a dime to anything that @BillClinton is involved in, #rememberhaiti and how Clinton Foundation robbed them.
Our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and we Patriots have this...STOP trying to undermine our President. The Bushes are treasonous globalists, GoAway
Thank you! :)
Thank You Mr. President.
Gonna donate more money to the Clinton foundation too are you?
GHWB —. Donate your pension you don’t need because you are a millionaire. Be like Trump and give it back or donate it. Tell W to do it too.
Sad that the good some of these #Presidents have done is so tainted by the true evil that lives within them!
I've been thinking "What more can I do?" 

Move to P.R. and help rebuild. I'm on planning mode!  P.R. Diaspora, we are needed home! #LetsGo
Hilarious...Trump cares more about "WE THE PEOPLE" than the 5 of you put together...Thank Jesus another Bush or Clinton is not our POTUS!
YES IT DOES AND EVERYONE CAME TOGETHER UNDER POTUS VERY WELL, HE DID A GREAT JOB OF GETTING RESOURCES TOGETHER.
I need them to come out and say supportive things about the GREAT JOB being done by the current President as well. They are far too quiet
Mr. President, I wonder if 43 can make a statement of support for Puerto Rico.
For what?  Tell 43 and W to send half their money. They are millionaires. They cost the govt millions each year taking care of them.
Thank you President Bush!
For what?  Did he donate?  He’s a millionaire. Tell him to send half his money. He can afford it.
The Bush, Clinton & Obama organized crime family. Good thing Carter is there to forgive & make good on the great harm these leaders caused.
PLEASE DONT JOIN THE DIVISION IN THIS COUNTRY, LET POTUS DO HIS JOB AND STAY OUT OF IT.
I wouldn't give one cent to help ,I think it was dirty the way the prior assholes treated president trump ,trump has been better then all
Greetings, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla, this is an opportunity to invest and help rebuild Puerto Rico with your technology.
5 Presidents doing what the Narcissist-in-Crock won't do. We admire these 5 patriotic presidents 4 doing the right thing! #PuertoRicoRelief
This President can't walk without assistance yet here he is still trying to help other Americans without expecting credit or wanting it.
Exactly.

You mean the #BushCrimeFamily 
Scrooge,  Huey,  Duey,  Bubba poor Webby never made it.
MOE..LARRY & CURLY ...TOTAL A HOLES
I think I may be Another Crime Family

The leaders of Hell, anyone dare to follow
OK RESPECT
I donated already
Each one of you had your chance to be #POTUS. Should have joined #Trump. You had Ike. Bush had #Katrina. Stop harrassing #MAGA
But there Mexican and tx/fl still need help #priorities
Am I correct when saying You & Your son would've been in  by now & would've sent aid by now? Unlike Fake @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
I recall how terrified hw looked at that pic when Obama took office n this pic is photo shopped
Please send One America now. They need people to organize getting supplies from the Port & the drs who want to help. When will help arrive?!
This fundraising effort to help the US citizens of Puerto Rico will match 100% of all donations up to $100,000

Is that how you helped Haiti? You spent your credibility on that one.
Please explain why private citizens should do what is REALLY the government's job
Thanks @GeorgeHWBush
This seems to be a different story than the one we heard from @realDonaldTrump
@BadHombreNPS  This is more statesmanlike than what 45 has said. See the website. #altgov #theresistance #resist
Pls help Vieques. Island desperately needs aid. Donate to local 501c- all monies go direct to residents: https://www.gofundme.com/viequeslove  
Keep dancing in your heart and live long and prosper.  From Vulcan, and the rest of us.
Thanks President Bush! I'm glad that former Presidents are filling in for the current one to do what is needed! @POTUS
Thank you for your interest to help PR in this huge disaster caused by Hurricane Maria. May God bless you.
Do not give these NWO evil communists any money.

911
Sir President, What about the statehood? That is the real Help. @POTUS @BarackObama @HillaryClinton
The food and water is not even coming to the grocerie stores. This is an emergency situation. Please help PR!
I wish I could, but at this time I can only afford to Pray!
When I can I will do more.
Thanks to all of you real Presidents!
Once again, the USA is able to count on our former Presidents.
Nasir, what were the capital officers supposed to do. Let them drown out the hearing. They caused the spectacle!
Kasie sorry I spelled it incorrectly.
thank you Mr. president.
President @GeorgeHWBush you were always a friend to #PuertoRico. Thank you for your support!
Trump. Outclassed again
I would take any of you back at this point
Your aid is appreciated! Pres. @GeorgeHWBush!
#PRStrong
President Bush responds to Puerto Rico
Wait...I thought we had a new president?
@POTUS OH that looser racist thug who HATES Americans
#ITMFA
@POTUS is it doing nearly enough to help the suffering of the 3.5M people in need of clean drinking water, food, shelter, aid!
All great men with class
Thank you President Bush 
Oh, gosh, so that's what a President is supposed to do. Thanks for reminding us. It is critical we don't forget
I don't trust a damn thing anyone from the Bush or Clinton families say.
Thank you for showing needed ASAP leadership. Hope it's encouraging @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @VP
We want some water George! Share some of that water with them haha. You are sitting on the largest underground water Reservoir. Help me out
NO they cannot, because THIS organization involves Clinton & Obama and they are known for mishandling/skimming funds donations. There are
many great credible organizations that people can donate money to & not inadvertently pay for a personal treasonous project or a wedding.
FYI - THESE PEOPLE ARE THE REFUGEES THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE MAINLAND UNTIL THEIR ISLAND CAN BE REBUILT FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE UP.
Wish the tweet was not nitpicky about @FEMA efforts. Or it was retweetable.
