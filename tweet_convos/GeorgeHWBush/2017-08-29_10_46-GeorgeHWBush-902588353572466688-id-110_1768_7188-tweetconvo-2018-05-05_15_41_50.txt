When is the Bush family going to donate 1 million for Harvey Relief??
Praying for you and Mrs. Bush to stay safe and for the flood victims to find safe havensand the assistance/recovery they so desperately need
@JJWatt is a class act. Maybe @GeorgeHWBush could get the Texas GOP to replace Ted Cruz with him.
Thx JJ and god bless Texas.
Come out and denounce Antifa.  They are the newest hate organization.
Will you and your family denounce Antifa?
No mention of the incredible job our President Trump is coordinating the efforts to save Texas and Louisiana storm victims?
Despicable!
George HW and W hate Trump! Along with every other respectable Republican.
@oakridgeboys @JJWatt

You're a great man, Mr. @GeorgeHWBush. Houston survives, as did we all after a hard-fought dessert storm....

God broke the mold when he made JJ. God Bless Him & all that he's doing for Houston. 
Trump has done an outstanding job on this terrible natural disaster. Unlike Katrina they couldn't even get bottled water.
I feel bad
Yah well you should be thanking @POTUS who certainly is outperforming your son 43
