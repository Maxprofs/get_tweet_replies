I voted for you. I voted for GW twice. I have to live with that every single day for the rest of my life. You are both vile & disgusting human beings. I hope the truth about your involvement in 9-11 comes out while you are still alive so you will  be hung for WAR CRIMES. 
Where were you the day Kennedy was assassinated? @realDonaldTrump #RealeaseTheMemo #QAnon #LiarLiar #FollowTheWhiteRabbit #Obamagate #911truth #GreatAwakening

You're an evil man!!! I just hope you get arrested before you die! If not, you will answer in judgment day
Enjoy your freedom Georgie... The American people are waking up, you will be tried in a court of law for your war crimes. We know you’re full of BS... enjoy your freedom while you still have it...
Not to mention NO ONE has any footage or evidence of a plane hitting the Pentagon. 
Lol not true, we have one 5-frame video showing MISSILE hitting the pentagon... coincidentally in the budget office who was investigating the 2.3 TRILLION missing from the budget...

The most secure building on planet earth only had one 5-frame video footage... yeah right 
That’s what I have heard also...no video footage of a plane ever hitting the Pentagon. I did see a short clip of a missile. Not sure if it’s authentic either. Makes you surely wonder beyond coincidences.
Wait what is this money going to?

soon you and all your bilderberg buddies will be burning in hell
Why did you organise planes to fly into the world trade center on 9/11/01  ?
Thanks for having the courage to lead Mr President.
God bless leaders like yourself. We love you and miss
you with all our hearts.

Hoping it's seized and redistributed to causes that matter to Americans.  :)
