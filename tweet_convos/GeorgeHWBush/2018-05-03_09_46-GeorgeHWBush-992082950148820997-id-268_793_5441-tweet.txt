Quite moved by this announcement by @MethodistHosp. The atrium is beautiful, but recent developments notwithstanding I have not taken up residence here. The doctors, nurses and support staff are so nice, but the second I get the green light I’m outta here. https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/barbara-and-president-george-h-w-bush-honored/ …
