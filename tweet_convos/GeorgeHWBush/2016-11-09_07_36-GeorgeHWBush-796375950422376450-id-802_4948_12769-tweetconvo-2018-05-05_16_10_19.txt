is it ok for you. You're in your nineties and won't have to put up with the consequences
You should thank your lucky stars that the corrupt criminal lost or you or anyone else would not have a USA
Yeah USA under Trump will be great, unless you're a woman, ethnic, gay or Muslim.
Did you see Trump's  first appointments? Woman Gay and Black. He finds the best for the job Wipe the egg from your face LOL
What appointments? Names?

Doesn't say that Trump transition team is made up of a quartet of his own family members and is headed by Mike Pence a man (1/2)
if you are in a plane and dislike the pilot would you sabotage it so the plane goes down? That's what you are  doing. Sad
.@GeorgeHWBush You suck. Your family sucks. The Bushes are a stain on our national honor. Go away forever.
Shame on you! He is a 92 year old man & former President of our country. As such, he deserved our respect. Play nice!
false
which part? His age, the fact that he was our president, or playing nice? You can express your opinion without being rude
@JoeNBC @realDonaldTrump Bush 41 was the first person I voted for president.  What a genuinely good man.
He planned the assassination of John F.Kennedy.  Is that a good man?
Read Case Closed by Gerald Posner.

How sad that some are so hateful in the face of graciousness. This statement is dignified, unlike some ppl.
Every President should learn from George Bush Sr. exactly how to conduct themselves in public.

@Italians4Trump @realDonaldTrump Hinckley's want to know when they get an invite for dinner.  It's been awhile
@Scarlettontv @realDonaldTrump very classy george hwbush good man
I miss your Twitter fight. Papa Bush rekt him last time
He's going to need prayers because he doesn't know  what  he's doing, he likes racists a little too much. Best wishes, Geo.
No one trusts these coots. Mr. NWO, yeah we remember U, took notes on ur actions. U voted Hilary
We live in a country of rules and diversity and open borders is unacceptable.
Why don't you look who Mr. Grandpa is Mr. Bush. Joseph Patrick O'Sullivan, Irish cop, but also Hispanic sir.
But we'll fund millions of illegal aliens MR. Bush at the expense of the men who risked it all for us.
My father was one of those Vets who couldn't get a machines to dissolve kidney stones until I went off
Where is the justice for those veterans who lose services so you can outsource this country Mr. Bush?
A new world order and can't honor the laws in the constitution and what about those men who risked it all?
days after I was in the ER fighting for my life with my daughter who had a broken neck wearing organs in bags
If he did his son would not have championed the dream act, and I blocked it with Oregon liberals.
Don't expect me to feel warm and fuzzy because this man doesn't give a rats ass about this country Donald.
He is all talk Donald. My daughter has permanent nerve damage thanks to people like him. Yeah I was warned.
You don't ever want to piss off a Latina she never forgets MR. Bush and she misses not a single thing.
I don't appreciate having cars speeding into me after blocking the dream act.
I'm really disappointed that you guys left that Texas border wide open to allow terrorists to come on over.
Your suppose to be the first family here to set the example, and he will need prayers due to people like you.
This Latina is not feeling the love here Mr. Bush. Neil was trash talking Mr. Trump which isn't right.
You totally voted for that crooked crook Hillary and shamed the Republican party with your open borders.
Oh I bet he is wait until we block the dreamers will you speed a car into his path like you did me?
Thats awfully interesting, during the entire campaign, you scoffed at him..said he would never win!!
I've alway admired you, but did you vote for him?
Dont go too far, we'll might be needing you.
you guys can't stand him for good reason. No need to pretend.
I just talked with real Pope about your house,Isaia64:11Our holy and beautiful house,where our ancestors praised you,has..
Grate President but I was in Japan.Barron Trump was still afraid at school.
:   You're a class act George !!!!
@Scarlettonfox @realDonaldTrump We don't believe you sir
So @realDonaldTrump says you told him he ran an AMAZING campaign! Really?  Hate speech and bullying = Amazing?
He does not NEED your support or congratulations. I have no respect left for the Bushes.
You, sir, are a class act!  God bless you and God bless America!
we really don't care to hear your congrats you are a disgrace to our party.
an apology would be in order, sir
tell your son to do his thing
true gentlemen
Great post!  As Americans we need to come together and support our President!  That's the best for all no matter the leader.
May those gracious words be sincere words.
please visit http://spiritlessons.com  george Bush and please renounce the satanic secret societies u r in.
as your son said' you're either with us, or against us.' Who did u vote for? #DeplorablesForTrump
Piss off Magog
Traitors!
Coming from Bush, "His family is in our prayers" sounds rather ominous.
too late, you and your family spit in the faces of those of us that help put you in office. The #GOP is now the #TrumpParty!
Classy response and true leadership from the "opposition"  Like George SR a lot. From a liberal deplorable
the elitist Bush Family showed all republican voters that they think they are above us. None voted for Trump.
needs to investigate all the RINOs. Likely had illegal business dealings. #WIKILEAKS #anonymus
U R A #Traitor & DID EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER 2TRY & STOP
@realDonaldTrump BUT WE THE PEOPLE SAW THE #CORRUPTION & STOPPED HRC
respecting the office and the process. You don't throw a fit when things don't go your way.
if the bush's ever invite you to Dallas for a ride in a drop top convertible, promptly decline.
In other words he's going to have you killed like he did JFK - Hire some extra security!
He was directly involved with LBJ in the JFK assassination! Open up the files when you are president!
I hope you don't expect Republicans to support your family in any election again!  Even your nephew!
Your prayers ???Do U mean your satanic ritual prayers ? God helps Trump then.
This is a sentiment & we appreciate it- although it should have come sooner

@georgepbush @realDonaldTrump I felt betrayed by u'r uncle & grandpa having voted for both of them. You give me hope! Smart
Thank you for your service President Bush.
you should have voted for him, we would have more respect for you if you did. Why did you vote for Hillary???
- YOU and your wife should have voted for him then. I supported and defended you for years - disappointed.
@JoeNBC @realDonaldTrump wow
nice that you voted for CrookedHillary and could not support your party. We pity you and your arrogant family
yet you didn't vote for your party? Shame on you all! We came thru and voted for you!
Hell's calling Bush.....tick tock!
now u say that, after the fact, he needed u then.
tell your wife and @JebBush you all screwed up big time in the public eye, but you all don't care .. you run the show
I lost all respect for the Bush family but you are the CIA so I'm scared to type more
why because you the establishment will have him shot?
why didn't you people vote for Donald trump
I'm surprised u havent croaked from all of your wicked deeds yet
a little to late! Have Jeb read what Prescott Bush said about keeping your word!
"His family is in our prayers" sounds like a warning.
but how distraught is Barbara doe
remember Eminem ? White America and Mosh?
Pathetic
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump President, sorry your family didn't support DJT + Jeb didn't honor his PLEDGE. DISHONORED YOUR NAME
are you #KissingAss of President-Elect @realDonaldTrump so as not to be tried for treason in #OperationCyclone ?
Can Trump lower the bar set by W ?
when it comes to the taxpayers.  They will remember this for the rest of their lives and the history books
h.  I regret that you and the Bush family did not support Donald J. Trump.  The Republicans have a lot to
This tweet isn't creepy at all  sounds like a low key threat from the Godfather himself...
问候老先生。你的家族永远都会鼎盛不衰，因为有很多人喜欢布什家族的家风。我就是其中之一。
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump Very gracious of Senior.
@Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump Mr Bush your actions and legacy continue to be a leading example for all Americans 
Always such class shown by the Bush Family!!
I do respect U but WE SPOKE and will always be reminded how U stood with the corrupt!
You are a Great American President Bush.  God Bless.
NWO elitist warmonger - you could have done something to not fan flames
alot late, but TY @georgehwbush @realdonaldtrump
The US as a whole is in my prayers.
suck a bag of dicks
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump Trump put an END to both the Bush dynasty and the Clinton dynasty. How wonderful!
@BrianSchoeneman @realDonaldTrump Save it! You were against him & your words are hollow.
.@RAndersonUSA Absolutely. Now he's the President-elect and he's got my support. All the whining from the left is confirming that opinion.
That's one thing #NeverTrump & #Trump people can find agreement. The meltdown by the MSM & liberals is magnificent.
.@RAndersonUSA I've told them their reaction is why he won, but they don't get it. They want to point blame. They should blame themselves.
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump to little to late
@noonanjo @realDonaldTrump Let's play a poor taste game here and open the bets on the odds of the use of nukes before 2020.
empty insincere rhetoric from a professional politician.
Bush family has more respect for the Clintons.  That's how ubsurd this is!
You failed this nation by refusing to vote for our candidate. Congratulations doesn't make you less a traitor
god bless you Mr. President. Unlike these low life's who say horrible things #thisMuslim loved you and yours!
bruh.
You should have supported @realDonaldTrump & the movement conservatives wanted. Thanks for your prayers, but not needed! MAGA
@Joey_Buttitta @realDonaldTrump @dacullington.President Bush, ur fam didn't endorse him, stayed true. Trump will needs prayers
@Harlan 
His family is in your prayers?  Classless omission. 

#Disappointed
President #41You're More Gracious Than #hillary Was On Election Night!  Trump Will Be Compassionate Like 'W'!
but you voted for Hillary
God bless you Mr. President. Hope Mr. Trump is half the man that you are. It's time for a "kinder, gentler nation"
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump really??it would have been nice if there would have been more support from the bush family
His family is in your prayers? What about Mr.Trump himself? Pray for him too!
