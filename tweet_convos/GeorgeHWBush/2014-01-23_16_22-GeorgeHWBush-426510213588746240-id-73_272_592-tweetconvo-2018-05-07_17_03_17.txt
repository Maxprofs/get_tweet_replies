@GeorgeHWBush HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa.... only an elitist prig would find that funny.
@GeorgeHWBush Only steal the wealth, which is what you do. Mr. De-regulation. Keep propping up those corporations, and funding those wars.
@GeorgeHWBush Keep Jr. away from the cups of wine, Lord!
@GeorgeHWBush And remember, we don't know anything about Dallas. That was just an Oswald lone nut thing. CIA was not involved. #lies #jfk
@GeorgeHWBush It makes me mad as hell when I hear our vets being shorted so we can support slave labor from Mexico, while losing our country
@GeorgeHWBush Do we look stupid? My dad fought for this country, and my Great Grandpa too. Why so you can give our veterans ins to illegals?
@GeorgeHWBush Texas is wide open why? With all that money following you think  your kick ass state would at least pony up for a fence sir?
@GeorgeHWBush Did you know illegal immigration is a myth? Well it doesn't make sense to court illegal votes, or keep the borders open.
That is the LAST Fathers Day Tie @Pharrell gets from J. Press "@GeorgeHWBush: Barbara and I are grateful to all at #BushReunion."
