Mr. President: I wish would have been old enough to vote for you in '92. Missed it by 2 years. Thank you for your service. You're a good man.
The elder Bush did  decent job. A strong foreign policy helped. Now that man could bring people together. It was a turbulent time back then. But he put together a great coalition. I cannot imagine Trump bringing anyone together. The man is a divider, a destroyer.
Agreed. Bush was more a traditional Conservative with some moderate social views. He did well with his coalition building.
Yes.  However, his ‚Äúread my hips‚Äù line ended up being a issue. I‚Äôve never voted rep. But I think there are many good people out there on both sides. And I really shouldn‚Äôt use trump to gage anything. He is a man of low integrity, the least intellectual individual in the WH.
Yes, your party was masterful in getting him on that. Most amazing piece of politicking I‚Äôve ever been witness to.

Are you going to hell? By being assasin ?
Satan is waiting for you in the hell baby

Jeb is a mess
If only your grandson was as courageous as you. He has refused to show up at candidate forums, meet voters face-to-face and debate his opponents. No one should support a candidate that‚Äôs too afraid or thinks he‚Äôs too good to show up and face voters...
The wheelchairs users ways are inacessibke in US as well as in UK especially in London. There is no access to them and they could not use free movment because of no infrastructure. There is non. They say that Zac Goldsmith could change it because Sadiq Khan does not care.

Can he run for POTUS in 2020
Sir, we stand blessed with your grace.  Thank you for the encouragement.
Thank you for your responsible citizenship, President @GeorgeHWBush . Your moral leadership will always be a part of our national tapestry.
What were you doing at the book depository when the motorcade passed, Mr. Bush?
WTF, what the hell kind of question is that? Mr. President, thank you for your service. My Uncle Marty Flynn spoke so highly of you. I took your call when he passed, my family thanks you for your kindness.
Some conspiracy theorists will believe anything. We didn't really land on the moon, but UFOs have visited & the government covers it up, 9/11 was staged, Elvis lives, the CIA killed JFK & Bush was there, Nickelback makes good music, etc.
