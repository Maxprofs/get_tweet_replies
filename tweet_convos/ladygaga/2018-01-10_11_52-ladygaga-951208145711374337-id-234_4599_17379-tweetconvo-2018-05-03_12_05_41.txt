Her awful tribute was an embarrassment and raked over the coals.

Watched the The Last Five Years documentary on HBO. Tears. 
You were spectacular  like Mr bowie
I was watching it, trying not to cry, but was thinking of you. You are the only one out there with such influence that compares to the legacy‚Äôs of such a wonderful and important role in music and art. I am Thankful for you

Rip Dave
Wow!
Amazing love this
nothing like ripping off a true legend like BOWIE masked as honouring him to boost your failed career absolutely pathetic and transparent

how did you do that

I really do not get why some key figures trash talk this performance. Its so good.
Nossa que massa
Hello baby
He died on my 20th birthday....I was shook
Pls my best artist ,can I get a money gift from you .I don't have money
@ladygaga 
Thanks Gaga! It's so beatifull. Xoxo
love Bowie and your tribute, but even in heaven he can never match your lips
to mind comes this

and what fun was this number for both band and spectators
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWgvGjAhvIw ‚Ä¶
know dabbing in the past again, but there was real class
He is amazing. I got chill bumps watching this
I am honoured and blessed to have grown up at a time when we had true artistes. We will never have the likes of Bowie, Queen, Prince, Berry etc.....again! I feel for you kids.

Thank you for this!!! @ladygaga is a insanely talented artist! I love her since I was 9. Shes the reason I got introduced to Bowie . I see so much talent in her she's amazing she always leaves me speechless. I shed a few tears during this tribute.
David Bowie life from Mars! 
Greetings from Major Tom! 
Ditto that
And baby your just moving on...üïá
Xoxo 
#DavidBowie
My tribute to the legend when he passed.  #youreyescanbesocruel
chills

I still hate this performance . She was definitely going to debut the lead for the real lg5 at the Grammys but then Bowie died..
Would like have whole space oddity that‚Äôs outstanding
Amazing memory!!!
e
Hi

Maby he can sing his songs for god,now he is there,Fame..!
she should‚Äôve just covered all of space oddity it would‚Äôve been legendary
This performance made chills crawl all over me and she was so mythical and I will NEVER forget this performance and her red carpet look
@ladygaga  give us a cover album of your fav classic songs..
Awesome 
Love it 
Was a great fan of David Bowie Legacy will live on.. and remember his great songs he accomplished 
I love Gaga, but you should put a David Bowie photo because you‚Äôre talking about him.

Yes it will long as you keep playing his songs and remembering the true Musical that he was all I'll great instrument musical people who passed away will be remembered because they leave or something behind and leave that music their videos and their songs appreciate
One coolest thing I‚Äôve seen. True artistry I can‚Äôt wait to see you in Vegas
@ladygaga That performance was breathtaking, he would have absolutely loved it, you did him proud Gaga. The graphics were insane too, all of it was just spot on perfect!!!! Goodnight sweetheart. #Bubbledreams, I love you so much Xx
You are amazing 
David Bowie made me know there is other life out there..
Lady Gaga you rock!!!!
This is true ( words are always the highest currency )
What a talent gone too soon he truly was one of the greatest!
Beautiful song
There would no Bowie without fellow #Hull musicians and the talented songwriter,guitarist #MickRonson R.i.P. #Rono !!
I like that effect that's cool as shit
Too bad she left a stain on his legacy with this mess, even his son thought so.
We all miss him so much
Long live Bowie!! 
Amen
Best Performance David Bowie He Will Live Forever
you should make a cover album of @DavidBowieReal #gaga #heroes #BowieForever
Bowie and Prince true artist
Genius
I loves him (original pencil work)
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget this moment... literally a piece of history where Art & Popular culture merged together to create a timeless performance. My girl absolutely slayed this concept.
Not to mention Gaga has always referenced Bowie to her inspiration from the very beginning of her career. I can‚Äôt imagine what an honor it was to salute him through art. Both of them pushed so many boundaries in their craft.
Bowie forever!!
Amazing His music was legendary and so was he
ICONIC!
I'm still gutted, legend, pioneer, forever will be stardust sprinkled over us
@hiudetemilaudio per restare in tema, qui fu fantastica
Vero 
2 years already!? I can‚Äôt believe how quickly the time goes.
Congrats
We all miss hom so much
It‚Äôs been one year. What the fuck?
Love you gaga!!
We are also Mourning in Africa...
What would ziggy say if he could see us now?
Shit Gaga RT 
AMAZING 
Gaga que love you so much 
#PawsUp 
Congrats on the retweet 
Legends never die! I was not such a huge fan but I like him and his music. Same as Chester he was very special in this world. 

He was a master.


That performance, after rewatching, was so much better than I remember it. Amazing! Her vocals were killer!

Follow me please
I love Gaga joanne
Thank so much
Ya. I bet he was the best singer who ever lived
Thx Gaga. I just wish I could see him live or something before David Bowie passed away. But he's not the only 1  Michael Jackson died from doing drugs. So it's ok girl
Everyone is living in the past
I'm loosing faith in you!!!
Memor√°vel performance no tributo a David Bowie. Tudo o que essa mulher faz √© incr√≠vel!
His legacy will continue, congratulations on the rt
