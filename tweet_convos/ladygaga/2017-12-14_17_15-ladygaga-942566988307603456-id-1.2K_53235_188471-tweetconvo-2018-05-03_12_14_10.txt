@ladygaga THANK YOU FOR RT THIS he said to me “you can make my casket now, I’m going to die”
I’ll just self promote since this is big. Follow my IG @brittbwebbars
Please tell me that he met her!! 
I wish!
 I’m sure he had a great time either way. 
He had a great time!
So I’m totally in love with this video! Your little brother is the absolute cutest! Congrats on the retweet from @ladygaga ! His response to it is so funny! Do you mind if I ask which show you guys went to? Just wondering if it was Denver or Vegas cause I was there too!
It was salt lake!
Oh ok cool! Well I hope he had an amazing time! I wish we were at the same shows cause I would have loved to have meet you guys!  Hope your recovering from all the recent fame! Haha!
Hahah thanks!
This is incredible! He’s too precious and you win at being a big sister!
Wait.... are you the Allie Mackay?? You used to do morning news in Utah right? I used to watch you as a kid every morning!
Haaa! Yes! Fox 13, then left and came back to do channel 2 for a few years. I now officially feel old.  Hope you and your family had a great holiday! Your video still makes my day! Xo
That’s crazy!! Wow! Same to you. I have some friends at channel 2
Thanks. He’s my little brother my kids aren’t this big yet. But best I would do the same for them!
LOL YAAAAS
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS

Isn’t he cute
Yes, y’all are too sweet! And ok went VIRAL 
IM SHOOK. Mother monster RT it.
she DID?? wow that's cool!!
Reading the comments, I’m sorry that some people have to ignore the topic and try to link a childs joy with sexuality stereotypes, which wasn’t the point of this video. @runs_w_woIves your child is quite clearly loved, however he turns out. What a great mom! 
Thank you so much for your comment. This is my son & after reading some of the comments I just had to stop for a bit due to the ignorance that some people have. It’s very upsetting looking at this from my perspective being his mom! So again thank you!
Some people have too much time  I’ve blocked a lot of them
A future LGBTQ member! Gaga does it AGAIN!
He's... a child, sis........ let him enjoy music without labeling him
I labeled the “future” him NOT now him. 
This really isn’t hard to understand.
I got it. Not offended at all. Now, I’ve seen some mean asses about my baby bro that I fucking drag tho.
They can ALL catch those hands! Every single last one of them
I’m saying
Ok but what did he think at 0:36
He said he thought we were at dinner during the concert so there was no way to see it
Awe that’s adorable
Like I need @ladygaga  to notice him so soooo bad, I don’t know if she already did it but yeah 
Lol she did! She rt it yesterday
Now I’m crying 
Omg I just realized gaga retweeted this! YOUR BROTHER IS FAMOUS!!!!! Think of all the stories he’ll tell. You’ll never hear the end of it!
LOL
your son is amazing!
Brother, not son. But yes I agree he is pretty spectacular!!!
I really want to know if they got a new frog or not
I don’t think so lol
I hope you guys had a great time :)
We did! It was amazing.
Im not profiling when i say hes going to be gay. Bc. No straight man or kid would wave his hands and be so feminist.
This is amazingly awesome. Hes very precious  and you are a terrific sister 
Thank you 
His wig was about to flew!
Sis he was scalped!
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all year!! Omg! I need video of him from the show!! 
I tried to get some but it was too dark 
after keaton mess my like and rt of this video is pending, 5-7 business days
I totally don’t blame you 
Omg this is the sweetest thing! I hope he had the time of his life! 
He did!
Jokes on you when that email was from Olawafunde from Nigeria and he's just robbed £3k off you. No Gaga tickets for you little man.
I didn't really get an email moron I bought the tickets months ago to surprise him
Ironically this lil gay boy response is the same response you'll get from all ages. I don't understand why ppl like Gaga so much.
fuck you asshole let children live
@paiveduarda
SIMMM! Eu tinha visto. Se fosse eu no lugar desse menino, com certeza teria infartado
This made me cry, I'm so happy for him
He had a great time! We both did!
That makes me so happy for y'all!
i wanna know about his frog
I wish I knew more. Supposedly he passed on from drowning. The kids filled the tank too full

Omg his reaction was priceless hope he enjoys the concert !!
He had a great time!
I'm sure people have told you he's just like a mini Jack. Adorns. Love him!
For real! The best part. I laughed so hard I had no idea he would say that
Wow he couldn't believe it
Why am I in my feels at 7.06am??
LOL 
Reading this as it is 7:07 am four days layer

Gavin and Trenton are The Internet’s kids! It’s official. Approved by the real mothers. 
So it says this video was 2 days ago. Did they go? What happened? Does @LadyGaga know about this lil monster in her domain and his dead frog? 

"Okay then I'm totally listening." 

Priceless. 

And what exactly is that he's attempting to eat, cuz I can't make it out?
Yes we went that night. He had a great time!!!!! So much fun. I hope she does!
What a serious face immediately after north pole, "Thou doth bespoke of a missive from Our Brave Arctic Friends! Milady has the undivided attention of Our Court! Prithee proceed with utmost import to mine Kingdom after the heartfelt lost of Our amphibious servant..!" Adorable.

Illinois Nurse Jill Staneck testifies babies born left on cold steel tables to die. Obama voted 3 times for INFANTICIDE
Many women believe there baby can hear their voice while still in the womb. I wonder does the baby understand they’re talking abortion?
Get your bottles and diapers and hit the road! Or we will send you to Plan Parenthood! Please don’t send me to Plan Parenthood! I’ll get my bottle and diapers
@eddiepinedaz94
omg i cant  who is this little boy? so funny, #PawsUp
us but g-eazy @court_is_short
spot on
well this totally brightened my day since my frog in my classroom died this morning
best part of the video. or when she’s like “it’s from the north pole” *drops spoon* WELL NOW IM TOTALLY LISTENING
i’m cackling
He's SO cute!!
This boy really needs a father. If not to protect him from the filth he would have seen at the concert, then at least to tell him that fanning himself like a girl is not the way to react to anything.
sad part is y did she get his hopes up 2 see Lady Gaga u have 2 be 21. 2 see her no kids allowed. Fake BS for some attention on social media
“well this totally brightened up my day since my frog in my classroom died this morning”
Why can't I be as queen as this boy

Lol he's cute,but I guess he'll into man when he grow up
Too cute for words! congratz on getting a RT from Gaga
All the best for Christmas and the New Year!!!!

Hi
So you @_ChristieBee

@mmkemio 
この人もガガさん好きやねん！
(๑ ˙˘˙)/
@darmal97  is this you
His reaction is so great! All children love music, but every child should should also get to experience a concert firsthand so they can relate on a spiritual and emotional level with others that are having the same experience. I believe that music is the way to bring us together.
Adorbsss
