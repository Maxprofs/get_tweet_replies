Gaga it was FANTASTIC!  #JoanneWorldTourMilan
MONSTERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD ARE SHOOK
YES WE ARE 
Hi  Gaga I am your little monster since 2008. I have my birth dyslexia. I experienced exclusion because of my discomfort. I came to your concert in Istanbul in 2014. It was so beautiful. I love you so please follow me @ladygaga #LadyGaga

I remember when Madonna met her family members for the first time in Italy back in 1987. Thanks to the  Who's that Girl Tour.
Omg you are sooo italian! Ti amo <3
#JoanneWorldTourMilan
então vc é italiana

Te sei italiana come mi som thailandese.
Che falsa! Almeno Madonna era andata fino a Pacentro a fare quel teatrino patetico del ricongiungimento coi parenti. Carrambà ante litteram. Come sempre avanti
Guarda che loro erano andati a Torino a salutarla...
Hai ragione. Ricordavo male. Mi sarò confuso con il collegamento che avevano fatto quando era ospite da baudo 
Cmq i parenti del Michigan sono pure uno spettacolo! 
Voglio vedere! Dove? Come?
Prova a cercare Paula Ciccone su FB. Ricordo abiti e interni da brivido

Beautiful as usual for Lady 
Much like your music, I always find that your best looks are when you're not hiding behind layers because, like your music, it is YOU who elevates the art form - not the other way around. More of this please.
