Barcelona, what a night! 
What about Latin America queen? 
bobby already confirmed she’s not going to latin america.
Did he say why?
he didn’t say why, and it’s not fair calling him names. if you guys remember gaga has her good and bad days. she may also have something big planned for this year.
I doubt she has plans for Brazil and/or Latin America in 2018. After the tour she’ll take a time off and after that she’ll  focus on ASIB and that’s all
and she’s in the works for rock n rio again. y’all need to understand that gaga needs a break too. she loves you all and was probably deeply devastated after cancelling brazil. so please understand her if she needs a break. 
I accepted the fact that she’d cancelled rock in Rio due to health problems. What bothers us is she posting “I promise I’ll come back and perform to you soon” but when is soon? Only in 2019!!??? Why??? We wanted here this year you know? That’s all so sad :(
Amazing Show 
I‘m ready for #joanneworldtourzurich  I‘m so excited to meet you backstage mother monster love you
I'm Ready.  #JoanneWorldTourZurich

Awwwwwwwwww. 
 do you have also a backstage ticket? I hope Gaga will like my Costume
The Custume is Amazing.
Thank you so much ... It was hard work but it was worth it
It's Beautiful.
Queen of not coming to Latin America
BRAZIL LOVES YOU
