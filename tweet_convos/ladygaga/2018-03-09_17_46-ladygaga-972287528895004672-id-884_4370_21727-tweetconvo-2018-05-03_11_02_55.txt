I can’t wait to hear your story either. I’m sure it will be inspiring and heart wrenching as well. Nobody could do what you do with as much kindness as you have without a hard past. We are in this together. I can’t wait to read the Kindness book!
we're honored to have played a small role in the amazing work you do with @btwfoundation. Thank you and feel better soon!
I appreciate non profits that I have seen no help from but are supposed to, that makes things really fun
Thank you, lady Gaga for spreading courage with your work, all over the world

You’re an inspiration to so many! I’m sat recovering major surgery for a chronic condition and it’s my birthday today. My best friend knows me so well. Opened her card today to find this! 
Get well soon and I hope the op was successful :)
Thanks Sheila. Woke after operation wondering if it’d actually happened because I had no pain. Was in chronic pain when I got to hospital. Feeling so much better and hoping it’s a new pain free chapter to my life. It’s a risk I had to take. We women are warriors.
I have every thing crossed for a pain free future do I you. Much love xx
