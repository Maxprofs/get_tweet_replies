@ladygaga you’re so kind and inspiring why can’t everyone be like that 
Thanks for the shout out, you angel!!!! So proud to be there representing you, @BTWFoundation and @ChnlKindness <3 <3 #marchforourlives
I love you very, very much, because we are the world, we make the world a better place worldd within ourselves and our attitudes ....

Today’s walkout was in fact set up by the #Women’sMarch, a movement with close ties to the likes of #LouisFarrakhan, the Anti-Semitic hate-group leader, the “Jihad against Trump” declaring Linda Sarsour, and Farrakhan’s dubious devotees, #CarmenPerez and #TamikaMallory.
You know that Fox is propaganda, right.  That this is all made up bullshit, right?
What's not being spoken...

Lady Gaga has always stood up for the "little guy", those without a voice, and social justice. That is what makes her amazing, and I admire her for that. If you don't find that admirable, there is the door.
