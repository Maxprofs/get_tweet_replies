I'm so grateful you performed this.  Your voice is absolutely brilliant and you could just see how happy you were playing this.  If I could hear an entire album of Lady Gaga performing Elton John songs, I might just become your number one male fan.

Hi Stefani, I'm a French little monster who have 16, and you made my life. There is not an hour when I don't think of you, you are like a goddess for me. I will love you for life. I would be happiest to be able to annihilate a second of your life, if you see this twet.
@ladygaga
Was amazing I love you beautiful
I love it, so mesmerising 
Honestly it was divine...in the literal sense. I looked at my brother and said,  “she is heavenly.” I always told people, “If I didn’t believe in God, I would believe in Gaga.”  #converted 
this was legit so good
Shut up and release good music again.
