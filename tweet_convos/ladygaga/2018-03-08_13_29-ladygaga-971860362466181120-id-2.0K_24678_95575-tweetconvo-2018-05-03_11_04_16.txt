Obg amo r
amor* erros
I made this last weekend
CONGRATS
Thank you!!
IF YOU ARE A STRONG FEMALE YOU DON’T NEED PERMISSION! 
@ladygaga OMG OMG OMG please see this watercolor painting I did of your @vmagazine cover!!!  LOVE U!
not all women have a uterus though - let’s include our trans sisters as well!!!
trans women who haven’t gotten reassignment surgery are still women in every right, even though they don’t have a womb. your logic is also basically counting out every woman who is infertile. over 10% of US women have trouble getting and or staying pregnant.
Today is my bday and woman's day too  Your tweet made me so happy. I  you and miss you!
Heyyy felicidades 
Bonito, mil gracias jo

Hi  Gaga I am your little monster since 2008. I have my birth dyslexia. I experienced exclusion because of my discomfort. I came to your concert in Istanbul in 2014. It was so beautiful. I love you so please follow me …
Some womens don't have womb and that's ok. Don't reduce women in a reproductive organ. You as an LGBT rights activist are lacking respect with the acronym T. Trans women are also women and deserve respect. Review your thought, please. I love you, but....
It's not about your womb... it's about how not all women are breeders, and that's not the definition of strong woman. It is TERFy, and it's in poor taste.
vc quer o mundo eu te dou
#InternationalWomensDay #SheInspiresMe @ladygaga im so proud of you, you make me stronger everyday theres nothing in the world i wanna do more than makes you happy thank you for everything youve done for me i could never repay you hope youll be better soon come back stronger

Nem toda mulher tem útero, tem as trans, que mesmo sem útero são mulheres.
Mulheres é amor, é a União. É a luta nessa sociedade machista.

I thought you of all celebrities would know not to conflate womanhood with sexual organs... I'm disappointed
You are my favorite

Your graphics makes me a little sick.  You have a great voice tho.

Adultery is the most things women's are suffering from
Yesssssss momma. I'm on the edge of glory with hopes we all love each other more. Hate is to many times the answer to most. No judgement is key with all women, men, trans etc.. this gives us all a million reasons to Never walk away from our differences. #love
Thank you  http://Air-Amclothing.com  is my passion .... to make clothes that give women energy power and confidence in their every day lives and be kind to put earth in the process
