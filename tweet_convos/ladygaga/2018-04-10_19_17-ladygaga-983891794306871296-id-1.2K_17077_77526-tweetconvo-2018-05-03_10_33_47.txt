Very nice lady gaga big up
a video on youtube of cardib saying that she would take a tranny to bed to punish her boyfriend is offensive to me. as a transgender woman it is heart breaking for me to see one of idols saying "I LIVE @iamcardib. please let me speak my truth, dont remove my post. thank u nicoco

Paper Gangsta pt 2 feat Cardi B
Nostalgia

Right now
sis you know she's transphobic right...
She is???
No, she's not!
A cis woman who thinks she can use the t word because she has trans friends is a transphobic person.
No they’re an ignorant and uninformed person. Stop throwing around defamatory names like that bc it actually pushes away any person who otherwise would’ve been willing to hear your viewpoint and change the way they see things.
Do you realize how divisive it is to call someone transphobic/homophobic/racist/sexist or anything of the like when you actually have no idea what’s in their heart?
@ladygaga your follow will make me the happiest person in the universe

@iamcardib 
Gaga you don’t need a ghost writer to collab with you. No shade towards Cardi but everyone does her music for her OKUUUR
Ew wtf no we need a Gaga and Nicki collab tf
Cardi B saw this post!!!!!!
So !!!
Stop this Gaga. She’s fake. She didn’t even wanna reply to this tweet.
she replied on insta

My two queens
Cardi B needs to be herself instead of trying to act like Nikki M , and Nikki doesn’t act so trashy like Cardi B !  There is only 1 Lady !!!
wrong.
Me too! Made it out of Whittier Rehab alive.
i am beside myself. As a transgender woman i was completely insulted when she said that i am a tranny and to punish her boyfriend she would take me to bed.  And @Madonna and @Ladygaga think thats cool. I am hurt beyond anymore words.
@Laet__
