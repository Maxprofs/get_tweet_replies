3 years ago today, Lady Gaga performed a breath-taking tribute to the Sound of Music at the Academy Awards. The performance was met with unanimous acclaim and proved how good of a vocalist Gaga truly is: 
Unforgettable moment.

You are an absolute music genius

It was so powerful , I watched a thousand times
Lady Gaga is the best and I like her songs
You welcome

Why is important to be praised? To thy own self be true. What happens when there is none? We're made in the image & likeness to God. Its our heart. It is design to be only happy in holiness, in holy love. Everything else damages it. Of course, to live in holiness is to suffer.
How could we ever forget let’s be real
You made me cry all the time! And I am hard to cry!

Lady GAGA singing #soundofmusic was sensational 
It really proved herself as a singer went well with the release of #millionreasons which #JoanneWorldTour 
#joanne thought had flopped little did she know it would be the worlds most popular song X
When is your movie dropping, Gaga? 
Pure perfection!!!
I love you more than anything. Thank you for blessing me with your presence and music
Dear freind,hope your health is improving my freind honey!!
Hey beutiful, on that night a lot of people saw you talent, that talent that I saw since 2009 (the year that I became a Little Monster)  hope you’re felling good

好希望你能来中国开演唱会啊 超级爱你
You're very welcome!
You are truly phenomenal!!!
I absolutely hate this song.... it's been redone so many times and somehow turned into a Christmas song.... no offense Gaga, just bad choice of song. Maybe something that hasn't been redone at least 40 times notably mentioned on Wikipedia.
Urs isn't included in that list

-Babe I’m home!!!!

+How were your hunting skills?…
Omg q bella! Gosh each and every day u get better Mother Monster. And more beautiful as well
