Best halftime show ever!
pelo amooor
Gaga, that was the greatest halftime and 13 minutes in superbowl history!! I immediately bought tickets to your Dallas show for my wife and I, which was awesome BTW!! And I am 51 yrs old. We love you Gaga!! Even the older group! Thank you for your work with LGBTQ community!!
Hey Gaga! I am one of your Chinese super monsters,we all love you,actually,we wanted ask you have the LG6 quicker,but I have seen your bad body s news,to be healthier! I am 13!
She needs a rest! And after the break she’s going to promote #ASIB, which is really important for her and us monsters. So I guess #LG6 will be in 2019, but she’s been working with @DJWS for a while now, so I guess she will probably release at least 1 buzz single like The Cure!
Blodpop collab this spring
That will be on his album, not hers
Yes but you say we gonna have a buzz single like The Cure
Just the BEST Half-Time show EVER!
Watched your documentary on Netflix 
DESTROY MY HOME
HOLE* OFMGN

You were so fun and calm onstage despite it being such a intense performance- so many ppl watching! GOALS

Was a great halftime show! Of course all your shows are!
Wish

This hardcore tattooed veteran carpenter thinks that that was one of the best halftime shows in the history of the Super Bowl, No one has the guts to make fun of me in person for jamming to my Lady Gaga station on Pandora
That was murder!
暇ですね(｡･_･`｡)

My son is an ArtPop baby  He was only 3 when he became a @ladygaga fan and he still loves her. #Applause   
Wish you did it this year because the halftime show was very disappointing. Yawn.
