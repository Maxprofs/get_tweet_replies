On this day in 2008 Just Dance was released. I was a 19 years old gay guy who had just started living on his own a few months back. #10YearsOfGaga #JustDanceTurns10
The first song that made me fall in love with Gaga was Poker Face in 2009. A few months later I attended my first ever gig, The Monster Ball Tour with my dear friend Laura. I’ve called myself a Little Monster since then and I will do for the rest of my life. #PawsUp
Today not only #JustDanceTurns10 but it marks #10YearsOfGaga’s music, art, activism, creative genius, fashion you name it. Happy anniversary, Mother Monster.
PLEASE COME BACK
TO POP MUSIC
THE POP NEEDS HER AGAIN
AND FOREVER! "POP MUSIC WILL NEVER BE LOW BROW!"
por que estamos falando em inglês garota
pra ela ler e entender, tomar juízo e voltar pro Pop.
espertas
I love you queen, happy 10th anniversary. Can’t wait for the BloodPop collab
keep waiting sis akdjsk

#10yearsofgaga #10yearsofgagatattoos #monster4life miss u
100 times better than Justins
Hey now! Any tattoo of Lady Gaga is a clear indication of her affect on someone’s life. Appreciate it!
What I said your tattoos are 100 times better than Justin Biebers’s

Ah mais oui remet la même chose que sur insta te fatigue pas trop surtout par contre recevoir des chèques de 75 millions pour Vegas ça va c’est pas crevant ça ?
Comment ça ?
ugh, i’ve been with you ever since, it’s been a wild ride but I’ve loved every second of it, hoping for 10 more years with you, Mother Monster 
It’s been 10 years since I’ve been stanning my queen? Omg we’re aging together bb 
I love you so much
You are the best, I'm here for you forever, so proud of you, a true icon, I love you so much my beautiful angel

Queen! Thanks for these past years, and many more to come. Before Just Dance I only listened to punk, 80's pop and visual kei. An obvious transition to become a little monster! You're a true inspiration. Bless.
