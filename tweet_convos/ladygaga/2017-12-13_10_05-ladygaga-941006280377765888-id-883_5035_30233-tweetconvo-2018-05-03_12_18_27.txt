Yess frrr I met her at Fenway!
YOU MET HER AT FENWAY ?!?! OMG WHAT HOW
House of blues :) night 1 at Fenway
omg my dad was at the house of blues night 2 while I was at the concert with a friend. sjsksjks I told him to stay cuz she was coming back and we‚Äôd meet him there but he left.
2nd night would of been very hard to meet her because she announced she was going to the House of Bluse, 1st night she just showed up and it was dead. Got lucky I guess
sjksjsks i know but he was actually in the house of blues while we were at the concert. he bought a flannel from there.
Next time we'll have to go!!!

Will you please come play #MillionReasons in a struggling little town here in Northern Maine? We‚Äôre thinking you and your piano on a log truck parked in the center of Millinocket would be perfect! Call me!
Oh sorry we don‚Äôt have any money to pay you but this town went from one of the most prosperous in Maine to really struggling. You have a million reasons not to come but the one reason you should come is because it would really, really matter.
What a show it seems. Awesome.
So cool!
