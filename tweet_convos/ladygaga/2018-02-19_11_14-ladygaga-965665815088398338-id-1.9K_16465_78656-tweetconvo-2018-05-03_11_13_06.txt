WHERE ARE OUR LEADERS
Golfing.
Yep, just as you said...golfing.

Obama was already on vacation when...


U are assuming there was a real mass shooting and not a govt psy op
2nd Amendment was written by Republican James Madison to prevent  tyranny, guarantee individual rights & freedoms from being VIOLATED.  Madison was founder of Republican party & wanted rights of the  Republic to be extended to all. @DLoesch @JanMorgan_ #2ndAmendment #2A  #FlaPol
SCOTUS in McDonald v. Chicago 2010, gave the 2nd Amendment SPECIFIC protection within the 14th Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms is a privilege of American Citizenship. SCOTUS historically emphasizes limits to federal government & certification of POWER to the states.
Please CALL Majority Whip Senator @JohnCornyn 202-224-2934, Chairman @ChuckGrassley 202-225-3951 and DEMAND the preservation of your 2nd Amendment rights of the Constitution to KEEP and BEAR ARMS. No exceptions. Period. #2ndAmendment #2A #FlaPol
No,the 2 Amendment or any amendment did not say that Americans have the right to ASSAULT RIFLES!  It also says a REGULATED MILLITIA! And not a single AMENDMENT STATES THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD BE THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE!! These children have seen more combat than some soldiers!
What is an AR? Armalite Rifle. What is a rifle? A Firearm. A Firearm  is derived from the word, Arms. Arms is in the 2nd amendment of the Constitution, which shall NOT be infringed or violated. Any questions?
Great analogy, I guess you have to spell it out to these democrats, because the people who own the guns know what they have
Nevermind,  I just realized you are one of these over tanned vapid women who try desperately to hang on to their youth. Nothing sadder in this world than a fifty yr old woman trying to look 20! Go back to getting your spray tan, work on those gluts and maybe you'll pass for 35!
Is Satan your father?
As classroom teacher, I truly appreciate this! Something needs to be done with gun control in our country. Kids and teachers should feel and be safe at school.
The same people that pump billions of dollars into a person's campaign. It is going to cost more for rallies, protest and kids walking out of school than it would be to give teachers guns and train them. Everyone says it is crazy, but I don't hear a better solution.
@ladygaga, 
Being brave and sharing my story. Been battling #Fibromyalgia for 3 years now. You help me become a stronger person day by day. You are my strenght. We got this. I love you so damn much and i hope you see it one day.

I teach at Stoneman Douglas, believe me... these kids and parents will NOT stop until a positive change in legislation for gun control happens! They are FOR REAL and are motivated and are passionate They are #MSDStrong 
So proud of all the students, faculty, staff, and families of MSD.  Thank you for shining a bright light into the darkness
Where are our leaders? I'd rather save an angel down
Please make many songs for us
For marjory stoneman Douglas
“I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders?” - Lady Gaga from Angel Down. ♡   #GunControl #ParklandStudents
This song should be their mantra!
#MarchForOurLives
No...that’s me.
It is to understand that according to original belief a God that is omnipresent expresses itself in all things and that to truly become one with all, you take responsibility for the universe you are a part of. No hate,  no hierarchy, no worshiping something that is external.
I don’t, as I just replied. I don’t believe in a character called lucifer, I believe it what the character represents. So I worship nothing. I simply ty to live my life representing the highest authority I can assume.
And so it is easy to target us as the satanic “adversary” but that is always an entirely subjective view, our definition depends on your belief.
OMG DOES THIS MEAN LG6 IS ABOUT GUNS OMGHSNAKAMAK

That was all we needed, a brave idol, that could speak for us. I really admire u Gaga, thank you for talking about it, and we will keep fighting 
We do. He’s your president.
The Kids are Alright & they are #WOKE
I am very proud to have ONE fine young HS guy in our family who is paying attention.

Yes! If each one of us broadcasts loudly and pledges to support them it will spread. The voice of the majority hasn’t been loud enough. Now maybe it will be.
Money, no, !
Sorry, DOLLERS
In Israel they have an armed guard in every school. It works very well. I would support that 

This is a valid point. I've been skeptical about this particular case since it's clear that so MANY people were warned many times that this young man had SERIOUS mental issues. It's almost as if the FBI knew but took no action because it fit their gun control narrative.
I’m with you!
Then join them in DC, Gaga. And bring lots of friends. This #Resistance needs a strong soundtrack.
That would be Grand if @ladygaga could join them!!!!!
New music and LG6 could fix gun laws
That's not the right moment for this...

Please help publicize their plans. Help get their voice out with action @ladygaga

Loving Lady Gaga! (And just a while ago I responded to someone wondering if there were any good renditions of the National Anthem, I said yes, LG's 2016 super bowl).
We love you Gaga for ur strength and for how you stand for what you believe.
It’s time for a sick concert for these kids. I know you do it Gaga!!!
Educate them 
I think the kids are educating us!!!
They are! They are the future. She is just using her platform to channel the students and young people to educate the leaders.
Hi  Gaga I am your little monster since 2008. I have my birth dyslexia. I experienced exclusion because of my discomfort. I came to your concert in Istanbul in 2014. It was so beautiful. I love you so please follow me @ladygaga #LadyGaga #JoanneWorldTour
Evil intention will kill with or w/o guns period.
Wow, really? @RepChuntley is there a reason u are being so cruel? Have u not been taught that if u have nothing to say then don't say anything at all? May I ask why u follow @ladygaga then if u are so full of hate?
Hey Gaga check out my new tattoo I got in your honour! Your Grammy 2017 look. Love ya
Dope
Thank you
The voice of the #ParklandStudents is deafening. They have my attention and support.
#ParklandStudents  We can #initiate a #ban on #bullets and #cartridges for the #AR's. 
#Protest #manufactures in the US.
As far as those people with huge #stockpiles of ammo, most bullets have a #shelfLife if exposed to #heat, #moisture, & of course #time 
is not on their side.
Agree, if we can't ban the assault weapons, ban the manufacturing of the .223 Cal. Ammo it uses.
When we had a war on drugs, the black market opened up. President Obama sold military weapons to the Mexican drug cartel, opened the borders & let Hesballa traffic drugs through the country.
Guns are your only protection against a government like that.

I forgot what was this queens name sis

u go gurl! tell em!!
PS @ladygaga just want u to know u have four generations who love u and ur talented music! From my 81 yr old mom, myself(54 yesterday!) My daughter who's34&my granddaughter who's 9 yrs old!! My mom has every single CD u ever recorded including collaborations! esp w Tony Bennett
Queen of gun control
Sadly I don't think the "leaders" actually care and that's the sad part. I hope they do listen but there's constantly shooting and they haven't done anything since.  It's sad #guncontrol
Yeah how about we don't listen to you.
#qanon #GunReformNow

Yep. There's more. Look up "Lady Gaga spirit cooking" or "Lady Gaga marina abramovic"

i love u the most of all babe
I really hope this can cheer you up. Having #fibromyalgia has made me feel so lonely, but you, YOU always make me feel like i am never alone. Make me feel like i can keep on fighting, every single day. I love you so damn much. #LadyGaga
@ladygaga, 
Being brave and sharing my story. Been battling #Fibromyalgia for 3 years now. You help me become a stronger person day by day. You are my strenght. We…
Lead us Gaga! We need you now!
Well said! We need more people like Emma Gonzalez! 
Not only @Emma4Change but also @davidhogg111 and @sarahchad_ and @cameron_kasky and the rest of these brave students!
Too right! 
Love ya, Lady Gaga,
I will light a specialcandle for you. Hey I beat a death sentence type illness 8 plus years ago, you sure can do it.
No stress allowed.
#1 thing. Herbal tea, peace and bliss
One thing to remember about this generation. They were as deeply affected by Sandy Hook as we kids of the 60’s were affected by JFK, MLK and RFK being slaughtered. That rage fuels activism still today! I’m so proud and inspired to hear their voices!
May not turn out to be so genuine.
YOU SHOULD STOP TWEETING ..
YOU ARE GOING TO BE LATE FOR YOUR SPIRIT COOKING DINNER ...
JUST TRYIN' TO HELP 
That's a scary creepy GIF
ACTUAL VID 
Gaga I appreciate you so much for talking about this! #PawsUp
Did u appreciate the spirit milking event where she is making fun of black slaves?
Yes that too
Ahhh so u admitted you're racist....apparently to defend lady Gaga you will admit to racism as well. Trendy. Now go watch her sing...oh wait she is a drug addict and canceled and gave refwundsss
When did she make fun of black slaves?
Our president has spoken
They listen alright, but the main question is. Will they take ACTION? We already know the answer to the disgraceful indivdual that's NOT serving our nation who happens to be our "so called" leader. The answer is, no. His answer is: ignore the youth and go golfing, tweet about...
Daytona 500, Tweet about blaming others for Russia and disrespect our FBI who is there to HELP AND PROTECT OUR YOUTH. The same action when he went to their HQ when viewing the wall of hero's. He leaves more of a dirty trail than keeping it clean for the nation to walk on.
yes baby
I agree with you @ladygaga including those who spoke out this weekend people like @KingJames and @KDTrey5
Save America
I LOVE YOU MOM PREACH IT
Yes ma’am
Leaders are parent too
I will march in my city for them!!! #ENOUGH #EnoughIsEnough #DraintheNRA #TIMESUP #NotMyPresidentsDay

Why don't you and a couple other celebrities chip in to pay for their airfare & hotels so more can attend the protests?
 proud to be a fan of yours
No. Because they are controlled mostly by greed.
Where can we go to help these kids and mentor them so their voices will be heard, not just for this week but for the future of this country?
I'll never understand all the hate you receive  you are such a beautiful person inside and out
We don't have any leaders. We listen only to TRUTH. The Parkland survivors are speaking truth to money.

We are starting a security initiative to encourage schools to put controls in place to protect kids while debate rages on. I live right near MSD high!
LOVE YOU QUEEN
Preach, bae <3
So amazing what they are doing. These young kids are incredible, so much braver than our elected officials.
These young kids are incredible and so inspiring!! They want change!! Our elected officals need to wake up now and do something. Enough is enough!!
Love you my beautiful friend. :)
Love you too beautiful bestie. :)
suffering w/ depression & anxiety" I wish gaga knew how much I think about her & she reminds me in my mind to stay strong when it's hard her music helps me to stay calm when I feel like life is to much to handle & I feel like giveing up i know gaga cares & will reach out to this
Live for love.
Not for government agenda.
Do not be a slave to them.
Learn from Whitney
&
Michael
I’m really sorry for those children, but I’m not giving up my #2A rights because the system failed to prevent another attack they had warnings for! It keeps happening over and over as if they want dead kids so they can take our rights away! #falseflag doesn’t mean no one dies!

So... if #Trump/#NRA is "responsible" for #ParklandShooting, then is #Obama "responsible" for the #Orlando horror? B/C I don't recall ANYONE - least of all YOU - blaming Obama for Mateen killing 49 people! #parklandstudents #MondayMotivation #GunControl
The FBI new about both shooters before they took all those innocent lives.
Yet you have an armed guard protecting you.
This is exactly why the rich and elite should not speak on things. They don’t live in a middle class everyday life.  I have kids in school and I’d rather have armed security and teachers at the school. Gun control is mythical unicorn fart
Now is the Time to Do Something about Common Sense Gun Safety Laws

GAGA FOR PRESIDENT
I love you
Will you enact a no armed guard policy for your guards ?
YES

ARMED SECURITY AND SURVEILANCE MEASURES
Proactive legend

If they don’t, these kids will be our new leaders. Bring it on Generation Z. We all support you!
Do guns control you and your life? I bet they do to protect you!
I think these kids are Little Monsters. The way they speak, stand up for what is right, & share their kindness for humanity speaks volumes. Now, Congress listen to them & the rest of America #GunControl NOW! #EmmaGonzalez I love you brave girl 
Unfortunately, NO Trump & his GOP will not be moved. The only way to move them is #VoteThemOut
SENDING SO MUCH LOVE TO THEIR FAMILIES!! I ALSO LOVE YOU SO MUCHHH GAGA!!
The adults in congress are sheep at beck and call of NRA.
Tweeted you... Please help these kids & all willing to help them to get their message out!!
not the current leaders... that's why all these special elections & those coming up in november are so important. we need leaders who will put american lives over the money the nra wants to pay them to keep looking away. somebody has to stand up to the nra & say no more!
thank you for speaking up and using your voice for something good, we miss you sm, hope ur feeling better xoxo
<3
Be quiet, you don’t step outside without Armed Security Detail 
Let’s see how quick you stand with #ParklandStudents and give up your Armed Security,otherwise sit down
Gaga for president
It's necessary introduce #guncontrol to keep the children safe, and Gaga I'm so proud of you #Pawsup
love u queen
These kids will not take no for an answer - we just need to support them and let them know we have their back
Half these kids have ‘gender identity issues’ & can’t figure out what bathroom to use. Pussy-fication at its finest hour.
WHERE ARE OUR LEADERS?I'D RATHER SAVE AN ANGEL DOWN
Where are the parents? This stuff didn't happen much a few decades ago
still waiting on the day when I log in & scream my lungs out seeing you on my followers list

#MarchForOurLives
tell 'em kween

If the #ParklandStudents want to blame someone start at the FBI who has botched cases that led to the Boston bombers, Orlando Pulse, Fort Hood, San Bernardino and September 11, 2001. They knew of Larry Nassar too. The FBI is a political organization not law enforcement.
Follow me pls
We need to support these students 100%. Raising the level of conversation leads to legislation! #Parkland
Considering who is sitting in the White House, I have low expectations :(
I love you
YES 
Love you so much
PLEASE LOOK AT ME MOTHER MONSTER 
I MİSS U TOO  Hi  Gaga I am your little monster since 2008. I have my birth dyslexia. I experienced exclusion because of my discomfort. I came to your concert in Istanbul in 2014. It was so beautiful. I love you so…
#Qanon
Baby, I was born this way!!!
I don't have arms, but still type with my eyes-...
Nothing but respect for my true president

How many #ParklandStudents were taken into a back room and brainwashed by Democrat operatives before they were paraded before the cameras? Democrats don't view the shooting as a tragedy; they see it as the perfect opportunity to launch an all-out assault on the Second…
These generation will tear down Trump's wall. #ParklandStudentsSpeak #WeCallBS
Love u
with the current leaders that america has and the current president, hard gaga hard...
If they don't listen let them hear the sound of losing an election.
a heck of a lot more of role models, than the republicans who fear their donors and the nra!

Sad to see the #ParklandStudents, who have gone through a tragedy that no kids should have to go through, are now being used by the Democrats as chess pawns to take down the NRA and Republicans in 2018. The poor kids don't know any better right now but someday they will!
Let's stand with these students and demand gun reform. Bring a voice to your community and host a screening of Making a Killing: Guns, Greed, and the NRA. #ParklandStudents #GunReformNow
Absolutely!
For our better future, would you remind your Wisconsin fans and followers to send a message tomorrow 2/20? VOTE AGAINST NRA ENDORSED Michael Screnock and FOR @Burns4WI or @judgedallet. Send the NRA a message! Vote! Thank you!
#GunReformNow #ThrowThemOut #NeverAgain
I know you have armed security guards. Tell them to give up their guns first. Set the example, I'm sure folks will follow. So easy to scream gun control from the top of your soapbox surrounded by guys with guns who are paid to protect you.

No, they aren't showing bravery and activism. It was not the gun's doing. If you must protest, protest your school and the FBI. They knew the guy was unstable. Protest kids being on mind altering meds.  #Parklandstudents
We love PoliticGa

There’s battle lines being drawn

IDK, i think they're worried.

Preach it sis #GagaForPresident

Where was the FBI? Where were Dems on gun control when ILLEGAL gunned down Kate Steinle? Let's discuss but stop pushing agenda!
Celebrities should come together to voice concern as well. Show fans our communities that they will use the media spotlight for a good cause.

You should collaborate a song w/ students from #StonemanDouglasHS here in #Florida I KNOW it would be SO #beautiful #Healing Sing they sang called #shine #CNNTownHall
It’s a shame their efforts will be for naught! These youngens will fail because They Themselves will NOT make the changes necessary to end this kind of Violance, We know the present politicians won’t, so it must be their generation that does it!

Lindíssima falou tudo
I really hope we get gun control. Why do we need guns? Why do you need to kill people my friend in Florida was in the school. Why do we need to feel afraid going to school. Why have the anxiety of feeling are we going to be shot. #GunLawsNOW

There has to be something done. 18 mass shooting and it’s only February. I don’t know what’s taking so long
To do what? What law( #GunControl) would have prevented this?  How about we pass law to make the FBI follow up on people like this. #ParklandStudents
#ParklandStudents Being Used By The Left To Further Their Gun-Grabbing Agenda...What Disgusting Exploitation, Of thee shooting victims. Victimized once by the shooter, and the failure if the FBI...Then again by the political left!
We call BS.
miss u
The #Parkland Survivors have been tempered by gunfire. They’ll not be intimidated anymore.
There is only two ways to solve it
There's only two logical ways President and the United States orders all guns except law enforcement turned in or create a new specialized police force separate from local or state. Specializing and staying officers at each school. There is no other way but more lives lost if not
I'm so impressed that on March 17th for 17 minutes kids from all over this country will lay down in front of white house in honor of those who died in Parkland and trying to get Our Leaders to listen!!!! Thanx  @ladygaga for using ur platform to share!!!
Thank you for your strength #ParklandStudents
Gaga, The Parkland Survivors are being used by The Media, School Official's, and Liberal's like you. Sad.
Come join us

I'm on the same page as you Gaga..
Sadly gun control only effects law abiding citizens. What we need is more affordable mental health.
