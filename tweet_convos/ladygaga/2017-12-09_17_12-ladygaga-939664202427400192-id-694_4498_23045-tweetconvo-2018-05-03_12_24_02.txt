A blurry photo of my #JoanneWorldTourOKC jacket that I hand studded. I wore the Mickeys because my makeup didn’t turn out the way I’d hoped 
Fuggin nice
Not the best photo, but I studded our leather jackets myself. My original shoes broke right before I left, but I was wearing white YRU qozmo sky platforms. #fashion
Nice to wear on beach as well.

Wow, people she's a human being just like you. After watching the 5'2 Netflix doc. It shows how terribly unhappy she really is. It made me realize how sad the life of so many of these celebs is. No one can survive long on that pedestal.
How will your voice will sound in space ? 
Amazing show. The best ever!!! #JoanneWorldTourOklahomaCity  #canttouchthis
