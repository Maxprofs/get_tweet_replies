high doses of vitamin D were safe and appeared to temper some of the destructive immune system responses believed to cause lupus.

Why didn't you say it was the date of your aunts passings...
Love your documentary - I always liked you but this made me see your soul ! Wow
Thanks for retweeting
100’s of people said that after watching this music video, they have engaged with a homeless person or got them a bite to eat.
I can’t eradicate homelessness but if through this we encourage a little humanity, that’s something

Prayers!
Many prayers for Joanne.  It is a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the departed that they may be loosed from sin. God bless those who remember the departed in prayer.
My father passed away Dec 12 of 1983. His dad, my grandpa, died Christmas Eve.  He drove an 18 wheeler.  Snow caused him to jack knife.  My mama now in a nursing home with dementia.  I know all about Decembers. My birthday 3rd. I’m sorry for your loss and can empathize
