Students to walk out of classrooms for 17 minutes in memory of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting victims and to protest gun legislation.  
Are you Lady Gaga? In any case, huge respect for you.

I may only be 7 but I dream big & have a voice. I am painting #SunnySeats to honor the souls lost. 17 #sunnyseats with 17 hearts to honor the lives lost. Let us #neverforget   My goal is to start a #sunnyseatmovement @ladygaga @BTWFoundation I am honored to donate these to #MSD

Student fan here!!! Love you mom!!!

My kids did 17 and then the rest of the day for all the past school victims with the leaders of their new group. Which wants safety, mental health and hope for the future
I disagree with this! It is being driven by adults!
Our school Jamestown Highschool did it and we painted our rock in honor of the school and put pictures of the students killed with roses in front of them. This is truly horrific and it’s been out of control for years I’m happy that so many of us are and have taken a stand.

The young will have to save us from the terrible condition the United States is in.

Now they ALL need to be #kind to each other all the time regardless of economics,skin color, politics, religion, appearances, designer clothing, withdrawn or outgoing personalty, etc
