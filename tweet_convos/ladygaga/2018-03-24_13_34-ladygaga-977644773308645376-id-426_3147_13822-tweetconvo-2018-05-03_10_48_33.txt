One more report from #MarchFromOurLives in LA from our OG #ChannelKindness reporter @LadyGaga! 
PLEASE LOOK AT ME GAGA I LOVE YOU SO MUCH YOU ARE MY LİFE I NEED YOU SO MUCH 
Hi  Gaga I am your little monster since 2008. I have my birth dyslexia. I experienced exclusion because of my discomfort. I came to your concert in Istanbul in 2014. It was so beautiful. I love you so please follow me …
We are singing for the world peace, too!
Please listen to our voice!!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

Good thing you know I don't mean everything I say!
Hopefully the youth will lead us to the promised land, but there are still a few stuck #NRA in the wilderness marching around the mountain.
Happy birthday to you our dear mommy monster!!

The Bible tells us to heed the voice of the elderly for they have wisdom and learned experience.

I am praying for you in a kind and heartfelt way. I pray that you will know the love of God and the hope of His calling. I pray for your safety and your peace. He loves you with an everlasting love.
You are so out of touch. And even plugging your stupid chanlkindness. Not self-serving in any way are you gaga?
I wish you had posted about this on Twitter earlist before this happened. I wasn't busy yesterday at all. I was just resting all day.
That wasn't even today was it.. Oh nope ha
Very cool. Cute glasses.


Are we gonna talk about the gun bra in 'Alejandro'?? No??? Ok then.....I'm a huge fan Just thought that needed putting out there.

@ladygaga You are the most inspiring person on this planet to me. Thank you for being you, the kindest, strongest, most beautiful lady inside and out. #Bubbledreams, I love you so much  xoxox
Vote for me Lady Gaga, and help make America safe again.
Helo how are you

Love you
I’ve actually made a fashion collection that shows absurd of violence, guns and wars and really need a help in it. Maybe you’d support young designer in popularization that anti-violence idea #GunControlNow #GunReformNow #MarchForOurLivesdc
I'm so very proud of you!!! Thank you for all you do!!! You are so amazing!!! Love you so much!!!
Thank you.

Thank you for doing this.
Definitely YOUTH POWER

Give over
You’re still young, so we choose to listen to you.
And yet. . .
Ever ask yourself how guns get loaded? Lady Gaga? People kill people, guns don't kill people. More people die by DUI & Planned Parenthood who literally rip apart babies
Except when you are a hypocrite and used guns for "props", right?

Mama lady gaga
Are you still part of the Illuminati spirit cooking gang ?
 Be brave and awesome
Can we beef up security at school? Something more like a concert, movie studio, set of a tv show, or a courthouse perhaps. The ISIS wannabe high-schooler in UTAH brought a bomb to school-thank GOD it malfunctioned!  #GunFreeZoneSittingDucks

You tell ‘em Gaga!
Flipping through my "anti-gun" Lady Gaga photo gallery. 

I love you very, very much, because we are the world, we make the world a better place worldd within ourselves and our attitudes ....
”....it’s a choice we’re making, we’re saving our own lives....it’s true we’ll make a better day, just you and me”  #wearetheworld 
Perfect
You make me so proud 
You and @davidhogg111 are tools. A #gun can not preform a physical action on it's own. And @ladygaga you should damn well be more concerned with what those #muslim so called #migrants are doing to your home, but no you sticking your unwanted nose in #America's issues. 
#2A #NRA
@ladygaga @BTWFoundation @ChnlKindness I am SO proud of you, you do so much to empower young people and to make the world a kinder, safer place. You are so important. Thank you so much. I will always strive to do better thanks to you. #Bubbledreams Gaga, I love you so much xoxox

Are you going to take the guns away from all your bodyguards., miss GAGA.?
What Hippocrates.
I'm sorry What? Sit your a$$ down.

To ignore the youth is like walking down a dead end
You are beautiful
just spent two hours on your birthday edit so i’m not doing it the night before :)
HMMMM
"Take your weapons and shoot" - Gaga
Does your security team carry guns?  Is your house gated and protected? You can't have it both ways GaGa.

I love you 
I love you glasses

What about listening to the people against it?
The freedoms granted to the American people by its constitution have been used to the people's detriment. Government must reign in these freedoms. With freedom comes chaos. We must stop the chaos.

Well done, Lady!
Gaga, you said a long time ago that you wanted to give your fans what they deserve and that was music, we still hope that you get better from your health and give us an energetic album with pop music. we wait for you and you get better soon. I love you #sad
We must repeal the 2nd amendment. Also the 1st. Must not allow those we disagree with to have a voice. 4th must go too. We must be able to go into homes and remove these weapons. Remove 5th amendment. Testify, or jail! Repealing the constitution fixes all!

I am not religious? But I had a friend who was and I think I remember something like, "And a small child will lead us." -Somthing like that. And today proved it.
Faux outrage!!  What about babys lives!!??  Stop abortion!!
Gaga please see this
I think it's really great of @ladygaga to be speaking out about all these issues, she's never been afraid to voice her opinions and spread love and support, one of the many reasons I love her
