@MusicPromosFree @LupusResearch OPB video oficial - PIDE MAS:
Thank you for this Lady Gaga! Your attention to this hopefully will help educate people & help donations to find a cure or prevention. I was diagnosed with Lupus SLE several years ago & it's an incurable disease that most people just don't understand or care to understand.
Love u
This is my personal favorite song you have ever done. This one brings tears to my eyes and fills me with such a good feeling.   I lost my mother in 2008 and that was the hardest thing ever!!This song reminds me of her. I know that she is soaring in heaven. Her name was Ann.
Súper 
Why, there is a cure for this disease.
And many others. Stop donating to these worthless charities.
Just lining corporate pockets.
Feeling 
I love u
saree pahana philia song
this is the best way to end the era remember BTGOG
Invest with human kindness like you keep doing . You will be the one loved by millions

Thank you for your support! I have RA, Fibromyalgia, and Lupus. There is a connection, I am sure of it.

Have to admit I like that song rock on
The Lupus Foundation needs your voice and representation.
Eu te amo muito!

It's too late for my daughter, please find a cure for this horrible disease...

Such beautiful art, your Joanne album has gotten me through very rough times, such as stuck in bed with bad horrific pain. I cry but listening to your music especially my fav song “John Wayne” I sing loud, and the pain goes away. Joanne would have been so proud of you.
