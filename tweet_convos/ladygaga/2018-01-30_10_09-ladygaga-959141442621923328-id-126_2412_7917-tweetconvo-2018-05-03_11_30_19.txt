Thank you Lady Gaga for all you do,
Danny DeVito humored
In a new super bowl M&M ad becoming
A human M&M and asking "do you want
To eat me?"
Reminds me of Lady Gaga's Classic
Classy Sliced Neat Dress!!!

cheers
Eh yes she does. No point in buying tickets and booking hotels anymore. Waste of time and money.
Having a bad fibro pain day and this song, her music are the only thing that’s keeping me from giving up. I love you so much @ladygaga
Thank you so much

A beautiful song, makes me cry every time I hear it, knowing the story behind it...

I cried listening to Joanne. My friend heavenleigh passed away from lupus a few months ago. It reminds me of her. Thank you for creating this. @ladygaga
No, thank you.
@ladygaga @AppleMusic She disappoints again !  #JoanneWorldTour #canceled
Just beautiful.  Losing your loved ones is incredibly difficult, but a 19 year old girl is truly tragic.  My 98 year old Grandma Eleanor just passed and it's been incredibly therapeutic to hear @ladygaga sing #Joanne in such a pure and heartfelt manner.

OK
I can guarantee it’s worse than dirt compared to this Stevie Ray Vaughn I’m listening to. Just saying
John Cages Prepared piano two. On 13, Electric Jaws Harps'.

Piano is the best version 
I hear this song all the time! It's beautiful!

#Monsters Here is the song that I wrote for @ladygaga - #BackHome! Sometimes people want to leave their past behind, and start over! And some people make mistakes, & all they want is to be in a place where they can be…

Perfect perfect Joanne 
When little monsters over flow with creative talent... 
"take my hand, stay, joanne..." 

@ladygaga performance at the #GRAMMYs was just AMAZING! really emotional! thank you for everything,…
