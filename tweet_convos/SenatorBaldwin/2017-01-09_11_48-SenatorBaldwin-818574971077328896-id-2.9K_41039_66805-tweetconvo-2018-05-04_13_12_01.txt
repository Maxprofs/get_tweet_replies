Please do not waiver, the integrity of the Senate is at stake. @mark_rice_ @SenateMajLdr
uh NOT...they still can filibuster which would REQUIRE 2/3rds of Senate to halt and wd
yes and CLEARLY YOU DO NOT!
I'm speaking of the Dems FILIBUSTERING idiot...NOt THE R's...why would they?
Oh go away...I'm not in the mood to explain the government to the undereducated today!
@Veronica @SenateMajLdr Looks like unmitigated obstructionism by Schumer and Dems I have no patience for them. Move along.
so, exactly what the republicans for the last 8 years.
You have to be kidding me. Obama got everything he wanted from the spineless Republicans.
Really?  Shall we discuss a certain STOLEN SUPREME COURT SEAT?
Nice work! Give 'em a taste of their own medicine.
Don't let McConnell get away w. this hypocrisy. These r most compromised Cab. nominees in history. Need vetting.
Me likes @SenSchumer getting sassy with @SenateMajLdr 
No ethics review = No confirmations! Non negotiable!
@scottymac003
If its wrong when somebody does something, what makes it right for someone else to do it? Hypocrisy!
This was great @SenSchumer!!!  Hope @SenateMajLdr Understands this action and will do better!
Brava!!
there has to be more in the file we can return.
We LOVE u, DJT will vociferously fight u but u stay strong because u hv MILLIONS behind u, not him. DJT is inappropriate.
I hope you sent it, just like this.
CREATE LIST of GOP actions &inactions. Advertise the GOP's created new precedent 4 2018
Thank you @SenSchumer. Currently  @SenateMajLdr is impossible to reach by phone. How can citizens make their views known? Don't skip ethics.
Dems need to fight and show what ethics are, again
We are with you Senator Schumer! Do the job you are paid to do McConnell! Put our country before your damned party
Support Schumer #notmyprez
Very well done.  Hard to argue with that without looking like a two faced turtle.
I tried to connect with Senate Majority Leader McConnell to express my opposition to the dismantling of the ACA. Mitch isn't taking calls.
Long-standing & eminently reasonable @SenSchumer unless Congress makes exceptions 'cause Trump has the blessing of Don King, Putin & Yeezy.
and the American electorate
the American electorate voted against him. He didn't win by getting the most votes. @jfreewright @SenSchumer
what ? he won the most states. Hillary just won big in California.
states aren't citizens. He won because he won votes in right places. 75M people voted against him. @jfreewright @SenSchumer
After years of (R) gerrymandering, VoterID restrictions, limiting voting places & days...
Yup
Thanks, @SenSchumer! You're a pro and some of us appreciate professionals doing their thing.
hahaha, really almost as funny as Amy "Leather Special" Schumer.  Fail.
@Sirstu1 @SenateMajLdr this will make no diff. Dems need new strategy bc Repub dont care about diplomacy. Time to get down&dirty
Well played sir!
Well played indeed!
So Schumer, "WHEN" are you going to get around to actually 'vetting' oboma.....???
What comes around, goes around. Touche' Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer.
@hippiemama2002 @SenateMajLdr I LOVE YOU Mr. Schumer!  Please fight for us!  Save us please!
Mitch the Bitch getting slapped. Feels great hey Mitch!
That's right Chuck, both sides of the aisle need to be flushed into the sewer.
@Sirstu1 @SenateMajLdr Repub don't care for our Country just their power!
Thank you. Keep the heat on!

How wonderful that you've awakened from your coma! I hope you're sitting down... Hillary lost! Now we talk about PEOTUS Trump!
WHY!!!!!!!!!
because we're stuck with him & have to figure out what to do now. 
Thank you for fighting for every American and our democracy!
Dear Mitch, put the country before your party and do the right thing... Impeach @stephenbannon to show good faith
McConnell may think all Americans are dupes but WE REMEMBER what he said and want him held accountable.
and now it's burning the Dems
Remember when you pretended you were actually going to follow through on this and fight for us?

 #competence
The utter hypocrisy and epic disrespect the GOP exhibit will forever taint their legacy. #hypocrites
Q: who is being disrespectful? A: Democrats. Tolerant, accepting until you disagree w/their ideology.


Please keep those cards and letters coming #RecycleandReuse
I am loving @chuckschumer with this move, I mean is the reps held to a different standard?
@PaulBegala @SenateMajLdr LOVE IT!!!!!
Maintain the standards or go down in history as being the party to ruin the Republic.
it's like parents that smoke telling their own kids not to smoke. Keep up the good fight!
Don't give the time of day to @realDonaldTrump or his GOP henchmen! #Resist
I'm curious, did Dems honor the requests in McConnell's letter back then?
Great! D's are standing firm, not buckling under pressure, demands from MajLdr. Much respect for D's.
stick to your guns...dont let these verkakte hearings go through!
Now that's real Brooklyn, Senator Schumer! Go at 'em!
: stuff like this is why we NYers LOVE YOU. You make us look good sir!

@AnuAnzu @SenateMajLdr we all know Trumps a rule breaker so why change now
thank you for calling out GOP hypocrisy. Please continue to do so.
is it better served cold?
Thank you for continuing to fight for transparency!
Great Job !!!
#excellent
Exactly Right !!
thank you
Thank you, senator. Keep up the good work!
You, go, Chuck! Great way to give it right back to Mitchy-poo!
First light at the end of the tunnel since the election. THANK YOU for this.
Would like to have been in the room when McConnell open & read this letter.
Thank you @SenSchumer for demanding that proper vetting be completed before confirmation hearings are scheduled
keep up the good work, sir
thank you Sen Schumer for all that you do . You have 100% of my support.  Democrats need to dig in.
What he said !
What's fair is fair.  What u wanted is what we all want
Sick burn @SenSchumer.  Now hold them to it.
Our requests are eminently reasonable, shared by leaders of both parties. I'll return this letter to @SenateMajLdr with the same requests. 
We the people will not stand for your stall tactics.  You are a political thug w/zero respect. Don't stall !!
How many of Obama's were held up?  Do you think @GOP agreed with policy or that POTUS gets their team?
Well done, sir. EPIC troll! 
And stop hanging up on us when we call. Especially if you don't want us on your doorstep tomorrow.
WTF?
@scipioroad @SenateMajLdr Have a fantastic day.

Well played, @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr
Thank You! Let's have the same standards for ALL nominees regardless of party.
this is how the government gets the receipts  using their own words against them, im crine
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr at least you request. . All your friends post demand after demand. Put your opponents on the offensive
hypocrite!!!
Yes, that's a good thing. If they are not vetted, kind of like the GOP's pick for prez, we don't want them
Note the date of Feb 12, 2009. What's the date of the first hearing? Rush job?
Brilliant!!!
If ur 2 old & out of shape 2 handle the meetings...find another career. Or find out what @realDonaldTrump does!
thank you
Chuck you are AMAZING!  @SenateMajLdr
Fine idea, Sen. Schumer. Thank you!
@MitchMcConell I'm sure he will give U the same respect u gave him
Sen Schumer 2020
.@SenSchumer make sure Don The CON is a One-term President or is impeached, whichever comes 1st. @SenateMajLdr #JeffSessions @CoryBooker
@kyleighhewett
Thank you Sen Schumer, proud to call you my Senator!
 As 1 of your constituents, I'm cheering you on and urging you to keep at it. Looking forward to response from @SenateMajLdr

El Cártel de Trump y Putin

amazing trolling of 2009 Mitch McConnell with 2017 Mitch McConnell
keep up the good fight. Don't give in ... ever!

Please get those giant boards from Bernie and plaster these all over D.C. Tomorrow.

Don’t punk out on this. Do it.
#holdtheirfeettothefire
Perfect!

@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr #Trump S president. Stop being jackasses and get along!! #DemocratsForTrump will never return to #DNC
WE WANT THE SAME... AND WE DON'T WANT THE SHAFT
Thank you, Senator - PLEASE be relentless. Merciless, in protecting our democracy.
yeah baby. Enough with the lies, why don't these guys have to be vetted. What makes them special ?
Absolutely... use their own words. They can't fight that
I mean, they will, but to sane people it will be rage inducing.
@TimothySandefur @SenateMajLdr I'm curious, what was Mr. Reid's response to Mr. McConnell?
DEMS have to stand up to Bullies like @SenateMajLdr! Hypocrisy at its best! #GOPCORRUPTION
That's hysterical,
Who's the clown now?
We're counting on you
to hell with this letter to @SenateMajLdr. The USA might be putting a Russian agent into the White House. LOOK INTO THAT
Thank you. The American people are with you. Fight for us and we'll fight with you
You should cockblock just like the  @SenateMajLdr did for the last 8 years. What comes around goes around, right Mitchy? #evil
What's good for the Goose, is good for the gander!
@quinten488 @SenateMajLdr It's time we stopped fighting and bury the hatchet. Fake pundits and Hollywood royalty want to rule
lmfao ok Chuck you win this round.
Keep the pressure on. #ThanksChuck
@kurteichenwald @SenateMajLdr  thank you!
From this point on, all of my children and pets will be named Chuck. #ChuckSchumer #Savage #DemForce
.@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
I thought that was rather brilliant in its simplicity.
... You got pwn3d Mitch
is this true?
Nice idea ! tit for tat !
couldn't write your own letter? This is childish
you do not mess with a New Yorker! Take them all to school, Chuck. Cheering you on.
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr be strong.  I've never seen such stupidity coming from the Republican party.   What a bunch of idiots.
@realdonaldtrump
Also, hiring son in law is federally ILLEGAL!!
HYPOCRISY is the fuel of the GOP! #crookedgop
Thank you @SenSchumer.
I made some changes, so it is ready for @SenSchumer's signature. 
@NormEisen @AndreaChalupa We we're laughing about this last night! Too bad Chuck didn't use pink
point: Schumer.
W to the O to the W. Long term memory coming in handy for ya, Chuck?
trump should release his tax returns, can you release them for us?  How about Wikileaks?
.@SenSchumer -- well played, sir.  Well played. Please continue to #ResistTrump
Thank you for standing up against unethical behavior (not to mention blatant hypocrisy)
thank you.  Fantastic.
thank you. Delay hearings until full ethics picture is available.
Americans expect no less. thank you.
Go get em @SenSchumer
nicely done, Sir.
Nice!!!
fully agree - standards should not be partisan. Trump dodged traditions w/taxes - this should not set the tone.
and this should be in Republican's best interest - follow due process, do the due diligence, no blowback later.
u are the Minority Leader and Gop has majority and has the voters behind them so don't push to hard
Every dem senator should begin questioning w excerpts from it.
Thank you Sen. Schumer! Tired of hearing that we need to get over it & move on when the same was done 8 years ago.
"You use my own words against me," Ebenezer Scrooge, A Christmas Carol
Yeeeeees
well played @SenateMajLdr yes ur a #hypocrite #SwampPeople
Please Do not confirm until applications are complete and background checks are done.
Love it. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

Mitch doesn't want vetting. Wife Elaine's father's company caught shipping coke; huge conflict of interest for a Sec of Trans.
THANK YOU SENATOR SCHUMER!!!!
thanks Sen Schumer! ethics are important in confirmation process
Keep calling out the GOP hypocrisy Senator Shumer #TheResistance #ResistTrump #Indivisible
u forgot to change the date tho
Seems only appropriate...... now about that SCOTUS seat.... hmmmm what to do, what to do...
Chapeau Senator!
@zeitgeistbabe @SenateMajLdr Now that's the backbone that we are expecting you to have. Remember when works ALL the time
You sir, are a steely-eyed missile man. Not you, @SenateMajLdr
please don't back down. We are tired of GOP using one set of rules for everyone but themselves. #WeGotYourBack
yes! I applaud you for continuing to hold their feet to the same fire they built in 2009! Don't give up
Bwahahahaha! Awesome!

@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr don't confirm anyone until they provide the required documents. Don't let them get away with this!!!

THANK YOU!
@BernPress @SenateMajLdr #BringBernieBack
THESE are the actual "Russian spies" influenced, not just this election, but every other election.
Thank you Senator! We can't allow nominees to be rushed with insufficient vetting, ethics & security clearances!
Hey @SenToomey 
Just making sure you got this!

Pennsylvania #VotersAreWatching
The best- "There, I Fixed it" I have ever seen!
I LOVE it!  Sent Mitch the same letter he sent to Harry Reid in 09 about vetting nominees.
Well done Minority Leader Schumer!!
Brilliant.
