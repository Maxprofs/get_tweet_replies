Fight the good fight, Tammy. Your Aussie cousins. http://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MAHBBlog_TaxingDenial_JCribb_Dec2016.pdf …
@AndyRichter @POTUS Obama set precedent for executive orders because he thought H would continue them as pres. #Backfire!!!
@POTUS44 signed less EOs than predecessors #facts now there's an #illegitimate leader in WH

point? Not indicative of all votes- winner take all system is not accurate reflection
Wait until it's investigated! Oh, boy!
we need extreme vetting of a Sen Baldwin's brain scan. This is vapid, empty, talk meant for sheep. Facts>Feelings
@gullsimpression we need Trump to go through the same vetting as an immigrant so his ties to Putin are made public.

.@SenatorBaldwin Will you do it please? Can you please vet the EOs? All we can do is call reps and demonstrate.
Just do YOUR job.
we literally vet our refugees longer than we vetted our #puppetincharge
How does the ban make ISIS stronger??
That's complete BS! TravelBan will serve numerous purposes which will enhance the WeakSecurityMeasures in place now!
also, ignore the Trolls! 
Resign! If you are not supporting the safety of Americans over people we don't even know, you have failed at your job!
Right now it's nice to be proud of someone you voted for!
Yes! We the People are very proud that POTUS Trump has kept his promises! Unlike career politicians who continue to lie, every day!
He's an lunatic. Sorry you felt the need to dip into my compliment.
I'll wager not. I'd still like to think that voting red doesn't mean you support hate.
The hate is clearly from the Dems. Why we left the party! All rich elites stealing from Americans! #Enough
I'm sure you asked the same of Obama right?  Bet you were ok with we'll find out what's in it after we pass it?
Thank you for speaking out !!!! #TheResistance
U have no authority to stop his orders. When did u stop obama's?
Which intelligence authority told u a travel ban (which it is not) would do those awful things?
We need extreme vetting of POTUS: #25th amendment
So you r saying that a 3mo ban is going to make ISIS stronger than they already were under Obama. LMAO
Senator when OBAMA forced Trans laws that violated women's privacy & states rights. what did you say?
what privacy do trans persons' rights violate? I don't feel violated. #GrowUp
Your lack of feeling violated does not mean you have to right for violation my rights.
just bc you perceive them being violated doesn't mean they actually are
I have the right to be not seen my men in the bathroom . men do not belong in female bathroom
bet you never knew Trans were there. Get over your hatred.
The hate argument is about 2 go down in flames.right 2 privacy comes B4 scotus
who is doing the hating here?
Please call immediately for removal of Bannon from NSC and WH #NoBannon
But now we must ask;  do we "Vet'' the President or the men standing in his shadow.
Thank you for hearing the protesters and for doing what's right! We need you to rally other senators to stop Trump. 
@dleemar @POTUS Snowflake 
Another #TrumpAssLicker that thinks it's 'like smart'.
I am a Business owner in America. Right now all the women in government are embarrassing America. Step down.
Baloney. Stop the lies.
The refs have been taken out of the game, who can we count on for accountability?
liberal propaganda, you are nothing but a lifelong politician without any passion for the right thing
could some1 do extreme vetting of president??? No tax returns, BS health report etc. he's more dangerous than any refugee
Thank you Senator Baldwin for standing up for what is right and voicing opposition. Stand strong!
@CindyDPishere @POTUS Thank you Senator Bakdwin
It's amazing how Trump gets snarky with the Pope himself when his ethos as a Christian is questioned, because --->
--> there are a lot of Christians in the banned countries, who are being persecuted and murdered by ISIS.
Thank you Senator!
You are my senator and I want you to vote against all Trump cabinet nominations.
I support President Trump's very wise choice of the ban!
Oh really Sen Tammy Baldwin? Did you check out Canada news today, a refuge in a week,, kills how many?
thank you for upholding our constitution and speaking out for justice and equality #NoBanNoWall
Thank you for speaking out! Bless you.
The Democratic party is extremely weak speaking out the Democratic message.  That needs to be  fixed!
WI has many refugee families, and that is all you say? You need to do more than vet, you need to fight for your constituents
you said it. This is a scary time but you bring hope
@PoliticalBee @POTUS
Im so sure ISIS is using this ban to recruit more people. As we let them die, they offer them life as a terrorist.
Thank you Tammy. We need checks and balances more than ever before.
yes please!
@meganeellison @POTUS everyone who didn't vote for him knew this would happen. Those that did vote it's time to wake up
Thank you!  We need your voice to protect our democracy.  Push back hard. WeThePeople are with you.
once the terrorists are here, how do propose to remove them? Look at Germany. America First!
This is Hateful!! Dems should have an emergency meeting about this. NOW!!
@IndivisibleMad @POTUS Go for it Tammy. We are with u in Madison.
shouldn't you know how stoopid that is
What is with Steve Bannon, Sen. Baldwin?  How can such a person be in the "room where it happens?"  I am so angry.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!!!! 
thank you for speaking out
@skness5561 i thing we should start with extreme vetting of some Senators... Who and how much pays them
Amen!  The hypocrisy is unbelievable!
@NealBabcock @POTUS Start Impeachment process NOW. Please and thank you.
thank you for speaking out!
Yes. Please. @SenatorBaldwin @repmarkpocan @SenRonJohnson @SpeakerRyan
We need extreme vetting of @POTUS' Exec Orders before he signs. Travel ban will make ISIS stronger, weaken counterterrorism and cost lives.
you and the rest of the legislative branch of government are either bowing to this or not fighting. Why start now?
Obama banned refugees from Iraq for six months in 2011. For some reason there was no blue checkmark meltdown then.
Obama didn't stop greencards and visas from returning to USA,  these actions are not quite comparable.
From a WI constituent, THANK YOU for taking a stand on the side of American values.
Muslims & refugees are a part of our community.  @realDonaldTrump  #NoBanNoWall
Thank you, Senator Baldwin!
not strong enough!!!! We need you! Please! Please! Please!!! Help US not him
Get Bannon out
You are my senator and I want you to draft legislation today to stop this illegal ban!
@MarthaPlimpton @POTUS I've been saying tht 4 ages. Treat people as terrorists wot do they have to lose?
proud that @SenatorBaldwin is my senator.
that's your opinion Senator & u r just promoting fear mongering instead of solving issues u had a decade term limits
Thank you for speaking out. I am outraged about what is happening!Put your words to action! #nomuslimban #RESISTANCE
Please Please PLEASE DO SOMETHING! T---p will be the end of us. All of us.
@meganmckenzie94 @POTUS POTUS is insane and must be removed before he destroys himself, the nation and the world.
Thank you @SenatorBaldwin! Detaining lawful U.S. residents is #illegal and #unconstitutional.  @POTUS
@AndyRichter @POTUS Don't just talk about Madame Senator.  Put your words to action
@AndyRichter @POTUS thank you Senator Baldwin. Please help us #resist
yea,troops on the ground!! He doesn't give a shit about anyone of it
@AndyRichter

@POTUS is crazy.
@AndyRichter @POTUS 2) This idiotic order now puts troops at risk
@AndyRichter @POTUS 1) if #presidentbannon's goals are to create a colossal ME war, this is how you do it.
Tell is what you are DOING.  Bannon is taking over LEGALLY.
@AndyRichter @POTUS And his Taxes?
your opinion is #fakenews
how will it make ISIS stronger? ISIS believes in literal interpretations of Islam, with or without Trump
@MarthaPlimpton hi. We need Bannon out of the WH. We definitely did not elect him.
Ready to vote against Trump's nominees, Senator?
and please explain. How is that?
Here's a novel idea, how about no votes on all of his appointments also. Show us this "resistance" of the Dems. #HypocriDems
As your constituent, I thank you for speaking out against the #MuslimBan. Please obstruct ALL @POTUS nominees. #NoBanNoWall
We do. We also need Senators to follow the example of @SenGillibrand and vet, with extremity, @SenatorSessions and the rest! #resist
#StopPresidentBannon
Thank you for your leadership! We need more US Senators like you!
I don't think there's been enough extreme vetting of far mor dangerous people - cabinet nominees @SenatorBaldwin @AndyRichter @POTUS
@geekie0724
please stand up for our democratic ideals.  our country needs you!!
Thank you for taking a stand Sen. Baldwin. Your constituents appreciate it.
You going to have tons much better than words.  The DEMS in the Senate are far too passive right now.
Tammy executive orders will finally keep our country safe. Maybe you should travel to Syria and spread ur 
How w/president bannon in charge of @realDonaldTrump & racist staff & cabinet? @MoveOn #Resisttrump #NoBanNoWall
Great statement.
So true, but what are you&Congress doing about this?  Trump Admin defying court orders-Congress needs to #TakeAStand
tammy, buddy, he already signed it @SenatorBaldwin
Then do something. Form a Democratic alliance and do something!
What US Generals & Expert Strategists are you talking to @SenatorBaldwin? Let the @POTUS do what he promised us!
.@SenatorBaldwin what's your plan of action to keep him from signing more dangerous, ill-conceived, and in-vetted EOs?
isis is very strong，we need to stop it！
.@SenatorBaldwin Then DO SOMETHING! Invoke 25th amendment, get house to start impeachment, something, not just words! @pinkbunny70 @POTUS
Thank you, you are absolutely correct!!!
Wisc. voter here. I agree with your tweet. Please show strong opposition to this muslim ban. The USA is built on immigrants.
.@SenatorBaldwin no more votes for @POTUS nominees. Mattis was complicit in this
Thank you for speaking out, Senator Baldwin.
