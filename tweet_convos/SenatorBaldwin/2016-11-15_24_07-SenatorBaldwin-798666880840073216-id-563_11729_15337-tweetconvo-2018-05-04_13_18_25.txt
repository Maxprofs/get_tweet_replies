At least we agree that ST is awesome. Roddenberry was a great progressive visionary.  BTW, Kahn lost.
we've got them just where they want us - James Kirk
I'm not a dem. But in fairness, they did win pop vote by more than 1M votes. So, you have a problem.
You backed Hillary the most corporate of the corporate candidates you don't have a leg to stand on.
he picked a kick in nutz to picking a bullet to head. Both suck and want neither but have to pick less deadly
tinfoil
Who is he supposed to have help find capable people, Aunt Harriet who never worked a day in her life and knows nothing?
yes, I'll take aunt Harriet over some shill.
Careful, Don, there's gators in there.

#DrainTheSwamp
There was no swamp until dt started building it & now it is over flowing with bigots.
Hindsight is 2020!
 part of the #swampdwellers. Lifetime in govt,  millionaire w/ 3 homes
Go with your wife and bankrupt another college, k?
Sanders, all who are on the list have zero influence and make no decisions. #Tatiana
God save America! God save the 'poor' who voted for Trump! God save the climate! God save the world!
god gave america only chance of saving itself by sending his only son Bernie Sanders for 2016. Next 4 yearishopeless
he's bringing in ppl w/ experience  name one bill u passed, one  good thing,  u praised HRC email no worry?Benghazi?
Why's it that Bernie is the only politician being outspoken about what is happening? Aren't others as outraged as he is?
@NaturalRadical thank you for making it easy and plain to see. No conspiracy here, all out in the open!
if u were this aggressive with #HillaryClinton & the #DNC @DWStweets u might have won the nomination #EmailScandal #PodestaLeaks
sweetie, @SenSanders was never in it 2 win it. He said from the start he was a place holder, to make it look like #HRC  ran.#setup
Mr. Trump will make America fascist, rasist country. Hope he'll be impeached very very soon!
@MichaelKeaton Hip waders won't work, can I get some that go up to my neck?
Trump has blindsided the voters to get elected.
I have two college degrees, and two jobs. Neither pay a living wage. I am on welfare.  I am very scared.  What should I do?
be creative, start your own business! Do what u love $$ will follow!
If we're forced to have Trump, the least he could do would be to drain this swamp:
McConnell has terminal soul cancer
I guess it is a matter of who you think is Swamp. :/
This is an unconscionable list of people.
You must be kidding, right? @Normsmusic
and he did , flooded all the Dems right out !
all those guys have now been removed from the transition team cause Chris Christie was the original head of the transition team
I'm proud to have voted for Trump - Pence
Sanders couldn't even stand up to Hillary and corrupt DNC. You have ZERO credibility!
Trumpster Dictionary Volumes 5 and 6. The expression "draining the swamp" actually means filing it with #ToxicPeopleAndStuff
@bengleib Thank you so much Bernie and please keep us informed with as much inside info that you can.
Big surprise, business as usual. People played again.
With respect, corruption is business as usual, but fascism is something more than that.
They have all been fired Bernie. NEXT!
lordy gody
#DrainTheCesspool  not #DrainTheSwamp. Swamps are good. Cesspools are bad.

@Pat_n_STL

Swamp Trump...
@realDonaldTrump

Only a non-lawyer can RESTORE THE CONSTITUTION.
takes one to know one..nyahhh
so you admit there was a problem?
Can you give me your list to compare and contrast had you won in the General Election? I would love to see your choices.
we all knew he was a liar but people didn't care because they hated Hillary to much
Are we sure he said '#draintheswamp," and not "reNAME the swamp," @SenSanders? Sanders to Trump @bengleib
We need to do the same with the DNC. Drain the swamp of Wall Street donors.

According to professional factcheckers, @realDonaldTrump told far more lies during the campaign than most pols. Do Not Normalize Trump #DONT
if u continue to listen to MSM you'll continue to be lied to. Wake up! Pence is already firing all these corp lobbyists. MSM sux
@bengleib we also need a chart of how many times his team has been divorced and remarried.
Prove that u can do btr! Also who sd its written in stn! Talk abt YNG IGNRNG PROTESTORS PLZ!
He's not in office yet. Give him a chance.
Only six removals here.easy
@dustinthomasXO He'll fill up our lands with dirty oil. Just look at the speech he gave here in ROC sympathizing w polluters
@bengleib 
He's gonna replace it with another one of his own..
He's flooding the swamp.
@SamuelStringman ..do what they like. So, yeah. Trump USA will be #neoliberalism on steroids.
@SamuelStringman, Neo-liberalism is about the wealthy not paying anytax; privatizing EVERYTHING! Really letting the wealthiest..
@SamuelStringman (2/2) former member of Project for a New American Century - a think tank that wanted to invade Iraq ect.

Wtf, Bernie. Stop pretending there was ever any credibility to any of his "promises"! You can't really be that obtuse!

Looks like Mike Pence sent them packing. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/16/pence-removing-lobbyists-from-trump-transition-team.html …
Pass along so more can be informed of our government being shaped -- misshaped, haphazardly-shaped, blatantly-biased shaped...
Saving image for reply to trolls.
Trump said in biz he overstated/oversold to get people excited, that's why he went bankrupt so many times, he's a con by nature~
- How'd you buy a 3rd house? Make alot of money in your 20's and 30's?
let him get sworn in first you twit!
#WallStreet #Schumer isn't exactly a progressive move by Dems.
Too bad Mr. Sanders was too shortsighted during the primary to take this possibility as seriously as I did...
@DykstraDame
Correct but you Mr. #Sanders didn't stop the pain of #Clinton #neoliberalism also,betrayer!
Dear Liberals: the pain of Clinton neoliberalism caused the rise of Trump. To survive, we must build an economy that works for all of us.
Yes @SenSanders all should have known it before but who needs a betrayer of the #TwoPartySystem?!

Hello?! Did the Donald mean ANYTHING he said?!
filling it back up with snakes.
I give the clown .@realDonaldTrump only4 years if he's not impeached sooner. He sold his supporters a bill of goods & they'll c.
@BernieSanders  Bernie Sander=Sold out to Hillary and got a nice lakeside  house for it. Hypocrite
Draining the swamp only to replace it with different swamp water.....pitiful!

Trump's voters are expecting that he is going to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain he is actually setting them up to be shafted "bigly"
He's draining the swamp so he can fill it back up with his own special toxic brew.
#PooptheBed + #FilltheSwamp = #PooptheSwamp

great Bernie, he will need many reminders
all great picks to me and the millions that voted for him.
These are temporary positions not cabinet or staff. I do appreciate you keeping his feet to the fire though.
There's an odd smell drifting across the Atlantic.......
get 'em Bern!!
A consultant from Verizon to head the FCC?????? Are you kidding me? Why not have Charles Manson run mental health care programs
Working for any firm bailed out or being a consultant to F500 firm should bar from transition team? #NoToCareerPoliticians
@MichaelRosenYes Not fair; the water level is bound to drop as all the swamp monsters move out and into government.
so has #VPEPence eliminated the lobbyists or not, @CBSNews states the lobbyists are gone? #DrainTheSwamp
Yes, Trump will have all the monsters in the swamp. He lied to his supporters. #NOTMYPRESIDENT
Anyone who believed any promises Trump said was living in Lala land!
THANK YOU! I appreciate the very explicit meme.
quiet now,facism luego. DEMS BLIND
siphoning swamp into white house..
Start by firing Steve Bannon!
appears to be pissing in while drinking from it!
oh Bernie why don't u run for head of dnc
@SenWarren The Swamp only gets murkier and more polluted under Trump. Eternal Bog Of Stench!
why couldn't you have been president
@Walthamama It's President-Elect Trump.
Bernie you're the reason that Trump IS president, as your followers never got a real message from you, on how they should vote
If by #DrainTheSwamp he meant fill up the leadership with corporate tools, the Racist in Chief is on time and under budget . . .
yes,  we need to drain you. 1 written bill in 9 years is pathetic.   How can u look yourself in the mirror and cash a gov check?
you are a sellout. Only question is were you bribed or threatened? Went from revolution to Kool aid drinking DNC man. #sellout
@OurPoliticalRev we need a shut the country down protest. Everyone who wants to make a difference needs to band together
you are a sell out - no voice loser.  Got any more supporters you can sell?  Clinton"s boy.
@liz_dry he had Pence remove all lobbyist from the transition team!
You mean Trump is a typical, hypocritical Republican? Too bad Clinton wouldn't let Dems make that case. http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-08-29/clinton-tries-to-separate-trump-from-republicans-worrying-some-democrats …
He only meant the left side of the swamp, he's building a wall in the swamp to keep the right side from draining. Predictable.
He should use you and your new lake house as an example

#DarinTheSwamp then #FillTheSwamp...

We need a staff of outsiders that will not run him like a puppet.
he is draining it, the left just doesn't like it
He's going to do what 99% of all politicians do; Lie, cheat, and steal while lining their pockets for themselves and their pals.
@MichaelKeaton Might want to wait till the cabinet is announced since as of Tues night Lobbyists are being purged by Pence
@OurPoliticalRev Like Hillary wasn't a corporate piggy. Tbh I'm just glad we got rid of her.
HES NOT EVEN IN OFFICE YET
yr silence was deafening when Hialry/DNC/SOROS billions you endorse her bought off 600vachouse.@LouDobbs @KellyannePolls @Reince
and, it begins
given his background the response from @realDonaldTrump would surely be "Caveat Emptor" and perhaps he would have a point?
Good luck with that.
@realDonaldTrump Did you hear @TrumpWithUSA !
@eddireader think of it as not draining the swamp but opening the cesspit
Trump showing how 'anti establishment' he really is...
sometimes you have to use the shit that you have available, kinda like debbie schultz & dnc
Would the line up have been different if Hilary had won? Like our @UKLabour fix your own party, then be a credible opposition
no government experience. Americans why ??
novice. Nothing to offer the American people. America's greatest mistake.
Coming from the person that soldout to hillary?
what a surprise he lied please continue to fight; know that millions are behind you supporting you
@MichaelKeaton 

Someone needs to explain to him, that filling the swamp with alligators, is not the same as draining it!
@AaronBastani  these Pfizer lobbyists seem to pop up everywhere.
how come I am not surprised?
Crooked Trump 
@VanceNguyener I don't know where you get your info from... http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-transition-team-lobbyists-2016-11 …

YOU SURE ARE WORKING HARD FOR HILLARY CLINTON MR SANDERS,

AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A GUN TO YOUR HEAD ANYMORE!

VERY TELLING!
@daveweigel looking sludgy and odor reaches my sunny town down south
This is sad, sick and just wrong #lies, #anti workers, #swamp becoming  #cesspool #sewer
His promises are worth nothing. He is a fraud and a snake oil salesman. His voters will find out the hard way.
he's filling his own swamp. I guess it's OK then.
, see he makes decision only best for him, not for others.
I love you Bernie, but your swamp looks a bit murky lately too.  #Demexit
in the U.K we have NOBS X
meet a Farage supporter
meet the wife he hides away
what are we going to do? Bless you as you speak out for America.
meanwhile the stockbroker fascist Farage known as Nigel ...
We really need you more than ever, @SenSanders Thanks @MichaelKeaton
@MichaelKeaton Hey Bernie, are you onboard? You're whole campaign was about ridding politics of corruption. Things in common
Instead of hating who he picked,Maybe suggest who he should pick,I mean you lostYou got screwed by you're own pty
USA problems are not corporate entities but their actions that could change with appropriate policy. Give trump a chance.
@MichaelKeaton T's first promise.....broken #VotersGotConned
- He is filling the swamp with the human equivalent of nuclear waste.
it couldn't be that he lied just to get votes could it???
Trump is a monster, at home in the swamp & gathering an army of monsters to terrorize America... #BeAfraid
Expecting him to hold to his promises is only setting yourself up to let him drain your patience.
...that's telling him Bernie wtg...woo hoo... waste of time
having Goldman Sachs in the treasury is like asking a RAT to guard your CHEESE!
Why is anyone surprised? Trump has been talking hot air for 18 months. He was always going to fill his Admin with cronies
Trump is more of a monster than someone looking to save the middle class.   #deception #CrookedDonald
@railrunnah Gotta give him props. He's being vEry inclusive. O.o
Read this book: The Wrecking Crew: How Conservatives Ruined Government, Enriched Themselves, and Beggared the Nation
Bernie, so glad you are fighting to call this out!
America was hustled by a greedy billionaire. He wants his kids to have security clearances and run his businesses. #stayalert
we are so screwed
Trump is doing a fantastic job.
ohhh Kimie. Smh.
I think I'm shaking my head at you. Unbelievable
