@MomRovin find a candidate to run against her NOW
voted no! It was @gop @RonJohnsonWI that voted yes- the 48k DeVos donated to him bought his vote. Disgraceful.
@Peggy7172 It is not "quality" education. It is a communist instituted strategy to control the youth. Shame on you! America1
holy cow, your ignorant
we need to teach about talking snakes in biology, virgin births in health class 
thank you for your vote. I am deeply troubled by @SenRonJohnson vote. I will not forget #WeThePeople #shame #noDevos #why?
@wisconsinfoodie and yet she's in so much for you vote!
huh?
too bad Ryan will not stand up as you have to defeat such an unqualified person. Ryan is a hypocrite and hopefully will lose
Thank you for your no vote.
Thank you Senator for supporting quality public education for ALL. I wish @SenRonJohnson had followed your lead.
thank you for voting for students' best interests.
where is the constitution does it discuss public education?
Tammy voting against accountabilty
Today, my vote on #DeVos will honor Dems proud tradition of supporting  public teachers unions for every donation#NoOnDeVos
@SenatorBaldwin
Education is a human right with immense power to transform. Kofi Annan.  You have done nothing to be proud of here #shameful
thank you for standing up for kids!  #ResistDeVos #RESISTANCE #SwampCabinet
............through the Teacher's Union.
Thanks!
can you put some 'bows on #fakenews sycophantic @RepSeanDuffy ? K. Thx
thank you for voting No. I am afraid for our children but confident they have you as an advocate.
Thanks for trying.
I almost misread your post. Thanks for doing the right thing!
"proud" = "shameful" / "quality" = "worthless" / "education" = "indoctrination" / ...government doublespeak
Thank you for caring about our children!
thank you so much for listening to us @SenatorBaldwin
Im glad you voted as you did, but WI no longer stands for quality public education under @GovWalker. We need to fix this.
oh? like common core?
thank you from a parent with two yound children in Michigan.
thanks for standing up for us. I hoped @SenRonJohnson would too, but the $50K he got from DeVos outweighed our voices
But you weren't able to wake up any other Republicans in that vote? It's a sad day for our kids!
Oh the things money can buy.
Deceptive tweet. She didn't declare a yes or know. That's cowardly.
Just another Dem hack
loyal only to the unions huh? WI dem senators never change. If she is confirmed are you all going to run to Illinois again?
no a vote like this holds Wisconsin back. Like when I  lived there and we had that horrible dem Governor
YOU LOST AGAIN!!!!
@AIIAmericanGirI @AmericanFamAssc Baldwin's vote against DeVos will the one we can point to when she is replaced in 2018!
THANK YOU!
You sold out and supported unions over students. you are a despicable person. I look forward to welcoming your replacement.
you do realize this is what will be bringing down the Democrat partyâ€¦ Not WikiLeaks :-)
it's about the Union not the children.
Thank you! (from Pennsylvania!)
Thank you Senator Baldwin for voting #NoOnDeVos. You are voting for our children and our future.

thank you for being my voice in Washington and consistently standing up for progressive principles.
That is, until Koch-owned Scotty & his equally Koch-owned legislature gutted the public education system in the state.
Thank you for opposing DeVos and protecting public education.
maybe you can talk some sense into Ron to vote #NoOnDeVos
Thank you!  And while you're at it, remind @SenRonJohnson to check his voicemail
