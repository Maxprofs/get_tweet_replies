Do you remember the Cruz plan? It will make bad legislation even worse.
The Cruz plan will raise costs even more for people with pre-existing conditions.
It'll stick people with junk insurance and bare bones coverage that does not include the guaranteed protections people have today.
On top of that, it'll destabilize the health insurance market and could cause premiums to skyrocket.
Thank you, Sen. Baldwin. I'm proud to have you as my representative.
Why should I trust what you say?
Thank you Tammy!

Please do. Keep voting no on all the GOP's bs.
Please show our own Tammy Baldwin your support and gratitude as she fights for our lives
What is your solution?
Why not let people decide what THEY want to buy? If you need more cash to give away make a separate tax. Central planning never worked.
Thank you. I cannot imagine what kind of person believes medical care should be denied to any human being. Wisconsin is lucky to have you.

Thank you Senator!
I sincerely thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you Senator
I don't think yes is in your vocabulary. You have failed in every way. Talk a big talk but all you do is resist.
Shhh. You're not in her district

Do they have a "hell no" option...Cruz is bad for Americans who need help with health care.

Why did first Awan arrest take so long???
Thank you for looking out for your constituents.
Thank you Tammy
With you, Senator. Not a constituent but with you all the way.  Stand tough, stand tall, for all Americans.
Thank you, Tammy! Wisconsin & the nation are counting on you to be a voice of reason in this stupendous chaos!
Thank you Tammy, keep fighting for us.
You donâ€™t start a health care debate with a tax cut for the wealthy. A majority of Republicans showed us the "values" they stand for today.
