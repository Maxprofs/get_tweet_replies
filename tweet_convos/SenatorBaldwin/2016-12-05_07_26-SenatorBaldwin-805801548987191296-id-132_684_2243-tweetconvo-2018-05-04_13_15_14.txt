Trump doesn't buy American,  and doesn't use American labor, to build his buildings. 
He is a hypocrite.
Trump's only rule will be: does it give away our tax dollars to corporations for private, for profit, projects? Great. He's in.
If that was only rule he'd have Uturned on TPP already.This JS voter says:Cooperate w/DT voters in commonGround
I agree with both of u. DT thinks only American companies should get to rob Americans blind!
.@beecallis @Old_Bern_Kenobi @SenSanders DT may not;but we CANT COMPLAIN unless we TRY2HelpDTwin&FIGHT OFF Rs&Ds who oppos DTs good(DrugPric
what did Hillary do
What have you done
But hide until Hillary lost
Criticize
A lot of help that is
Action speaks louder than words.
how true as long as it's provided by Americans,  it's been horribly difficult to find US products
Trump hires only Chinese.
if trump talks to random countries, can he not tell off the world leaders lol
and pay higher prices
too bad all the corporations that any rebuild money would go to are optimized for syphoning money out of US economy
So his families' clothing line, furniture, etc. Will be made in America now?
yet he does neither! His campaign hats were made in China! We should all unfollow Trump to take away his platform
his campaign hats were made in the USA!  If tax is put on goods from China Trumps goods will be taxed too.
none of the campaign hats I saw were made in the USA!  All of their tags said China.
unfortunately there have been a lot of cheep knock offs made in China.  But Trumps campaign had them made in US
Trump could start by producing his products in America!

@U2   In GODs Country 
Why doesn't Trump Corporation start by bringing all those jobs back to America
I clicked on this just to see the triggered, radical leftists. I was very pleased. Thank you, everyone.
wow and throw all diplomacy,  and international trade networks out the window. That's insanity!
So,you don't want Americans to have more jobs?
of course. Study international trade and u will c y this is insanity.  We "barter"at bigger levels 2.
Which is why all of @realDonaldTrump's hats, T-shirts, etc. were made in... China?
This is FAKE NEWS folks. The only element that might be truthful about Trump is his father named him Donald.
How do you come to that determination? What's your criteria for ID'ing fake news?
Anything the Trumpers dont like they call fake.
Im not a Trumper and I call it fake. They have so many people who do nothing but ...
Is Russia capable of changing the election results and did they? That should be everyone's main concern!
Remind me again where Trump manufactures his products and buys his steel?
Love it !!!! Love it!!!! I have been trying for years but felt alone. Now we're on this together !!!!!
america is not yours to buy
Now THERE is some hypocracy in motion! Such a beautiful thing...right?  Do the Trumps make anything not in China?!!
yet all of #trump merchandise is outsourced to other countries!
tell that 2 to TRUMP-ET where nearly all Of  his Clothes are ma de outside thé USA. T Y .
But, Senator, if you drive corporations out of the country, who will hire us?
Quoting the vulgar capitalist are we?
@realDonaldTrump Amen, Bernie. Spot on.
what's wrong with Bernie 
keep quoting all of Trump's promises. #beattrumpathisowngame
...does this include Sanders $100,000 European luxury sedan?
our rules for our economy take precedence over labor arbitrage!
don't forget to give all the taxpayers money to the companies that ship off jobs.
@BernieTweet2020 @SpeakerRyan can we afford it as Consumers?
So anything with a Trump label is an automatic rejection.
Agreed http://JustKeepCruising.com  is an American travel agency, to help you travel the world.
thx bernie for taking action for the people
I think Trump said at what cost.
Now if only he'd take his own advice and shut down his over-sea factories.
How about MAKE IT IN AMERICA...DJT and @IvankaTrump  branded stuff??? When will we see 35% tariffs on those goods? @SenSanders @SpeakerRyan
So of the models racing NASCAR... Only Toyota is "American made"
It's hard to buy American when most of the products available are made in China. Like @realDonaldTrump 's hats, etc
massive BS as usual coming from him
Yes, #America has all it needs (resources/people/talent) right here in our own backyard. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
#Trump doesn't #BuyAmerica steel, so why would @PaulRyan and the #GOP? #MakeAmericaGreatAgain @AFLCIO http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Political-Action-Legislation/Six-Facts-on-Donald-Trump-s-Use-of-Chinese-Steel …
Man made climate change ! What a hoax ! Just like the Affordable Health Care Act !
Oooooh Booooy ! Children !
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump 

Hey Barney & nimrod Pelosi, maybe if you took out the union equation?
not me, I am boycotting every red state and every racist company that supported the know nothing @realDonaldTrump
So is Ivanka bringing production for shoe line to USA from China, or moving to Ethiopia for cheaper labor?
Do Donald and Ivanka have items made in the USA? ,hmmm
sad that 90 %  of items are made in China or amother country it's very sad
I say Stop Spending until AMERICA is well again. I'm with Her > 
make Trumps bring their manufacturing to USA. If they won't why should any other company?
Buy American hire American and fire Trump!
Buy American;  are you going to give Walmart a buy out?
I guess #Drumpf better stop selling his products then!!
says the guy outsourcing his own products.
unless you're @realDonaldTrump. Then say things knowing no rules apply to you because privilege makes you bold.
Your point being?
They'll buy American all right, but it'll be made somewhere else. Technically that's buying American
so why is he still making his merch in China?
and don't forget to buy *America*, as in property, because prices are about to go up up up!
will trump buy American or bring his ties shirts back here to be made. Think not. HYPOCRIT. Hmmmm that's it
there goes the trump brand!
so that means we shouldn't purchase any Trump products!
Encourage DT to start at home- how many jobs could be created by moving the manufacturing of Trump items to US?
Great! When are @IvankaTrump's manufacturing jobs coming to the US?
Bernie your a liar. “An honest public servant can't become rich in politics.” — Harry Truman   http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/breaking-news-sanders-massive-criminal-fraud-caught-red-handed/ …
So, donations weren't as high as she thought so you think she stole 2m $? Are you having a stroke? 
Why is he doing business on the side with Taiwan?
PAUL RYAN is clearly owned by Wall Street. Fuck him. He betrayed the American public.
Well, that means can't buy any trump products.  All made in China and Bangladesh.  #hypocrite

hmmmm....this sounds a bit like the good old days...buy German, hire German.
How about we also pay Americans a #living wage, not one commensurate with slave conditions overseas? #UnionJobs
And PAY Americans.

#Trump doesn't pay his bills - we all know that.  He didn't pay #USAFreedomKids.  Aren't they American?
-Surprise! Typical- get use to it. Didn't pay for kids. Sad.
What are you yelling about now? Do you ever get out of campaign mode? Fake fears,where have you been for 8 years?

Wow, never thought of that!! SMH
8 yrs ago this proposal was tagged a "goverment make work program"
one simple rule for Trump & Ryan: LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE LIE
Then let's start producing more products in America with innovative technology!  Sustainably  & conscientiously!
Nice words. Will Trump companies move manufacturing to US or face stiff penalties? Or will they loophole again?
-Good point! Undoubtedly, they'll find a loophole.And they think we know nothing.Americans are savvy
but won't that cost Trump money?  doesnt he buy Chinese steel?  Hire illegals for cheap labor?  Do you care SR???
Hey Bernie.  Go away
It would be a good example if the Trump family's companies made their products in the USA.
-Yes of course, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
says the guy that doesn't buy American... Oooookay...
and bomb anyone we don't like or I owe millions to.
well looks like once Trump burns down all our int'l relationships we will have no choice. Will we pay $.15/hr?
God forbid He is the USA president & he ran on platform of America First Trade needs to be FAIR to AMERICAN WORKERS
unless your making ties or shoes or hotels
im tired of all these fucks bernie they want war there going to get it with me im tired of these fucks!
Is Trump moving all his business efforts back into the US?
so essentially they are asking people not to buy Videogame systems, cellphones, computers, tablets.....
Or become President; then you never are held accountable for what you do.
you support this, yes?

How about 3 million illegal votes, did those really happen @SenSanders & @SpeakerRyan? Want to rebuild America on Trump lies?
No it didn't. However, HC vote recount shows her ahead close to 3mil popular votes.Fact-not fake news
"Does not compute" ....which is it?
So, @realDonaldTrump DOES want us to boycott all of his brands. Oh, ok. Will do! @SenSanders @SpeakerRyan
-That would be a YES-straight through the Holidays 

Sent from my iPhone
Now that he race is over, could you please get back to Washington and do your job i.e. vet dying - maggots in his wound
#doucare
Stand down , Bernie. Go home and lick your wounds 
Buy American, he imports his products from Asia. Hire American, he only hires Poles.
That's it. No more ugly trump ties for me.
Thanks Bernie for quoting a smart businessman and true American leader!
@NancyPelosi @SenateDems @vj44 @DrJillStein @HillaryClinton Judge in #Michigan -Let's measure our Dicks in #DOJ. @LorettaLynch
Hey Judge in #Michigan -Loretta will suck on your Dick
Loretta you love sucking on Dicks-JUDGE #Michigan!
I rather buy Made in the U.S.A goods than made in China, problem is Made in the U.S.A is a bit more expensive. Why?
Because here in America employees are paid fair wages verses China where employees are paid pennies
Don't buy ties that are made in China.
-Simple, if everyone is serious about this, boycott all the products he bragged about. Period.
bravo Bernie, bravo!
