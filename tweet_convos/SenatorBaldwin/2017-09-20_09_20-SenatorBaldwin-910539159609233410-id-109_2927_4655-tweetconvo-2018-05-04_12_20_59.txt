What I’m hearing from Wisconsinites on #GrahamCassidy is pretty clear: We thought we were done with heartless, partisan repeal plans.
Another big source of frustration: The idea that weakening pre-existing condition protections is in any way OK. It’s not. #GrahamCassidy
I have been trying to call Ron Johnson for a week. Is his phone off or does he just want to pretend he's not getting any calls?

I called his Oshkosh office.
Thanks I will call that in the a.m.
You do know that I am the lovely Carla iwanski mother-in-law don't you?
They are good people and good company. I feel blessed to have such a wonderful daughter in law.
Could you walk over to @SenCoryGardner's office? We can't get through on any of the phones, but he needs to vote no. People over Party.
Keep calling! It's not hopeless. #GrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyBill
We're counting on you, Tennessee, to keep calling. @SenAlexander must hear how bad #GrahamCassidyBill is. #GrahamCassidy
Maybe you could have @SenRonJohnson fix his DC office line, and allow his constituents to contact him there @SenatorBaldwin ?
My phone is ringing off the hook with calls about #GrahamCassidy today. Keep it up and make sure you call my colleagues too! : 202-224-3121 
Ron Johnson's other office numbers.  I got through.  
Thx, I’ve successfully called the WI numbers several times this week as well. It just bugs me the DC line is ignored. 
Call @SenRonJohnson in Wisconsin and tell him No to #GrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyBill
#MedicareForAll WE REALLY DO NOT WANT ROMNEYCARE/OBAMACARE ANYMORE THEN TRUMPCARE IN WISCONSIN TELL THE TRUTH!  #ResistTheGreedAndCorruption
Ron Johnson's other office numbers.
Thank you @SenatorBaldwin for your steadfast efforts on behalf of Wisconsin families!!
save the Health care Obama care,Thanks.@JeffSchwersinsk
Thank you for telling people that!!
Also call your STATE reps and urge them to make public statements opposing #GrahamCassidy
#DrainTheKochSwap Please #GrahamCassidy
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Called @SenRonJohnson and his mailbox is full. @SenRonJohnson answer your phone and do your job to get the opinions of your constituents.
I just called and got thru to leavea message.
ALL DEMOCRATS NEED TO BACK MEDICARE FOR ALL AND NOT ROMNEYCARE/OBAMACARE WHAT WE HAVE NOW!!  #MedicareForAll #ResistTheirGreedAndCorruption
#GrahamCassidy  shouldn't be rushed through without understanding the implications of the bill.
We are trying.  Unfortunately @SenRonJohnson apparently is deaf.  He can't hear his constituents saying VOTE NO!

Amend #GrahamCassidy to end gov't health insurance for all US legislators. Make GOP senators be in the same boat as many of us.
The ACA is far from perfect, but to simply abandon it instead of moving on to single payer is insane.
Thanks Tammy! - Seriously @SpeakerRyan @SenRonJohnson #CassidyGrahamBill NO GOOD!

@SenJohnMcCain please Vote No! This isn't the way.
Calling congress does not get your voice heard in America. Cut the Crap Cowgirl. America needs a government that represents the people.
trump is heart less
Thank you, Senator!
How can you let a clown like Trump play this shit with hard working taxpayer money?
If this bill passes, I will file charges for cruel and unusual punishment and oppression. It's criminal!
Make calls they help
The President said he won't sign it if it doesn't protect pre-existing conditions. Please make sure he knows that it won't!
@SenatorBaldwin do we need to keep calling you too? I haven't been wasting your time and throwing energy into @RonJohnsonWI to vote no
McCain, Flake's voicemail in Phoenix were full. Too bad representatives don't really represent you anymore, a full answering machine does.
#PRO TIP: don't call Tammy, call someone who might vote for the bill!
Why're people calling you.... You're against the bill already.

Act smart people call @SenateGOP

Thank you @SenatorBaldwin for your commitment to good healthcare access for Wisconsin families. Proud you represent me (WI rez in Singapore)
My Senator is Mitch McConnell.  I know.  I am sorry too.  I can gleefully say I have never voted for him.
Glad to hear it.

#MedicareForAll kill #GrahamCassidy
@SenKamalaHarris @RepAdamSchiff
@DrDenaGrayson
My daughter #Epilepsy #autism severely disabled meds 9k per month #MedicareForAll 
I didnt bother you ma'am, because i know you aren't a fool like johnson is, supporting this crap.
Called @SenatorGardner Asked him to vote no. How could he vote yes on a plan that hurts those who need it most and w/out a CBO score?
Thank you Senator Baldwin! Shout out from the West Coast!
Thank you, @SenatorBaldwin. So glad to have you representing Wisconsin.
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Tried to get thru to bcassidy tonight, can't even leave a message, just rings. Guess he's not up to talking with a citizen or receiving a Vm
I would call my @RepChrisCollins but it would do no good. He was on local tv the last time the vote came up & he said he supported it. Ugh.
New bill gives different results to each state. Please call him again.
Thank you.
I hope Congress doesn't pass this bill.
It will hurt millions of Americans -
Mailbox for Ron Johnson is full, I sent him an email.
You should start a #SwingParty and swing your state!
Is there any point in calling my Democratic senators?
LMAO  How disingenuous.  'Call me... make my phones light up so I vote how I was going to vote anyway.'

#FakePolitician
Please vote NO. Thanks! #GrahamCassidy Phone lines are busy for both senators.

I don't know how it could be legal for the GOP to wage genocide on the sick and the poor for financial reasons. It's un American and sick
Stand strong!
Sounds like you may need to take a stroll around the building & suggest your colleagues answer their phones (like @SenDeanHeller )
I did
I hope you are listening when they are telling you to dump Obamacare.
Just vote no so our calls mean something PLEASE
I called Marco Rubio. I know Sen. Nelson is on board already. He is a great Senator, most decent man, and a Democrat!
It's a bad bill senator don't sign it do your job or go home in 2018
I wish the public would educate themselves on this. Some say pass it my rates too high. They won't go down with this and worse coverage.
You forgot to say it was only 3 working legal Americans.
I'm not calling you my fabulous Senator. I'm working on the GOP. I know you will vote your conscience and what's best for the country! 
We need your sanity!! Thank you!
Unlike many, I take it you actually answer your phone?
https://faxzero.com/fax_senate.php  Fax your Senators FREE!

Thank you for endorsing single payer. I called Ron, for all the good it will do. He doesn't give a shit about his constituents.
I wonder what his phone lines are like!

@RepTomPrice @SenJohnMcCain @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr #ACASavesLives @BillCassidy #trumpcare2 @LindseyGrahamSC
#GrahamCassidy = #RansomCare
Ron Johnson does not answer his calls. Only can leave a recording. How come no one around to actually listen in his office?
They're scared.
I called @SenatorCardin  and @ChrisVanHollen office!!
Miss Baldwin what am I supposed 2 say If I dont live in their state? Both my Senators (Franken&Klobuchar) r voting no but I still wanna help
@RepTomPrice @SenJohnMcCain @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr #ACASavesLives @BillCassidy #trumpcare2 @LindseyGrahamSC
Because of his corruption trial Sen. Menendez is not representing the citizens of New Jersey
Thank you for continuing to support the #aca
I'm Faxing you and Ronny Johnson
We know where you stand already. The Greed Over People bunch need to be flooded with calls since they dont get it.
Must be nice to have so many constituents without jobs that can spend their "workday" blowing up your phone
It appears that 700 billion more in military spending is ok to you, though?
She's just happy playing fauxgressive and and being a part of the McResistance. @SenatorBaldwin is a fraud and a corporate warmonger.

Does it help to call you if you are already voting the right way?
Yes! Her aides can tally calls/ emails  of support/ concern, can also bring up your specific concerns.
It's easier than making lame Trump jokes/memes to text "resist" to 50409 to fax and/or call your MOC's right from your cellular thingee.
Text resist to the number 50409. It walks you through it in question and answer very easy maybe 3 minutes longer if you write a lot.
I won't waste a call on my @SenRonJohnson- but I did reach out to compassionate conservatives @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain
I'm faxing him and I sent him a video. Let him see the face of Stage 4 cancer!!  Keep up the good work.
Thanks Senator Baldwin! This foolish zombie repeal plan must be stopped for good! ACA can be fixed with bipartisan regular order not tricks!
Sen. Lindsey Graham desperately smears Jimmy Kimmel for speaking up for kids like his son
Thats Cracker Graham for you. He likes being pivot man and wants to head up the death panel too!
Pass it!
Thank you for supporting Medicare For All. You are one of the good ones.
