Medicaid is full of fraud and has been for yrs.This isn't a secret yet no one BUT the Trump administration is willing to take it on!
They're necessary cuts.  The hard working, tax paying Americans are sick of supporting lazy people and refugees.
Have ANY of @realDonaldTrump campaign promises been kept? #NOPE #TrumpBudget America has been trumped. LIAR
On the contrary, nearly all of his promises are either complete or in progress.
Really, be my guest and rattle them off for us. here, i'll start with 2 failed so far, ACA repeal and Wall along mexicos border,
Both in progress.
so, elder voters for trump....how do you like him now?
Like him Better than Hilary 
 LOL great answer!!!
What if we just let the GOP impose all their cruel budget cuts?  Finally expose their cruel policies and inability to build/lead a nation?
Yes please. Then you'd see and have to admit Trump knew what he was doing, when he makes America great again!
By all means #MAGA all you want. Just don't cry when everyone is sick, poor and nearly dead.  Except Trump and his rich cronies.
If Trump is impeded by the deluded 'progressive' Dems, we WILL all end up sick and poor, and the nation decayed.
Facts are tough for you aren't they? I can't have a conversation with someone who thinks math and science are alt facts.  Good day madame
I know what you mean. Difficult to converse with one who refers to "math and science" when those weren't part of the topic. Get well soon.
Yes, math has nothing to do with this awful budget.  Zero numbers in there whatsoever!!! #MAGA
@PaulBegala UNITE SENATE AND DO THE RIGHT THING. THE BIBLE SPEAKS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR POOR AND DISABLE !!
The Bible says WE need to take care of the poor and disabled. US -- not the government.
Proven liar
That's what happens when you ignore his lying because he's the angry white man
@SenateDems Quit lying. The Trump budget does NOT contain "devastating cuts to Medicaid".
Make that necessary cuts to Medicaid...fixed it for you, your welcome.
You're not going to say that when old family members die becaus they can't afford medicine.
Isn't it your responsibility to care for family? The govt should step in only if you desert them.
Not everybody has loads of money to pay for expensive healthcare.
He lied?  Surprise surprise
Read my lips, "I will not cut Medicaid"
Trump's budget theme song:
it is time to pass legislation to make euthanasia legal. This budget demands that you give people this option. Really.
That's just sick.
That wasn't clear - meant physician asst suicide. The healthcare vs feeding my kid dilemma.
His lies will never stop. Being a con man has gotten him this far. It's got to end with him being impeached.
#Fakenews
Gee, almost hard to believe the man w fake Univ, scams, cons, many extramarital affairs who bragged about assaulting women... lied.
Who knew
Perplexing for sure !?!? Not
I've known he was a piece of shit ! Bloviated waste of oxygen
Still the only rational choice when the alternative was Killary.

Even if this bill fails the fact that it was presented as it was is appalling
@realDonaldTrump you and GOP are an embarrassment to all those who fought and died for our Country. @USWomenVeterans @votevets @SpeakerRyan
"Read my lips..."   When will some voters learn?
Everything is devastating to someone. Obama care was devastating to us.
Are his Supporters getting it yet?
Rest assured, SS and Medicare are next.

It won't pass but trump supporters must remember that he tried to cut them off
"you can keep your doctor"
Like I said, Read Trump's words as the opposite.
Stop the false rhetoric! There are no cuts to Medicaid....it will not be touched!
Repeal is easy. Replacing it with cost effective system is the challenge.
No politician, right, left or media talks about cutting COST. Why?
Welfare and Medicaid needs to be cut!!! There is so much abuse and fraud in these programs. Democrats use them for voter payments!!
Stop having illegitimate offspring after illegitimate offspring! Its redistribution of wealth. Plain and simple slavery!
He's a used car salesman, he'll say whatever will keep you(repukes)
 on his side.
#45 lies as usual.
It ain't gonna happen, Senate said Dead on arrival, This is that evil bastard Ryan, his dream, Trump better wake up
That's funny. In the budget I just read it said No cuts to Medicaid. Are we reading the same budget??
Poor.Obama Adm. 28Million on Food Stamp grew to 44Million. The program & rate is UNSUSTAINABLE. The middle class are hit the hardest
You know their not CUTTING# Trying to reduce the growth. Like WORK instead of WELFARE M;  You are immoral to want to keep future generation

@POTUS wants poor to pay for increase in our national security which in the end is protecting the rich since they have  the most to lose.
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpBudget #Flynngate #SethRich vs #BrennanHearing Tell That To #SusanRice #ComeyMemo #RussiaGate https://youtu.be/YWbMCdvnQHw 
What do you expect from a liar and con man. Everything in @POTUS life has been one big con.
He's not cutting it...he's decimating it. True to his words, and people should have known!
Does @realDonaldTrump even know what is in "HIS" budget or only what someone has told him? Not like he's read it.
.. @RepCurbelo & @marcorubio ppl of Florida are depending on you to speak up. Social Service benefits are needed.
tax payers work & expected government support.
#TrumpofEvil #trumpbudget @TheDemocrats @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan

Budget Based on $2 Trillion Math Error http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/trump-budget-based-on-usd2-trillion-math-error.html?mid=twitter-share-di … via @intelligencer
If US wants give away money, you clear UK national debt?
Look at the Medicaid rolls and see how many are children of illegal immigrants. Especially in border states. Stop the spin!
If you let him solve the immigration issue, only citizens will get Medicaid. The budget makes sense.
Medicare?
Where is your alternate budget?

Most likely.
I thought we wanted less wars. Why +$54B in defense spending?! Halliburton doesn't need the money.
#liarinchief #gop #hoodrobbin
You know what, Democrats have been complicit in the dismantling of the American welfare state.
#Socialism Now!
Fake News.
Those are his words, from his mouth. His lie and your ignorance
Why do we need Medicaid anymore anyway? The rich are paying for everyone's free health insurance anyway
How can people be mad? They put their trust into a professional con artist & mobster, then expected this guy to be legitimately concerned?
How 'bout that new budget, U Trumpkin Sheeple. Is it what y'all signed up for?  Oh wait...  Fake budget?
Pay attention 2 FACTS, not beliefs!
This budget is heading into Charles Dickens territory.
You have to reject this budget please.  This man is evil and vile and must be stopped.
He lies about everything. But, please put forth your own proposals and alt legislation. Don't just rely on being the anti-Trump party!
Every time he opens his mouth he is lying! Why is it taking so long to impeach the SOB?
What a shame!
True trump
One has to be a moron to think that a man who bankrupted his business 4 times would be able to put forth a good budget.
Big big difference Hillary, never invoked the 5th!
As a old man @POTUS is quite forgetful of his promises....or he's a pathological liar.   I wonder which it is??   Both!!!
#MAGA #Trumptrain #DontheCon #Medicaid #trumpbudget
And y'all believed that .... ok
Trump can't be trusted
I guess he just meant "cut" as in not remove it.
Dems are going to lose at ballet box for all the obstruction!

Trump is a cheesy con artist; if his lips are moving he's lying
Try paying for your fake groceries & fake medical bills with your fake Medicare/social security monies. Enjoy the fake meals & fake meds.

Good!  Stop making this a generational hand out!  This never was meant to be a long term assistance!@lindapezzino  @YoungDems4Trump
The only cuts are the ok mess who don't need it ! Hope they  Good afternoon the judges who do this.

Worst. President. Ever.
He didn't ,people need to get jobs.
"A Chicken in Every Pot!".  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL.
Believe me.
To be fair, Trump had virtually no chance of winning and had no intention of actually doing any of the things he said on the campaign trail.
Seeing it now
