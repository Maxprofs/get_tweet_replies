I LOVE IT, THANK YOU SO MUCH

We want bangerz 2.0
You Can do better،، plz make album 
I know but i want another one like bangerz 
Nooooo; I want another GOOD album- why would you want exactly what she already has out? I mean, do I want a pop album? hell yeah, I want whatever she has, but I hate it when people say they want “another bangerz” like dear god, go listen to bangerz then.
You’re incredible! We loveyyyyy
WE JUST LOVED IT  THANKS FOR BLESSING US WITH THIS AMAZING VOICE

I was nearly crying at how fucking fab your voice sounds on this Miley! You’re my fave forever!! I love you. 
I'M SO IN LOVE WITH DON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME  Bravo you slay, these vocals are amazing !!
@MileyCyrus I have never listened to you before but I have to tell you that you absolutely fucking crushed it on "Don't let the sun go down on me." Easily my favorite track out of both albums. It's so good. Well done!

Bitch is back? Nope only “don’t let the sun go down on me”

Thank you!! Couldn’t find it anywhere 
no problem!
I honestly didn’t like them one bit. You can’t come close to Elton. Nobody can
no we didn't
She did that with The Bitch Is Back, you should listen it...
Love u

I LOVE♡♡♡♡♡
Oh I truly enjoy your voice and shit But I listened to you singing with Billy Idol and now doing Elton John and your voice is not trained for rock and roll. Maybe you should tryout on that show called the Voice and hopefully get picked by someone that knows how to couch you 4 RnR
