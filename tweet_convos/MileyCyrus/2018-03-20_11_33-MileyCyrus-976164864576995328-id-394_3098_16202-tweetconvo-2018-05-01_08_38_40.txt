it's a great thing

Yes , I can' t wait to see you perform for a great cause and you are so awesome, don't change!


Go Miley  thanks for supporting them 
Thank you for marching. #MarchForOurLives
It’s easy to go along with the crowd and agree with the majority! What is brave is standing alone! @KyleKashuv is a brave soul for standing up for our constitutional rights and standing with the “we the people” !
SEE YOU THERE
Will you help spread this impt update to DC marchers, @MileyCyrus? 
Headed to DC on Saturday for @AMarch4OurLives? Get important updates from the City on safety, weather, traffic, and transit with free text alerts. Text “MARCH24” to 888-777 to sign up right now! #marchforourlives
@realDonaldTrump @potus Why is Homeland Security backing this uprising in the form of a rally?
We're DC Government (not the feds) and reaching out to everyone involved in the event to help spread the word. Thanks for your interest though!
DC Homeland Security reports to the FEDS.  Otherwise yiu are bogus.  Investigating
AMAZING
What Parkland should be worried about is the 2000 students in Brevard Cty convicted of rapes, gun violations, murder etc under Obama’s Promise Program like Cruz being sought by the police to get them back in the schools!  That would scare the crap out me & should everyone else
Anything to try to keep your feeding career relevant… Am I right?
SO EXCITED!♡♡♡♡

Will you be barefoot? @caminoperegrina #barefootpilgrim #peace#love#freedom
March 24th is my birthday!!!
# brahian Díaz

Wow, wish I could make it.  Best of luck for everyone there!
And if you can’t join them at least use the tag! #MarchForOurLives

#MarchForOurLivesChicago
Where have all the flowers gone?  Where have all 17 MSDHS teacher's & student's gone?  They've gone to graveyards everyone!   
Where have all the flowers gone?  Long time passing. Where have all MSDHS   teacher's and students gone? They've gone to graveyards everyone!  Oh, when will they ever learn? NRA  Gun Lobbyists…
I'm sure you do! Because if the revolution happens, you're rich and part of it so you'll be fine but your followers, hmmm. Peasants in your Collective Utophia.
I’ll be out there marching but I need to know when y’all Queens @ArianaGrande @ddlovato are performing!!! #MarchForOurLives
WHAT A DISGRACEFUL WAY TO LURE AND CORRUPT YOUNG MINDS TO YOUR MOB MENTALITY WAY OF THINKING.SAD.WHERE ARE THE PARENTS AND THEIR OWN FAMILY VALUES. MYLIE CYRUS IS NO ROLE MODEL.

You go Miley Ray! Rock the Capitol! #MarchForOurLives
Can't. Understand. Normal. Thinking.
I'll be marching in Parkland - standing up for and with MSD students and all of our kids.
How 'bout you shut-up, put some clothes on & keep your hands out of your crotch? Do THAT.
Lots of good @AFL matches this weekend b4 Easter ? Do u hv any predictions ? Will u be having pancakes on sat am @FOXSportsAUS haha
That is what Israel do . will you support us against those Jewish terrorists
You would have marched to ban wooden matches after the fire that killed 92 students in 1958.
Thanks God that folks wisely decided to harden schools against fires.
#hardenschools #1A 
BTW do YOU have an armed  bodyguard?
I will march with you! Please also speak out against all gun victims, including those gunned down by the police. This must end.
Wish you’d be HERE in Nashville for our March!  We need some hometown fun!
I'm sure they appreciate your support hopefully many more celebrities can join you
It's a shame that @cameron_kasky doesn't seem to care about lives as much, Miley I know you want to act like you give a damn but my god get informed first
If you want to me  blow up wonder land just say the word & I will that's what I'm here for use me like a 5$ ho

Giggity
Lindíssima falou tudo
Bwahahaha, you'd actually be the voice of reason!  Way to try to stay relevant though.... gold star kiddo.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
You show them Miley
Miley was just running around with her weird group posse a year ago. California needs to break off from the US and form their own country.
Lots of enthusiasm being lost due to HIGH ALERT OF SKIES ON SUNDAY.
STAY INSIDE.
Way to go Miley.! I’m a fan now.

Aaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwww! You Rock! How do I get in touch with Angus Young?
Thank you for miss-adventuring. Smiley, faces.
Can't wait to play percussion in a March in York, PA with students from York College of PA.
Love you
Congratulations @MileyCyrus

Thats cuz your as ignorant as they are .... this has happened before in history ..
Please consider donating to our @gofundme campaign to raise money to print and donate 2,500 posters to @its_the_outrage, the official merchandise partner for @AMarch4OurLives in Washington, D.C., to be made available FREE to marchers. https://www.gofundme.com/march-for-our-lives-posters … #MarchforOurLives
You will all be accomplishing nothing except getting free publicity from these poor young victims. Are you going to ride your blow up penis and stick your tongue out every 2 seconds.  You're an awful role model.
Can we please please please just stay in school because I got lots of work to finish?
Just got to #keepgoing
And I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause there's always gonna be another mtn, I'm always gonna wanna make it move; always gonna be an uphill battle..
Keep on moving @mileycyrus 
#marchforourlives #neveragain @AMarch4OurLives @momsdemand @Everytown
I should have used the word attire.
Hey sweetie. I really  your performance s.but Can u watch the dress thou maybe. This is a march for gun violence in schools where people learn.
I hope if ur showing up, youre not bringing armed guards with you. That would be against everything this March supposedly stands for
Wonderful
No one needs the support of a drug addict to strip law abiding citizens of their rights.
YESSSS
What time do you perform I have to go then
Need a poster for the march?! How about some free Saved by the Bell one themed ones?! #MarchForOurLives

Hi miley ; bless am your big fan
I wish you could perform this


When u going back to Voice? U were a bomb.
Nice

I seem to recall #hollywood behind #hillary and leftist media outlets @cnn @msnbc pegged #hillary as winner with fake news polls and correspondents. Please, by all means, sing at that leftist anti-gun/anti #trump march !! #MarchForOurLives  #nra
sing The Climb

Love you Miley
Thank you @MileyCyrus for your continued support! It's important, vitally important and really terrific to have you on the team!!

Thanx you beautiful young lady!
@MileyCyrus


so u try to use this #MarchForOurLives  to Promote a show and sell some CDs ?
did u ever before speak out about GunViolence ? No ? maybe because of fear to sell less ? and now u see potential to make money so u come out ? what Happened to BackYardSession Miley ?
I think the March is a great idea but a better idea is start with the parents. They are the ones that let their kids go to school they see them every morning first before they leave for school. So let's make that the foundation of this March
I can't hardly wait to miss it
Pls go back to nick, liam cheated on you twice and no cheater deserves a second chance 
Good for you. It’s the right thing to do. You should march with Emma too.
I don't know you and of course you don't know me but that song you sing The Climb it makes me feel so right inside thank you thinks thats ur best Youve grow up and boy have you been growing in all kinds of ways Its been a fun and interesting ride
#TimeIsShort Put Your #FaithInHisBlood, #YESHUA is #SALVATIONTODAY!
Wish I could be there with u Miley! I can't afford it, but I will be there in spirit! Love u Miley. When I was young everyone laughed at my beliefs. Womens and kids rights to speak up!!
See you there!!!!


PLEASE SING MY HEART BEATS FOR LOVE OF LIBERTY WALK OR HANDS OF LOVE OR INSPIRED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU HAVE SO MANY INSPIRATIONAL SONGS THAT WE ALL LOVE AND HAVE BEEN SLEEPT ON SIS, COVERS ARE NICE AND WE LOVE BUT WE WANT TO HEAR YOU AND YOUR STORY
remember that you have a song called liberty walk and robot that you could perform at the march
Yasss queen! I love you! 
Cutie
That is a good idea
@MileyCyrus I might see you there!! On March 22 I'm flying out to DC to #MarchForOurLives   I'm stoked to see you and to support the amazing and courageous students behind this amazing movement!! 
Awesome!   These students truly are amazing!   Meeting my sister in DC as well -we can’t wait to support them!
I LOVE YOU
Love the young people determined to make our country better and safer.  Count me in.  with admiration and blessings that they heal and we all heed their voice.  I hope these wise children are awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
I am so happy that you are lending your voice to these amazing young people! My daughter is a freshman in high school, and she, her classmates, and ALL of her co-students deserve safe schools and these marches are bringing that closer to reality. Thank you Miss Miley!
Haces todo bien. Te adoro
Will there be armed security in attendance?

Please urge your fans who are 18 years to register to vote and do not elect NRA funded politicians.

Queen 
Awesome Miley!!!
So Miley will no longer have armed security at her concerts?!? #Frauds
Can't wait to see you all march.  BTW your dad was awesome on Sunrise in Australia today 
I love you
Buddy
I’m all for star power, but I hope the invited celebrities take a back seat to the students who actually attend high schools around the country. Help them raise their voices. They have a lot to say.
Don't worry. The students have got this.
Omg! Can't wait. Sing together with Ariana & Demi
Just don't make it about you and keep your tongue in your mouth.
Oh great, bring out the freaks
