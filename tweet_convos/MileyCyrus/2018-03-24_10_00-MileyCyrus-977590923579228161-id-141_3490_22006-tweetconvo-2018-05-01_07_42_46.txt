How close is your armed security? Also wearing a bulletproof vest is a crime.
And having a gun is legal. Makes sense.
Owning guns are legal check the 2nd amendment again.
Exactly. That’s the issue. Guns are legal and bulletproof vests are not?
Why do you need one? I know I don’t need one.
Oh because I don’t want to be shot dead while I’m in school.
Stop with the gun free zones then
How ‘bout we stop with the guns?

Liberals: Ban guns. -Ban some guns.
              Make schools safer. -Don't arm teachers or officers.
              Let's ALL talk. -Resign.
              Commonsense
Conservatives: Which (essentially the same) gun do you want to ban?
Liberals: The black one.

good job Miley

So if the streets will be safe after guns get taken away... what you going to do about #Blacklivesmatter ?
Im pretty sure BLM was protesting the militarization of our local police forces, no one is taking their guns away, or sighting them for a internal audit... #Puppets
It brings tears to my eyes to kids in the streets rallying and protesting for their lives. Kids shouldn’t have to beg for their lives. We hope your protests are not in vain. We hope it helps to bring the change we all need. Bleep Normal stands with you 100%
Love u so much the song and sweat ,amazing pic
take a picture with Ariana please
KING AND QUEENS
Mental health is a horrible issue. I'm sorry you have to wear a vest. Now put your hands down and step away from my Second Amendment rights!
Muchhhh love 
So you are no longer hiring any security with guns to protect you?
Common sense gun laws do not aim to take away all guns.

You're right shouldn't have to wear it but Welcome to the Real World. We also should not have to have tyranny of evil people and Military and a bunch of idiots who are hard headed and religion. But we got that anyways. Welcome to the Real World
