If you really cared about our children's safety you'd support armed security for our children in schools. Do you support this or do you support disarming law abiding people who haven't broken any laws just so you can remove all guns from people?
Who are you protecting urself from? Many nations have stricter gun control n less crime....laws, punishments, rules, civility, education make for a peaceful society not guns!
Yes, there are peaceful countries with strict gun control.  Iran, Syria, Venezuela, just to name a few.
Canada
Australia is another
The final chapter on the Australian gun ban has yet to be written, and when it is, Australians will not be pleased.
“Everyday shootings are everyday problems.”#MarchforOurLivesDC
I wish I had heard this young man’s name.  He gave a moving and powerful speech.

"We can only live in this so-called American dream if we have the proper gun legislation and resources to do so," Trevon Bosley says. "It's time for America to notice that everyday shootings are everyday problems." …
This young man was on point with issues that need to addressed, so proud of our youth
Her name is Emma Gonzalez. Yes, an impressive young woman
you, also, should invest in common sense and gain knowledge on the subject since you’re most definitely uneducated. the kids acknowledged that, yes, they kids; yet they seem to have been 100% more affected by the violence & trauma than you have or ever will be. they are-
Bravo marchersIn the streets of #Paris #MarchForOurLives #DemocratsAbroad
This is amazing!! Thank you for supporting our children.
politicians can ignore the message today but young ppl will vote in record levels, and have an impact. Washington should listen, but I know the won't. Everyone will be shocked that establishment politicians are voted out.
You clearly don't know young people
Wait till November and you will see
Your wrong on two things. 1)general voter apathy 2)most of the "wanting change" people already live in blue districts and won't really change the composition of congress
I am not sure about your blue state theory, but talk to me in November
Voting in congress is based on districts, a conservative will never unseat Pelosi in San Fran and a liberal will never win in Ft Worth. State wide elections like the Senate might be affected but that's doubtful in most states, large turnover rarely happens
Congress and senate have had  democrat majority many times in recent history.
From 06-10 I think for a couple congress' in the 90s. Incumbants have a massive advantage
Reallly.  Where do the school shootings happen?
The answer is too frequently.
Yes ... and after 9-11 we revamped airport security, installed blast doors in airplane cockpits, passed the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act and started 2 wars.
Well zero airplanes have been flown into bulidings in the last 17 years.  Zero successful air based attacks. We did have attacks at Ft. Hood, San Bernardino and Pulse in Orlando though.
Very powerful speech.  The young people will be the difference in this fight to get action on guns.
Did you see the girl before this?? I was . So powerful.
They are all so powerful and brave.
Indeed!
Im so proud of all this student coming together to stop gun violence
Somethings happening here. What it is isn’t exactly clear.  You know the rest...
In Memphis
Thank You #Memphis
Chilling #EmmaGonzalez silence meant every second! 

So many messages through her silence! Imagine desperation inside that school for each student there... she kinda took me there 
Emma is an incredible young woman. My hope is that all these young men & women become the leaders of your nation in the future. They are so impressive. #MarchForOurLives
#MarchForOurLives I hope the gun law is improved
How do you suggest improvements?
1. Everyone has to be psychologically tested.
2. No weapons under 21.
3. Better monitoring
4. And much more
3) Better monitoring? Is that another dystopian fantasy? Please explain that, perhaps you mean actually enforcing existing laws? Your right we should actually try that.
You should monitor better who gets a weapon and you should also monitor social networks and take them seriously. The intelligence agencies need to act better and the sellers should also be able to assess who is able to buy a weapon or not.
That is really a disturbing thought, I thought the patriot act was bad but yeesh
Either weapons are banned or other means of security.
What about 2A? Holy smokes that is some extreme soviet like restrictions that 1)couldn't be enforced 2)would cause mass civil unrest 3)mass spike in crime 4)not legal so a lot of courtroom drama 5) couldn't overcome a veto if passed 6)2A would've been nice at kristalnacht
Look at all the retards that think banning guns will solve the problem  I’m buying a firearm and I encourage everyone to do the same #2ndAmendmentRights
Our rights to life trumps your rights to guns, repeal or amend the 2nd amendment now!
The gun WILL defend your lives
Not really
Our lives are more important than a gun. We are LIVING BREATHING HUMANS a gun is an OBJECT. A weapon created for violence! Our lives are more important than your amendment that is not adapted to the times.
A government who would take guns knowing it will not fix the problem is clearly any over reaching one and not far from taking away the rest of your rights. By the way the government does not give us the right to bare arms it is only enshrines it as a God given right.
Other countries do it and it has worked greatly. The issue here in this country is that people value gun possession more than a life. They rather mass shootings continue than give up their precious guns. Thats the problem!
Name one country in which the crime rate has gone down after banning guns
I hope the gun law is improved.
You guys can't stay off your phones long enough to improve anyting
Or eating tide pods
Haha that's a good one.
Just facts im saying
Yeah..
I put on my combat boots for the first time since 1994. #VetsForGunReform

In Rome in front of the Embassy
They need to "March for the Bullied"!
Amazing turnout! Learn how we’re demanding comprehensive gun legislation at http://www.americansforgunsafetynow.com .
I am an old guy, I learned gun safety when I was 10. I have a daughter in HS 70 miles away from school shooting. We need a way to make our Children safe! Time to address, not hide! There must be solution! I will stand at an entrance to be a shield if I must! Or we all homeschool!
They don't want legislation for safer schools (whatever that entails). They want a ban on guns, that's it.
You are right. We know guns will never go... impossible! I do dogsled in grizzly country. I want my team safe from harm. But our children need to be safe! We ALL need to find a way to keep our children safe! It is time. There can be a way, if we ALL work together! 4 Our Children!
Please stop with the hashtag feel good statements. We need metals detectors and people with weapons to protect those on school grounds. You have them at sporting events, but kids go to school everyday.
I learned gun safety at 10. Education, GOOD education I think would be a good thing. Self defense, how to disarm when safe. Empower and teach youth and adults to be safe. And bring back the Presidential Fitness Program JFK started. It made a difference in my life! No More Fear!
True, exactly as the NRA provides@
I think the NRA needs a good pr spokesman. That was the NRA of my youth! My father taught me respect for guns, I could take apart a Ruger when I was 10! I was a good shot with air rifle first, had my own 22 rifle at 11 kept in my fathers gun safe. Respect for “Tools “ I learned!
If you just turned 18 or if you will be in time to vote, register today! Each vote counts & we can vote out politicians ignoring the real issues going on. I’m proud of every student, parent, teacher, and everyone else joining in on this Movement today! We WILL make a difference!
Then tell me teacher, parent why are you so afraid of armed security in your schools
America's love affair with arms hasn't solved any problems in fact it's alot of the problems so maybe more guns at schools is not the solution. As you know the guards are people and people are faliable so next thing you know the guards with guns with be the problem"
so what is your solution?     BTW, it's not a love affair...IT'S MY RIGHT.
Well not having gun control hasn't worked so far maybe give it the old college try. The excuse is it won't stop it but it's not based on fact you can claim this
So gun control means no guns that's your mentality? yet you claim it isn't a love affair haha
Why don't you try to tell me what kind of gun control you are looking at.   What is it you want for Gun Control?
Something better than the current nothing. I don't have a definitive answer just like you don't. Trying something instead of trying to defer logical policy and staying status quo
Then why didn’t you allow Hunter Pollack to speak !?! #MeadowsMovement
because to progressives only some lives matter, I say this with the saddest of hearts but I can conclude this by the actions taken.

Great post alison

Ending gun violence while ignoring the vast majority of violent criminal activities....
Like 30 days for the shooters in Chicago
From Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: My mother, my sister, my nephew (hiding in his stroller) and I marched for gun control. Thank you to the students who made this march happen. I’m sorry we adults haven’t done better by you. #marchforourlives #neveragain #BooksNotBullets
Cheers from Norway 
I am so proud of you all! You ARE the change!
I have goosebumps all the time. I hope we change the world. Everyone has to join in! #MarchForOurLives
This is really beautiful. This is hope in action, I embrace it and hope you do too 
I can't say enough how proud I am and how inspiring these young people around the world are. They are fired up and ready to go. I am too.
Why do some members of this generation turn to gun violence...solve this and you will stop the mass shootings. We have had guns for years and now this is shooting up their schools. Why!
Tell em jen

Well they kinda do, in a soft buyback way, everybody involved wants to have an Australia like gun system. Insults isn't the way to advance debate though.

So proud of my 13 year old daughter.  The poster with the female repro system is hers.  I’m doing something right!
That poster was right on point.  Guns have just one purpose: to kill.  A woman's body is her body, and has whatever purpose she wants it for, whether for motherhood, for working, for being an activist...it's her choice.

Marched in Johnson City TN today with my grandson, a high school freshman. 
Emma Rocks!!! She is one of my heroes. What passion and strength.  Tears well up in my eyes. My heart goes out to any and all students that have ever had to endure this kind of unnecessary gun violence.  Your power is in your numbers; use it!
He is a useless “so called leader”; I believe that is a pretty well known fact by now. #Tragic
In solidarity with you from Madison WI.
I was a suck today. Yes I cried watching the march and speeches because I am so relieved.
Totally ugly crying.
Oh it was bad. But it felt sooo good.
The world is yours go out and reclaim it!!!!
Fox not showing Demi. They are on the outskirts saying poor reception.
Yeah, right ..... I’ve seen some stations showing people WAY out on the outskirts so it looks like nobody’s there :(
Phony FAKE
As I listen to these young people speak I’m getting emotional, the future is bright!!!!!
Who is marching for the MILLIONS of kids being murdered in the womb
They had their March already.
I see, you believe in murder as long as it is good for your conversation?
Abortion is not murder.... #FakeChristain .....Your dogma is not my dogma....MYOB.
At which point in development of a fetus does a dead fetus turn into a live fetus?
Fake news
Wonder why nobody can answer that question?
So proud of all of these kids! #marchforourlives
So proud of all the young people that are taking a stand. Remember this day when November comes and make a change. !!
When adults fail, children take over. #MarchForOurLives  #GunControlNow
CC: @realDonaldTrump
Right after they eat tide pods
They are not the same kids nacho, or do you like lumping all together? Like, all gun owners are crazy like mass shooters
Thank you so much for proving my point...
I am so moved to see all the young people of every color speaking so eloquently. This is doing my soul good.
I am too, these kids are amazing!  Now if media could focus more on this and ride this hope rather than non-stop Trump, we will have a better world.
wether you intended  to or not, just now that people around hear probably won't take kindly at your adoration of trump. How could you dare speak up against the "non political" attacks against trump.
not a fan of Trump Jose - just want more coverage for this movement beyond today- media is obsessed with Trump.
I actually understood you probably weren't a trump fan, but my comment was directed at people seeing your comment who will think that the media's constant 24/7 "non partisan" attacks against trump are of most importance.
thanks!
To rent a car you need to be 25 years old (without an extra fee) why not do the same to get a gun and increase the age not to 21 but 25, to save lives we need a tougher gun control #AMarch4OurLives
You don’t have a constitutional right to a rental car? What kind of argument is that?

Watch LIVE as we #MarchForOurLives  in the streets of Washington, DC to demand that we end gun violence and mass shootings in our schools and communities today TYPE BEAT
So glad to see action today which was so lacking by the previous administration. All that was given to gun violence was impassioned speeches but no action.  Where were you starting with Sandy Hook.
Marching in Morristown NJ now. What a wonderful crowd. Students we should not only be proud of but feel hopeful in their quest for a safer America. They are our future.
Watching on CNN. Great coverage. I just saw a sign that read “Teach your parents well”! Loving it. 
Youth.... they get it. 
They do? Google tide pod challenge
Yeah didn't say all youth but I'll take ten of those Tide youth over one of those AR 47 psychos any day of the week. 
AR47? Um. Ok. Cuz a lot of gun owners are law abiding citizens. But, you only hear about the less than 5% of the lunatics. Not to mention, Chicago. But, nice attempt
What's funny is y'all bring up the same lame ass argument every single time... Chicago. Like that's some hot button issue. Not one of you cares about Chicago but you got nothing else. I'll help Columbine, Sandy Hook, Denver, Parkland, Las Vegas..........
What's funnier, is y'all mention those incidents, which rarely happens, but refuse to acknowledge Chicago, and the drug overdoses, suicides, and insane amount of other issues. Keep trying. A for effort
Keep deflecting.... you're great at that. Also hop on over to Chicago and tell people to stop using drugs and killing themselves and stop all the other issues that effect millions but leave this non existent gun issue alone because its a  non starter. 
And keep thinking banning guns will solve the issue. You've still failed to tell me where in wrong. Who's deflecting? Read my responses again
This is the way I understand it too.  I think the Democrats just shot themselves in the foot. lol
We must stand for something or we may fall for anything.

Inaction isn’t a course of action and #enoughisenough. It is time to #Beheard 

73 teens have been shot to death since the tragedy in Parkland, FL.

Look at all those George Soros crisis actors
Gun violence will end when the people of this world understand that Largest Criminals in the world run our Government, and are fabricating these shootings with the peoples energy. Our own government spends greater and greater amounts each year on weapons of mass destruction.
See how quick they turn on you..

Let's get the voices of stop the school abusers...then we can stop the shooters
My rights are more important than your wants!
Wish you would March to End Bullying, you know, one of the root causes of kids going crazy and taking lives...
Packed in San Diego.  All races and ages represented. Led by students.  You are the future and making the country better now!   Thanks to all who came

I'm so proud of all of you. Even more so today, proud to be an American. Thank you for speaking up and making yourselves heard. #MarchForOurLives
The only way to end school shootings would be to remove ALL guns owned by private citizens. If you ask for only assault rifles you will only decrease shootings not eliminate them. Either ask for what works or learn to cope with the aftermath.

After watching the complete DRAMA and over-acting today in WashDC from all the speeches at the March.
The rally calls for the DEM party.
The HATE given to the REP party.
We all know EXACTLY what the march was about.
