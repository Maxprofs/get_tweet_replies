Miley Cyrus announcing she deactivated her Twitter account by recording a rap song and making a music video for it. 
She sucks at rapping. Lol

ok but just one thing- you left a sliver of white space uncropped on the left side when you made it your avi and I think I speak for many others here when i say that's going to drive me a little insane 
we havent slept in days
hey ella maybe while you're lurking through viral twitter threads at 1 am you could take a few seconds to uuhh correctly crop your new avi so people can sleep peacefully
i think she has seen it by now, maybe her ocd isnt as bad as we thought

Oops Miley !! Lorde!! It'll be irritating to @taylorswift13
sexy
doug usually your judgement is spot on but I don't know if I can agree with you on this one
OMG @tofakeit how did my gf notice u

How did she retweet if she deleted it? Kind of like she “moved to Canada” she’s a proven liar.

I hope you lose your voice box

Miley’s right. Most of us are tweeting for others and not ourselves.
