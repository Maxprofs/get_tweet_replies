This is what you get at a fake rally with fake sweatshirts. Fake people sticking out their tongues. This is what parents are letting their children follow. While cops are killing children and we just let them.
What an idiotic reply. Do better.
And you are sticking up for a millionaire who gives a shit less about you and just wants your money. They live in a fortress behind guns! They have guns around them right now in secret keeping them safe. Keep letting them screw with your priorities! As long as the $ flows...
Another senseless reply. Because someone has $, they must be awful ppl? They don't care about any social issues? There's a stupid, inaccurate stereotype. And to be clear, I'm not sure you know my priorities. Do better.
Kelly she has body guards around her now with guns following her everywhere. She will never put herself out there for anyone or be vulnerable. It's all show. While she says children are not safe she has a gun following her. If you can't see the how she's getting over then idk.
What??? Trained professionals with guns? Say it ain't so. Pretty sure she can speak her mind, regardless of the presence of security. Your assertion that she shouldn't is mind-numbingly stupid. 1A, remember?
A person who would shoot a child that got anywhere near her that she didn't like.
WTF?!?!? Now this is a strawman argument, and I've got no time for that bullshit. We're done here. Have a great day
