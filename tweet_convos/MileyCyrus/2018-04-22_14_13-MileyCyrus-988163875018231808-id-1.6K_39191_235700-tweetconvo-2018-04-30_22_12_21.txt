OMG why did I think of the car scene in "The Last Song"  #Miam
me too i love this scene so much omg
Same they're just GOALSS he makes her laugh or gets on her nerves sometimes haha 
i just expected them to sing but they didnt :(
Ja das dachte ich auch, aber leider nicht...Stell dir mal vor  Haha I just replied in German bc I saw that you're from Germany as well but I live in Berlin :)
oh lol hi 
I coulda sworn this music wasn’t for you anymore?  You just can’t help that you’re the epitome of a culture vulture huh? Party In The USA still bangs though....I guess
Sis sit down. She already said she still likes Hip Hop music
I bet she does with her confused ass 
How is she confused? If you actually knew most of the things she has said in many interviews then you'd know that she isn't and never will be a culture vulture. She mad Mike Will produce an Alternative/Psychedelic album for her. He wasn't just used for Bangerz sis 
Didn’t realize you had to be confused to like more than one genre of music. That’s crazy.
This is what the world has come to. Nowadays music has It's own race too. We don't call it by It's genre anymore. We separate it by white and black music because people are ignorant
wheres the damn album sis
She just released one I-
i know im just kidding lol
but she’s coming  soon 
This is all I can think about
And she wiiiiiiiiL be loved 
:’)
This is so funny djdjdj we stan Liam
@LiamHemsworth you better not give my home girl a heart attack
