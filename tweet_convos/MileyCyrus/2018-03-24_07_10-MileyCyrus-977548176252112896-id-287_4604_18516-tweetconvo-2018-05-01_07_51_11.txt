Inspired too babe
IT'S THE CLIMB
The Climb 
YOU WILL SING THE CLIMB AND TODAY MAKES EXACTLY 12 YEARS OF HANNAH MONTANA, I'M NOT WELL
Miley, You say a song about cliches. How you got big on this song I’ll never know. One... work on your song writing skills, two... this has zero foreknowledge of gun violence. Smh.
Why can't you be happy that she actually used her voice and platform. If you don't like her, at least respect her and what she's doing
So proud of you baby 
Yes girl yes, it's about the climb #MarchForOurLives
The Climb is timeless

#EndArmedGuardsForCebrities
It will be old news in a week
chorei aqui

Why don't you write a song about mental illness, and the lack of professionalism by Broward County School District and the Sheriffs? It would make more sense! I know of two lawsuits already, but you folks still keep blaming the NRA & the Guns!
Itzzzz the cliiiiiiiiiiimbbbbbbbb
very meaningful lyrics
You climbed..now yo higher
@MileyCyrus 
#climb

Love you Miley!

Not wall Democrats are criminals but 90% of criminals are Democrats
No one cares how you feel about gun control! Get a real life and leave ours the f_ck alone.
I donated a pint of blood through the Red Cross. Minimum age is 16 with parent consent; 17 and above can all donate without parent consent!
Unfortunately Miley California & Florida are two Mickey Mouse state that have police dumb founded how these weapons fell into the wrong hands !!!!! Parents should take the blame. There  guns should be locked up unloaded. STUPID killings.   Love Ya Miley and have a great day.
People now are coming into the age where their Votes matter .
Our dreams Miley Cyrus are our insightful views of a pending future , what becomes from our insight is based on us .
We  stand with you and your fight to end gun violence..!!
#12YearsOfHannahMontana

I always loved the interpretation more than anything. You did so much better than i ever would have dreamt myself. You're the greatest, undisputed no. 1, so it became real after what i suspect has been the craziest climb in human history. LoveU

I believe in you Miley!
I salute you. Thank you for leading and being so brave.

Amazing lyrics

So very true, perfect lyrics for today. We may be British but we are behind you 1000%.

Why not teach kids to not alienate the odd balls and the loners then they wouldn't feel like shooting their classmates is the only answer. It's not a gun problem it's a compassion problem
Thank you for using your platform for good and for change ♡
