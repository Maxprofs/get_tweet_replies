Poor little rich girl with armed security wants to limit poor peoples gun rights.

How about telling teens to stop bullying each to the point of suicide or to the point where the victim snaps and shoots his or her fellow students if do notice majority of the shooters where bullied by fellow students

Thank you for your support m
