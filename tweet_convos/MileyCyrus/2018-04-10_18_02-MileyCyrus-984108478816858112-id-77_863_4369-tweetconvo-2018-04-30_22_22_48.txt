BITCH IS BACK
Beautiful babee
I saw Elton interviewed about his tribute and he didn’t seem like he liked it at all. He kinda acted like a Brat. Too bad, because he has great music.

Who knew one of the great interpreters of the Elton/Bernie songbook would be Miley? She has a hell of a voice and knows how to use it.  The two cuts on #EltonREVAMP #Eltonrestoration are great, she was great w ej at the Grammys, and tonight #EltonSalute Brill!
I love Davey’s guitar, a backwards flying “V”!
Go Miley.
Go Dee!!!!!
