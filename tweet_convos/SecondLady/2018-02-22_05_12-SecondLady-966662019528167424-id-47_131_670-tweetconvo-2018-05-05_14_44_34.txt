@VPPressSec You forgot to retweet this one on @VP

I'd like to ask Karen Pence if she thinks she could shoot a gun fast enough & accurately enough to take out a bad guy with an AR-15 with one shot (there won't be time for another) ... oh, while she's protecting 2nd graders???
I love Mrs. Pence
In a tap on the shoulder of her man to dance way.
In a "please secret service do not hurt me way"

In spirit I am close enough
God bless her
@SecondLady thanks for visiting Central Florida and learning more about Music Therapy! Next time we would love to have you @JoyfulMT in Orlando!
Thank you @SecondLady for visiting @Nemours Children's Hospital and highlighting our important and successful music therapy program!
I was in a rehab hospital when I was given a roommate, an elderly woman who was very agitated and confused.  I turned on some lighr classical music.  She called down almost instantly.
Hello, Mrs Karen Pence. That's true that music therapy helps to heal a child's pain.
Also, keeping assault weapons from flooding our streets is a great way to keep our children safe.
Bless you and your mission! Art therapy and music therapy made a Huge difference in understanding myself and my recovery. Thank you.
That’s why we need music in school we probably need this program is for two I have many ideas that will help get to the root of the problem do you want to contact me I live two hours away the Carlisle Barracks Housing get together
Thank you for shining a light on this type of therapy.
Nice to read about your art therapy initiative and music therapy as well There is a healing power in sound that can help in everything from ptsd to oncology - I also think drama therapy is pretty good too :) p
I did music therapy in college and I believe in it. You are an angel Mrs Second Lady. Truly

Music is a wonderful art to involve your child in! It’s enjoyable, productive, rewarding & relaxing!

Mrs. Pence
You introduced your husband at cpac and mentioned Horses Please look into the over sixty thousand Horses being held in pens by the BLM Awaiting their fate, torture, starvation or sent to Slaughter. Please tell your husband. Kill pens also hold thousands throughout USA.
Gospel Music is Best ,I Love Jimmy Swaggarts Piano ,Its the anointing ! Praise God .
With all due respect Mrs. Second Lady, when will we start focusing more on Interventions to stop this cycle from happening. We must fix the cause in order to have a different effect so that these children & their families have different outcomes. Please, Listen Linda! Jk love ya
gOOD FOR YOU MRS. PENCE......YES, MUSIC DOES SO MUCH FOR THE SOUL.
seeing your husband dragged to jail would ease the country's pain. #youmarriedgarbage
I believe good music soothes the spirit...   Blessings.
