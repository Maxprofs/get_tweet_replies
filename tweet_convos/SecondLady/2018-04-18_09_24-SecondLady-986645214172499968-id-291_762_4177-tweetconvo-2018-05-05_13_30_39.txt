Please run 2020
We love you, Mr. VP
Is this kind of like that costly stunt to go walk out of a football game on OUR dime?
You mean to golf some more right?
The United States returned the honor and appreciation the Prime Minister showed the US on their visit to Japan.

The United States and Japan have mutual respect! 
That's a very good sign!

"He that loveth pureness of heart,
For the grace of his lips the king will be his friend."
All the best.
So Spotus and Slotus meet up with Potus and Flotus. Sounds just as confusing as you handling our affairs.
VP needs to be impeached as well he been a yes me we need a fresh new white house to stop the rich only .
@VP America is tired of watching trump make money off this presidency. We except this amoral crap from him but YOU no YOU will answer there is nothing innocent or Godly in YOU.
God bless the People of Japan with  Abundance and lots of Made in the USA...

Job 38:7
When the stars were made, the angels praised me with a loud voice...
Talk BUBBLES.
I appreciate the warmest regards of the Vice President&Second Lady.
Off to Florida again on my dime and the american people you and trump or bringing america down and Putin is laughing at us the people need to stand up and get rid of that wanted be god need to in peach trump and pence and Mitch they need to do like paul Ryan to get out of office




I've got to admit, Mr. #Pence, that your tweets are so inspiring.
Bravo

Mod POUGE 420
can you hear the drums of justice? they are beating for you.


Did you take the Rolls-Royce or Pope Mobile? How much does this cost USA? Your plane IS SMALL.
Have you happened to notice the Pedofile registry around the area? 
Isn’t it time we address the problem
yes I am trying to heal with the heart 
LOVE ALL
THANK YOU
Be a man grow a pair stop kissing as your wife and children have lost all respect for you.
Mike Pence, most boring vice president EVER.
When you want to do illegal dealings you go down to Florida to Mara Largo funny how this regime in the White House don't hold any meetings in the White House
How much are we paying for your room to the Trump organization?
Love you guys! May God bless you all and keep you all safe! I keep you all in my prayers to stay strong despite the disrespectful comments from the losers.
Why not use Camp David and save $20 million? #VoteThemOut The secret service bill alone is probably $20Million!!
These should be done in Washington at the “Tippy Top Shape” White House. Too many taxpayer dollars wasted with all these fancy trips.
Thank you for all you do for our country!
Hope all goes well with the talks. May God less you and this meeting.

Ya where Trump is making money most likely charging tax payers about a $1000 a night
I was thinking out loud today.  Our 2nd lady is pretty awesome. We are very lucky to have such a great 1st & 2nd Lady. And lucky to have our President & Vice President working so hard for us.
She better than the first she is America and not a Russian pron Star
Oh my goodness!  How wonderful for you!!  Just an FYI, Trumps official golf trip count stands at 101 at a $ 64,165,048 cost to the American tax payer. You're the party of fiscal responsibility so I'm sure you know what you're doing.  Have fun!!  Enjoy!!!
More tax dollar money being pumped into a private resort, with a membership of $250,000 a year and American tax dollars are paying for you people to have a good time at Donald Trump private Resort what is not on ethical about this
Yup, spend our tax dollars. Ignore Puerto Rico.
On our tax money. How many times have you and your worthless boss been to Mar-a-lago on our expense?
You have absolutely no spine, you will never be president


Since Trump refuses to help our fellow citizens in PR, would you two please head there next? #TrumpFailure
CONFIRMED: 
Black out in Puerto Rico. 
The entire island is without power. There is “ZERO power generation at this point”, according to a 2nd @AEEONLINE spokesman…
.@SecondLady & I are off to Mar-a-Lago to join @POTUS & @FLOTUS for golf. 

There, I fixed it for you.

C'mon Mikey, you know God hates it when you lie.
And join in the implicit graft to the #corruptpotus.  Thanks from a taxpayer paying you to pay Trump!
Thank you for spending more government money to enrich his pockets. I’m sure they will post a huge profit this year thanks to the money from the citizens taxes
#Miralargo = #moneyforTrump #conflict #ripoff #entitlement #MSNBC #CNN #DNC #RNC
Enjoy the vacation. So happy to be able to give you lazy, corrupt people that gift!
*makes
Oh so you are going to be playing some golf also
Praying for safety and wisdom.
Go to the beach and relax. That's very important You deserve it.
Go to the beach! Envoy! You deserve it!
Wonderful!! Please give our regards and warmest wishes for a wonderful visit to the Abes.
Keep up the good work you and Trump just keep going and going , God Bless 
Sick.

What happened to never leaving DC because of all the work?

Lies
Stay there. Retire. #resign
Godspeed!!
lazy bastard

And play some golf and eat gourmet Trump food at the tax payer’s expense.
Be safe!

Have some good relaxing fun too.
Well, enjoy the caviar. The soup kitchens, are always open in Indiana.

They could’ve just taken your cardboard cutout, no one would know the difference.
Karen, has Barbara's red shoes on. The torch has been passed. I wondered who it was. I could only see the shoes and white dress.
Another vacation and marketing jaunt at our expense.
So now you are promoting trumps businesses also. I will not normalize this crazy, corrupt, white house. Mikey knows also and that's called treason
Bye jerks! You know you’re complicit.

You mean to meet with Putin
You must be the caddie
And watch Trump play golf
.Are you going to talk about what’s happening in #PuertoRico? Or do you not give a damn?
@PhilipRucker
17h ago

On CNN @jamiegangel is talking about how thoughtful and decent George and Barbara Bush were with staff, noting when they went to the Vatican they asked who was Catholic so those aides could join. Marked contrast to Trump excluding Sean Spicer last year.
The amount of tax payers money you and 45 waste on these vacations are appalling. Do your business in the White House or Camp David. 45 is not supposed to make a profit off this office.
Who gives a shit?

Does your CoS, Nick Ayers have any comments? In case you missed it, NDAs aren’t really working anymore. Ask Michael Cohen and POTUS.
Nothing to say about PR? I know, brown Americans don’t mean shit to you people... but come on!
There is no such things as “Second Lady”.
OFO with Trump!

Stay there. #resist
Why don’t you go to Puerto Rico and fix that problem!!!!!!
Off for a dirty weekend on the tax payer. Bunch of grifters.
Who cares.
More taxpayers money funneled to the Trump private business.
Hate Mar-a-logo construes Marago or Maralongo both referring to witchcraft and the former 'the scarily nails on a prey's paws' and how it is admirable these days.
We love you guys very much. God bless you @VP @SecondLady
Good luck and thank you for all you are doing for our great country!! Stand firm!!!
and golf. lots of golf...
translation: Trump decided to golf rather than do gov't biz and Flotus is threatening to leave and the Japanese find it insutling to be left alone after the long flight #TradingSpaces #freebigwig
Amazes me how FLATUS is so greedy that she would stay with some animal like Trump but money does talk so guess she loves the talk.
If she’s the veep’s second lady, how many ladies did the president get? @bazmaniandevil #StormySavesAmerica
Oh, look! Another costly golfing weekend vacation on the Taxpayers dollar that could have just as well been done at Camp David!
Never Forget Puerto Rico  keep your promises. Rebuild Puerto Rico .   #PuertoRicoRelief
How about you fiscal conservatives fly together and save some money assholes.
Because the POTUS and CO cannot be on the same aircraft, ever. It has been policy for years.
You're r right..still chaps my ass
There going down for a wild sex party for sure !!!!!!!!
Who will be thrown out of office in June for cronyism
Could you possibly suggest that he meet some of these officials at Camp David? 
1) It would save taxpayer dollars
2) We wouldn't be putting more money into Trump family businesses (I have no idea why this isn't an ethics violation. His family gets richer with ever POTUS visit),

You should be going to honor Barbara Bush instead.
My-What-A-Shithole needs a Tidal Wave!
Teaching him arts and crafts????

Please try to keep trump from embarrassing the country. Or insulting one of our greatest allies.
Love the SecondLady’s red shoes !
MORE vacation time for you too?
   Great Job, Mikey!

#PenceKnew


Great man, I love you!!
Liar, nobody likes you
Wasting taxpayers money again Traveling with your wife when you're suppose to be at the VP Residence waiting to break a tie in the Senate

Enjoy those H2B workers Trump has... us 0 because none of you care to help us ... release visas
How do you respond to Trump's lying tweet regarding Comey firing.  Maybe you should watch the Lsster Holt interview on your trip.
Why is a state visit from a foreign leader being held in Florida when it should be held at the White House? The White House is the symbol of the United States not the presidents golf course.
I agree!  Plus look at all the expense to the taxpayers not to mention all the disruption to local businesses.
Have a super time. God bless.

Second lady and I are off to spend your tax dollars again!
The prime minister has been in DC for days.  Why do you need to spend all that taxpayer money so trump can show off?   Do you have that little regard for the taxpayers?
Thanking God, for our @POTUS and @VP  and our first ladies!  All hard working American patriots! #MAGA  and #KAG
Free Palestine today.
Mother, may I admire Melania's fine imported assets?
De-fund Evangeliticals
Says the second in command from the fiscallyconservative party of over-the-top spending of our money on themselves.  #ComplicitGOP #gopthieves #TrumpEnabler  #ActionsSpeakLouderthanWords
You need to check. The last I new about Obama took more of our money than any President. Why do you think the deficit is so high. Or do you know what a deficit is?
Bad week for the Pence Kushner Haley neocon cons. Really bad week.
How much are you charging America for your stay, or should I say how much is Trump charging you?
.
.
Off to kiss up to the guy you will go to prison for, sad!
They are golfing.
Shameful waste of money!!
Enjoy the golf weekend because that’s about all you’ll get done!
BFD!
Is Don Donald charging you the full rate or are the taxpayers picking up the bill!!!!
How much of taxpayers money have you all spent at @MarALago so far?
And waste more taxpayer money by going there instead of White House?
There's this huge white house at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave with dozens of meeting rooms and facilities specifically designed for this. Why are you going to a golf resort on the tax payer's dime?
God be with you sir....
Odd
Important talks should be held in our nations capital
Unethical....what are you hiding?
hatch your evil plans to hide more secrets from the American people

And we'll use big words, lots of big words, because we know some - and even what some of them mean. Word.
TRAITORS, our constitution has a prescription for that
Keep mother safe.  Bring Purel!

Oh yeah? Nice! Sounds like #AGoodTimeOnOurDime
How much do you expect the bill to be this time for the secret service rooms and golf carts? Trump still charging full price to the tax payers?
.@SecondLady & I are off to Mar-a-Lago to join @POTUS & @FLOTUS for important talks w/ our great ally and friend @AbeShinzo.
"Important talks"
You deserve a break.  You practically work 24/7.   Enjoy your WORKING getaway.  God knows the other presidents did and didn’t work half the hours.
There is a blackout in #PuertoRico
Hey you crooked fucks, why are you meeting with international leaders at a privately owned club? How much is #Drumpf making of of the dignitaries who will stay there? It's called emoluments and you need to get serious about this! You're all such offensively crooked lying fucks!!
To SPEND MORE OF Americans hard earned money
If you stayed at a local hotel where Government Workers stay Would have More Respect
Perhaps you should instead go to Puerto Rico to address it’s on going humanitarian crisis/lack of electricity.  Need to get priorities straight.
Since the White House is under constant FBI surveillance, the only way for you traitors to have treasonous conversations is to leave and go to a Trump property, isn't it??
DO enjoy your time on my dime.
Pissing tax money away.
You do know that the money that the government pays for all of you to stay there eventually ends you up in con man trump’s pocket don’t you?  It’s no accident that he prefers his own properties, no skimming off the top at Camp David for example.
It's one big Deplorable party!
Really hoping you go to jail!
