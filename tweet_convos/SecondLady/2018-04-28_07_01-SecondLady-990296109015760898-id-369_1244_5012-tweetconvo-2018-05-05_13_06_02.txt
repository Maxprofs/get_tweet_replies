Joshua 1:8-9
This Book of the Law shall not depart from your #mouth, but you shall #meditate in it #day and #night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your #way prosperous, and then you will have good [1/2]
#success. Have I not #commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the #Lord your #God is with you wherever you go.” [2/2]
1 Timothy 2:1-4
Therefore I exhort first of all that #supplications, #prayers, #intercessions, and giving of #thanks be made for all #men, for #kings and all who are in #authority, that we may lead a #quiet and #peaceable life in all #godliness and #reverence. For [1/2]
this is good and acceptable in the #sight of #God our #Savior, who desires all #men to be saved and to come to the #knowledge of the #truth. [2/2]

It's always infrastructure week.
Why don’t you get him off the drugs he’s on?

There is nothing that could fuel the potential for drug abuse and addiction problems in this country more than the chaos of your presidency.
Are you serious?? This is beyond Trump derangement syndrome.
If you think that what happens in other countries to the poor,  who often turn to using addictive substances to stave off hunger can't happen here, then you're not very well informed about the world. Trump targets the poor, who can least afford to be targeted.
So the people are so poor they can’t afford food and become so hungry that they spend money they obviously don’t have to buy food on drugs, which are always more expensive than food. Oh boy that’s rich.  .
Clear you’re not a prosecutor. You can use household substances to get high. And there is a sharing culture amongst drug users. No one person has to have money all the time to get high. Do some research before you spout off stupidity.
Clearly you’re not an intelligent human being either. Where are you a prosecutor that you find the majority of drug addicts get started on said drugs because their tummy is empty? I’m guessing #FantasyLand. #Dope
There's a non habit forming solution for Trump derangement syndrome.  It's called common sense.
God I wish there was. This country would become way more sensible.
@realDonaldTrump, Why do we have to wait an entire year to find a place to dispose of these expired or unused drugs?  Every pharmacy in the country should be able to dispose of these year round with no questions asked.
Check with your Pharmacy. My Pharmacy will allow me to drop off unused drugs at any time.
Starting with all the drugs Jackson peddled in his tenure.
Yes give your meds to the DEA so they can then give them to Mexican Cartels in Fast & Furious Part 2!

Added Bonus, politicians get richer from their owners: healthcare & big pharma!
How about “National My prescription drugs are too expensive” Day.  $1400 for 30 pills, insurance won’t cover them, can’t go without them...
How bout let’s get rid of big pharma
Who will produce life saving drugs then?
We love our country and President 
Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't it the lion that was the coward in Oz? I guess this is appropriate though, tRump does afterall believe that Putin is the wizard behind the curtain who can help him be BIGLY MAN.

This week – Take back day.
Next week – streets are flooded with prescription drugs.
Man get rid of that it ruin d my life for 20 years.  Im clean today cause of Lord and Savior Amen.
Spanky’s stash must be getting low again !
Dr. Ronny Jackson. Is he in charge of storing those pills?
I am 94. In a conveleacent facility. Watch our President every day. Praying for his total success. I have always been watchful of the drugs I take.
Bless you

All returned drugs will be forwarded to Dr/Adm Ronny Jackson for “disposal”.

Admiral/Doctor Ronny Jackson back on the job??

When are you going after the real dealers, the ones with an MD, and Big Pharmaceutical?
When will you go after the American killers?
The opioid epidemic was addiction for profit by American 1% against Americans.
The body count will not diminish until the Big Pharma Drug Dealers and their willingly paid Doctor pushers are charged and do time!
Good thing we have a president that is paying attention to this very same matter that you are inquiring about.
#Trump has done nothing at all to help end this American epidemic.
It's a shame he refused the recommendations of his own committee and has allowed this to continue.
His only action was to put a media spokes person in charge who hasn't done anything other than a couple interviews
I never had a pill problem until I went to see a doctor.
don’t even get me started on Suboxone. I was having trouble kicking 50mg hydro addiction that began w/ kidney stones. Dic said subs were a miracle drug. I got hooked on those then they told me how hard they were to kick. I went cold . 30 days.
Hi Donald thanks for what you've done for the USA it means a lot thank you so much
What a great idea! We could do the same with guns and tax exemptions for corporations!
Wow. The audacity.
Check these pupils out!
#POTUS45 Here is what addiction looks like.

Will @POTUS be turning his in?
Love it!!! Getting prescriptions out of the hands of those who may be harmed. #BeGratefulNotHateful
This will probably do more to protect the watershed in a particular community than it will to stop addiction. Did you just do something environmentally friendly and not realize it?
I find this strange.  Particularly because it is our doctors who are over prescribing medications. Pillars of the community. Why treat this as if it's an unseen, unknown foreign agent?
you wanna prevent drug addiction yet you’re legalizing weed. how smart is this country, guys? really!
Cannabis is not physically addictive. Also is far more beneficial than the majority of prescription medications that are killing people.
keep telling yourself that at 4:20 everyday buddy
From the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)

(If none of it makes any sense to you, you’ve done too much weed)

Essentially they concluded that usage is psychologically addictive; &,it significantly alters brain architecture & chemistry.
wow look! It’s the worst dictator in the history of fascism!
Our nation needs a Narcan distribution day for family members, loved ones, and active opiate addicts alike in order to save the lives of over-dosing opiate dependent and addicts alike! Narcan should be made available in order to save lives in the midst of a National Opioid Crisis

We have an opioid crisis in this country and you call a man an American hero even though he may have been OVER PRESCRIBING! They call him the candy man for Christ sake... Smh

I hope world should take arurveda or organic drugs  for extremely low side or no side effects.
No such thing as a side effect. Just effects. But absolutely natural and organic is the only real answer.
Locoweed, peyote, salvia, cannabis, psilocybin, tobacco, jimsonweed, coca & opium are all “natural”, “organic” drugs. Natural & organic doesn’t automatically mean safe.

Many “herbal” supplements can killer you.

Absolutely, chewing on a raw cocoa plant would be ill advised.
Interesting thought from Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Until marijuana is federally legalized, it cannot be researched to determine appropriate levels and dosages. People are guesstimating usage, products, etc. I try different products - edibles, vapes, “raw,” to find what works for me.
This just sounds like a Trump missed opportunity. If only he would have nominated Ronny the Candy Man to lead this day of Prescription Drug Disposal. #TrumpLoser
Mr. President, please read and study Psalm 88 with your pastor and pause to feel the hopelessness of those who need relief from pain. Please help give them comfort.
Maybe mention this to Ronny Jackson.... I hear he has some prescriptions laying around

Could we "Take Back the 2016 Election"?  It was stolen by #Russians who #Colluded with #Kushner and company to install a certified idiot in the White House.  Trump is too stupid to know how stupid he is; and anyone who supports him is, well, lacking a moral compass.  Sad!
PowerPrayers 
So will the WH DR be collecting these drugs to give out to the staff?
Why is it when I had emergency surgery they want to give me oxy when i asked for Tylenol 3 with codine they said they arent authorized to prescribe them. Makes no sense espcially i told them I dont want oxy or can take it.Makes me sick. This is messed up.
Should be lock up a Doctor Day

Make sure you tell Ronny Jackson so he can get rid of all the illegal ones he stole.
#TheGreatAwakening Also in the news
Addressing the most important issue. Unneeded opioids.
Sorry I save my left overs n very can tell if I can use them again. Why should you pay double if the DC calls in same meds.

Make sure Dr Ronnie disposes of all of those illegal drugs in the White House.  Surly your Tweet must be a joke.
Will Dr Ronny be at the head of the line?
I know someone who wants to take some back.
Not until you legalize marijuana.

Did you guys know that anti depressants have been found in the brains of fish. And that due to hornones being dumped in the water male fish have been feminized. Male fish have been found with eggs in their genitals. That means we have made transgender fish that wont get depressed
Fill’em up.
Don't you dare say a word about the president's nominee for va ditrctor nothing has been proved about the accusations against him. You should all be ashamed for messing his clean teputation
No more words necessary for the despicable dotard you support!!!
That’s great but can the @potus please get us good affordable healthcare PLEASE? or was that just a campaign lie?
How can I get a job at a disposal site? I want to give back.
Years ago I was working as a steamfitter on an existing resource-recovery garbage-burning steam generation plant. US Marshals came in for a few days to dispose of confiscated drugs in the boilers. Those guys had absolutely no sense of humor.

Well the Prez has this doctor that is totally handing out drugs - so looks like a break even moment.
The drug industry must be reigned in! @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
Why crush enterprising Americans by telling them to not be a dealer?
WHY ARE YOU ANTI JOBS!?
Yes we need to get all the bad drugs like Oxycontin, methadone, Suboxone, zanaxs,an other drugs like cocaine, heroin,LSD,pcp, any needle dope too!
FREE MARIJUANA!!!
Yet you have s candyman doctor on staff... irony much?  #fatnixon
@rushlimbaugh hey ...   it’s your favorite day!
TELL THE CANDY MAN DRUNKEN RONNY TO LAY OFF.
What about all the prescriptions Jackson handed out like post it notes? Shouldn't @realDonaldTrump be talking about death penalty fir him as a drug dealer?
Stop @pfizer and stop #DrugTakeBack to begin with
Don't make a problem where it doesn't exist, not for any type of gain ! The problem is people, communication, emotional health, mental health !! These are only a few reasons so many folks make good 'targeted-addicts' in OUR contemporary society !

Then stop the doctors and hospitals for getting kick backs from the pharm companies.

trump is dreaming there's no collusion that is what trump want to think but we all know the truth trump is believing in his own lies he's a madman ranting and raving in Michigan! Does trump have a job instead of ranting and raving about Russia he sounds like a guilty man
How is the relationship between Melania and him going?

Oh the irony of it all, given the failed presidential nomination of Jackson, the “Candy Man”, you should have changed the date.  “Alright everybody gather 'round

Anything you want
You've come to the right man

Absolutely. Thank you President Trump
What about having a fking take a gun back day.?
Dispose of your drugs every single day either by the fire department even some of your local CVS will destroy them
Do we take them to Ronny Jackson’s office?
