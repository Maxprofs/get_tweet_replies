Sleeveless? Is that allowed? Mrs Obama was skewered for wearing a sleeveless dress! Yikes. White arms are okay I guess.
The 44th had to overcome obstacles 45 will never even be able to comphrehend...He not only overcame them but turned them into points of accomplishments, he handled more than 45 could handle in a thousand terms, and did it with eloquence and Grace & amazing integrity and wit...
When President Obama spoke it was with thought and genuine care, the speech he gave after Gabby Gifford was almost assassinated was one of the most heartfelt and touching ever given, not a dry eye around, now trump, he sounds like a wino who's pissing on a bldg w loud wet farts..
The glaring difference is that Donny speaks horribly bc if the subject matter which is always himself,,  look at me world, look at me people, I need you to look at me, now tell me how brilliant I am,  how handsome I am,,, oh yeah maybe I better throw in a good insult against ppl

Hey Andrea’s, I still don’t know what you mean? Can you explain a little more in detail?

Proud to stand with the First Lady !
Your sick she’s forgiven!
Don't forget to give your boss credits...
Somebody please tell me how his supporters if truthful know and heard this man say this ,,how can they trust a hero like him. If it were their wife or daughter he was speaking of think they would accept the lame locker room story? Bet not if they were any kind of man they wouldnt
more filler. BORING
What about Global Awareness for "Climate Change"  without monitoring our environment  ..future people will no longer exist.
Brawwo
How can Karen carry on like this is a normal day? Her husband has been proven to cover-up for traitors, she is supporting the conspiracy against the United States of America.
This is not normal. Thoughts and prayers you may still be able to save your soul.
Magnificent, great work and many thanks to all the participants, and to you Karen Pence the second Lady. Lovely.

For God's sake no he doesn't, I frankly am disappointed in a man that I thought was a moral person, how can Pence even be near trump, knowing the downright filthiness of the person, we know money doesn't equal cleanliness especially inward, the man must smell of rot  inwardly ...
@VP & @SecondLady are HYPOCRITES & FAUX CHRISTIANS! It is that simple!
My son was honored to meet you and the First Lady during your visit to Corpus Christi after Hurricane Harvey. You came to the food bank and he asked you to thank your son for his  honorable service to our great country serving in the United States Marine Corps. 
Meeting Melania in her designer outfits. While the people of Teaxs have an emergency.  SAD
buenas noches
You and the VP are doing a great job IMO.
Unfortunately, her husband's boss is a moron. He will be forever tainted thru association.
Idk I feel great about both of them. Moron is a technical term (IQ of 51–70) so you are wrong. Trump's IQ is 156.
Ok, u obviously don't like the term "moron". How about "unwise"?
His wisdom or lack thereof will speak for itself. 

How about adding "...in my opinion?"
He fired the head of the FBI while he was being investigated. Was that wise. Btw that decision created Mueller. Now he thinking about firing Mueller. Wise, I think not. His revolving door cabinet. Where's the vetting. Do u see wisdom in any of this?
U did not answer my question so not answering yours.
Ok, in my, fact based, on evidence that so incredibly one sided that only one response can be made, opinion!!! Satisfied?

Madam VP, Sister cities are an excuse for politicians to waste our tax $$s on THEIR paid vacations. We did not elect representatives and executives for boondoggles at our expense. Call “sister cities” what they are - a swamp-like waste of your time and our money. Voters notice.
And thank you Madame VP
funny how the GOP has done its best to cut cultural funding, educational funding, etc.  Hypocrites and liars.
.@SecondLady

Thank you for serving US.
You better hope your hubby is not in those tapes!
Wonderful work thank you karen
 Thank you Second Lady Karen! Love you and what you’re doing for us.

No more refugees. They are not refugees but infiltrators. We are at war with obama's resist movements and gangs, obama's civil war in USA. @POTUS @TheDemocrats @GOP @BarackObama

Who cares. You and your husband, with his schizophrenic conversations with God can just go away. He is complicit and will be indicted, tried and imprisoned. #IndivisibleTeam #TheResistance #SignOfResistance

Hey, girl
Thank you Mrs.Pence for all you do. God bless.
Karen, please remind Mike that adultery is a sin and sexual assault is a felony. He seems to have no problem turning a blind eye to these facts in the case of @realDonaldTrump
You have no clue you are enrobed in a criminal cabal.  OPEN YOUR EYES Madam Pence
Does it bother you, as a #christian to have your family stand next to a man who loves to #grabthembythepussy and pays #pornstars and #playboy models? It should bother you. #NotMyPresident
I agree with your art therapy efforts; however, you will be forever tainted by your proximity to the morally bankrupt president. Just go away.


Good luck, public speaking is my kriptonite.

Doing a great job Mr. Vice President along with Second Lady. #KAG 
God Bless our POTUS and VP’s Family 
BEAUTIFUL 
Amerikans in Puerto Rico need help.

Wrong color it appears. 

Sad
Didn't know Puerto Rican people where "American". It's a US territory but the voted against becoming a state.
Future First Lady
Traveling mercies.

God bless you you are one sweetheart and we love our Vice President 
Wrong... If it's anyone it's you.
You are a wonderful breath of fresh air.
You are the most active Second Lady ever.   Thank you for your service.
You are a fraud....just like your husband....just like the president
Children acting like adults, adults acting like children. Wow
Thank you Karen.
How are you?
WE ARE PROUD OF YOU AND VP . AMERICA IS GETTING GREATER WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF POTUS AND VPOTUS AND THE GREAT WORK OF FLOTUS AND VPFLOTUS.WE STAND PROUD
Jesus is willing to forgive the vilest of persons. I don't hear Trump asking for forgiveness.
Love our @SecondLady  She's so sweet 
So excited to have @VP and their family to serve  Thank you Jesus 
Very proud of you Karen!
