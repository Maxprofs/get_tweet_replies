Hello miss Pence a possible dinner chat with your husbund.. could be why is it all right for us to multiply our spending in our armed force's and it's not okay for Korea to take action on daceds year defence technology MaAm.
I have ptsd from medical related pain. Music plays inside me. I have painted fine arts in Klimt and Schiele style

K Pence is REALLY ON THIS
Hallelujah
Did you get some crayons to bring back to Donald?

Oh look, you're at another well funded site. Tweet when you're doing more than art therapy photo ops
DID YOU DISCUSS YOUR HUSBANDS ATTITUDE TOWARD LACK OF MORAL CHARACTER IN HIS ADMINISTRATION. DO YOU EVER ASK #FLOTUS ABOUT THIS OR HER CHAIN-MIGRATION PARENTS THAT YOU & MIKE ABHOR. ARE YOU AS BIG OF HYPOCRITE AS MIKE? YOUR CHILDREN WILL KNOW TRUTH, NOT YOUR ALTERNATE VERSION
Your doing a great job Second Lady Pence!

Hello


Your president wants to cut funding to the arts and to libraries and educations. He’s an idiot, in case you haven’t figured that out yet.
You know Mother, Mikey was practicing art therapy with his camera.
Making the insurance companies pay enough to actually cover our overhead and materials will change the mental health world. No place I work can afford art supplies for patients
You were with students? Was the teacher armed?

@Hillaryh4444Hos     Pence brother works (high position) for #Cummins   Who benefits if #RussiaSanctions lifted
These children were slaughtered because of YOUR Administration.
And all you can talk about is #Therapy 
Fu
Therapy my ass!

This young student was shot down by a mentally ill man.
Your Administration
supported the executive order that allows mentally ill people not to have back ground checks for assault weapons.
Putins Agenda i suppose.
shame!
#GunControlNow
Anything to say about this? Disgusting people - get the hell out of the White House.

New: When the RNC stopped paying Trump's family legal bills, it quietly began paying Trump $37,500 a month in rent, plus $12,000 a month in salary to Vice President Mike Pence’s nephew. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/rnc-paid-trump-campaign-trump-tower-rent-after-paying-legal-bills.html …
No one cares what Mikey or you think. Get a real job.
Good tell your dopey husband to  restore full funding to the Endowments For The Arts. His loser boss stole it and gave it to the military.
@SecondLady , or do you prefer Mother, have you noticed how lustfully Mike looks at President Trump?
Just to let you know, this is just happened in Syria.
No @VP Pence
You’re wrong
Democrats aren’t merely resisters
We’re not just against Trump
We’re pro America
Pro equality
Pro justice
Pro democracy 
Our ideas are supported by most Americans
The GOP is the party of corruption
Unlawfulness
Lies
Hate
Good luck running on that.

did the teachers have guns to protect you?
More gun violence fears for US students. Happening now in Colorado. This madness must end and the answer is not more guns.
Thank you Second Lady Karen for all you do for Americans. Refreshing and so welcome after decades of being invisible to tyrannical politicians.
Did you know your husband is doing nothing about children being murdered? Please get on him.
Ask them about this while there
Thank U art is an amazing form of therapy with humans working on expressing their feelings while they did not have a great child life. From emotional, physical to sexually abuse U are helping tremendously. Only @SecondLady that has. U are not fat shaming like Michelle Obama. @VP

@VP was very kind to Adam wishing him luck. He didn't have to do that. Stop the hate and dividing. You're the spoon stirring the pot. Stop it, its counterproductive. Makes you look petty.

But yet you and your husband support an administration that wants to cut arts funding. Sad!
Meanwhile, kids are being slaughter in our schools!!!
Thank you so much for your service
Most impressive
Did they ask you and @mike_pence about all of Paul Manafort’s new indictments and how he was the one who CHAMPIONED HIS HIRING?

They inspired you... how??  Inspired you to To talk to your hubby about cuts to education such as this??
@donlemon don we have so many guns we trip on them.  There are no need for AR type guns.  Agree in the us the common denominator is guns
How about gay conversion therapy? Does Mikey penis know anything about that?
YOUR HUSBAND SUCKS UP TO TRUMP SO HARD. MOTHER MUST BE MAD!!! 
U & Ur husband @VP is very impolite in 2018 winter olympic festival at Korea 반성하시라. 부창부수. 마이크가 그런 짓을 하더라도 부인이라도 손을 내밀 수 있는 아량이 있었어야지..
韩国，世界垃圾聚集之地
Very impressed that highest level Fed. Govt.has focused on this overlooked therapy.Doing Art, works.Promoting this, another good idea !
Zzzzzzzzz.
Art can definitely be inspiring...
Your buddy, the Governor of Missouri, just got arrested. You know all the best people!!!
Welcomed my good friend Governor @EricGreitens to the White House today. He is doing a great job for the people of Missouri. 

Your thoughts are the same as mine. @vp is not an innocent bystander in #TrumpRussiaCollusion & is, of course, a pawn in Putin's game.
God Bless you sweet lady!!  We are blessed as well as Mike.  He would not be able to be who we need him to be without your support...so Many Thanks!!  You are not forgotten even if you dont hear it as much as Melania!  We love you too!
You've got to read this about Mr. Sycophant.......such a complete fraud!
Mrs. Pence, you are 100% class and grace. I am so proud of our lovely Second Lady!
Can you ask Mother, @SecondLady, what her opinion is on your good friend MO Gov @EricGreitens getting arrested today and is she okay with you getting ideas of bondage and blackmail from him?
I want to join your team!
You are a wonderful 2nd Lady. Thank you for everything you do!
Where are the women at?

You know what inspires me? The Parkland kids and getting guns out of our schools and banning assault rifles. Be like me.
Well it would help if you were knowledgeable first & not just spout taking point and #fakenews.  There is NO SUCH THING as and “assault rifle”.  AR does NOT stand for assault.  Do some research.  But like most #liberal #sheep, you won’t.  #GetEducated
I’ve never heard of Art Therapy but it does make sense that certain forms of art can be therapeutic.  My favorite are clear running mountain streams with a snow capped mountain in the background during the springtime.
Hopefully, the instructor is armed. He is teaching, after all.
We are so excited that you are inspired #neveragain
I'm guessing you and that dude from Sealab 2021 don't have sex

#AliensReplacedTrumpsBrainWithPuddingAndHisPenisWithACheeto
#PenceKnew #PenceToo
Crap. Now I'm not going to be able to get that out of my head.
“Mother, tell your children not to walk my way, motherrrrr!!!!
 Ok Karen, Your husband's administration just called to defund the NEA and NEH.

Shut up

Will it help the survivors of the 18 shootings your husband was a party to grieve?
Why don’t you really help kids.  Stop gun violence.
No such thing as “gun violence”.  Guns don’t shoot people... people do.  A gun is a tool like a fork or shovel... or a phone!  #GetEducated
did you say fart therapy?
Does art therapy cure mass shooters?
No, but mass shootings will be labeled as morbid art.
You are a sweetheart you remind me of my aunt when I was young always made me feel positive 
Thank you Mrs Pence for all you do and  we appreciate you sharing your husband with our country as our VP.   It’s wonderful having both of you bring your love for God,  true Christian values and  real Hope back to our nation.  May God continue to Bless you and VP Pence.
That was fantastic God bless you 

Something is crazy. Most Presidents get some on the side...it's news for years. People totally flip out. Meanwhile others mutilate their crotch & are called heroes. Many are bangin each other in the stinker & if you talk about YOU ARE THE WEIRDO..! Shootin kids, rape...HELP....
Wow Michael
 I think you really need to address that quirk. Just a thought.
Karen - you’re always badly dressed. Can you get tips from Melania? And do something about your hair 
You should’ve put a few pictures of you Sandra ??   Do you look as nice as she does ???
Unfortunately you cannot even explain how you are inspired. The only thing you can speak out 2 is an inspiration of old school ignorance. That's not inspiration.  that's old school dumb ass 101
How many women allow themselves to be ruled by ignorance while dismissing reverence?
Criminals, all of you.
Did you ask the teacher if they had a pistol?
Mading is leek see cont keep legsshot
GREAT SPEECHES TODAY AT CPAC!!

Art Therapy works.
Conversion Therapy is abuse.
Please inform your husband there is a difference.

My opponent is involved with Russian banker Torshin and Russian gun rights activist Butina. They are helping to funnel dark money through the NRA. Any comment or condolence from @RepRohrabacher would be a charade. #CA48 

…
Stormy
Are any of them shooting victims?  I bet they would prefer common sense gun laws that would have prevented their shooting.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @VP @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP   Beware of #TrumpDistractions.  Trump wants to bring back #PreExistingConditions. #HealthInsurance #ACA #Obamacare #Disability #Women #Veterans #Seniors #Children #CallCongress2022243121
That’s nice, Mother.
Are you trying to upstage OUR First Lady?????
That's a very low bar.
Karen, you look wonderful...whatever you are doing it is working for you...
@Jerrypool24 Are you making some kind of stupid joke; too much time on your hands
In the 1990s we banned assault weapons and we saw a great decline in mass shootings.  In the early 2000s the NRA helped fund politicians in order to lift this ban, and we saw an increase in mass shootings.  Great People don't do that!
GOD bless you!!!

You’re a great Second Lady. And I’m a liberal. ;)
