Is it true your husband us having gay sex with Sean Hannity? Asking for a friend.
As always, thank you for your support of art therapy. Their clients need affordable insurance, therapists need standardized licensing and affordable schooling. And institutions need to provide reasonable space and support for the work. It can all be done.
Hi Second Lady Pence I have looked at your tweets and see you don’t say much about the opioid epidemic but my family needs some help. My son is in jail due to addiction and has been denied for drug court 3 times but he meets all criteria. Slade Windsor needs rehab not prison..
Is art therapy bullet proof?

Awesome @SecondLady .
Awesome.
Yes Ma Miss Pence Good Job Don
Interesting videos about Art Therapy. I think I have a book I never read about it and should. I can imagine it can help some in several ways, but the Arts have so many facets, from ARCHITECTURE, CULINARY, FASHION, DANCE, MUSIC, SCULPTURE, POTTERY, PAINTING, FLORIST to JEWELRY ETC
I realize there is a difference between learning art to pursue a career and art therapy. Seems troubled minds full of pressure need an outlet to relax, release and let that creative energy flow, like we did as children.
We were so honored to have you visit today.
Thanks for sharing this lovely and heart-felt video.
Thanks for Sharing ,I Love Your Kind Hearted Positive Tweets ,Peace and Blessings to You .
Art therapy isn’t interesting to me. Educators are always trying to push it for my autistic son, 15, like it’s magic.  He hates it and it does nothing but get him messy and make the staff feel good.
Thank you. You are always welcome to come to Texas.
My iPad is a great artistic tool for art and creativity and I use it to criticize you and your treasonous husband (Manafort ring bells?) and treasonous Trump.
