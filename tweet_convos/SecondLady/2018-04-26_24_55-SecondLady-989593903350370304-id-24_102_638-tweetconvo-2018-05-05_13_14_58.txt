As always, thank you for your support of art therapy. Please understand the clients need affordable health insurance and the therapists need affordable education and standardized licensing across states.

Now if we could only get the arts back into our schools so that all children could learn that art is a really fun hobby and a natural art therapy that makes them better, more rounded, and happier adults. Make it happen @secondlady.
It's good to have a religious background I believe in Christianity I believe in God and Jesus his teachings I tried my best to abide by that even though everybody's conflicted with the balance of Good and Evil it's Universal the light outshines the darkness
