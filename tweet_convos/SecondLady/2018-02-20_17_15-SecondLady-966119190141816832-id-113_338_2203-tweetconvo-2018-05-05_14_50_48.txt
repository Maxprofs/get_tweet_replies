Not if he continues to erode #2A. #ShallNotBeInfringed by anyone even @realDonaldTrump
I don’t think banning BumpStocks is so bad, do you That tool sounds like having a sawed off shotgun sounds like it’s an unnecessary tool for anything, right
The gun owners of America r standup people who do not break laws. Why r we the losers? So why more laws that restrict the bulk of the population? Criminals dont care about laws thats why their criminals. Restricting our ability to have these will not prevent these tragedies.
I agree, banning guns or anything related to guns, won’t stop criminals from getting them, but don’t you think it helps @realDonaldTrump to show he is at least trying to stop the illegal gun tools No #Liberals ever did anythingright
Lets say we do this & give a little. What happens when some people want to change something about #1A just a little tweak & then a little while later just a little tweak. #2A is the only right you have to wait til your of age and then you have to pay a fee to use. Whats next?
Love this
Correction: Art therapy is a separate profession that uses the visual arts.  Music therapy uses music.  Dance therapy uses movement.  Drama therapists uses theatrical techniques. These professions are all separate w. their own training&requirements.#artTherapy  #at4hr
I'm going to throw up.
That child looks totally disengaged. What you are pretending to do is NOT music therapy. Do you even know what music therapy is? It’s not shoving a drum in front of a child.
wholly agree! also Art Therapy and Music Therapy are 2 different modalities not the same thing.
I'm not being unkind I think your heart is in the right place but I certainly hope you are in a concrete bunker with all those kids. This country needs to rid ourselves of people with guns who should not have them and your husband should be behind that 100%
Karen, this is really what Mikey wants! #BlessHim
Maybe let’s buy schools more pencils, books, and art supplies and ease up on our outrageous military budget, then.
Well if your husband agrees with the President and goes along with his ideas, these therapies (art, occupational, physical and speech) will no longer be available to those who need them.  Nice going Pence and Trump...idiots.
Is there anyway you could draw your husband a conscience ?
I’m sure if we all pray hard enough, it will fund the art therapy that is cut from schools.
Now now it has to be thoughts and prayers don't forget that. Our poor kids no art classes no music classes no gym classes no freaking nothing. Just being shot at by a Madman who should not have had a gun. Vote these stinking Republicans out of office
the same ones that Donald and your husband and their GOP company are cutting funds to?
Hello
Ms Pence this blog is misleading and incorrect.  Art Therapy, music therapy, dance therapy, and drama therapy are all distinct professions.  Please do not confuse the public.  #arttherapy
#musictherapy #dancetherapy #dramatherapy #arttherapyfacts
Oh how I would love to see more of this!!!
but you won’t because they cut funding for it so there’s that....
Great idea Second Lady Karen! Art therapy has much to recommend it, so am happy to see you champion such a worthwhile endeavor. Thank you! 
Parents, keep a close eye on your kids.
As a Board Certified Music Therapist, this thrills me!
This bot is praising @SecondLady 
Protect your citizen form guns! never mind other countries. The world needs PEACE from the real terrorist U.S..  U.S needs stop looking for wars!! The U.S needs stop lying about North Korea just like North Vietnam. U.S needs to negotiate a PEACE treaty with N. Korea!
Were you all armed ready to shoot the bad guys down? #ArtTherapy ain't no good if you don't conceal-carry ma'am.
Great work!
GOP increasingly UPSET with POTUS AND VP SCANDALS!  Sexual predator and his misogynist side-kick!  Controversies pile up for White House, alarming GOP
You should add Hillay and Pelosi to your class
Hey Karen, here's some "music therapy" you should use on Mike. He doesn't take the 9th Commandment seriously. This may help him become more faithful.
Teaching them to play the gay away?
Karen. Such a charmind, smart women with a huge heart.
Music therapy also has been successful.
Very nice medicine for the soul.
Your beautiful  smile
@SecondLady 
Life's  getting better and better.
Go back to the country!!!

Fabulous, let us all create beautiful melodies.  Music feeds the soul.
The road is long..
You are very honorable. Stay true to yourself!
Good for you Karen!  You'll need therapy once #LyingPence is jailed with the rest of the #TrumpCrimeFamily!
we know you are hypocrites but at least do not perceive the rest of us as being stupid or inane as your duped Deplorables
Mother please let mike free. He has been wanting to come out of the closet. Set him free mother.
BEAUTIFUL 
Maybe you could get that poor little Baron Trump in your sessions.
Puke
Does Mike let you out of the house to do this, Mommy? With your slutty sleeveless dress like that? You need Jesus.
Great to see you both have done nothing to reign in Trump. You have failed The Constitution and let the American people down.
Thank you for reminding us about the truly important things in life.
When America is rising up against the crooked GOP, tweet about your wife's art therapy...now THAT'S what I call "leadership" (said no one, ever...)

@VP

Fuck you, Pence. You're an uneducated cheap suit, hiding behind a pseudo-religious facade, desperately hoping that no one finds out that…
Liquor, Guns, BBQ, Trucks
No Q, four letters is enough.
Mrs Vice President
I Wrote You When God Sent Your Husband To Where He Is Now
I Did Say Use Your Position For The Good Of Humanity&NEVER BE PARTY OF THE OLD GUARD BLOOD THIRSTY WAR MONGERS
Am Very Sad&Disappointed That Your Husband As A Governor Never Use D-WORD SANCTION WHY NOW?
Oh sweetheart, if only your husband wasn’t so amoral, I would get behind this...
You can't still support a person and their very good cause because you don't like their spouse? I find that baffling.
I don't support @FLOTUS cyber bullying either. Of all 4 central players, @SecondLady is by far the least fake one. She never liked Trump.
I like her, too, I'm just flummoxed why you feel you can't support her effort?
What's it like to be married to a professional liar?
02/20/2018....Trump aide, Sam Nunberg on @TheBeatWithAri "I am going to be questioned by Mueller's team. I can tell your viewers that @VP Pence and @KellyannePolls lied to America about Russia."
#TrumpRussia
Serious question. Are you high? 

There is more going on than art therapy. How about speak out about Parkland?
Tell your husband to stop harassing Indiana’s poor people who are on Medicaid.
Trump's proposed 2018 budget cuts to NIH, CDC, FDA, HHS backlash - Business Insider
But I'm sure your art therapy will make up for it. SMH.
Mother. Did you know about Mike’s “therapy?
You KNOW you are on the right  track, when you are torn apart by the bulls of bashan!
Fund school resources!
LAWYER UP MIKE. YOULL NEED Therapy in jail!
Slot of kids will need this because of the gop being afraid of NRA so many kids with PTSD from just going to school give NRA money back
Has the #NRA approved this post?

Too happy just days after their friends got slaughtered. Thoughts?
Yeah, They look real traumatized for losing their friend just days prior. And I’m sick? 

Yeah no.
Kudos! I participated in a program at Green Oaks: Medical City where we colored. I thought it was silly at first but as I got into it I found it to be very therapeutic. Kutgw!
I color when flying, works for me
This is who your husband takes orders from.
Your husband.
%AWESOME!!!!!!!!%
