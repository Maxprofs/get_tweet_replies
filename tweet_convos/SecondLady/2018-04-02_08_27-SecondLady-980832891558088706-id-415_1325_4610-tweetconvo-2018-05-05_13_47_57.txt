Mr. President you MUST award Anthony Borges the Medal of Valor for taking multiple bullets while shielding fellow students during the mass shooting in Parkland Fla.

Please proclaim it Autism Spectrum Condition :)
@POTUS Please address the autism epidemic.  Adult autistics need LOVING lifelong support systems!  #USA1in36AUTISM #VAXXED #CDCwhistleblower #speakingtruthtopower
I thought I read recently average life expectancy of those with autism was age 36
I am counting my blessings for my son, he is not mute and has never had seizures. My heart goes out to parents with severely autistic children, we MUST always be their safety net when the parents pass on to their glorious eternity they so much deserve.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TRUMP PROCLAIMS IT!!!!!  April 2 is Autism Awareness Day EVERY YEAR! QUIT GIVING TRUMP CREDIT FOR THINGS HE DIDN'T DO!!!! HE ALREADY THINKS HES A FUCKING KING!

Thank You! My grandson Brodie has Autism. He is really intelligent when it comes to learning, just at his own pace. God Bless you all!
He couldn't tell you what Autism is.
Thank you Mr President
Bravo cheers outstanding good job

What about senile, demented potus, would this cover that?
You can tell it was totally DT’s idea because he spent all of April 2nd posting tweets that raise awareness and support for Americans with autism. He definitely didn’t spend a whole day taking jabs at the USPS and complaining because he hasn’t gotten his wall.
Toxic Heavy metals and Vaccines cause Autism 
Is he going to do his autistic person impersonation.
Whoa that's right there is a special spectrum for people like you

Have international scientists found autism's cause? Did a rising number of #vaccines containing the aluminum adjuvant trigger food allergies, #ADHD, learning disabilities, eczema, diabetes and an autoimmune epidemic, of which #autism is the most severe?

Dear .@POTUS, please meet with CDC scientist Dr. Bill Thompson & .@RobertKennedyJr about Thompson’s MMR vaccine fraud allegationsChildren are at risk for brain injuries, especially African American & Hispanic boys. Here’s Thompson’s confession:
My grand daughter is 22 and was diagnosed at the age of 3 with Autism and mental retardation. She cannot stay home due to being violent to herself as well as others. In WV there us nothing to help parents and children with this terrible condition. Praying for all with Autism.

Then be willing to put your money where your mouth is. Expand Medicaid for those who fall through the cracks and expand programs for those who are high functioning instead of cut cut cut.  Do instead of talk.
@KenCalvert April 2 has been World Autism Day every year since 2007 thanks to the U.N. Ken.

Did president spanky really convince you that he did it?
Yeah I’m sure you really care about these kids.
Do you think that we would believe you care we have seen how you treat those with disabilities
Does this mean you won't light it up blue this year for @autismspeaks? You hear us #actuallyautistic people? Cos we're shouting for years now -- can you hear us yet?
I was a Special Education teacher for 25yrs and we need better oversight of special ed funding, too much goes to ED/LD, family's and not enough to our truly challenged, autistic, azberger syndrome, mentally, Physically challenged students and families.

The spraying of our skies with aluminum, barium, and strontium, amongst other things (viruses, gene splicing enzymes) is NOT helping the autism problem.
Please tell the President that I have a great idea for Mexico to pay for the wall. Increase Tarrifs on Mexico to pay for the wall. Basically their people are coming over here without Mexican police trying to stop them. So increase the tarrifs to pay for the WALL. Great idea 
And I proclaim April as yet another month that trump is a moron.

Including his own son!
You could have went all day without being so evil.
Shouldn’t it be called Baron Trump Day?
So lets be sure to appoint a lady who wants to block them from attending public schools or getting an education.

It’s amazing to see the trumpkins thanking the president for something done 10 years ago.   How can people be so ignorant ?

We all know what @realDonaldTrump thinks of people who are different. #ShitholePresident
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse 
Thank you #POTUS! 
Grandson, and so many Americans with autism! Greatly appreciated! God bless America!
Trump hates disabled people, like the reporter he once made fun of. Why lie and pretend otherwise?
And the other times?  He made the same gestures with non disabled people?...
Proof? I’ve never seen him make that gesture any other time.
Ill make you something special.  Just give me time lol
You mean, this president Trump?

World Autism Awareness Day", passed in council on 1 November 2007, and adopted on 18 December 2007.
It would be a better and bigger gesture if he just admits his youngest son is autistic #WorldAutismAwarenessDay @realDonaldTrump
@JustinTrudeau if trade decreases with United States why not increase trade with    Cuba I am sure they would be a willing partner and the people need assistance with goods and services
Thank you president Trump
HAPPY Easter Mr.45 it's sad to  your 5 grand kids without a fix guardian why don't you overturn this divorce by mediation or by cutting a deal some how to fix it Those broken parents to be that's really hurt please it not to late

Important day for my family and friends families that are impacted by this medical issue.
Thank you I have an amazing son with autism...
Thank you @POTUS
It was already proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly resolution "62/139. World Autism Awareness Day", passed in council on 1 November 2007, and adopted on 18 December 2007.” #PresidentStableGenius #Trump
Mr. President. @realDonaldTrump. Autism Awareness Day use you pin with and executive order taking marijuana off schedule 1 this and every parent with autism nose that marijuana helps so do the children of favor give them access to medical marijuana remove schedule 1 drug list
You mocked a disabled reporter in 2016
Are you planning to #LightItUpBlue tonight?
I hope and pray that soon, these people discover healing. Those who are caregivers, guardians,parents need all the support possible. Peace, love and strength to them all.
My son and my granddaughter are autistic. They are both GREAT people, just see things differently.
If you support autism awareness and acceptance please subscribe and share to this awesome kid!
Thank you!!!
If PUTIN comes to Washington....#TheResistance will RISE UP and march!
No chance! not until you recognize epilepsy awareness also.
Thank you, Mr. President, @realDonaldTrump, this means a lot to my husband Steve and me. Our older son, @JedediahBartley is on the Autistic Spectrum, with Asperger's Syndrome.
Thank you President Trump for recognizing Autism Spectrum Disorder.  My great grandson, Ledger Don Jarvis was diagnosed and with therapy, has seen great improvement.
Autism can b amazing if one knows how to unlock tha autistic mind , takes lots of love , patience and endurance It Can b done,  I know for a fact . 
 TRUMP NATION DOMINATION  MAGA  FEARLESS ONE  KEEP AMERICA GREAT 2020+++ 
He didn’t make it autism awareness day it’s been April 2 for years! Nothing new here!
It’s just like Little Donnie Trumpster to try to take credit for something someone else did. In this case, the UN in 2007.
Really?  Announcing something to bring awareness?  I guess you neverT's see things in your sad minds they way you want.  Pretty pathetic.
Why didn't you post this on facebook as well today?  Last year you lit the W.H. blue.
The UN actually established it in 2007 but go off i guess

When is Chronic Pain awareness day? For chronic pain patients it's everyday. And something your body won't let you not be aware of. Not trying to take away from those who suffer from autism. But only chronic pain and mentally ill get demonized all the time. And now by your office
Ok, Trump gets points from me for that.
Too bad he doesn't have awareness for anything but himself.  And Ken Calvert, yo follower, grow a pair.  Or get a vagina, lots stronger.
Don't forget that those autistic persons may also have chronic pain. Why are you raising awareness for one group with health issues through no fault of their own, While demonizing pain patients with health issues also through no fault of their own. I find this beyond hypocrisy.
Your hilarious.
thanks, I used to be normal. But after being hit by a drunk driver and having many discs crushed, 10 surgeries, lots of pain and little function I don't handle Political Dr's or mandated suffering because of drugs that are already illegal. I know it's funny.
Thank you for perclaiming this day as World Autism AwarenessDay, my husband was poisoned at Camp LeJeune, one of thousands of Marines, civilians, men women and children, who died, no justice for my son's Dad, Camp LeJeune, victims are dying everyday, wrongful death no justice
It would surprise me if he even knows what autism is...
Good try. You didn't proclaim anything, you Nazi clementine.
The appropriate authority to address the world  is  the UNo. However Mr Donald  Trump can reiterate in the USA.
THE ANGELS SING FOR YOU♔ ON HIGH

This proves he's a Russian spy


Our son was diagnosed with ASD in September. Blessings come in all different forms, shapes, and sizes. #GodIsGood #AutismDay2018 #ASD #WorldAutismAwarenessDay #EasterMonday
Meanwhile I'm a parent who can't work due to caring for my daughter with autism and every day I hear that he's threatening her SSI, our Medicaid, our food stamps, our housing, etc. that we currently rely on.
Go get a job and become self reliant. You will feel a whole lot better about yourself in the end. Instead of looking for free hand out looking for pritty.

LOL, moron.
The UN did this before you could. Don't take credit for others' accomplishments!
Grow up, Monique.
Please be sure to #protectMedicaid to support people with #autism and their families
Why is he going to throw them out of the country too!

Thank you @realDonaldTrump !!!
It was designated by the United Nations General Assembly resolution "62/139. World Autism Awareness Day", passed in council on 1 November 2007, and adopted on 18 December 2007. Nice try Trump. Maybe you could claim that Mother's Day was your idea.
You don't know how these things work, do you?
Guess not...
Hopefully he'll declare a Trump Derangement Syndrome Day in her honour
I remember when I put myself in my arms for the first time, those big eyes with impossible eyelashes, and that I thought that I could never part from him again. That's how I met the person who taught me so much
#WorldAutismAwarenessDay
(For @ladycrocs) There are many memories that remain in the retinas, most coincide with those we all have of our children, those little gems capable of bringing out the best and the worst of ourselves.
Then there are other memories that, in retrospect, you realize were transcendental: like that afternoon in your room when you were 18 months old when you are indicating with your finger to take a ball. And do not look at the finger. Not the ball.
That sunny morning in which he takes you by the hand and, without saying anything, takes you to the kitchen, makes you pick him up, takes your hand again and tells you to give him a glass
Remember those tedious, endless moments, in which your little one is in the park with a thousand toys and dozens of children, but only entertains him spinning the wheel of a baby cart
It comes to your head that day when the teacher tells you that your son does not attend to orders and, delusional about you, you tell him that you ask him for things please, without really understanding where the problem was
One day you realize that you can already dry your hair indoors, or put the vacuum cleaner and use the blender. Things you had not done for three years to avoid causing terror in him.
Remember when you read that paper. Paper. With a line that says: Diagnosis: autistic spectrum disorder.
By cutting protections and funding?
How can he make fun of people with disabilities then?
I don’t believe anyone is making fun of anyone except of course your prez
#too little to late. Don’t use autistic kids as a distraction to your treasonous, hypocritical, intolerable acts you do to hurt the people of America every day. Shame on you Donny. Poor upbringing!
Thank you. 
I mean, he also believes that vaccines cause autism and is supporting an organization that makes money off of making us look like burdens, but that's none of my business.
Common WH Communications Office; Spanky doesn’t know what Autism is. You shoved a folder a d a pen in front of him and he signed it.  Bet he held the folder up to say “See? I CAN sign my own name!!!”   to follow

Destroy Big Pharma!
So  is now blaming his behavior on autism?  smh
Has Dolt Trump been tested for autism himself? @realDonaldTrump the world would be more likely to accept a reason for his idiocy, rather than him just being an imbecile...
Nice - but we should proclaim an ADHS-day: so Mr. #NotAPresident can celebrate this day, too!

Oh, sorry: I shouldn‘t lump people with ADHS in the same pot like the old, senile man ( @realDonaldTrump ) - blame on me...
#WorldAutismAwarenessDay Why aren't we talking about finding the cause of autism?!? #Truth
You do know that today was already Autism Awareness Day way before you entered office. Get rid of DeVos and step down as both of you continue to cut support and educational funding for students with disabilities. #ImpeachTrump #TheResistence #AutismAwarenessDay
Can you read?  Lol.  No one said he declared it.  Just announcing it to bring up awareness.  Your sad hate filled heart.  Pretty pathetic.
It said that he proclaimed something that already was. Please learn to read and learn the definitions of words. Proclaim means to declare something. Your blind faith in a racist and bigot is what's wrong.


As you continue to destroy public education
Thank you for recognizing autism.
He didn't do it, Obama did
And yet he makes fun of neurodivergent and disabled people.

Trump actually didn't come up with this, at all but nice try.
We need tostigmatizing parents that have severely autistic children. Look at #Newtown & #Parkland2 autistic men that aged out of the system! We need to reopen state mental institutions, since we no longer experiment on them, &/or offer adult daycare! #WorldAutismAwarenessDay
Are we going to try for infrastructure week again? Those weeks always go well.
That’s great the market is crashing and you say nothing? Please be a leader
