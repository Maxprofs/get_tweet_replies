You're a sell out. You sold out our children, and I'm sure you sold your own soul. Satan will come to claim one day, Senator
Reagan is rolling over in his grave watching this shitshow that is now the GOP.
Thanks for choosing the children. @BetsyDeVos is a champion of children and choice!
i am also #prochoice
of course you are, nasty woman. But does your 'pro-choice' embrace parental EDUCATION CHOICE?
haha!  Not taxpayer funded. Go ahead and bankroll a private education if you want. :)
'Pro-choice:' Free to choose what education MY taxpayer $$ provide for my child.
actually, we don't get to pick a la carte how our tax money gets spent.
You've shown Georgians that you don't care about our children and are only representing R party. Please resign.

how much money did Betsy DeVos give you again? Do you dare say the number?
Reagan is rolling over in his grave at this monstrosity of an administration. For shame.
Reagan would have been so disappointed in today's GOP
too bad he's not still in the White House.
#Shame on you. @BetsyDeVos is decidedly unfit & unqualified to head the @usedgov
if there is nothing in common the circles should have no overlap.
Considering the delusions in DC these days it was thought necessary to explicitly show NOTHING
but its wrong. two sets with no overlap = two seperate circles
http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/z8nfrdm/revision/2 …
I mean normally, I'd let it slide.  But this is literally a protest about education.
Reagan sucks, also #VoteNoDevos
@ajconwashington The 7 countries in Trump Muslim BAN were chosen to warn US not to TRAVEL to them not to block ppl. #gapol
Reagan signed MLK day into law. David Perdue can't even support Coretta Scott King's words. #gapol
#dumpdevos - selling your soul to the devil for a measley campaign contribution? Your kids must be proud to call you dad
When will YOU hold constituent town halls in the metro #Atl area?!! Looking forward to it!! Lots of questions for u! #gapol
Reagan would be appalled at what you & colleagues have done to GOP. Not standing up to Pres PRAISING a muderer Putin.
Our current President, Steve Bannon, makes me long for the days of Reagan and I hated him.
What would Reagan think about the drastic departure of common decency in the Republican party? #notmysenator
Thank God for Democrats in the Senate who worry about our children -- and no thanks to you, David Perdue. Prove me wrong.
Vote No to Betsy DeVos
.@sendavidperdue Wonder if his Alzheimer's was causd by pollution http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-air-pollution-alzheimers-20170131-story.html … #voteNOonPruitt #cleanair #cleanwater #environment
You are in the pocket of the DaVos's. Feel good?
Hypocrite -- Reagan went to public school, something your vote today will help to end. You voted AGAIN for your fascist hero
I live in Gwinnett Co & support quality public schools. This is why I urge you to Vote No on DeVos! #OpposeDeVos!
Even Reagan would have opposed #BetsyDeVos. She is unqualified & I urge you to Vote No on her nomination! #OpposeDeVos
vote no. Don't sell out Georgia like you want to.
then honor him by doing the right thing. He would have seen DeVos was incompetent. Stand up & show Regan's courage
23,400 dollars from the Devos family SAD
don't sale your vote. Do what's right for children..don't confirm Devos
Mr Perdue you should be ashamed of your confirmation of Devos. You will not receive my vote agian
President Reagan, despite his faults, wouldn't have allowed someone as blatantly unqualified as #BetsyDeVos into the Cabinet
How much did he sell cabinet posts for? @ajc
I bet #RonaldReagan is rolling over in his grave today.
Can you please vote no on DeVos.  If schools need to fix something, let's fix it, we don't want charter, private, schools
Voting for Betsy DeVos is *deplorable*! #VoteNoDevos #NoonDeVos
David, do you do the same gesture to our own great President Carter on his birthday?
Listen to the people you represent and vote NO on DeVos!
Catch Trump O'riley interview before the game?Bill asked re game Trump NEVER mention GA or Atlanta, or Falcons..He's vile
shame, shame shame!  #holdthefloor
Hih? Yet not a peep out of you when Trump attacks America and sides w Putin against us? We need you. Vote no #BetseyDeVos
My dad was a Reagan republican and he would be shocked at the possibility of Devos, and all the GOP nonsense of today
If you vote in Devos after taking over $24000 from her, KNOWING she is unqualified,it will be clear that you sold your vote.
How much money did you accept from the DeVos family again? $23,00? You should still vote no b/c she's unqualified.
That whirring sound you're hearing is Reagan doing 10,000 RPM in his grave.
What's your price, Senator? DeVos gave a lot more than $23,400 to other senators...you're a cheap date.
if you are truly a Christian, you will vote #noDevos
Please vote NO on DeVos. She has no experience in education and is unqualified for this position.
very ineffective in support of loser DeVos. Totally bought and crooked. You should be ashamed of yourself. Sad
Our children need better than DeVos. Do not be scared to vote your conscience. Voters will remember
.@sendavidperdue How about you #VoteNoDevos and do the right thing 4 your constituents who are against this unqualified nominee? #DumpDevos
he would not even recognize your party now. You crap all over our nation and it's history/values in his name. Shame!!
Congrats sir, then I'm sure you're familiar with Reagan's views on education? As in never politicize it, top priority.
are you doing anything today he'd be remotely approving of?
And, most importantly, "And freedom is special & rare. It's fragile; it needs protection." -- Pres. Reagan 1/11/1989
(2/2) "...freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise." 1/11/1989 Pres. Reagan farewell address.
Please remember Pres. Regan's quotes: "We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom.... (1/2)
vote no one Devos. Will she ask for her $$ back? Did she buy your vote?
let's! Schedule a town hall meeting in Metro Atlanta
President Reagan would be ashamed of the GOP right now.  Vote NO on DeVos.
This is such a strange image coming from someone in the pro-Putin party. He's rolling in his grave. Congrats.
. Reagan would be ashamed of the GOP of today.
...DeVos 
$23,400!  From devos!  You are cheap, yo!  What can I get for $500?
vote against incompetent Betsy Devos, u have  job , this is common sense.
Your hero Ronnie Reagan went to public school, like many children from poor homes. No DeVos then to stop him.
GA children need public schools, or GOP needs to fund private schools for them. Vote NO on DeVos!
Instead of talking about Reagan, please tell how you're going to protect public education and the children. #DumpDevos
AMERICAN CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER!! #DumpDevos
or you could be listening to people that actually care about purchasing kids. #StopDeVos
Something tells me he wouldn't care for your enabling a fascist to lead your party, Senator.
calm down your boner; he's still dead
1. Vote no on unqualified, pay-for-play DeVos 2. Reagan would have repudiated Trump; you should too.
I haven't voted for a Republican in 20 years. Happily realized today that I can cross party line and primary you in 2020.
DeVos is not qualified and you.know it. Do the right thing.
don't confirm DeVos she is clearly unqualified. Show us you can't be bought! Protect our public schools!
Reagan would not be silent if a White Nationalist-Bannon replaced Military n Intelligence on NSC. SHAME ON YOU.
vote with your brain not your wallet ? No to Devos!
#DumpDevos
MT A sobering look at what Betsy DeVos did to education in Michigan - and what she might do  http://wpo.st/4So_2 
Do the right thing. Vote No on DeVos nomination. Place our nation's interests over party interests.
I have a whole lot of friends in GA that can primary you next election. Vote no on Devos.
Reagan would never have voted in favor of DeVos you shouldn't either #noDevos
judging from the way you avoid your constituent s I donor think your worthy. voteThemOut
sure would be nice if you'd stop voting based on who gave you thousands of $$$. #DumpDevos #NoonDeVos
#DumpDevos  listen to your voters!!! #NotoDeVos
Please vote NO to Betsy DeVos as Sec of Ed. She's not qualified no matter how much $$ she gave you. #noDevos

You will forever be remembered as a pawn in her pay to play scheme.
SHAME
SHAME
SHAME
Reagan is rolling over in his grave at what the GOP has become, supporting @realDonaldTrump as he compares us to KGB Putin.
Reagan would be ashamed of you. You accepted $ from DeVos & will gladly vote for the most horrific Ed nominee in history.
Focus on something important #VoteNoDevos #votenoondevos
VOTE AGAINST #DEVOS; I don't expect it b/c her family gave u about $25,000 in campaign contributions #Votes4Sale #DeVosvote
Please vote #NoDevos.  She is not right for our children.
#DumpDevos
That was back when the Rep party wasn't so hateful and totally bought.  How much did the Devos' give you???
don't confirm Devos
Hey, if 23,401 of us send you $1, would that buy back your interest in doing the right thing? #DumpDeVos #noIDEA
.@sendavidperdue Is the $23,400 Betsy DeVos gave to your campaign more important than your constituents? They WILL vote you out in #2018.
Except for the fact that his re-election won't be until 2020.
you are . Do your duty #DumpDevos  #BoughtAndPaidFor .
um... how about paying attention to the senate instead of having wet dreams about Regan?
with devos donations to you, and the well articulated concerns about lack of quailifcations, do the right thing and vote no
President Reagan wants you to vote #NoDeVos Listen to your constituents. Be a leader not a partisan hack.
vote NO to Devos!
Why are you not listening to your own state's citizens? WE ASKED YOU TO BLOCK DEVOS. Remember her? The one who paid you?
Reagan let Jesus take over your party. Look at the history of the Republicans.
It's not too late to grow a conscience and vote NO on DeVos.
no on DeVos
in a hearing regarding DeVos, someone who could influence our children, and you tweet this? People watching- #noreelection?
partisan hack?
keep the 23k but vote NO #DeVos
President Reagan would want you to #VoteNoDevos
you're a cowardly nudnik. Seriously, stop pretending like anything you do matters.
#please take a stand for our children..I am especially concerned for our disabled children.. #VoteNo #DeVoss
DeVos is unqualified. Did you sell your ethics for $23,000? Our kids deserve better. @GOP should be ashamed of themselves.
Vote NO on @BetsyDeVos #BlessYourBoughtHeart
This how ya'll do it in Georgia? Skim off the top & throw the kids to the wolves. DeVos will be the most unqualified
#DumpDeVos so our kids can have a real education.  Or is $23,400 your price to betray the USA?
What can I get for $25K?
David what did you do with the $23,000 Betsy DeVos paid you for your vote? Vacation, down payment on a house? Just tell us
your family took $23k from DeVos. VOTE NO TO HER.
DeVos is grossly unqualified.
You will pay for selling out our kids
I don't think Reagan would be impressed that you're voting on a nominee (DeVos) that give you lots of money.
was that $23,400 from the DeVos family a birthday gift? Or were they just buying you?
please listen to your constituents - vote No on: Devos Price Pruitt Perry Session Bannon
DeVoss bought your vote. You are a sheep.
Reagan would be ashamed of your support for Devos - pay for play bs
you should throw a birthday party with all of  that money you accepted from the spectacularly unqualified #BetsyDeVos
we know you got that DeVod $$$ but she has no experience and this is about the children
So, is $23.4k the going rate for a Senator these days? Asking for a friend.
Since you accepted over 23k from DeVos, I'm assuming you'll either recuse yourself of vote no.
Hey, Senator, other senators got a lot more $$ from #DeVos; you should have held out for more. Your vote isn't worth as much
really??? Reagan is rolling in his grave at the LACK OF INTEGRITY of the GOP.  VOTE NO ON DEVOS!!!!
REALLY? …http://When.Are.You.Hosting.A.Town.Hall.In.Metro.Atlanta.That.You .Will.Peronsally.Attend? Your constituents have #MuchToDiscuss w/ you.
don't vote for DeVos. History will remember this
#shame #dumpdevos
Please vote NO on DeVos. She's not qualified for the job.
Protect the children of your constituents. Vote NO on DeVos. #DumpDevos
Were he still alive, Ronald Reagan would die of shame over what your GOP has become. You discredit his memory.
President Reagan was the 1st president I ever voted for. Trust me, he's rolling over in his grave at Republican shenanigans!
No on Devos, unqualified
pathetic
you and @SenatorIsakson need to listen to your constituents and VOTE NO ON DEVOS
What would Reagan say abt @realDonaldTrump comparing thug Putin to USA?
So DeVos bought your vote for $23,500. Was that for ur character, integrity, morals or was it a package deal?
think about what Reagan would of said about our own President siding with Putin. Please put a stop to this disaster!
He was a bad actor and a puppet just like Trump. No one respects Reagan except nutjobs like u!
Will you #DumpDevos or should we assume you'd sell out the kids of this country for your job?
Reagan would not approve of Trump. Vote no on DeVos!
No, seriously, 23 grand?  That's IT?  Dang, Senator. That won't even buy the ENTRY-LEVEL Mercedes.
Please pay attention to what your D peers (and 2 R's) are saying about DeVos.  Vote NO and ask Trump for a better nom,
Vote NO on DeVos. And take Ronald Reagan's name out of your mouth if you're going to continue to blindly support Trump.
How about some integrity? (oh you sold it for some payoffs from DeVos...oops) #DumpDevos
you're pathetic and DeVos is an insult to us all. Shame on you. RESIGN
$23K from Betsy DeVos.
I'm celebrating the $23,400 you got from the DeVos family. That kind of money buys a lot of loyalty!
#noDevos
Focus on the matter at hand: #DumpDeVos
did DeVos buy your vote? She is spectacularly unqualified.
Pay attention.  Reagan is dead.  STOP DEVOS.
#StopDeVos
GOP beatifies RR but he would not recognize the spineless kleptcrats claiming to act per his legacy.
Reagan was not a fan of Putin's KGB.
If you give a shit about Reagan or his Conservatism. you'd stand up like @ananavarro @TheRickWilson @Evan_McMullin
shame.
do your job. Vote no on DeVos.
is $23.4k gonna be enough for you to F over all the kids of America? What's that breakdown to per kid? Don't be a sellout.
GoodBye Cruel World !!!
We all know DeVos gave you money. So you are putting money before your constituents!  #dotherightthing Come out of the swamp
recuse yourself from the Betsy Devos vote. Having received over $20k from her, u cannot be objective. I have a Vote
I wish you listened to my phone call
How much DeVos money did it take to buy your silence?
RR raised taxes, grew the size of government and sold weapons to Iran. Totally makes sense that you'd celebrate his life
don't forget sponsored the wars in central america and we can see how that turned! children are still dying
You know DeVos gave @SenThomTillis 50K more dollars than you. You need to learn to hold out if you're going to be corrupt.
Reagan was a politician who had enough balls to stand up to his own party when it was the right thing to do. #NoDeVos
You took $23,400 from DeVos family
Reagan would be ashamed of your party now.
#DumpDevos
Good luck with the vetting process next week. #MAGA
I wish he'd never been born. #gabagool
vote NO on DeVos
