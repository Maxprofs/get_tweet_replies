Hypocrite you can't be prolife & antiimmigrant #bantheban Stand up.
.@sendavidperdue If "protecting life" is one of your priorities, as a constituent, I expect you to speak out AGAINST the #MuslimBan.
If you do not, I will understand your silence as support of the #MuslimBan & know that only American fetuses matter to you.
They aren't protesting to protect anything but the @GOP. http://news.gsu.edu/2016/05/03/more-than-3300-youth-are-homeless-in-atlanta-area-project-by-georgia-state-and-partners-finds/ â€¦
What are you doing to help preserve life in light of the massive damages caused by oil pipelines?
your response to #MuslimBan is appalling. Good first steps? You want more?

It appears to the nation and the world that only some lives matter.  #MuslimBan #NoBanNoWall #StopTrump
The best way to reduce abortions is to support women's access to health care and contraception. #PlannedParenthood
agreed!! And real sex education in schools, not abstinence only.
What good is your moral obligation if your protection stops at birth? You oppose healthcare 4 needy mothers,children. Shame!
protecting life?! You, sir, care only about restricting women - not life.  Your voting record proves that.
you are a confused chicken farmer indeed. legislating what a woman can do with her vagina is UNCONSTITUTIONAL...duh
I'm a Georgia voter & I stand with Planned Parenthood. Over 3 million of us marched! #WomensMarchOnWashington #HearOurVoice

It is BAFFLING to me that you support people marching for a clump of cells and not a refugee child living in terror. #shame
I hope you will be equally zealous about women being allowed to choose what happens to our bodies.
WHOSE LIFE? What about #BlackLivesMatter?
what about the lives of those who flee a country where they are persecuted? They're already here. Fight for their lives
Protecting life, just not this life #refugeesarewelcomehere https://goo.gl/images/kZzslf 
#MarchForLife?  So much hypocrisy.  Once the babies are born, it's "you're on your own now kiddo, good luck".
If you are in favor of protecting life do not destroy our healthcare and public education. No on Devos and save ACA!
Your hypocrisy is showing again. You want to strip the weak & vulnerable of critical services but you think you're pro-life?
Protecting life includes feeding, healing, and educating children post-birth.
vote no on Devos. And Jeff Sessions.  Voters will remember your choices and who you support while in congress.

and how much attention did you give to the women's right march? #reasonstoprotest
how about the many thousands requesting a town hall meeting? Do you only listen to some of your constituents
Protect all human life & support @SenFeinstein's bill to repeal the Muslim Ban. Love the sojourners.
keep up the good work in Georgia.
Will you please meet with your constituents who want to protect life and are concerned about ACA appeal and PP defunding?
If you believe in the sanctity of life why are you taking their healthcare?
If you were pro- life you would not defund PP or take away the ACA that provided maternal services & baby checks. Hypocrite!
you're not pro-life; You're pro-birth. Once out of the womb, unless they're born rich, republicans couldn't care less.
when you get pregnant, I fully support yr choice to birth a beautiful child! Cherish life! And respect other's life choices.
When will you be meeting with your pro-choice/pro-abortion constituents? Or do we not count?
You are not pro-Life. You are pro-birth. You do not care if that child is fed, educated, or has healthcare.
Thousands more of we constituents marched to protect lives & health of mothers *and* children. Change or lose our next vote.
pls vote no to DeVos.
Having a baby shouldn't be a punishment for having sex. Limiting birth control by defunding PP = exactly that. 

#WhyIMarch
Moral obligation to protect the unborn? But no moral obligation to protect them during mother's pregnancy and after birth?
"Every child is a blessing." So you're against Betsy DeVos, privatizing public schools, leaving IDEA up to states, etc.
Okey-dokey, then. "Every child is a blessing." So you'll be voting to *keep* the ACA (and/or expand Medicaid)?
Not life protection, only fetus protection. Once born, you and other pro-lifers don't care anymore. 

#WhyIMarch
you mean #marchforbirth ? Because where is your voice against the death penalty or want to increase Medicare? #WhyWeMarch
Food, shelter, healthcare, & civil rights protect life. Legal abortion protects women from illegal abortions.
We marched to protect all lives! Stop the war on women! #WhyWeMarch
A bit contradictory since you seem to be against access for women's healthcare and repealing the #ACA. #hypocracy
3/Oh, and let's not forget healthcare for them as well (which you do not want to provide). #MarchForLife #WhyWeMarch
2/and educate the actual children who are born to parents who don't want or can't afford them. Shame on you. #WhyWeMarch
1/You're pro-birth, not pro-life. If you were pro-life, you would support the programs required to feed, house, clothe,
where is your public statement about the #womensmarch? Do you care about the testament of 60k+ Georgians? #istandwithPP
if you were truly interested in protecting life, you wouldn't repeal the ACA or defund Planned Parenthood. #MarchofLies
you are pro-birth: you want a life born, but not fed, educated, or healthy. You are bringing shame to the state.
you have no desire to protect lives by defunding @PPact & the ACA or banning refugees. Please, keep ur religion out of govt
You're not protecting life. You just want to kill women by taking away their healthcare. #supportPlannedParenthood
You just want to kill women. Illegal abortion kills. Support accessible contraception, healthcare & education instead.
Poor families have less access to quality healthcare = Higher infant mortality. 

#prochoice
#WhyIMarch
Very low turnout for a very unpopular platform.  MAJORITY SUPPORTS PLANNED @PPact Preserve our right to choose.
Tell the truth. There was hardly ANYONE  there.  Majority NOT IN FAVOR of anti-abortion laws. We Support Choice.
