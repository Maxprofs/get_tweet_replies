We are aware of how this #LightItUpBlue is just another PR stunt to make this all about #DonTheCon and not the actual people autism affects.
@chattycathy317 @erikforCO @WhiteHouse @POTUS @FLOTUS I doubt he would have any issue if Hitlery was the one in the house
where you go Eric. Running your punk mouth till called out
Eric Eric Eric. This won't look good on your resume.
as is the case with the insane. No sense is made
And at the same time @realDonaldTrump is cutting the funding from programs that support people with autism, really classy...
@chattycathy317 @MacFinn44 @WhiteHouse @POTUS @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump some poeple can help but show their stupidity
Talking about yourself?
reference Eric and now you too. Your in.
.@realDonaldTrump mocked a disabled reporter, Melania has done jack 2 "combat bullying", his HC plan robbed ppl w/autism of vital care. 
@chattycathy317 @PoliticsWithG @WhiteHouse @POTUS @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump yes they lie. They repeat lies they hear. Idiots
Thank you @Potus and @Flotus! Lets put an end to autism!
@realDonaldTrump cut funding from med research progs, progs that support people with autism, etc. is that how he'll "put an end to autism"??
Do you know and understand the concept of streamlining to make things less costly and more efficient to give the money to the proper venues?
"proper venues"? Like the wall? Big tax cuts for the billionaires?
In a word,  yes!  Both grow economy, helps our safety, makes people coming here abide by the rules.
It is so sad that the GOP and Trump have fooled so many people into thinking making the rich richer will somehow help the little guy
Check your basic economics class..when they get a break, we all do. Which keeps GNP wheels going. We can't all have the same income.
"Trickle down economy" Bush gave huge tax breaks to the billionaires and it didn't work
@Flotus Why is White House same color as Trump's tiny balls? #Worstpresidentever #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Thank You Mr. President, My grandson has Autism as do many other children. One day we will find out why.
#WorldAutismAwarenessDay  TY All Awareness is important! @POTUS & @FLOTUS @KazmierskiR @HorseShort @_CFJ_ @ShellyKennisto1 @eavesdropann

True , but people have short memory !
Love
Thank you for supportimg autism
Son on the autism spectrum? Interesting millions of women march worldwide & u dont even blink an eye..... U R selfish
Oh great, more people you can make fun of.
Does Melania have an app that allows her to light up the White House from THREE STATES AWAY?
So disrespectful
Hard to believe this is sincere ..sorry.actions speak louder than tweets these days.
Then you are not very well informed.
We don't believe you. trump wants to strip healthcare away from the handicapped sop they die off faster.
Dude she doesn't even live there.
Who cares?
is Drumpf only doing this because his kid is on the spectrum? As far as I can tell he only cares about himself!
You know your words will come back to you right?
Thank you Mr. President and Melania for my granddaughter who has Autism and Tuberous Sclerosis. God Bless you!
They not give a crap about your granddaughter.  He is working to destroy sister that will support her in school & in the community.
From mocking wounded veterans to mocking the disabled press core member to mocking captured veterans, yeah he's really concerned about them
Psalm 20:5
We will rejoice in your salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners! May [1/2]
Where's the one about where he drown a bunch of babies and women? That part always creeps me out.
 this!
Except they're never there, so who really turned on those lights?
Technicians. You actually think they turn out the lights and lock the door at night?
Well dear time for bed hope I remembered to turn off the sprinklers
Melania is never there, and the dirtbag is always golfing.
Direct your anger at the DNC they let you down not Trump
Please stop the Tweets
Wow, thanks Donald; it looks awesome
So beautiful. Thank you @POTUS, for caring about America & putting all Americans first. You are Mr. Smith goes to Washington, A TrueBeliever

MAY THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD, {JESUS} LIGHT UP THE WHITE-HOUSE, AND KEEP IT LIT AT ALL TIMES. brendanmccrossan@yahoo.co.uk   northern Ireland.
I my president! Thank you @POTUS for your to @SuzanneWrightAS by lighting our house blue & making autism a priority in your administration
too bad y'all don't give a darn about kids, autism or anything but yourselves for that matter.
Yeah they dont give a damn.....hence the blue light at the white house.
sho' is easy to flip a switch. Heck of a lot harder to make a real difference. Seen his taxes?
Well the ones Maddow showed us he paid 39 million ..can you say youve done as much? Thats just one year.
my taxes aren't the question his are. Why do you hate America, and hate tradition?
Rich I love America. I just dont believe in the one world order that Democrats xo.
Do
Be your words
Il Blu rimane sempre bello per gli asociali autustici difficolta nei rapporti sociali Amarcod Fellini bello il blu il primo amore
Alleviated by the sweet bells of constantinople like those really nast radical ones had said.
why, are they actually there tonight?
But it's just fine to mock the disabled. Give me a break hypocrites
hmm....maybe Baron
@WhiteHouse The failure of Obama and Rice is just one example of their incompetence. Failure to verify a huge gap. No wonder our debt.
Slaughtering innocent people including children and babies cannot be tolerated chemical weapons or not.
Donald Trump became president in everyone's eyes Thursday. Now the weak losers can start accepting him as their president. God Speed!
This is a beautiful thing. I'm sure some will find it tasteless and some will tweet stupid insults at  the President and First Lady.
THANK YOU !!!!!
Hypocrite!  Impeach the FASCIST!
I'm happy about him honoring people with Autism.  Both my son and I have Autism Spectrum.  I'm just hirer functioning. Thanks so much.
Now that is a nice color reflecting on thr white house. @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @DogBountyHunter
@alessandraleigh @LelandBChapman
THINGS LIKE THESE VACCINES AND CHEMICALS IN THE SKIES FOOD AND DRINK CAUSE THIS KIND OF STUFF, WHY WONT IT STOP, WHY KILL US?
Looks great
V
#VACCINES #1 CAUSE of CANCER and #AUTISM  #MUST STOP #CORRUPT #CDCLIARSAND THIEVES>
as much as you change "white house "and those inside are not Popular is as painting a chicken on a rain
why NOT change the colour from WHITE to RED because that's what the house represent. The world see it that way.
also made fun of a disabled man...
God Bless
Trump secretly is afflicted
@rlockrocks
Thanks! Where's the funds though?
great job!
Great pic but now overhaul the AHCA so it would no longer impose immense harm on kids with autism.
Or simply just live up to your promise not to cut Medicaid.
thank you Mr. wonderful president for caring for the kidsThe only thing Obama ever let the house up with was when the homosexual BS passee.
@timagogo @WhiteHouse @POTUS @FLOTUS @rlockrocks
this is laughable when he's proposing block grants to fund Medicaid.
Neither the whoremonger or the whore have any honor. Fake con artist. Honor, where are your tax returns?
Meanwhile Behind these lights you're trying to cut all your health care and stick it to the elderly the poor the disabled Medicaid Medicare
Thank you in honor of my 12 year old grandson!
Thank you for highlighting #WorldAutismAwarenessDay by lighting up the White House blue !  BTW, it's also about #Acceptance & #Opportunity.
Nothing more than lip service & PR stunt. 45 is bad for #autism acceptance. Disappointed @autismspeaks would RT this.
Was @POTUS honored when he nominated a judge who knowingly ruled to discriminate against individuals with autism? His words are meaningless.
Instead of autism research better schools help financially, we get blue lights a awful president who wants walls, divisions, hate and lies.
Spend  time with YOUR SON.....
Love my new President
Meanwhile, #TrumpCare proposed major cuts to #Medicaid, which provides important services to many with #autism. Good work!
Spectacular!
Very Beautiful! Excellent issue to highlight. It affects so many families.
I have a autistic son can you help him
What did you do for Barron? Did he get a new train-set?
On another less weighty subject: saw the NYT pic in the tweet story. Now i understand ur hair issue. Looks ridiculous! Get a haircut!
Autism is an important subject but will it be affected by your proposed cuts in medical research? I bet it will. What hypocrisy.
April is designated to recognize not only Autism,but also Child Abuse Prevention and Awareness,Can you honor our children gone too soon plz
make a promise to help them and you can see how to help human in the basic form of what it needs are.....
And rhe Secretary of Education implies that schools should not make accommodations.
Nissa I raised my 2 kids alone,  mom was the deadbeat works both ways, but aborting a baby after 1-2 months is wrong!
The Clinton's also glued drawers shut and cut phone lines, childish stunts, total lack of character.  Trump has class.
Class? Are you kidding?
The White House does this to recognize all of those who are affected and the liberal democrats still find something to criticize
Too bad he's a POTUS that rolls back the rights of these same disabled , in school, workplace..

Trump insulted and degraded Disabled Americans, followed up by trying to eliminate services Disabled Americans need to survive #TrumpSucks
Awesome!
Thank you for respecting those with special needs!
Thank you president Trump. I have a son  who is a police officer
Donnie is an idiot.  I have no respect for the 'so the called President'. Russian Puppet, only.
Stop vaccines! End Autism!!
beautiful
Oh you mean your daughter because the wife cant stand to live with you.
wow I just checked your approval ratings, they are really bad and getting worse
