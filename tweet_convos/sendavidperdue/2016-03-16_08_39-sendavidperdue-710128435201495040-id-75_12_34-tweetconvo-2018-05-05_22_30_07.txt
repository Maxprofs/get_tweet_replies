@sendavidperdue @POTUS Then quit if you refuse to do your job. Or suspend pay.
@DukeOfVinings @sendavidperdue His job is to do what the conservative people in Ga elected him to do.
@SamAxeMarshall @sendavidperdue His job is to fulfill his constitutional duty.
@DukeOfVinings @sendavidperdue
@SamAxeMarshall @sendavidperdue what does this have to do with anything?
@DukeOfVinings @sendavidperdue Read......  It will expand your mind. Live long and prosper. 
@SamAxeMarshall @sendavidperdue Dude, I remember it.
.@sendavidperdue Does your “authority” empower the Senate never again to consent, eliminating the Supreme Court? Article III assumes not.
@christor @sendavidperdue Tell me something Christian. Whats the number of Supreme Court Justices the constitution cites?
@SamAxeMarshall @sendavidperdue More than zero. “The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court … .”
@christor @sendavidperdue
@SamAxeMarshall Nothing’s wrong with the Senate’s refusing to consent to *a* nominee. @sendavidperdue refuses even to consider *any*.
@christor live long and prosper Christian.  We wont change each others way of thinking.
@SamAxeMarshall Fair enough. Happy to chat anytime! Cheers!
@sendavidperdue #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue  These trolls have never even read the constitution. Probably not even from GA. Stand firm.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Vote how you want, but hold the hearing. The President has done his part, now you need to do yours. #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Your constitutional authority is to confirm or deny a selectee. Refusing to #DoYourJob is reason for a recall.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Is this how a "businessman would be better than a politician"? #DoYourJob like a good employee should.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS The people gave their voice 4 years ago. You are trying to derail democracy! Do your job and vote
@sendavidperdue @POTUS or trump with a nomination? Bird in the hand here. You work for us, at
@sendavidperdue Ha. This is twisting words. 'Withhold consent' means after a vote. Do your job.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Do your job or quit I pay U 2 work 4 all of America
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Your Constitutional duty is to do your damn job and hold hearings and have a vote.
@sendavidperdue you are not representing your constituents w this stance. I'll donate heavily to your next challenger. Do your job
@sendavidperdue You're not withholding consent, you're withholding confirmation hearings, which is very different. #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue you and McConnell are a disgrace...this is the stuff that creates cynicism and anger...and I'm Republican and from GA
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Playing politics, not "exercising your constitutional authority". Just admit it. #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue This is partisan nonsense! There is no reason for the US to go 10 months with only 8 judges. Get your head out of the sand.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS you were hired by the People of #GA to perform your constitutional duty & confirm #JudgeGarland. Now----》#DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue @POTUS So all the votes cast in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 don't matter?  #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue @POTUS A politician thinks of the next election. A statesman, of the next generation.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS you can withhold consent AFTER a hearing!
@sendavidperdue enjoy being a single term senator then. Your obstructionism will get you fired #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue you, sir, are no patriot. This country deserves a #SCOTUS to continue moving our nation forward, not stalling or backwards
@sendavidperdue The American people elected a president w/307 days left in term. It's disrespectful to us, the office, the court. #doyourjob
@sendavidperdue That's because you're an obstructionist and this will backfire when you jerks lose the Senate and the WH again. #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue You don't understand the constitution!  You can't just not allow the hearing.  You can vote "no", but you have to listen.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS SHALL ADVISE&CONSENT.Not Withhold & Object, Not Withhold &Obstruct. Hold the hearings&do ur damn job! #SCOTUSnominee
@sendavidperdue @POTUS #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee  Ridiculous, you are taking the peoples voice away! You are only supporting your own agenda
@sendavidperdue @POTUS This is pathetic, do your job or resign.
@sendavidperdue #DoYourJob or lose your job next voting season.
@sendavidperdue Does that mean you will respect the peoples' choice after 1/20/17, or just find a new way to obstruct? Serious question.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS We don't cotton to oathbreakers in Georgia.For example to uphold the Constitution not the GOP http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Oath_Office.htm …
@sendavidperdue @POTUS
@sendavidperdue @POTUS  As a voter this makes me distrust you even more
@sendavidperdue @POTUS AND YOU SAID YOU WERE DIFFERENT! What bullshit #DoYourJob or resign before we boot you out in the next go round
@sendavidperdue @POTUS I think you should at least begin the process..POTUS is setting you up to fail.  Optics!!
@sendavidperdue @POTUS I hope Georgia remains firm in their Constitutional authority to vote you out next election.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Unacceptable. The President has done his job. Now it's your turn to #DoYourJob!
@sendavidperdue @POTUS  but why? Simply because Obama nominates? What if that person is a conservative? Just NO is childish
@sendavidperdue @POTUS glad you held the whole hearing in your brain and made an informed decision. Pathetic. #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue Then vote on it. #DoYourJob.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS thank you Senator for sticking to this.  We the ppl appreciate it.  No to Obama appointments
@sendavidperdue @POTUS the American people have spoken, by electing Obama POTUS. Stop being obstructionist. #SCOTUS #SCOTUSnominee
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Lying POS potus nominates a gun grabber!!
@sendavidperdue If you're not going to do your job, then you don't deserve my vote and you will not be getting it @POTUS
Hey @sendavidperdue @POTUS has done his job, may you should #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue @POTUS old man politics as usual. Making me sorry I voted for you  #DOYOURJOB
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Stop putting party over Country and #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue @POTUS please do your job and vote
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Without a hearing? Actually that's not your job you party shyster. #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue @POTUS I don't think you understand your Constitutional duty, Sen. Perdue. Voters will remember.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS So you don't want to be re-elected?
@sendavidperdue @POTUS you think hillary will nominate someone better?
@sendavidperdue @POTUS But why? What's the reason? Not your right but your reason?
@danafowlefox5 @sendavidperdue @POTUS doesn't have a right under the constitution.
@sendavidperdue We want @potus to put people on the court. As a proud Georgian whose tax $ pays you, I am telling you to #DoYourJob
The Senate SHALL advise and consent....The Constitution didn't stutter. @sendavidperdue @POTUS
@dawngpsalm63 @sendavidperdue @POTUS yes. Not listening is really an  AWESOME trait in a leader. #DoYourJob
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Thank you! This #SCOTUSnominee supported the 2007 DC gun ban attempt. Enough said.
@sendavidperdue This is a really, really stupid call. There is a political price for this, and we will make you pay it. @POTUS
@sendavidperdue @POTUS   But analyze this judge first, and provide reason for decision.  To do otherwise sets a bad future precedent.
