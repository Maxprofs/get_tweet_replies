“But I think we need to be very specific about how we pray. We should pray like Psalms 109:8 says."

The verse Senator Perdue used is not new, it went hand in hand with Trump's Birther movement.

hang on ! GS is taken it to the CAVs ,  James' money belt is holden  him back !!
Listening from Canada, can't believe the hatred you displayed toward Pres.Obama. I grieve for your country. Today,Orlando.
maybe you should pray for the death of the national debt as well.
.@sendavidperdue <== unfit for office. Prays for POTUS death.
If you had good sense you would apologize publicly while everyone is watching Orlando. #HateIsUgly #ChristiansLoveNotHate
I can't believe that you would make such a threat on your own president and you supposed to rep this country? Just treason!
why you worried old man? You have no answers, 10 years you'll be pushing Daisy's. #fakechristian
If only this "Christian" had a basic comprehension of Christianity...Jesus weeps!  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/10/georgia-senator-prays-for-obama-to-suffer/ …
why are you praying for Obama's days to be few? Is he running for a 3rd term? Surely you don't mean his days in life? #WWJD
Just recited that same horrible prayer, for David Perdue it's fair exchange for him to receive the prayer
our national defense priorities are why we have such a national debt!
Thank Bush for the National Debt.
Sen Perdue,
You can claim ignorance of the Bible, but their's no doubt the significance of Psalm 109
@sendavidperdue
http://www.usccb.org/bible/psalms/109 …
Secret Service should arrest @sendavidperdue for inciting death threats against Pres. @BarackObama - an absolute disgrace! #Trumpery
NO Christianity in this man...just another thumper, repeats the words, no clue to their meaning.
U preach hate & incite violence. No love for a man, his family or our country. Vengeance is mine says the Lord. Check urself
May the fleas of a thousand dogs find refuge in your pubic hair.
May the prayer that you pray for others be visited upon you
dude your 66 years old, you offer nothing. You'll be dead soon. Serve your term then go away.
that's a lie.
"Imprecatory Psalms invoke judgment, calamity, or curses, upon one's enemies or enemies of God."

Senator Perdue,
You are either ignorant of the religious significance of Psalm 109 or don't care?

@SecretService Could this quote be considered a call to  #assassinate  POTUS?. Isn't that a #FEDCrime
Workplace safety for #Army #Navy #Marines #AirForce #CoastGuard Shld be on that list #PassMJIA #MJIA #MilitaryRape
And that's why you voted to let the terrorist no-fly list have semi automatic weapons, right?
Actually it seems the ND is undermining your ability to subsidize big oil, corporatism and war.
Agreed. Stop corporate welfare now! Make the rich pay their fair share of taxes.
Did you pray these things for Bush 43 (Iran, 911, Recession), Nixon, Trump? I'm guessing No.
@sendavidperdue Also, APOLOGIZE for PRAYING for the DEATH of the @POTUS
(R)epublican Budget Masturbation -- Shout "National Debt!" to cut helpful programs, but then don't actually reduce the debt!
may you also die young since you are so haughty
Debt from defense spending is undermining our ability to fully support our citizens. #NDAA #gapol
its not the Government job to "fully support our citizens"
THIS PSYCHOPATH senator lead a prayer in hopes that president Obama dies! Sir, YOU NEED TO BE IMPEACHED!
sad
--> @sendavidperdue
prime example why there should be term limits for all members of the senate and house..God don't like ugly.. #TERMLIMITS
If you're still alive, that's proof enough for me that there is no god.
I will pray for you,Sen.. Anyone who  uses that Psalm to refer/pray/as a joke against another human being needs God's help.
maybe we wouldn't have that problem if you stop giving yourself and you're rich buddies tax cuts
Praying for our Presidents death?  You belong in jail.
The Republicans and the Democrats are same. Two big wasteful spending parties. I am sick of fake Patriots like you.
Then vote for Democrats.@GOP = FISCAL FIASCOS. Compare debt between Republican and Dems.@sendavidperdue
sadly, fascist clown trump wants to do those same things again, but to a greater degree. monumental stupidity.
Well If The GOP Would Not Have Given Tax Breaks To The Rich & Give Corporations A $950 Billion Tax Break We Might Have $$
Please deal with the pain deep inside of you in a different way, and do not threaten the President. Grow up.
Delete your account. You are a scourge on this earth. You are unworthy to say Obama's name.
sick 
You sir are an embarrassment to Christian faith
embarrassed you represent Ga...
- We've had enough war, douche, let's worry about housing, feeding, and caring for the vets you already created.
Sounds like you want to cut taxes for billionaires and corporations again.
But what about all those non-balanced budgets of Saint Ronnie Reagan?? He never did balance one. Bill Clinton did.
the Republican con game of inadequate defense spending continues with this "pray the prez" away moron.
You confuse the debt with the deficit. The latter entails borrowing to cover deadbeat tax dodgers like you and #TaxDodgeDon
Please tweet your resignation and then ...
#DeleteYourAccount
Not true and thinking people know it. If you have to lie to support your view, your view sucks.
Too bad your #GOP buds won't raise taxes on those making over $10MM/YEAR. Fund #Infrastructure not #yachts.
nope. The national debt is created by you voting for huge defense spending and from moocher non- union states like #Georgia
that's not true at all and you know it.
Then, how about you @GOP loons stop running up the national Debt. @sendavidperdue
If true, then simple answer is raise taxes on rich & corp's (& pay back the $$ u & ur cronies stole from Soc Sec)!!
Asking people to pray for president's death? You are no Christian. You are worse than Trump. Love those so-called "values"
thank you for standing up for voters , Americans, we don't need media to interpret someone's words falsely
If Sen David Perdue (R-Ga) doesn't know what an "imprecatory prayer" is, now is a good time bring him up to speed
your hatred of @POTUS & publicly wishing for his death will get you visit from @SecretService, so no need to fret debt.
BS. Stop inciting wars for (or with the help of) the Military Industrial Complex and we won't need such a bloated military.
translation: "Spending money on things I don't like is undermining our ability to spend money on things I do like."
You do know that the National Defense budgets is what is constantly driving the US into further debt, right?
You're Just Another Southern Redneck Racist God Isn't Happy With ...   #ALLBLUE16 ...
Tax the churches that you and your conservative brethren attend.
National leaders using psalms as dark, unfunny punchlines undermine our nation.
I'm currently praying that your days are few, and that your family ends up in a dumpster.
you are a disgrace to the office you hold.  You are a US Senator and this is how you represent your state and our country?
u. Praying for Obama death y u mad.his manhood is bigger than urs he's blessed wit melanin he is a God ur god!
@sendavidperdue
I was going to blast you for your despicable prayer but then realized everything I was going to say has been already said.
nomorechciken
President Obama has reduced the deficit by a trillion $ but you want to jack it back up again for your contributors.
.@sendavidperdue WTH is the matter w/ you with your evil "prayers" against our President? Looking forward to you reaping what you sow. SICK!
from the atl journal &constitution. https://cmgajcluckovich.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/061216-luckovich-toon-ed.jpg …
what true Christian prays for the President's death? That his children be fatherless.  Not funny.
SHAME ON YOU!! The defense dept gets 50% of the budget. Get real and #stoplyingtotheAmericanPublic
Why didn't you join the military?
Then why did you support the Bush/Cheney debt busters while they ran up unheard of debt?
Our defense/military is well funded.
should pray for a brain! We now spent as much as the next 14 countries combined on defense. What a moron!
Is your ass jealous of the amount of shit that just came out of your mouth?
.Natl defense budg bigger now than you want ppl to know. Maybe you can pray for Tom Cottons days to END SOON, fatherless kids
shame on you for asking people to pray psalm 109 against another human being remember you reap what you sow
You Self Righteous FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE Greedy Obstructionist Pirates are PATHETIC
BLAME A FRIGGIN GREEDY OBSTRUCTIONIST PIRATE. Bush pissed a $236 BILLION BUDGET SURPLUS AWAY
Here are Senator David Perdue's office numbers-
Atlanta: (404) 865-0087
Washington : (202) 224-3521
Use them...
Senator, you are an embarrassment to the State of Georgia. Yes, the President is a black man.  Get over it!
should we pray for the poor to be killed too? Please guide us
let me fix that for you: our national defense priorities are undermining our ability to fully get the nation out of debt.
Prayers for our president's death? Seriously?

You're a #traitor and a #disgrace to all Americans. #StochasticTerrorism
You are a sick man.
@MonsterMarcia @sendavidperdue Wonder which Church is his this religious man I'd like to ask the preacher if he teaches them that
Yet you never seem to be unable to fund contracts in your district.
Sir- Did you actually PRAY for Obama to die? To a bunch of Christians?  1 John 2:9  FJB Gold Star Dad
And if we weren't fighting wars fought under fake circumstances that Bush pushed, would we be this underwater?
Time to send some money to this assholes upcoming opponent. You may want to consult that book you cherry pick! @sendavidperdue
You've got that backwards, dipshit. Defense spending & deregulation are driving our national debt. #GOP are a big fat #fail.
traitor to the USA.
RWNJ POS, we have the greatest, most expensive military in the world!
Jesus weeps!
Excuse? Pardon? What? Huh?
@MonsterMarcia @sendavidperdue Just like they pretend SS is causing a problem when we pay into that fund our working lives
National defense?  When was the last time we faced a real threat 15 years ago? How about global Health care, help some ppl?
you should be impeached and indicted for inciting death threats to Obama ! You are a sick animal and a spawn of satan
MM of Americans voted for Obama and we love him. We don't take kindly to you Xtrisn types trying to curse him w/  myths
thanks for making the state of GA an embarrassment again. Keep your prayers to yourself from now on.
~@sendavidperdue You ought to be ashamed of asking Christians to pray for Obama's death. You're undermining decency in this country.
@madamecrab @sendavidperdue 
And should be in jail
how long have you been a cow tipper?
why did George W run up debt and Bill Clinton pay it down?
As a Georgia resident I want to remember your name to GOTV against you. Shame
That's real Christian of you to wish for Obama's death.  You should resign you POS
My kid just gave Grace at d dinner table and asked for Obama's days to be few. We all hugged n laughed. #YourAHero
May the Lord destroy @sendavidperdue's fruit from the earth, and his seed from among the children of men. Did I do that right?
The bibel is cool.

F 35 ..... wtf...... Can't fly.... WORSE ....
Maybe you could pray for the debt to die. That's your thing, right?
Just watched you and your fellow "Christians" laugh as you prayed for president Obama to die. You are human garbage.
Shame on your soul for your #fakechristian comment..if God is real he will punish you for your hate & racism..#shame
Bloated defense priorities caused the debt you bloated tool.
.@sendavidperdue BS!It's your job to lay & COLLECT taxes to pay debt & provide for common defense.End @GOP #CorporateWelfare #CloseLoopholes
You call yourself a Christian! Threating our @POTUS ! You are not a Christian Perdue! U speak with Devil's tongue! #GOPFAIL
praying for #POTUS death is a bigger problem
I am embarrassed that you are from my hometown and a graduate of @GaTechEngineers
no it is closed minded pseudo Christians who are making our discourse so rancorous #asbadasTrump
@sendavidperdue
secret service won't prosecute you for your death threats because NO SANE PERSON WOULD BELIEVE A PRAYER WOULD WORK HAHA jerk
UR a disgusting vile pos-in hell for all eternity Jesus would spit in your face HOW DARE YOU CALL YOURSELF CHRISTIAN?
Disrespectful, conjuring death spells, you're a horrible example for our youth.
Two wars in the name of National Defense are the main the reasons for our National Debt
#FakeChristrian
You need to be arrested for threatening the @POTUS. Where is the secret service? You are no Christian.
May Georgia's voters condemn your bigotry and make your days in the Senate few by voting your ass out
thank God normal people are against you in wanting President Obama killed @Support @SecretService
let me read you from Austin 3:16
Shame shame on you @sendavidperdue.
What a pathetic excuse for a "Christian" you are, @sendavidperdue. People like you make me ashamed to be called one. #GOP
@MonsterMarcia @sendavidperdue I think reprehensible and despicable are two better words to describe it.  #notajoke
“.@theonlyadult: .@sendavidperdue https://twitter.com/theonlyadult/status/741345443288907776/photo/1pic.twitter.com/jVAlxgQp9y ” 
praying the same for you , as you do the president your days be short
Are you kidding me? Truly..as a Senator you need to educate yourself and quite lying to the public!! Shame on you!
Ga vote this idiot out of office.
Re: Psalms 108.7 "When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin." This applies to you.
What an exemplary Christian & American you are! Praying for POTUS' death? #ResignNowTraitor
so praying for the president's death is what you're about...
"Really unfortunate" that GOP's @sendavidperdue perverted the Bible to wish death on America's First Family.
"As far as the lines that followed the verse he quoted, Perdue said it is 'really unfortunate.'" http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/david-purdue-obama-pray-224185#ixzz4BC8FeJzx …
@briantashman unfortunate David Perdue is on the public dole for salary and benefits. Threatens the President
Typical Christian terrorist.
Thoroughly despicable Senator, even by your low standards.
How do you call yourself a Christian yet pray for the death of our President? Just another GOP Christian POS hypocrite.
You mean the National Debt that Bush & Cheney created after Clinton gave them a surplus? You mean that one? #RepublicansLIE
shame on you
Shame on you for the scripture you quoted. People like you that are the reason why I will no longer vote Republican
U should be ashamed praying for evil things to occur, It's anti-Christian. U should be praying  to the Lord for forgiveness
I don't think sacks of shit pray but I could be wrong.
for what you said my Christian about our President  remember God sits high and looks low, so comedic not, but ignorant yes.
But you want Obama dead.
