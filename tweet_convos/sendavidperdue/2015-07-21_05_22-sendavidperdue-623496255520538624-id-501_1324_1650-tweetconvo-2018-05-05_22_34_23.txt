@SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol America has become war zone thanks to gun nuts. Servicemen survive wars & die on America's streets
@TeaTraitors like you give two shits about the service members.
@KiloMick I'm not the one denying Vets benefits or making it easy for Terrorists buy guns & turn USA into Somalia
@TeaTraitors literally every "gun nut" I know is a vet
@KiloMick So were both Ft Hood shooters.  You want to keep guys like them armed?
@TeaTraitors yes, captain straw man, that's what I want. I have nothing else to say to you. You're an ignorant person
@KiloMick LOL Only strawman is you. Why do we have wars when gun nuts r killing more Americans than ISIS or Al Qaeda could dream of?
@TeaTraitors <--- denies using straw men by building a straw man. You're not as smart as you think you are. You should atop
@SpeakerBoehner @HASCRepublicans @uscapitol maqsood anwer 2015 1 daily basis
@SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol 
These pple who fail AMERICA
Are card carry'ing idiots
Do you know how many and DO YOU KNOW THEIR NAMES? @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol
@imsure @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol Boehner's throws out scraps to appease us..not going to work.  He would be wise to remember Eric Cantor.
It would be best if he confess whatever bho holds over him and be done with it…and him! @anne19brown @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol
@imsure @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol Yes.  What does Obama have on him and the others? Some pictures...or ?
Maxine Waters said, Obama has a database…no doubt 8X10 glossys as well! #ConfessionIsGoodForTheSoul @anne19brown @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol
@imsure @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol Yes. Everyone thought she was a loony tunes.
Yeah, I think she's been muzzled since then. @anne19brown @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol
@SpeakerBoehner @TGowdySC @uscapitol
@SpeakerBoehner @USCapitol @Kathie1718 I HOPE YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED & I DON'T CARE HOW MANY RIDES THE PRES PROMISES ON AF 1
.@SpeakerBoehner @RepMimiWalters Boehner doesn't represent GOP VOTERS! #FireBoehner #PJNET  @uscapitol
“@jimcc66: .@SpeakerBoehner @RepTomEmmer Boehner doesn't represent GOP VOTERS! #FireBoehner #PJNET  @uscapitol”
@SpeakerBoehner @TGowdySC @uscapitol we the people would like to know why it took 5 days for the president to lower the flag to half staff?
@SpeakerBoehner sad day
@SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol @Bitter_American Only decent thing I remember Boner ever doing in 40 years in DC. What a record!
@SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol took you long enough.
@Rightonthelake @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol I hope u feel the same about the White House?
@randyduke4 @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol Uh, no one said I didn't. But obviously, they are no better.
@SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol My question is why did it take you so long? You politicians need to wake up! Do your jobs you are being paid
@haroldb54 @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol tradition does not lower national sites for Line of Duty deaths. these were LOD.
@bodiva @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol LOD I know very well. 28 yrs worth. Any soldier killed in LOD is afforded that respect.
@haroldb54 @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol not at the Capitol. The flag wasn't half staff throughout any war.
@bodiva @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol So in other words your complaining because veterans are calling for those killed to be honored!
@haroldb54 @SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol no, pointing out to those critical of "slow to act" that they've done something they've never done b4z
@SpeakerBoehner @TGowdySC      Why did it take 5 days to lower the flags?
@SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol when are you but going to manup  when it comes to dems the GOP  is a sorry site
@SpeakerBoehner @TGowdySC @uscapitol yes
.@SpeakerBoehner @repmikerogersal We deserve a SPEAKER who represents us! #FireBoehner #PJNET
@SpeakerBoehner @Bitter_American @uscapitol It's about time DC caught up with the rest of the country.
@SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol Should have flown at half staff the entire time we were at war. http://icasualties.org/ 
@SpeakerBoehner @uscapitol exactly, why in the world did it take so long ?????
