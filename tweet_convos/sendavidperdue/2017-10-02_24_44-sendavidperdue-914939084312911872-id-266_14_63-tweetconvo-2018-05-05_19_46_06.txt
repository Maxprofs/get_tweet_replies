The President has issued a proclamation honoring the victims of the tragedy in Las Vegas: http://45.wh.gov/sfbDya 
Did you really take $1,800,000 from the NRA?
*crickets.....
Right? If yes, defend it. If no, I’ll believe you. But to tweet hashtags & avoid any discussion is doing a disservice to the dead.
They’re all doing a disservice to the living and dead, they don’t give a shit about you or me or the people that have died...
I own guns. Was raised in a gun family. Raised my son around guns. That being said something has to be done. It’s getting ridiculous.
I agree, I myself am a collector, hunter avid gun person, was raised around them, my child is also, nobody is held accountable anymore
And yes that won’t stop criminals but it could stop a crazy like the sandy hook kid or maybe this Vegas guy. Case in point: my uncle
Only will stop them from buying at a store, still a black market that accepts cash, no paper trail
#MASA
Your prayers are not enough.  Do something.
Your prayers are meaningless when you accept money from NRA & refuse to support #CommonSenseGunLaws
Are you going to vote yes on the silencer issue? Please respond here Senator, we that follow you want to know your position and reasoning
You've taken money from the NRA & spoke at the NRA conference. You're a part of the problem. Keep your prayers, give back the blood money.
Exactly, what are you going to do about it Perdue? http://www.rethompsontravel.net/david.htm 

http://www.rethompsontravel.net/david.htm 
Do more than PRAY!
Work for us, we need #GunContolNow
You need to pray for the USA and apologize for being a traitor. STOP supporting the person who is currently holding the country hostage.
Proclamations don’t save lives. Common sense gun laws do.
Pretty sure that they and their families would much rather they were alive than "honored".  Thanks for doing NOTHING to protect them.
What are your 'go to' prayers for gun massacres?
@sendavidperdue was $1,825,000+ from the @NRA worth all of the innocent lives it took? You have blood on your hands. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Folks (including voters like me) sound kinda pissed in these replies. Maybe u should consider changing your tactics? I will vote again.
Blood money.
You do recall taking $1.8M+ from @NRA, yes? How about rejecting gun-lobby money and pushing for smart, life-saving legislation, Senator?
Out in 2018: anyone who doesn't take a stand against the NRA.
Vote against Anti gun laws like the people of Ga voted you in for ...  #GunControlDoesntWork
@WhiteHouse #PrayForTheNRA
this is good, if you come forward supporting responsible gun control it will actually mean something.
Do something
Make it really count, Senator. Vote to ban automatic gun conversions. -- Forsyth Co. Voter and 2nd Amendment Supporter
How about taking action to pass meaningful, reasonable gun control instead?  #ThoughtsAndPrayersAreNotEnough
#NoMoreThoughtsAndPrayers
And I'm praying you grow a back bone and stand up to the #NRA.... 
How's that prayer working out?
He might as well have dedicated a golf trophy to them.  It would help just as much.
This is less than nothing. It's time to change the law.
Or... Vote for common sense gun regulations?
Clearly, your prayers aren't helping if these tragedies keep occurring. Think about it, Senator. 
- a constituent
Maybe stop praying and do something to change legislation so these tragedies stop happening.
After you're done praying, perhaps pass meaningful #guncontrol legislation so it much less likely to happen again? Just a thought.
What did you spend that $1,825,006 from @NRA on?
Stop the blood baths.
#sendbackthebloodymoney....
#shoveyourprayersupyourass
Americans are violently dying by the thousands. Their blood is on your hands. WE SEE YOU!
Another empty useless gesture!  How about actually doing something useful like enacting sensible gun laws?????
NOT ENOUGH. #guncontrolnow You contributed to this tragedy.
Tell us why you keep blocking any and all  gun control legislation @sendavidperdue
No. Prayer has been tried in the past and it doesn't stop this. It's time to work on laws. To start, limit magazine size to 10 rounds.

You actually have the power to fix this. Pass gun regulations or you are complicit.
Nobody wants your prayers NRA shill
Sure, pray. Then act. Talk about gun violence. Gun shop owners are more worried about robbery than mental health.
Guns for possible terrorist. Yea!!! Gun Checks Nay! Praying for more #MassShootings ?
Blood on your hands
Prayers aren't enough. What are your thoughts on sensible legislation to restrict high-capacity magazines, silencers & armor-piercing ammo
Money, money, money. That's all you pray for, and the NRA answers your prayers! Blood, blood, blood, all over your hands!
GUN CONTROL. PRAY LATER!
Enough prayers. Do something about gun control NOW!!!
@WhiteHouse #TheNRAownsyou
Shame on you. The angels will see the blood on your hands, come judgement day. May the lives of the victims weigh heavy on your soul.
AS IF THAT WILL DO ANY GOOD. GUN CONTROL!!!!
Also, please pray that no one else learns how much more than my balls are caught in the NRA moneyclip and keeping me from #gun control
Pray with me, Senator. If we pray hard enough we can escape any accountability.
Useless without action on gun control.
Shove ur prayers! U'd rather take @NRA blood $ than protect the lives u represnt. We'll see how sorry u r when u vote on silencrs & bullets
This is the price of you getting $2mill from the NRA.
You own part of this and every shooting in this country. Feel the weight of that and do something to change it!
.@sendavidperdue took $1,825,006 from @NRA. All he'll do is send a hashtag -- he won't *act* to reduce gun violence

Until this changes...nothing changes.
Surely u plan on donating back the money NRA gave u to help with the victims funeral expenses and hospital bills
Give back the $$$$ have you no conscience  ?
BLOOD ON YOUR FUCKING HANDS.
Pray for God's forgiveness when he judges you for you love of NRA money over people's lives.
Here's a thought: Give back the $1.8 mil you took from the @NRA. Then you can make some sensible gun laws for our country.
Pray for your soul.
Pray? You moron. What do prayers do for dead people? How abt smart gun legislation? How abt not taking NRA $ & doing the will of the people
#bloodmoney  bought you. Can you save yourself & put people before the NRA?
#bloodmoney
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
@WhiteHouse #PrayForGunControl
Can you pass some reasonable gun control now? Pray then act. Faith without works is DEAD
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You are complicit in the escalating gun violence! Hang your head in shame!
How dare you sully the memory of those lost with your inaction. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Prayer isn't working you dip wad. Take yourself out of the NRA's pocket and DO YOUR JOB. #LasVegasShooting
So. How's this tweet working out for ya?
Sick David & Liar: Your took FACT $2Million from the NRA #BloodMoney  #giveitback #guncontrol #KarmaNeverForgets #vegas #TomPetty #LasVegasShooting

#SendBackTheBloodMoney
It's time to #SendBackTheBloodMoney and stop being complicit in the mass murder of American citizens. The @nra is a terrorist organization
How about legislation to ban these weapons from being sold to prevent the next tragedy?
Enjoying cashing NRA checks while people die?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
What else are you doing? #SendBackTheBloodMoney
What is your plan to stop these tragedies from happening again and again?
When are you going to pass sensible gun control & vote NO on the silencer Bill. How many more would have died if the gunshots weren't heard

#passguncontrolforvegas
Senator: You've accepted $1.8 million in campaign $ from the NRA. #SendBackTheBloodMoney and support sensible gun laws that Americans want.
Who cares! Stupid, hollow words. Means less than nothing.
Your prayers mean nothing
If a mass shooting happened in ga, how many casualties /wounded would it take for you to reconsider your position on gun control?
Do something!  You are a "more of the same" politician.  Enough with the prayers!
#PrayDavidPerdueStandsUpToTheNRA

#Pray for common sense gun safety legislation
Hypocrite.
Forget it, Senator. Your vacuous tweets won't wash the blood off your hands.
Blacksburg. Newtown. Aurora. Fort Hood. Charleston. Orlando. And now, Las Vegas.  Is it still to soon to talk about gun regulations?
You have the power to act. Shame on you for facilitating this tragedy. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney you contributed to this shooting by taking the NRA’s money and doing NOTHING to work towards stricter gun laws.
Why can people purchase automatic weapons!
Enact gun control legislation for Vegas
I live in Georgia. Thank you for praying. Now get off your knees and support some common sense gun control legislation.
$1,825,006 from @NRA
Geez Dave - the least you could do with the $1.8mil you got from NRA is sending flowers to all 58 victims.
What are you going to do about it?
Stop it. Your pretend sympathy is gross.
Praying that senators who care more about NRA money than about American lives find a conscience would help too.
Prayers don't stop bullets do something or be a coward that takes blood money from NRA.
Hi David. The $2,000,000+ that you took from the NRA speaks much louder than any half-ass Twitter prayer.  #SendBackTheBloodMoney
If you have no interest in actually doing your job and helping people, why be a senator? Also, what are you doing about the #CHIP renewal?
Your prayers mean nothing when you're willing to take $$$ from @NRA but refuse to do anything to address these tragedies.
When you should fire your social media team. Or, at least give them a list of donors as frame of reference when tweeting 4U. #nrabloodmoney
We don't want your prayers, we demand that you #SendBackTheBloodMoney & cut ties with the @NRA
.@sendavidperdue took $1,825,006 from @NRA. All he'll do is send a hashtag -- he won't *act* to reduce gun violence 

#SendBackTheBloodMoney
The senator is listening to his constituents. The ones that voted him into office. Which you obviously aren't.
Was the $1,825,006 you took from the @NRA worth their lives? Because your prayers mean jack shit. #prayforvegasANDGUNCONTROL
Empty prayers without Action.
I would hope my senator has a better plan than "praying". We need action from you. We need it NOW.
Hogwash. You contributed to this fiasco.
Their blood is on your hands
Prayers do nothing

Knowing that the sound of gunfire is what alerted the crowd in #LasVegas, how will you vote on the #shareact?
responsible gun control NOW. Quit bending over for the NRA you cowards.
You goddamn hypocrite.

Scumbag. The 58 dead are merely a cost of doing business for your owners.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Praying won't suffice. Have a backbone & pass sensible gun reform. You won't lose a primary or a general election for doing the right thing.
Honor them with gun laws not a proclamation!
And pray that Congress does not pass the bill that allows silencers and harsher bullets!
$1,825,000 from the NRA!
Good luck washing those hands @NRA @GOP
You have blood all over your hands. Do you not have a conscience? Too much time in the bubble. No idea how you sleep.
Don't pray, we've prayed after every shooting, and they keep happening anyways. This time, please ACT!
Wow. Nice words. How about some action? Are you in favor of that silencer ban now?
do better! you helped cause this horrible massacre.

What are your prayers worth? Nothing. You sold your soul to the merchants of death. America is sick of this crap.
Those deaths are on your hands.
U r in bed w the @NRA from whom you've both taken millions.Until u make gun & bullet prices more cost prohibitive this will happen again & again & with no leadership in the WHouse on this issue will no doubt repeat itself These guns are4 killinghumans not should 4 military only
I'm a constituent and voter. Prayer is fine. Gun control leg. is better. Stop accepting $$$ from the NRA. YOU, sir, are part of the problem!
how much money did you take from the NRA again?
praying for you to lose your place in the senate. Bet you’re not bothered by that because you know it’ll have no effect.
Take some responsibility and act. People are dead today because of the failures of Congress.
Your prayers are not enough! There's no reason for US citizens to own weapons that can cause mass murder. It is insane to think otherwise
And it was an outstanding statement.
A 13-character tweet that means nothing. That's $140K of @NRA #bloodmoney you took per character.
Better hurry & wash that blood off your hands. @NRA shill!
Now is the time to talk about the issue of guns in America. Not later, now. Please show some leadership concerning this issue.
Praying on twitter is mearly a sign of gloating and a "look at me, i care to approach".
I am praying for your change of heart. #ThoughtsAndPrayersAreNotEnough
You are an accessory to mass murder: 
 http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/David_Perdue_Gun_Control.htm …
SERVING AMERICA'S BEST INTEREST not yours, not the NRA's. A proclamation is not bringing back the dead or preventing new dead. STOP FAILING
You took 1.8M from the NRA.  Blood on your hands.  Keep your fucking hashtag.
A nice tweet but that's all you'll do cause you've been paid to look the other way.
Don't forget to count your NRA blood money! $2,000,000 and counting! I guess that's worth a few American lives. #bloodmoney
Can’t even be bothered to put together one sentence of condolence? Did you promise @NRA you’d gag yourself?
Prayers won't help. You accepted $1,825,006 from @NRA. #SendBackTheBloodMoney #GunControlNow #guncontrol #thoughtsandprayers
How's that NRA money feel?
Does it feel like death?
Because that's what it is.
1.8 million dollars. I bet the survivors are going to have higher medical bills.
You are a puppet of the @NRA. You took nearly $2 million from that criminal organization. You oppose reasonable background checks
Amazing you can tweet with all the NRA blood money on your hands
Thats a lot of blood money davey boy. fucking gross. you should be ashamed
Send back the NRA blood money.
#davidneedsanewpairofshoes sorry man you don't get to feel bad, you sold out to help cause this horror.
Why don't you use your @NRA blood money to pay for funerals??? #BloodOnYourHands
Stop taking bribes from the NRA
#PassMeaningfulGunControlLegislationForVegas
Their blood is on your hands. #DoYourJob
