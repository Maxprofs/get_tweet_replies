You are despicable! Your office doesn't answer phones from constituents!
WHO?!?!?
That's funny, I see someone who doesn't want to be president. He admitted that in an interview, that he actually has to work!
@sendavidperdue are you crazy?
Wow good job David
Hope for impeachment? Hope for a resignation? Hope for a massive stroke?  Your boy has done nothing to help this country. #RESIST
Are you completely disconnected from reality and your constituents or are you just a bought and paid for hack?
The hate in your heart must be overwhelming to follow and propagate trump's lies. You're a sad man.
you are delusional.  I feel nothing but fear, disgust, and unease.  Georgians are watching you!
Literally what are you talking about.
Lol. So out of touch, senator. #nope
Did you fall and hit your head?  Seriously the longest get nothing done 100 days ever.
HOPE U can COME OUT OF THE CLOSET. U& @SenatorIsakson could hold joint #TownHall.  U will hear OUR voices ... not hope. Just $ going to rich
Hope that he will be impeached and spend the rest of his life in a federal prison for selling out the U.S. to Russia.
TOWN HALL!!!!
hope that things don't get worse
People who are looking for a town hall meeting from you are seeing no hope. Really? You do not care about your constituents? Meet with us.
To which people are you referring? Certainly not your constituents here in Georgia.
All you do is pander to Trump.  You have no cojones.  You are nothing more than a puppet.
What people????????????¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿
You've proven daily that we Georgians are last on your list. Our hope is that our fellow citizens see you for who you are.smh
Your voters don't believe you, or even think that you yourself believe what you're saying. You're backing spin with spin, lies with lies.
Get real Senator
No. No we are not full of hope. More like disgust. Fully Investigate #Trumprussia and I'll feel hopeful.
Yes! Hope! There are 100 less days of his presidency.
Delusional. People are sheep being led to slaughter. @POTUS only interested in price per pound.
When everything is a disappointment the only option is to hope.
If you stopped hiding from Georgians, you'd know we see NO hope anymore. And you're part of the despair.
If by hope you mean every morning I wake up and hope our disastrous "President" has been locked up, yeah you are right
Yes I'm very hopeful as I see his regressive policies fall apart at every turn.
Truth!
Is this a serious statement? Is this really your true feelings? How can you say this with a straight face. You're truly pathetic
And you are letting him get away with all of it. We will not forget. We will not be silent.
I only see despair as he deconstructs our protective agencies, alienates our allies, lies continually & makes himself & his family rich.
Is this a joke? @sendavidperdue, POTUS has had policy after policy declared unconstitutional. The first 100 days have been barely legal.
Do you seriously believe that? I've got no words. You are beyond redemption
You do not represent me. You are rich, privileged and in your own bubble. Trump has never been A+ on anything in his life except treason.
Hope? Are you kidding me? You better step up and do your job and stop the damage done by this administration.
Do you have your rose colored glasses on??!!??  #TownHall #townhall #Trumprussia
NO preemptive strike on NK. We cannot afford another war especially one that can turn nuclear quickly
Hope that he will be impeached soon.
You and Trump are a joke. Hope you do down w him on #trumprussia #100daysofshame #impeachtrumppence #gophypocrisy
Either you are completely insane or so tied to the GOP lies you can't see truth from fiction. BTW, you can't avoid your constituents forever
The courts give us hope. #USAoverGOP
Surely you are kidding.  I'm only hopeful that every day brings us closer to impeachment
You give Trump an A+.  Wow.  That clearly shows your blindness, privilege and lack of empathy.  You are out of touch, sir.
…presumably because there’s not much else to see
Hope that we won't wake up to lost health care or a crashed economy or war? That is my desperate hope but it's called anxiety, not hope.
Stand up to that man!  Hold a town hall!  Quit being a #trumplapdog
yikes
What hope? You threaten to take my healthcare, hurt and terrify my hispanic neighbors, and start wars all so Trump can make a buck.
Excuse me? Your constituents on both sides of isle would disagree. You can't govern with EOs. #DoYourJob or #WillLoseYourJob
Our only hope is impeachment.
No we're not. We're seeing a flailing man in over his head, obsessed with ratings and now with an itchy trigger finger.
If by hope you mean "President with the lowest approval rating ever" you'd be correct. Hold a townhall, Senator.
I'm not sure who you mean by people. I don't think even yourself will say it's sucessful and your constituents certainly don't.
You are full of it. He's done nothing for the working class. Stop drinking his koolaid!!
No, actually we're seeing a bucket of failure and kissing corporations' asses.  And YOU"RE part of the problem!
Seriously? Only if you're delusional & think he can get everything done with executive orders.
And what dimension are you living in?  I just don't see it and the last I checked I was a people. 
Hope that we stay out of WW3 David. Are u sane?
Spot on Senator! 
People are most assuredly *not* seeing hope. Rampant corruption, dysfunction, treasonous activities, yes. Shame on you! #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
The people from GA who are looking for their Senators are finding none.
lol
Hope? Are you kidding me? Sure HOPE that he doesn't start WW3 and HOPE that he doesn't take away my rights as a woman. 
Can we hope you'll have a town hall meeting for your constituents?
Could not agree more.  No ACA repeal.  No border wall.  No Muslim ban.  Hope.  Now how about a town hall, @sendavidperdue ?
If you talked to your GA constituents, "hope" isn't what they would say! This GA voter doesn't feel hopeful. Hold a town hall!
Yup, his incompetence gives us hope that he won't destroy our country, our healthcare, the fragile post-war peace
He's accomplished nothing. Destroyed things like a child. Spent OUR money. Now he's gearing up for War b/c he gets back pats for bombings.
Sycophant
