What, no mention of the #JEWS who actually suffered the loss?
You can start by stopping the Muslim ban.
@SenatorIsakson   This constituent says
No to DeVos!  Impressed w/ leadership from  @SenJohnMcCain and @LindseyGrahamSC !
@SenThomTillis the tragic loss of so many.......? There's a noun missing here...
how can you say you are striving for peace, when you have done nothing to respond to Trump's refugee ban?
.@sendavidperdue you've remained silent about neo-Nazi Steve Bannon and the #MuslimBan. We (your constituents) will remember your inactions.
May history not repeat itself. May the US not lead the way to a new Holocaust. #nobannononnsc
Please denounce @POTUS unconstitutional immigration/refugee ban #MuslimBan #NoBanNoWall #Resist
"Of so many" -- any groups you want to name in particular? Of course not, that would be reflecting on the facts of history.
put your vote into that sentiment!  VOTE  NO to CEO EXXON REX TILLERSON. SENDS A BAD MESSAGE TO THE WORLD!!!  WAKE UP!
it is important to remember history... please do not stand idol, it is a bad idea to repeat it
if this is truly how you feel, fight the ban on Muslims, and refugees. #notamerican #standuptotrump
reflecting yet while you allow people to persecuted on our soil on the same day. You should be ashamed. #nomuslimban
And you honor the lives lost in the holocaust by not doing anything about ban on refugees/immigrants?
We need you to stand against Sessions & DeVos. Please issue statements, I urge you to place GA and the nation above party.
Yeah right. If you really cared about the Holocaust, you wouldn't have voted "silent" in regards to the ban.
don't make the same mistake as the administration: Remembrance Day is about the *Jewish* lives lost via Nazi persecution
Jews. They're called Jews and deserve the respect of being addressed.
Will you make any public statements regarding the unethical and inhumane treatment of refugees by #POTUS .
can you comment on Trump admins refusal to mention jewish people in holocaust statement?#NCvoter
.@sendavidperdue The best way to remember is to not let it happen again. Why have you not spoken out yet regarding Trump's EO?
You should feel nothing but shame if you ever call yourself a Christian again or tout American values. You disgrace Georgia.
Officially, his office's response to the Exec Order is "No Comment".  Doesn't know or care how many detained at ATL Airport.
What do you think about Trump not mentioning the horrific loss of 6 million Jews? Do you care?
then do something about this in America
How about in 1939 when a boatload of Jewish immigrants were sent back 2 their deaths in the holocaust. They were immigrants.
Way to toe the Trump partyline.Don't mention the Jewish people specifically,be sure to make it look like you're all-inclusiv
Is this how u want to be remembered in GA? Complicit in supporting a Nazi "strategist" pulling our president's strings?
you the with Senator Isakson. We have a holocaust yet you stand aside and allow Trump to walk on our Constitution? Get up!
I like how neither you nor @realDonaldTrump mention the Jews. #fakeChristian #horriblemen
We put you in that seat, we can remove you from it. #NoToSessions #NoToTillerson #NoToDeVos End the #MuslimBan
@SenatorIsakson 
Constituent in Sandy Springs says,
"Bannon =Göbbels"
So speak out against the #MuslimBan - I will remember your complicity come election time. We all will.
.@sendavidperdue Reflect harder. Your support of Trump policies will only become harder to defend to us, your voters, as time goes on.
strive for peace with this EO? You are dooming Americans to a similar fate. What is your stance!
Senator, why haven't you come out against #MuslimBan and executive orders blocking #refugees from safety? Even this little boy spoke out:
Looks like it's time for the strong to step forward and for the weak to kneel.
@JohnnyIsakson "striving for peace" = saying no to ban on refugees & immigrants. Sunday school teacher? WWJD? #NoBanNoWall
I fixed your tweet

Reflecting upon tragic loss of refugees after heinous ban by @realDonaldTrump. I'll stand against it! .
such a hollow useless platitude. I honestly expected better. You can and MUST do better. Make us proud - not ashamed.
TY @Impeach_D_Trump for sharing.Sen. stand up to Bannon/Trump/Putin or don't consider yourself a man
considering your silence on the treatment of our Muslim neighbors this tweet is meaningless.
Stand up for what is right...not Trump's ban on refugees and legal immigrants!
It wasn't about peace, senator. It was about equality and liberty; precisely what the Founders committed treason for.
I know you've been busy with the Koch Brothers, but still waiting to hear from you. PS your VM is full.
to show your commitment to preventing further atrocities you need to challenge to #MuslimBan and cut out the lip service
did you see how many of us were @ Hartsfield today? We need you to stand w/ us, your constituents #NoBanNoWall
& May we not repeat the mistakes of generations past. #NoBanNoWall
You can strive today by condemning the #MuslimBan.  Your silence makes you complicit.  History has its eyes on you.
This is so embarrassing- David & Johnny- the silent Bobsey Twins - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hSGjyWJZIQJpGz4V2ftX_qioCgBtL59oJkkhx146nFE/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true …
I'm an American because my Jewish grandfather was able to flee Austria as WWII began. You can prevent more tragic loss now!
And with a man who wants to be the next Hitler in charge, please comment on the Constitutional crisis he created on Friday.
then why are you not standing against this band on refugees coming into the United States?
Continue to strive, indeed. Please speak out against Pres. Trump's #muslimban.  Be on the right side of history. Speak up.
Do not allow history to repeat itself. Turning away those who seek refuge will lead to tragic loss. Love thy neighbor.
Now is no time to be silent.  History will judge you. #NoToMuslimBan
Keeping quiet on the #MuslimBan isn't a great start on this goal. Your silence is deafening. Stand up for the Constitution.
You need to stand up for American principles & denounce Trump's order. You should be ashamed of yourself!
Please to not say this and then support Trump turning away refugees and immigrants based on their religion.
denounce this ban now!
They're called Jews, senator.
Your chance to strive for peace is at your door. Condemn the executive order that bans legal residents from their homes.
. @sendavidperdue you have an obligation to oppose the Muslim ban.  As a constituent,  and a voter,  you must openly oppose Trump.
Thank you for acknowledging the day.  Now show up for refugees in 2017.  Oppose Trump EO #NoBanNoWall  -- a GA voter
what are you doing to oppose Trump's unAmerican and cruel agenda? #NoBanNoWall
what about the tragedy of refugees?  Will you strive for peace for them? for the children of the mid east and gens to come?
We will never forget where you stood on @POTUS Executive Order to ban Muslims. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hSGjyWJZIQJpGz4V2ftX_qioCgBtL59oJkkhx146nFE/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0 …
How about the Jews that died in the Holocaust? I suppose we needn't mention them. There were only 6 million.
How can you be so hypocritical when @POTUS bans refugees on this day? Think of  the Jews who died after being denied visas
Georgians will remember your silence -
-yours are hollow words from a spineless coward. Stand up, denounce @POTUS his wall & his ban or be counted as evil with him
And yet silence on Muslim ban? Do you know anything about the Holocaust? The U.S. is causing "the tragic loss of so many."
.@sendavidperdue do you have anything to say about the #MuslimBan ???
yet you support a president's who EO detainspeople based off their religion. You are the worst type of #hypocricy
.@sendavidperdue I vote in Georgia. When will you speak out against the violation of law being committed by DHS and CBP? #NoBanNoWall
If it's true u remember the holocaust then why silent on #MuslimBan and refugee help. We notice. #ChristiansAgainstTrump
strive for peace by supporting refugees. Speak out against #MuslimBan. Remember Jesus was a Middle Eastern refugee.
How do you tweet this and then not oppose what POTUS did on the same day? Don't be on the wrong side of history.
Totally agree - thank you! How about speaking up against Trump's illegal and unconstitutional Muslim ban?
Georgians want to know where you stand on the #muslimban.  It's your duty to make a public statement.


@SenThomTillis Please stand against the un-Christian & illegal Muslim ban! #stopMuslimBan
perhaps now is the time to speak out against the #muslimban
How do either of you sleep at night? Are you too scared to stand up for basic rights?
Stop the ban on Muslims. Don't repeat history with @realDonaldTrump
Clearly you aren't remembering how it started. Denouncing and fighting the unconstitutional #muslimban would be a start, @sendavidperdue
.@sendavidperdue If you believe this, you must speak up. Discrediting media, silencing dissent, religious discrimination. Where r u on this?
We also remember where leaders stand on issues. Please tell us your position on the immigration bans. #Constantvigilance
It would be good to see you #StandUp and say #ThisIsNotRight You have lost your moral compass, David #silenceiscomplicity
your #SILENCEISLOUD
Unless they're Muslim, right? #NoBanNoWall #nobanonmuslims #noban
please do not support the muslim ban and Trump's cabinet nominees. Aren't you up for election in 2018? We are watching
Say 'Jewish' you #SpinelessRepublicans #DeadGOP #Whig #AntiAmerican #prolifegeneration #AllLivesMatter
@SenThomTillis y'all HAVE GOT TO STOP. @SenatorTimScott you too. Our president just banned people from the u.s. Do something
@SenThomTillis your silence today will be remembered.
Shame on you
So where's your statement regarding the latest presidential atrocity? #MuslimBan #Coward
your silence on the Trump EO is shameful and craven. Grow a spine and stand up for us, now before it's too late. Govern FFS!
On this remembrance day you should be denouncing the EO of the president- no Muslim bans and no Bannon on the NSC!
trump puts us all at risk and you post this? Why aren't you standing up for those being oppressed in your airport right now?
While reflecting, think of the Muslim ban. Will lead neither or peace nor safety.
@SenThomTillis And banning legal immigrants and refugees is not the way to remember.
Please stand against @potus in immigration ban
Let's reflex on the PHD Professor at Clemson who is not allowed to return to her job & life. Nazis-R-US now.
Where do you stand against @realDonaldTrump anti-American orders? What side of history do you choose?
and today, Jan. 28, we are reflecting on the loss of our values by refusing refugees.
Hope you stay true to your words and speak out against the refugee ban.
POTUS just made clear that the generation of Americans that stop striving for peace is this one.
when are you going to speak on the Muslim ban? constituents deserve an answer. We are waiting
by banning people based on religion?! Speak out against the #MuslimBan #resist we will!
I don't see you striving. I see you unconstitutionally banning refugees and even citizens. Where's your integrity?
will you stand up for those Trump is trying to turn away now? You say "never again" & you have power to help make it so.
Do either of you have anything to say about the inhumane treatment of refugees happening now?
Where do you stand? Do you have a backbone or are you spineless? Speak up against @realDonaldTrump or resign.
time to stand up to @POTUS #MuslimBan is #UnAmerican
#NoMuslimBanJFK #NoMuslimRegistry God sees what you are doing. Hope you like hell.
I am one of your constituents and I do not support your loyalty to Trump's Muslim ban. It is unconstitutional.
if you truly care about keeping the Holocaust from reoccurring, you will fight Trump's war on Islam.
.@sendavidperdue How about doing something about the Muslim ban EO? How about striving for peace today?
We stopped them from coming in 39 and they died. Now we are stopping Syrian's from the same thing. Shameful!
You need to stand up to Trump today or we will have no peace.
Please stand up for our GA immigrants and stand against the #MuslimBan
Lets continue to strive for peace & stand up for injustices; lets open our doors to refugees & not ban people based solely on their religion
your constituents would like to hear your position on #MuslimBan
The "so many" were Jews, turned away by the US because they were thought to be German spies or socialists #historylesson
remember this? Your "enemy" today is your shame tomorrow.
@SenThomTillis You need to work on ending the Muslim ban or you will be complicit of repeating history.
@SenThomTillis Imagine Syrians as Jews.......
@SenThomTillis are you both so simple how damn ignorant that sounds today while we are banning people due to their religion.
If you support Trump's ban on fully vetted refugees, this statement is meaningless. We will remember. I'm a GA voter.
Kind of like how we are turning refugees away today?
My name is Regina Blumenstein. The US turned me away at the border in 1939. I was murdered in Auschwitz 
Be on the right side of history and say NO to the #MuslimBan How can you speak of relig. liberty and support this? Shame!
You aren't reflecting very hard if you support a ban on refugees. Anne Frank and her family were banned too.
YOU WANT PEACE? WE ARE ABOUT TO LOSE ALL HOPE OF PEACE WITH WHAT THE POTUS IS DOING. HE IS CLUELESS. YOU ARE WITH HIM.
What are you doing about this massive conflict of interest? https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-trump-immigration-ban-conflict-of-interest/ … via @bbgvisualdata
you are disgracefully unaware of the irony here.  No words.
.@sendavidperdue Please remember those Jewish refugees in 1939 that we turned away by welcoming in today's Muslim refugees.
Suffering continues as our own govt commits the same crimes that began the Nazi era. #WeRemember means no repeat!
don't even pretend like you care. The Republican party is about to do it all over again.
This is the perfect example why you must stand against @POTUS' unAmerican policy barring people of faith from entering USA.
@SenThomTillis both rt in support of immigration reform. @POTUS signs an EO on #holocaustremembrance #MuslimBan hypocrite
You & @GOP have become an embarrassment. You stand by as @POTUS issues ban on Muslim refugees, then tweet about Holocaust?
You are a #fakechristian. God will judge you.
your #failure to stand against your republican #POTUS's orders shows that you know & remember zero about the holocaust.
CONSTITUTIONAL CARRY in Georgia.
The way to do this is to open our borders. I wouldn't be here if the US hadn't accepted my family fleeing WW2. #saverefugees
This Iraqi worked for peace for US. Now detained???#ThenTheyCameForMe
Strive for peace? You mean condemning Syrian children to die in a war torn country? You're a murderer. -GA VOTER
now is the appropriate time for leaders like you to strive for peace - condemn Trump's cruel, religious-based refugee ban EO
Then why didn't you honor them by standing against Trump's unAmerican, unChristian ban?
Senator, what did you do Friday to resist the Bannon Destruction of State plan?
How many more will die because of your racist ban of Muslim immigrants. #hypocrisy
Sir, consider your support of a man promoting othering & discriminatory legislation. How do you think the Holocaust began?
..David so proud of you for your love of America. Thank you
Betraying everything good and decent in America is not http://pro-America.You  can have the hypocrite.He'd fit right in TN
you are the reason we must continue to utter 'Never Again'. May God have mercy on your soul.
thank you. May we prayerfully consider the difference between those survivors from 70 years ago and the refugees of today
Deut. 10:19. "Therefore love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt." #NoBanNoWall
Assume u also include those who were lesbian/gay & who were killed in the Holocaust in your reflections today as well.
.@sendavidperdue Duuhhhhh I'm David Perdue and I'm rank and file with the Alt-Right movement of Nazis, and try to get cred with a tweet.
How of those people would our illustrious, delusional Pres send away if they sought asylum? How can you support that man?
This is the day Trump picks for an assault on religion. #holocaustremembrance   The Hitler parallel continues. #ImpeachTrump
yall lost get over it
The Confederacy lost. Grow up, join the 21st century.Start living like the Christian you surely believe you are.
trump won get over it we had a black president for 8 years  how are we racist
The fact that you refer to him as a "black president" underscores your racism.
ha ha ha ha ha
Classic #hypocrisy smh 
Good point! Today is an excellent day to remember that we as Americans should stand up to injustice and help those in need, right?
many that died in Holocaust were turned away from our borders. YOU are now complicit in allowing history to repeat itself.
Allow history to reflect that on this #HolocaustRemembranceDay you used your position 2 publicly reject bigotry
#NoBanNoWall
you just tweeted support of an immigration ban.. How hypocritical can you be?
@SenThomTillis typical response from political hacks, example of lack of critical thinking. #NoMoralValues
please fight this EO to ban refugees! These are women and children who have no where to go.
Peace for everyone unless they're Muslim. Got it. #muslimban #hypocrite #fakechristian
You could be working to prevent Trump from forcing history to repeat itself via the #MuslimBan, but you're not. #NoBanNoWall
I should hope this means you will not repeat that history with @realDonaldTrump
Meanwhile, yes to muslim ban.
May we strive for safety for those still reaching to us for peace. What are you doing for them? #NoBan #MuslimBan
