.@sendavidperdue @sentomcotton A lot more Americans than six are killed due to @GOP opposition to even reasonable #GunControl measures.:-/
.@PoliticalAnt @sendavidperdue @SenTomCotton @GOP The GOP always supports the deaths of Americans if someone profits from those deaths.
@missy_ryan God is demanding that u quit abusing the #Bible to threaten your democratically elected #POTUS.
I want the details made public of your violation of the LOGAN Act but I don't think I'm gonna get that either
@missy_ryan

@mssnowwhitty @SenTomCotton @washingtonpost That before or after you prayed Obama died?
Both of you are traitors to this country. Cotton taking bribes from Israel, you hoping for Pres. Obama's death
Even the G. Bush records?  Yeah...let's!
We can thank the Bush Administration for releasing all of the criminals that participated in this attack.
It figures that two traitors like you would hook up. Next time just get a room & stop screwing the rest of us.
.@sendavidperdue And I am demanding that @sentomcotton apologize to the family and friends of #CassandraButts. You know what for,chump.
