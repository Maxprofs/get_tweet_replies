@CheesersDurden @WSJopinion @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @WSJ and the people spoke when they replaced  congress with a GOP majority.
.@fairtaxman @WSJopinion @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @WSJ That's completely irrelevant. It's not Congress' job to appoint SCOTUS justices.
@CheesersDurden @fairtaxman @WSJopinion @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @WSJ It's Congress's job to clear the appointee. Let obama appoint all he wants
@duckyack @CheesersDurden @WSJopinion @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @WSJ show me the clause that says "clear"

@WSJopinion @SenTedCruz @tedcruz they have spoken, twice, now do your damn jobs and quit spitting on our constitution
@WSJopinion @tedcruz @WSJ 
Is it possible Obama won't fill seat, hoping HRC gets elected,and nominate him for supreme court?
Roll the dice?
@WSJopinion @tedcruz  After his nomination, President Obama has respect the steps that the our Constitution determines for the designation.
@WSJopinion @tedcruz 
Pres. Obama has the right to nominate the Scalia’s replacement, but he has not the right to “force” the designation.
@WSJopinion @tedcruz I think Ted Cruz would be an excellent choice to take Supreme Court Justice Scalia's place on the bench.
@WSJopinion @SenTedCruz @tedcruz the people have spoken.

@WSJopinion @tedcruz @SenTedCruz
