Speaking of broken, how about meeting people in your district? We need to fix our broken political system. Need senators who listen
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! #UnitedforFreedom!  Do YOUR job!
Don't spend what we don't have! Get government out of healthcare! Keep 7 year promise of #FullRepeal! #KeepThePromise
3rd recess & 3rd no-show in Atl! When are you going to fulfill your job responsibilities and meet with constituents in Atl? Shameful job!
Please work for #FullRepeal of the ACA and don't replace it with a Trump version of government healthcare. #UnitedForFreedom
#FullRepeal promised w/REPUBLICAN pres - we expect  nothing less! Get government out of our healthcare! It will save us trillions!
You are an immoral puppet.
The broken process is the process where you vote to line your pockets and not help Georgians. Are you ever gonna meet us?
House Republicans voted yesterday for a bill without even waiting for a cost-benefit analysis. I'm dubious about your fiscal responsibility.
The bigger picture is the #FullRepeal we have been promised for 7 years. Trust me, we're not forgetting. #UnitedForFreedom #KeepYourPromise
The bigger picture is US democracy and you're shitting all over it.
Please #KeepThePromise  and give us #FullRepeal !! No #SwampCare!!   #UnitedForFreedom
The tweaks to Obamacare in the House are not even close to #FullRepeal. Stop this outrageous government overreach. #UnitedForFreedom
Ok, big picture. People WILL DIE if you continue your support of Trumpcare, and you will be responsible. Big picture, do you sleep at night?
It is imperative that you appoint an ind. commission to investigate trump's collusion with a hostile foreign gov't. #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
Repealing&Replacing ACA takes your eyes off the bigger picture.RyanCare will be a disaster in GA.Can't trust GA b/c lacks Medicaid expansion
Federal gov't has no legitimate power to provide healthcare - will fail like VA
#Constitution #FreeEnterprise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Meanwhile the golf trips and Melania's staying in NYC... those don't rack up millions of unnecessary  dollars at all. Dump T*ump!
I hope you have enjoyed your job, u won't have it for long
.@sendavidperdue if #AHCA becomes law people we love will die Access 2 aff hcare is life or death 4 those at risk of/living w #breastcancer
NOT happy at all with the direction in which you and @realDonaldTrump are going. So please stop. #juststopwiththebs  #GAresists
Are you serious?  The GOP is the reason we're in this mess, & Trump won't make it better.
I urge you to examine the House's healthcare plan using this standard: lessening the national debt & repairing the Federal budget. Vote NO.
Impeaching 45. I.Agree, get on it!!!
You have no idea what the bigger picture is it.
Every word that comes out of DJT's mouth is evil, and you declare yourself his stooge. What does that say about u?
#FullRepeal of Obamacare, please.  That was the promise.  "Land of the free" does not mean subsidies. #KeepThePromise
The bigger picture, like giving tax breaks to the already wealthy in this country? The GOP has become so un-American it's unrecognizable!
Couldn't agree more. Excuses end now. Congress needs to do the job we elected you to do. Build a wall. Rebuild military. Revise taxes.
Forget the budget; it's imperative that you vote NO on #AHCA & preserve access to healthcare for Georgians. 1/2 ur voters (women) lose out!
#fakesenator.... so you really think about ga people?   Or just your Republican admin?
There are other ways of doing it besides breaking the backs of the middle class. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Like defunding insurance for sick and dying people????
We pay you so you can protect us, not so you can kill people & give the military an unnecessary boost because the president wants more nukes
How can you be so monumentally out of touch w your constituents? Oh, right - you never listen to us. Sad!
This right now is dysfunction. Voting to give money to the rich and kill the poor is dysfunction. Rape as a pre existing is dysfunction!
I will remember in 2020 if you vote for this disastrous healthcare bill. Care about your constituents for once.
We have our eyes on you, don't worry
Rape would qualify as a preexisting condition. It it be known the @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP want to leave abused children uninsured.
At what point do you remember to vote on what's best for Georgians??
I the words of "Joe Wilson." YOU LIE!!!!
#AuditTheFED would be the good place to start.... but you're not listening anyway. #smh
Of making rich people richer!!!!
That's called checks and balances-not broken.  It's working if it's slowing your train wreck.
Wow What a dirtbag you are Senator... White & Wealthy with no empathy for middle class. Your scared to host Town Halls !
From Sen hearing: KABOOM! Lynch Stated: "She would do WHATEVER it took  to PREVENT Charges from being brought against Hillary."
Glad to finally C some unity in Reps Now @SenateMajLdr & Sen Reps need 2 get on board Trump/'People's' Team ie @LindseyGrahamSC & @RandPaul
The bigger picture is the GOP obsession with erasing Obama from the history books. Listen to your constituents. GOP healthcare is absurd.
Does big picture include irresponsibly passing legislation w/o any analysis of its cost or impact? The House seems to think so. Don't do it
Your vote is a vote against conservative values. Shame on u, sellout like all the Wash swamp. Next election, you're out of here traitor!
Listen to your constituents, this is NOT what they care about right now. We want a firm commitment from you to vote NO on ACHA.
Damn right
Good for you
Disappointed in GOP vote on flawed healthcare bill. Senate must defeat this bill. If not, look for changes in those who elected in future.
No pre-existing conditions, vets now at possible risk, no grty of maternity & ped care. What are you doing for GA? Confused.
Thank you for supporting our President   We are thankful for you
I support Handel's tweet to free blacks from Dem's plantation-not voting due to her pro-gay agenda

Thank you sir for your work.  I'm from Georgia and would appreciate your efforts in trying to correct this problem.
hey there! whatcha doin with your 11 day taxpayer funded weekend? anything fun?
I want you to see my child who has a pre-existing condition and care about her for a change. I hope you lose your job at the next chance.
Vote him out!
Quit being #trumpspuppet and do whats best for all Americans! We will be fighting to #VoteOutPerdue2020 #fuckthegop
pls explain what's meant by "changing budget process"? Hope you don't mean changing senate rules??
No, it was imperative for you to stop the murder of children. I've fallen for the GOP bait and switch for the last time.
We will be voting you out in 2020 .@sendavidperdue as well as 11 of your @SenateGOP brethren in 2018. Trump has signed GOP death sentence.
What are you going to do about #AHCA?
#TownHall
*that!
Remember you work for the people not Trump. He is a treasonous moron and unless you don't want to follow him down the drain, remember thatď
You need to keep an eye on your seat if the new Trumpcare bill the Senate authors is even 1/10 as catastrophic and murderous as the House's
Including passing bills with NO cost analysis?  You cannot be trusted to do what we, in Georgia, want.
The house made a grave mistake. You should send this bill back to them.  A bill with no score. They voted party over country.  #cowards
Your statement is rather foolish. The President can't take his eyes off the wall and the last election. And you won't meet with constituents
I will be voting against you ever chance I get.
David, you are awful. How about Trump wasting tons of money playing golf & vacationing & with his wife & kid in NY? #GOPtoady #gapol

You just want to help Trump shovel more of OUR MONEY into his pockets. Sit and spin.
Your entire agenda is destroying his legacy. Try something positive for once
How can one say this budget is a "step in the right direction" when it still funds Planned Parenthood, among other very dubious things?
You don't work for Trump, you work for us and we are clearly not ok with this course.
