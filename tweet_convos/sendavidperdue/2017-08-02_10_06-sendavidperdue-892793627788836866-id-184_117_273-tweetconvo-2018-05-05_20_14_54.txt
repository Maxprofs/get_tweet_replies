You are Trump's red meat merchant. I am a Georgian who will work to defeat you.
Embarrassed my senator helped draft this hateful legislation. You don't have to agree with the crazy man in the WH on every issue #growapair
So basically this is a move to implement the new minority.
Why aren't you going after the companies that are hiring the immigrants like Trumps golf courses and hotels? Put a cap on them!
Now there is a loony idea that has nothing to do at all with the law or the problem
Thank you for being one of the few defenders of @realDonaldTrump .  Don't become one w the swamp!
He was chairman in GA for Trump for President. He has a vision and gave up his successful business career to make America better
When will you hold a town hall for the constituents (like myself) who you represent, so that you can explain how this benefits GA?
Clearly the RAISE Act believes people over 50 cannot contribute significantly to society.  Old politicians we have now are proving that!
Who do you think has historically been harvesting Georgia crops? Immigrants. Outbound loads have fallen because of it. He's screwing farmers
That is unfortunate You should meet some of them some day who happily landscape, harvest, and take care of their families
This will be your xenophobic legacy for the single term you serve.
Hahahahahaha Anyone who opposes illegals is by your definition xenophobic Look up the definition before throwing it out there
I'm in the same boat as you and I couldn't agree more.
Same.
Agreed
Excellent. I stand with you.
How could I have ever thought Gerogia was more progressive than Alabama. I obviously swapped the devil for the witchMay as well head to MS
I am less surprised by @SenTomCotton  he is just an asshole
This has zero chance of passing because immigrants are a source of cheap labor in Georgia..
Thank You Senator!
Very impressed with you, @SenTomCotton and the RAISE Act! Long overdue.. Thank YOU for your hard work & effort in putting #AmericaFirst 
Your white sheet is showing.
Thank you for having the guts to listen to the people.   GA voter
You are such a disappointment. Period
Ok, I love you!!!  Voice of reason!  Please don't stop pushing this.  You are 100% correct.  U & COTTON R MY NEW HEROS!!!
So disappointed.
Great Bill #TheRaiseAct We NEED this Passed Now!! Immigration reform is long overdue!!
This bill is a disgrace to American ideals. I'm a State of GA employee with an MBA & I'd only have 29 points. #shameonyou
The fact that you are sponsoring this is really strange your family benefits from the labor of immigrants
Thanks for embarrassing Georgia again, @sendavidperdue. You must really hate Georgia farmers. Outbound loads are way down. No cheap labor.
Guess you never look at the Georgia Debt Clock.  GDP is going up and Ag is major contributor
As your constituent I ask that you would remove your sponsorship of the RAISE act.
Please explain your objections. I suppose you have read ACA and understand that atrocity?
#MakeAmericaWhiteAgain
Did you even try to get bipartisan co-sponsors?
congratulations on your work to destroy GA farmers. What does @NathanDeal think of this?
You do not represent me, my state, or the values of this great nation.
I cannot wait to vote against you in 2020
Thank a god courage lives in the Republican Party after all!
@SenateGOP @The_Trump_Train NICELY SAID SIR !!!
Most economists agree that this act will slow economic growth.
I'm your constituent & I will call you every day as you promote this horrific, racist bill that hurts GA. You work for us.
Vote Perdue Out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're terrible. Based on your plan, you would not be admitted to the US. #moron
I'm for skill-based immigrantion policy.  Wage rates and English speaking are not economy-enhancing skills.  Write a bill that makes sense.
Unless your objective wasn't improving immigration, but riling up Trump-base, providing a distraction for WH, & boarding that sinking ship
Horrible idea! Thanks for making Georgia look stupid.
You are an embarrassment to the state of #Georgia. My staunchly republican, millionaire, tax paying immigrant grandparents would be ashamed.
Georgia farmers will love watching their crops rot in the fields because you hate immigrants.
Party before country
The current immigrant system already benefits GA.
We need an immigration  reform both for legal and illegals. Senator your mistake was to have @realDonaldTrump involved. Now it will not pass
Yes, thank you... for showing your TRUE heart. I thought you were a moderate. Turns out, you're just like the rest. You will be voted out.

Thank you Mr. President and Sen. Perdue. God speed!
This is will be great for our Country! I am so glad to hear this! 
Thank you!!
For all that thanking Perdue, I guess u will be the ones in the fields cutting onions and Southeast Georgia
THE WORST ! #RaiseAct -WE NEED PEOPLE FOR AGRICULTURE---GEORGIA WILL SUFFER !!!
You are an embarrassment to Georgia and do not represent our values. I will do everything I can to make sure you do not serve a 2nd term.
So Mr. Purdue who will pick all the onions and Georgia now
David for Senate Majority Leader
David for unemployment this bill will hurt Georgia in the long run we have tried this before with a bad outcome look at history
#RACISTAct is dead in the water, just like you in 2020. This and the yes vote on #healthcarebill #yourtoast
Good for you now how about hillary, lynch, powell, rice, comey, etc and what about ending Muller due to conflict of interest with comey
Green cards = H1b visas on steroids, a gift to companies undercutting skilled Americans w lower-paid immigrants,
& a dog-whistle to whites!
Thank you for your efforts @sendavidperdue! #MAGA
You should be ashamed of yourself. Now only people YOU and your racist friends can pick and choose who comes in. Disgusting.
How about a town hall meeting with your constituents to see how they see this?
Well Done @sendavidperdue! Great piece of legislation solid on merits/principles.
Agreed..
Your nationalistic and xenophobic ideas are short-sighted at best and will not fare you well. #NoBanNoWallNoRaids 
http://www.newamericaneconomy.org/feature/an-open-letter-from-1470-economists-on-immigration/ …
How about talking to constituents instead of orange orangutans?
Nooooooo! WTF - I'm embarrassed to live in Georgia.  You have really sunk to a new low. What are trying to do, tie Trump for idiocy?
Shame! This is anti-legal immigration idea is wholly un-American & doesn't represent values of Georgians-immigrants built this country
David Perdue is a disgrace to the human race.
We pray for you everyday. God bless you.
#DumpDavid #RAISEAct
Skilled labor is not everything. This act will rage a war on Georgian and Southern farmers! Who's going to pick the peaches and pecans?
Meanwhile Senator, the wheels are coming off at the WH. Don't you think it's time someone called an intervention? You? Hello? HELLO?
Immigration already favors skilled and scrappy. Admitting families ensures a support system for success.
Senator, you are nothing but an empty suit.  Your continued love affair with Trump is gonna haunt- in 2018 you will be minority;  2020 gone
BTW, guess you gave up GOP for fascism.  You and your boyfriend, Don, belong together. @TurnGABluePAC
Just wondering if your immigrant family background would have qualified.
Thanks for taking the time to explain how you're a garbage person. I'm RAISE-ing my middle finger in salute to you!
Who's Trump going to hire to work at his hotels & that God awful winery? Were those people in the truck going to be Trump employees?
#Resist
One more bigoted, racist policy. Congrats. Than I never pass u fool. SHAME
Hope u r tweeting 2 Perdue & Trump. The racists are the three in the video!
I’m sorry answer your damn phones clean your voicemail – and start listening to your constituents, instead of worrying about ridiculous crap
GREAT JOB
COMMONSENSE BACK IN AMERICA
I trust we'll be seeing you and Senator Cotton chiseling the new "merit" requirements on the Statue of Liberty any day now.
Sad day for America. "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free" -Just kidding! Only if they speak English
Typical GOP bs
As a citizen & constituent from an immigrant family, I'm appalled. This is xenophobic, ignorant, & will hurt economy. Diversity = strength.
I absolutely support this new legislation. it is EXACTLY what immigration law should be in this country. Thank you, Senator Perdue.
i'll hang up and listen
Thanks a lot for your leadership and this is the best thing that has happened to the legal community in a very very long time.
3. had a chance to be successful. Please reconsider how you have crafted this bill. Lives depend on it.
2. all 8 of their kids to some of the most prestigious schools in the northeast. If your proposed law was in place, we never would have
1 My grandparents were immigrants. They came here with nothing, hoping for an opportunity to build a better life. And they did. They sent
This bill goes against America's core principals and discriminates against lower-income, LEGAL immigrants who are not white. SHAME.
Thank you ! 
Do you not understand that Trump will never sign a bill that keeps him from hiring all of the low-wage immigrants he uses at his golf clubs?
Cutting immigration was 1st proposed by Harry Reid, Barbara Jordan, President Clinton, & the Sierra Club.

@Perduesenate is on solid ground!
You are a fool and most of GA doesn't support this harmful and stupid bill. We WILL vote you and Trump out in 2020. Sincerely, ~Blue GA
Immigrants are not the enemy. Xenophobic and hateful old white men like you are.
RAISE act is nothing but RACIST act! Won't pass!
Wow u got to do the emperors & stand with him. Must have fulfilled life time dream. By the way immigrants & refugees are not on welfare
Senator you are an embarrassment to our great state.
Labor Sec should have done WH Press Conf not fake news Stephen Miller. Will proposed eng pref exempt Kushner Chinese only speaker investors?
Thank you for this!  Keep working hard...we need talented/educated immigrants.
Meet with your DAMN CONSTITUENTS.  You are not above US!
Where is the #TermLimits bill? That would help Trump's claim to drain the swamp. Career politicians need to go! Oh, over 50 need not run.
This bill don't have any points for work experience so how this is skill/merit based immigration?
Can you let me know the evidence for this? Policy should be based on facts, not general impressions. Don't insult our intelligence.
THANKYOU FOR THE RAISE ACT, IT WILL BE GOOD FOR ALL.
Time to change the motto. 
Oh, look. Three of the most un-American, racist jack-offs in the country.
Your policies are cruel & un-American.
David Perdue I was wondering what you were doing . Good job you got my vote again THE FLAGMAN .
Hey, look, David Perdue wants skilled immigrants to take American jobs. I guess his cronies will be able to pay them less than Americans.
Thank you! #MAGA
Trump allowed in 15,000 more skilled worker visas than Obama. I guess Americans can apply for the bottom unskilled jobs.
Thank you Sen Perdue for putting Americans FIRST 
Speaking of Australia.  Trump likes their healthcare:
what is ur family history? did they speak english? did they have an education? a job?  ur are ALL liars and cheats.. this is disgraceful
Perdue, you clearly have hitched your wagon the the Trump train wreck.  I urge you not to blindly follow him off the cliff.
Bad bill. We should be increasing the number of people coming here legally who can be self sufficient, not decreasing. You're a biz guy?
Money!  12 pts given if they invest $1.8M.
David you look like a racist up there ..I can’t wait to vote you out .. you do not represent my beliefs or most in dekalb county.
Wow.  If corp is willing to pay 200x median income they get 8 pts. This clearly means that money buys you entrance to the US.  300x = 13 pts
15 points for being an Olympic athlete?  How is that "responsive to the needs of our economy?"  How does running fast grow the US economy?
Points given by age: 26-30 most w/ 10 pts.  Ages over 51 get 0 pts.  Can we add that point system to elected officials?  Over 51 not wanted!
Very wisely cut the clip before Trump spoke!  He is a YUGE failure.
What Is The RAISE Act? Trump's Newest Immigration Legislation Is Dangerous & Inhumane
One chart reveals everything that’s wrong with Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant outcry http://read.bi/2f80VzK  via @businessinsider
WATCH: Trump Introduces GOP Bill Limiting Immigration to People Who 'Speak English' – Even Fox News Not on Board
Thanks to Sen. Perdue,Sen. Cotton and Pres. Trump...for putting American workers, taxpayers...first.
Another reason why the CEO of a company has no business in Congress. That's not how government works.
Thank you Senators! America first! Limited immigration of only the best applicants.
So glad my senator is smart! Yes to the RAISE Act!
Smart. my foot, His bill don't have points for work experience so how come it's merit / skill based immigration bill?
This will destroy Georgia's economy. @GovernorDeal, I hope you're paying attention

These #s. Trump dropping with whites, with men, with whites with no college degree: disapprove 50 % to 43% approve https://twitter.com/QuinnipiacPoll/status/892796139233316864 …
The guy who shut down Pillowtex after 9 months, walking away with $1.7m while 7650 people lost their jobs, thinks immigrants are the problem
They are for millions of low wage "American " workers.
I see Traitor Tom up there!
#TrumpCON Mar a Lago files H-2B Visas for ADDITIONAL Foreign Workers. GREEDY CORPORATIONS CONTINUE LOW WAGE SLAVERY.
Recent immigrants are smarter than Americans in 26 states. @TheEconomist. Know the facts
But you oppose the efforts of our EdSecy to make improvements?
Thank you @sendavidperdue @SenTomCotton & @POTUS! Why would we let those who are skilled go to other countries, while we fill welfare rolls?
Senator, this will hurt Georgia! We need workers for our farms! Please put state priorities and American values over party platform!
Your support for @realDonaldTrump and this so-called immigration bill is appauling!!  U R a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot
We want ZERO new immigration.
Going from 200m in the 70s to 300m today is 50% increase.
Paying illegal aliens to build America 4 foreigners.
The next time you swing thru Buckhead to p/u $, stop and meet w/ constituents. We have some concerns about your job performance.
I judge you by the company you keep. You & your cohorts are awful people with awful ideas & awful motivations & most of the country agrees.
Bravo Pres. Trump, @sendavidperdue, and Sen. Cotton!
As one of your constituents, shame on you for standing with Trump on such an anti-American piece of legislation.Your constituents in GA hate
@POTUS @VP @SecretaryCarson @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @brandondarby @Reuters @UPI @AP @bbc @cnn @cbs @nbc @abc @msnbc
You are just another empty suit, Potemkin Perdue.
Please get a new job.
Thank you Senator Perdue!
With all due respect, Senator, you're delusional. This has nothing to do with the economy. It's unAmerican. #Immigration built this country.
Including forced #Immigration.
Indeed 
Thank you!!!
Thank you Senator Perdue for your efforts on this bill.
Very good System and It need to be implemented very soon.
You really are a horrid man
Gotta give credit to the GOP where it is due: they make crystal clear their hatred and disdain for anything not white male.
How exactly is this a race issue?
Thank you for your work on this much needed legislation and your service to the citizens of Georgia and America.
You're a horrible person
This will hurt Georgia farmers you know. Didn't Sonny tell you?
