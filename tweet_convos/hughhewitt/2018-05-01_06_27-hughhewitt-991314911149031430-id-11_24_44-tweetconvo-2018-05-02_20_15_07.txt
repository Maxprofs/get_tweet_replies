2/ It's pp. 15–19 of the transcript (https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/17-965_i86b.pdf …), and at the audio recording's 11:50 mark (https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2017/17-965 …).
3/ Kudos to Justice Kagan for presenting the question as a thinly-veiled hypothetical, avoiding outright accusations of bigotry against the president while acknowledging the very real risk of what could happen. A blunt, serious, thoughtful line of questioning.
4/ And kudos to SG Francisco for answering her questions directly, thoughtfully, seriously. He pressed back against the implication that President Trump's orders embody bigotry, but he didn't dance away from the questions and acknowledged the limits of the gov's position.
5/ P.S. The 2015 case I had in mind as the most interesting recent S.Ct. moment was Obergefell, when Justice Alito asked SG Verrilli about tax-exempt status for traditional religious groups. 

Verrilli's answer: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

(I'm paraphrasing Verrilli, not quoting him.)
Might also be the dumbest thing I’ve heard in a court room.
law isn’t supposed to be decided on hypotheticals.
Would you prefer "analogies?"
I’d prefer they follow the laws as they are written.
I’d rather not have the constitution analyzed by a hypothetical that the American voters will never let happen!
I’d rather they leave politics outside the fucking court room.
Thank you
Exactly! Hypotheticals were dealt in debate before the law was passed. It isn’t a judges role to re-litigate, but to interpret the laws already written...NOT rewrite them!
You're right. It's not the judge's role to re-litigate. It's the litigator's.

Another thing that struck me was that we still have a branch of government capable of civil discourse. They could politely and logically disagree. We have lost that in the legislative and executive branches.
We have. Congress under the Kenyan forgot how the branches interact when functional. The Mongrel's Pen & Phone, u know. POTUS is shutting down their grift and corruption. They will all be defeated. Cornered beasts.
I block trolls and bots before I respond to them. 
LOL
So every democrat saying things like white privilege should never vote an anything negative or perceived negative involving Anglo's. Interesting argument they make. We should start pointing this out.
Attacking voters for their perceived views, instead of holding politicians accountable for the views they express, is a losing strategy, so keep it up. It's your white privilege to do so.
Justice Kagan confuses concern with Islamic terrorism with religious bigotry. It’s strange that she lacks the ability to make the distinction. And her hypothetical would be much more informative if we had a major problem with Jewish terrorism.
Isn't it relevant that we were actively fighting in a war against the "Islamic State" at the time? If we were actively fighting in a war against the "Jewish State"...
So the Surpreme Court is fishing for ways to use "in his hearts of hearts" as grounds for a legal ruling?

Good God.
No. As @HowAppealing can attest, clearly the most fascinating Supreme Court exchange since 2002. https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/2002_10_01_appellateblog_archive/#85541204 …
