I'm over Mitt Romney. Nothing he can say at this point can repair the damage he's done to himself. He should take up fly fishing, or kite flying, get out of politics.
Romney is a swamp dweller. Like all politicians, he says what he thinks we want to hear. However, his career doesn't match his rhetoric. 

We learned everything we need to know about Romney when he didn't take advantage of Obama when he had the chance in 2012.
Which makes Romney’s vicious attacks and blatant efforts of sabotage against Trump that much more egregious! Poor judgement. Don’t elect him
Bugs me about Romney and other politicians.The “call to serve “Going to DC and being a power player is the only way to serve.There are other and probably better ways to serve .If that were their goal.Sorry to vent.Thanks for trying to understand the guy
Romney has chameleon like credibility.
OLD: I traveled to Utah to get information for another political hit piece on a conservative for @CNN. Here’s what I made up using anonymous sourcing, conjecture and out of context quotes to slander another person with an (R) next to their name.
Nothing burger, nothing on immigration , border security, opioid epidemic, jobs,  infrastructure or foreign policy.
You went to Utah & still think Romney has a “virtual lock”? Did you talk to any voters?
Excellent article! Bottom line ... @MittRomney would shake things up in the Senate, which is exactly what we need! #UTSen  #TeamMITT   America it’s time to replace #ObamaCare
He will lose
Dr. Kennedy will beat this snake. @MittRomney is lower than a worm.
If his political career were over as he says, he wouldn't be running for the GOP Senate nomination in Utah. @MittRomney just go away.
