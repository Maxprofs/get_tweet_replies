Goldilocks should have stuck with the three bears!
Book sounds very interesting Hugh and Jake.   For my next airplane ride!
Why be offended over wolf telling the truth. Pres. Spank stated, "Grab em by the Pus-- and mocked a handicap person, and insulted a gold star family, and is a habitual liar. Stop the hypocracy as this doesnt pass the smell test.
The mere fact that someone like this was selected to speak, stains the entire press corps who would choose to attend this event.  This was no surprise act - a few minutes googling the comedian would have provided the average media member the knowledge of what would occur.
Until the attendees stand up and threaten to boycott, or just stop buying tickets, the stain will be on all of you.  It's why the average American can't stand the press - and deservedly so.
Well done Hugh. Who scheduled this so-called comedian and did they review her script? Oh, and Eck will always be a former Red Sox pitcher to us here in Boston!
Iran must go The area’s biggest problem
Wolff an absolute disgrace !!
Israel strikes Iranian targets, and in America feigned indignation and theatrical hyperbole over a comedy routine continues.
You want, too much, to be liked by this crowd.  Wolf was there because the audience (media) wanted her there, and they laughed at every single one of her diatribes.  They agreed with everything she said.  She is them, they are her.  She just said what they couldn’t say.
