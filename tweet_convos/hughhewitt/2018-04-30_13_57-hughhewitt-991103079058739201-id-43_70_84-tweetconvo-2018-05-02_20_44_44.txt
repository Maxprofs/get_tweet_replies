No brief for Iran, Eli. But here's the thing. once a nation's scientists know the how to on the nuclear issue, you can't expunge it from their brains or files. Sorry, just don't see what all the shouting is about. Of course Iran has the knowledge to produce a nuke in the future.
What about the implication for the NPT? If verified, shouldn’t he IAEA update us on Iran’s nuclear weapons program? Agreed you can’t unlearn. But preserving the designs etc... suggests intention too.
IAEA has already reported all this stuff. See @ArmsControlWonk thread
I don’t know. If the Israeli claim is verified, then it seems like there is a lot of material for western agencies to comb through. It also would be a way of verifying, filling in holes, etc..  how much work was done after 2003?
Yes. But the key question is what has been done between 2015,and now. Unless you believe that Iran is concealing an entire parallel nuclear infrastructure unknown to the world.
If the #Israelis really had new intel Bibi would have said it not recycled all this old stuff. Fact is Trump is violating @TheIranDeal.
Do you want the UN to sanction his twitter account?
Lol
BS and you know it. Old ‘news’
You’re not troubled that Iran preserved the capability? That it repeatedly lied to the IAEA?
All known and expected given the unreliability of US an unremitting hostility of Israeli right wing
Honestly asking: does preserving capability knowledge or lying to IAEA violate the deal?
The only thing they lied about is whether they were working towards a nuke in the past. 

We knew that in 2015 and let them get away with the lie in order to garner peace. Seeing as the rest of the agreement didnt need their truth to be upheld. We have full access.
Everyone with knowledge of the hows and wherefors is watched and accounted for. Every program structure is investigated and watched.

Uranium/plutonium doesnt enrich itself, it is a large undertaking. They literally cannot hide it.

This is stupid.
Eli what do you think the US should do to stop rogue state Israel––which, unlike Iran, hasn't signed the NPT and doesn't acknowledge it has a nuclear program at all?
Stop trying to start wars, Eli. We've been over this
Good thing Israel hasn't developed a covert nuclear program.
Wow, can you imagine if a country in  the middle East secretly developed nuclear weapons without UN approval?
And Iran has already paid a huge price through sanctions. When will Israel come clean on deceiving @iaeaorg ?
When will Iran pay  for all the US military veterans who lost limbs and suffer TBI’s from IED’s they provided to Iraqi “insurgents”?
When will the U.S. pay for selling chemical weapons to Reagan and Rumsfeld's dear friend Saddam Hussein that were used to kill hundreds of thousands of Iranians?
US sold chemical weapons to Reagan?
No, the friend of Reagan and Rumsfeld, Saddam, he was the one to receive the worst weapons in human history and went on to murder hundreds of thousands of Iranians with our unwavering support.
They both used chemical weapons. Russia was supplying Iran. Bad history for both superpowers. Hope it never happens again. People need to overthrow all their dictators and we need to raise hell when our leaders want to take us into another unjust war.
"Call the number on the bottom of the screen to order your own propagandist war materials today! We provide old intelligence from over a decade ago you can have in the background as you sell intervention around the globe. Hurry now supplies are limited!!"
Hmmm. Reminds me of when Netanyahu presented a compelling argument that Iraq was close to having nuclear weapons & encouraged the West to invade them. But I'm sure he isn't lying this time round...
Gearing up to sell another war? Nice dude
Keep it up Eli. If we get out a war out of this, we’ll be that much closer to exposing your lies. Sadly, it will cost thousands of American lives, not that you care #IranDeal #bibilied
Wow, judging by the comments here you are losing this info war. How does that feel?

::absurdly huge splash::

new article up on bloomberg everyone! check it out!

israel exposes nothing you clown egg
Netanyahu is NOT trustworthy. This is a lie
Btw when will we find out of Israel s illegal nuclear weapons?
Israel exposed Iraq’s WMD.  Still looking for it.
Our intelligence services seem to be lacking....I guess they are too busy gathering intelligence on the opposition party rather than those countries that would do us harm?

Historical context for today's Netanyahu presentation in English, explicitly directed at Trump, on Iran. In 2002, he told the U.S. Congress "If you take out Saddam, Saddam's regime, I guarantee you that it will have…
Israel should focus on gunning down Palestinian teens who throw rocks.

I hope the IDF are hunted by their victims for the next 70 years like the NAZIs were.
“There is no question whatsoever that Saddam is seeking and is working and is advancing towards the development of nuclear weapons – no question whatsoever,” Netanyahu said on September 12, 2002.
Have you ever been right... about anything?
Wrong.
Ahh yes , everyone got it wrong except Israel.  Zionists want war-Christians going to have to fight and die for them.
We should preemptively bomb any middle eastern country that gets a nuke
It's OK, he didn't really expect that anyone believed him...
oh shit did israel find the WMD’s?
Here’s an idea, quit your job
Kim could have flipped on Iran, maybe at Pompeo meeting.
Israel with its own illegal nuclear weapons program that isn't inspected is rich complaining about someone whose program is inspected. What b/s.
One could rephrase your quote:
"Israel exposes Iran's nuclear lies, and the limits of U.S. intel "
to form a more accurate statement:
"𝐈𝐬𝐫𝐚𝐞𝐥 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐔.𝐒. 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐥 𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐬"
Sure sure terror apologist keep retweeting lies .
Be nice to U.S. intel, they have a lot of assets tied up spying on Republicans.
Oh come on nobody actually believes anything from Bebe or Trump at this point . Talk about the creators of “fake news”.
I think that the U.S Intel let it slide to make Obama happy...
Ah yes, that neutral observer Israel. I'm sure they have no reason to lie and trump up charges.
You know it's possible that Kerry told the truth about absolute knowledge of Iran's programme. Maybe his hatred for Israel &Bibi meant he wanted the deal to sabotage Israel. Just wondering.
>Israel exposes

jeez
@AnshelPfeffer FYI
@EliLake - sincere question: is possession of these materials in violation of the JCPOA?
If so, then I follow your logic. 
If not, isn’t this part of the risk implicit in the deal (good and bad)?
