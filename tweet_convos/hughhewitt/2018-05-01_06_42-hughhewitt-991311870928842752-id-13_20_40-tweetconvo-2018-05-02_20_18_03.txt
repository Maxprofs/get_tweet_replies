Informative interview. To understand how senior leaders think, evaluate their landscape of responsibility, make recommendations, and come to decisions was worth the every minute...twice...and he’s a fellow Yinzer.
thanks. Really good discussion
Do you think Clapper is a man of honor?
Do you think Brennan is a man of honor?

The fact that Hayden stands with them tells me everything I need to know about him.
Evidence. You seem to be oblivious to some evidence because you dash right past it so you can pat yourself and MH on the back because you're "the adults in the room".   We know James Comey lied and it now seems that John Brennan lied.  And there's no "deep state"?  Self-delusion.
That title should be: "The Search for Intelligence."
If there was FISA abuse it has to be because Bush/Hayden did not ensure adequate protections for political targeting of citizens.
I'm confused on the FSB/Wikkileaks reference. I'll try harder.
"Inner Circle and Chance the Gardner" lovely absolutely lovely.
The consequences, legal and political, for breaking "norms" on pushback are not excused by "doing it the first time."; especially after taking the position to allow the collusion accusation to run its course. All that needed to be done was to treat the server issue legally.
Hayden needs to be in prison.
Wow,haden  part of swamp, had no problem with Comey not telling trump.hillary paid for dossier
You aren’t exactly unbiased about the Potus.... so no thanks!
