Deterrence with a not so secret weapon called PowerPoint
Psychological warfare at its finest
Of course not, that’s why he presented his ‘evidence’ in English. Fox News viewers hate subtitles.
He could've erased all doubts and spoke in Farsi
The Israelis wouldn't spoon-feed a message to the IRGC like this. It appears personally tailored for Trump.
Ridiculous. You really think @netanyahu would hide info like this from @POTUS ? The display is that @POTUS44 ignored ALL this! Wake up people!.
Not to mention Trump probably already saw it, as did the Europeans. This would explain why the Euros were making "we can make some adjustments to the deal" noises all last week.
Just thinking the same. If those cowboys from Mossad snatched 1 ton of papers from Iran and got out safe...not exactly the best security in Tehran:)
Doing business w/IRGC just got scarier?
you must be joking to think the timing of releasing this BS information has nothing to do with trump May 12th decision. The boy who cried wolf is at it again.
…what’s wrong with addressing the U.S. given we’re key to exiting the Iran deal?
Sow the seeds of paranoia. It will be fun to watch.
CNN's @JohnKingCNN @OKnox @jpaceDC @abbydphillip repeating the audience of ONE narrative.
So why in English?
Its a lesson to evry Israel enemy. We will go anywhere and do all the impossible. Remember Antebe, Uganda?
hell yeah those guys (mossad) are tough
Totally Agree.  Obviously @POTUS has known about these developments in real time. Totally ridiculous to say @netanyahu threw this out on intl TV and the @cia didn't know.......Right @CIA?
Maybe #Netanyahu can accidentally run into trump in the #Seychelles 
It seems to be the pre war destination for oligarchs  authoritarians  & #blackwater contractors 
Intent on starting a war
A dose of #whataboutism, Michael: What about #Nasrallah's promise to "storm Galilee & being Galilee", & what about his intention to use #Haifa's ammonia tanks as #Hezbollah's nuke?! #Israel #Lebanon
Exactly. This was a message to Iran and the world. We will go into the heart of Teheran if need be. Do not fuck with us.
What if material isn't from Iran
No messin is there, giving up his intelligence in the facilities for Trump, knowing the iran deal paramount
Iran is already 'at war'.
