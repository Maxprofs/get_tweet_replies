From @JacksonDiehl | Taiwan seems to be benefiting from Trump’s presidency. So why is no one celebrating?
From @EJDionne | The steep price of the Trumpian circus
From Robert J. Samuelson | There’s a genuine solution to our health-care problem
From @hughhewitt | Michelle Wolf’s performance at the White House correspondents’ dinner: What a fail
From @timkaine | Congress must take away Trump’s unlimited authority to wage war
@michelleisawolf was BRILLIANT!  You’re such a hypocrite to criticize Michelle but not hold @POTUS to the same standards.  Nothing Michelle Wolf said was inaccurate of this administration and she even used words this President has used.
Worth mentioning that Hugh's son works for the administration that was being insulted. To put it another way, if the federal government ran a sweepstakes, @hughhewitt would be ineligible to win any prizes.
Straw man. Good one.
Interesting that Trump supporters would ever think anything was off limits
25 killed in Afghan bombing. Israel strikes Iranian targets. Stop with the feigned indignation and theatrical hyperbole over the comedy routine already. Pickup an extra box of Kleenex if you still have the need to whine about the WHCD.
Interesting that the party that calls liberal snowflakes whenever they protest against political correctness or name calling are getting so weak kneed at some jokes
Wolf called out Sanders for lying, something missed by wolf's critics. For some people they want more than I haven't spoken to the president or I will comeback to you.
Hugh Hewitt is a hack snowflake.
You think this is worse than Pres. Spank saying, "Grab em by the Pu---." He mocked a handicap person, He insulted a gold star family. Wolf told the truth. Pres. Spank is a pig and deserves no respect.
I assume you weren't listening.

Sensitive Trumpanzee morons supposedly traumatized by #MichelleWolf #GOPHypocrisy @SHSanders45 @JudgeJeanine @IngrahamAngle #MuellerTime

No more cocktails. They hate you almost as much as they hate the rest of us.
"Is it really impossible to find some president of intelligent disposition who can elevate a country rather than leave it trashed and stained?"
I shall lend you my fainting couch. #MichelleWolf
Aw you poor, silly little snowflake
in truth the failure was on the current #WHCD President for selecting her!  @edhenry as a former VP of this organization this falls on the leadership of the Organization. #travesty #beyongthepale
