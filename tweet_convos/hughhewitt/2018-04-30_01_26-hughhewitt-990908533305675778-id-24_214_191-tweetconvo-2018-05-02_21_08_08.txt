It's a good thing Trumpsky has brought everlasting peace to the Middle East..
Itâ€™s a good thing Barry gave Iran 1.9 Billion to further their cause.......
Jim... wise up, please. No one can bring peace. But I commend you on your long lasting Trump derangement syndrome... itâ€™s staggering.
It start with the writings of islam, contrary to the 10 commandments of the REAL GOD
The Problem is not Islam the is the United States will help both sides Otherwise Why America can not kill a small group like the Taliban?Because he does not want
when  a belief system has it written that it is a holy thing to kill the believers of a different faith, That is a very big problem and contradict the 10 commandments God gave to Moses for the whole world to live by, That IS going to create multiple layers of very bad problems
May God be with them. I truly hope the president mentions their names, one by one. They deserve to be acknowledged for the good works that they do. And all of the prisoners I pray for them that are journalists also.
Let me guess. Deep State CIA MOSSAD False Flag attack. Again.
All in the name of god smfh
We have a President that is constantly bashing journalists, not realizing what a dangerous job it can be.  They bring the real news. America lost one today.
To NBC the fact the bomb in Afgh killed  7 urinalists is more news worthy than the fact that it killed 11 others and injured 41.
Very Sad

Liar. clinton has already been investigated. Therefore you murdered those people.
HOW MANY #HEARTS & MINDS HAS #AMERICA 'WON' IN THE MIDDLE EAST SINCE 9/11 #MadDog @DeptOfDefense @TheJointStaff? NONE! Isn't It Interesting That The @WhiteHouse Puts @Iran on The #MuslimBan List, But Fails To Put Their #PIMPS From #SaudiArabia Who Did Attack #US on 9/11 @JoeNBC!
Hey #Mattis, Did You Hear The News From The @UN That Ever Since The War Began In #Afghanistan In 2001 & Every Year Since, The @UN Reports RECORD HIGHS For SLAUGHTERING INNOCENT #AFGHAN CIVILIANS & That 2017 Has Been The WORSE Year So Far For KILLING Afghan Civilians @AshrafGhani
The NO-WIN WAR Going Into Its #EIGHTEENTH YEAR, In Which The WARMONGERS on @TheHill Continue To Support Even Though Our #US Troops Are Being SLAUGHTERED Along With #Afghan Citizens! @WhiteHouse @StateDept @USUN @NSAGov @DHSGov!
Quit distracting from gun murders
I can already hear the wardrums beating. more intervention, more soldiers. just wait for the MIC shills to appear.  its time to #ripthebandaid off of afghanistan. they pose no threat to the USA, and the war has been an abject failure, as this attack indicates.
Those pesky Amish again?
