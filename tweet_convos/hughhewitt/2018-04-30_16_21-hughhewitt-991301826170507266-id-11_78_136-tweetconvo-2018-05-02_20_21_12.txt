"Mossad always impresses" --@GenMhayden to me just now, in wide ranging interview about @realDonaldTrump, fmr FBI Director Comey, the war over facts and much more.  Audio/transcript to post asap.

I think Soleimani would likely consider that procedure Haram.
Netanyahu would consider it non-Kosher.
Nope. He's likely about as religious as Bill Maher. You can't possibly compare Israel, a country with gay pride parades, a female former PM, (Golda Meir) a European drinking age, a mixed gender army, decrimminalized weed, and legalized prostitution to a theocracy like Iran.
Benjamin Netanyahu is a right wing Orthodox Jew. And what you mentioned is just low standards and already exists in countries like Turkey. So yeah Israel is more liberal than a theocracy than Iran. Congratulations.

Can't wait for the movie

Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Qods Force, says Iran will "erase the Zionist entity, and we will dedicate every moment of our lives to this task." (Maariv) 
Nice.
