@SenateDems @SenateFloor I'll Show #PhonziSheme #ShowUsTheBill Really Was Up Close & Personal Americans Stupid Huh?
I Want Every @SenateDems & @GOP To Stop Arguing Over This #Obamacare #Healthcare Tax It Was A Lie Right Out The Door
What are trying to hide?  DEATH WARRANTS!
Which did the Democrats use when they passed Obamacare without reading the bill? Jonathan Gruber said we weren't smart enough...remember...
"You have to pass it to find out whats in it..." @SenateDems = clueless. Wait to midterms when they get crushed (again) #Trumpcare
What is the @SenateDems plan to fix Obamacare? Complaining about rooms? #Obstructionists #TrumpCare They really dont get why they lost lol
After the way the catastrophe known as Obama care was passed, a tweet and retweet like this couldnt have any less credibility. #Trumpcare
go knock and open the door you r US Senators and represent us "damn the torpedos&fullspeed ahead"get ama aarp on board with you!
once the bill is shown & voted on, can Mitch be sneaky enough to switch it for a far worst bill without anyone knowing? #MarkIt
The AHCA and its contents!
I love  this!
@NancyPelosi famously said "We need to pass the bill to see what's in it." The Dems passed socialized HC w/o one Rep reading it
You have to pass it to see what's in it.
Do not let them take our healthcare without a fight!
Schumer smells like farts
They are meeting in secret   No diversity here, either
#HoldTheFloor #SaveOurCare Letter from American Academy of Pediatrics & 5 other groups on danger of this #AHCA bill: http://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/advocacy/coverage/aca/LT-SenLeader-OpposeAHCA-061517.pdf â€¦
We have to pass it to find out what's in it.
Insane
Y'all need to come together and withhold consent and do whatever else you can to slow the passage of this bill!
How many closets? How many restrooms? How many total stalls?Are the restrooms clean? Which restrooms have most stalls? Are the closets lit?
GOP is hiding everything  ! it just a game  to them ,they don't care if they'er destroying people's lives.. it just a win for them.
There's one prison cell in Leavenworth that has a sign: "Reserved for Menendez"
Our Country has gone to hell while ALL of u pout back & forth. So poor job performance. Your all fired. End of problem.
#WeThePeople Are #StrongerTogether And Are #TheResistance ! Liberals democrats independents republicans millenniums #stand together #resist
They Republicans are trying to hide their agenda to harm millions of Americans in order to overflow the coffers of the extremely rich.RESIST
Hidings seems to be the only thing the current Administration is qualified to do!
Y'all need to WITHHOLD CONSENT and grind all senate business to a HALT! Your constituents are HOLDING THE LINE & RESISTING - YOU must also!
Kind of like "We need to pass the bill [Obamacare] so we can see whats in it"

Sen Rep r going 2 blind-side us. They're covered 4 life & if their constit. knew what was cooking they'd b leaving the table.
Real stories = Big impact #AHCA could destroy our lives- pls share
You can't find the room they're in ??? DemonRats will be DRAINED from the SWAMP !!!
@GOP @SenateGOP know that #Trumpcare is bad for America. They need to STOP gambling with American lives. DEMAND TRANSPARENCY FROM @GOP!
What is the conference doing to stop passage when it inevitably comes up?
There's nothing that can be done if GOP gets 50 votes + Pence. Being done through budget reconciliation so no filibuster possible.
There is the amendment option if they decide to use reconciliation. From what I've read it seems like a viable option. No dem has mentioned.
.@SenateGOP .@SenateMajLdr .@senrobportman Psst...
I also remember all the hearings on Obamacare.  Remember you have to vote for it to know what's in it?
Try the full quote. Then explain how it excuses the Repubs actions

In the words of @NancyPelosi , you will see the bill when it passes.
Why you guy's hide obamacare youn got to pass it to know what's in it #lyingleft
THEY WANT TO PLAY,"HIDE THE BILL!"  "MARCO," "POLO." "NIGHT JOHN BOY," "NIGHT DONNIE TRUMP."    
It is time to #WITHHOLDCONSENT until they #ShowUsTheBill
I think all those rooms are booked with their backroom policies
- of course they're hiding TRUTH
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't YOU start working on your version?
Re: #ShowUsTheBill
Your approval isn't required. You weren't so forthcoming re: #Obamacare that you have room to make #Trumpcare demands.
You know, besides the 79 hearings that were held over the ACA.
You know, the ones that Republicans were locked out of. Say goodbye to #Obamacare. We're done subsidizing at the expense of our families.
If they were locked out of it how did they get amendments to the bill? You lying again?
The only amendment they got into the bill that remained, was rendering the IRS toothless at collecting the "fine". Do your homework.

A meme? Run along. You're done here. I could have done better on my computer.
Oh yeah, and way to turn down the partisan rhetoric!
If you think you will ride their evil Bond-villain-like behavior to victory,
your setting us all up for another disastrous election cycle.
Well, why don't you ladies and gentlemen start withholding consent for a bit, stop everything in its tracks.
Be patient, you'll see it. They can't pass it without showing you. Quit trying to stir the pot.
GOP working in secret to eliminate healthcare coverage,won't engage with constituents abou it and yet blame liberals for being shot at.
They are hiding the fact that they are in cahoots with the dnc slime against POTUS . You f' kers are busted !!!
What are they hiding??So, now the country is being run by a secret society?This is sad, very sad.
#ShowUsTheBill
NO SILENT BILL @SenateMajLdr @RepTomPrice @senrobportman @SenDeanHeller @lisamurkowski  @tedcruz @SenatorCollins @MikeLeeforUtah @RandPaul
They're trying to hide their AWFUL Healthcare plan from American Citizens until it's too late and they've pulled the trigger on us!
I don't know. We know see what u Dems were hiding with the ACA. That's why u passed it b4 reading it.

Guess they are stealing a play from Dems playbook. We have to pass the bill to see what is in the bill.....remember?
Remember the 79 hearings over ACA.
CALL YOUR SENATORS 202.224.3121 AND DEMAND OPEN HEARINGS ON #AHCA. THIS  AFFECTS EVERY SINGLE PERSON NO MATTER WHAT YOUR AGE IS.  RETWEET!!
I never heard u demand that if the Dems and the ACA. Why the change
Suggesting @SenateGOP hiding in closets?  If not, I am.  Come out of the closet. Some one would happily play "I'm coming out".
They really want to sign a BILL BEFORE THEY READ IT ! ALL THAT PHONEY BS ABOUT PELOSI - DEMS HAD HEARINGS !
