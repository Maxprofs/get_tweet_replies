@SenateDems it didn't bother you that Timothy Geithner didn't pay his taxes.
Thank you for standing up to the kleptocracy T's trying to install. Vote NO on #foreclosureMnuchin #Tillerson #DeVos 
#VoteNo
you have no problem questioning Republican nominees but r lacking when it comes to Clinton foundation discrepancies! Haiti
mote questions
The Treasury announcement re. US payments to Russia's FSB stinks to high heaven.  They hacked us.  Please check into this.
@SenateDems hey Bob, let's see you sponsor a bill doing just that. #willneverhappen
@NH92276 When will ask John Lewis to pay his $1 million in back taxes or Sharpton the  $4 million he owes.
Why do Trump defenders think "two wrongs make a right?" Didn't your parents teach you that's wrong?
@SenateDems Menendez, the very person indicted for corruption questioning legally claimed tax incentives. Is that a joke?
@SenateDems Senate Dems and Republicans claim all kinds of tax breaks/incentives. Maybe citizens want a closer look at that
PLEASE vote no on #RickPerry & #BetseyDeVos. Both completely unqualified; she will set education policy backwards
how come no one challenged him on his it was for non profit companies BS?!
@SenateDems '''Let Pompeo take his post at the CIA! Holding him up puts USA at risk!
America knows, America is not stupid. Why are Senators wasting their time talking to him?
no Americans are not that smart. Too many have been dumbed down.
Two questions.  1. is it legal? 
2. Who writes and votes for laws to be passed?
Are you meeting with this group next Tuesday?
Id like to hear you let  Mr. Mnuchin answer your questions without your butt hurt agenda cutting him off.
, YOU SAID GOOD AGAINST S. Mnuchin, LETS SEE MORE OF THAT WITH the Mic's open/ on.
@SenateDems like you did!  Lol pot calling kettle black
which is smart.. Because our taxes are out of control and wasted by people like you that don't budget or care
@SenateDems and the Democrats but those loopholes in the tax laws
Thank you. 
Why is our tax sit. such that people need to HIDE offshore accounts? Maybe because they feel they're being stolen from?
Can you explain hugging this group that killed americans on Dec? Or did I get it wrong?
your voters might want to know you hugged this group dec 9th.
I mean, most of the sitting body there avoids paying taxes whenever possible, so I don't get your point.
This prompted me to look him up.He was indicted for corruption. Hypocrite.
Reid is another one. People need to vote these ppl out. We really need term limits.
So who are the real takers? Who's REALLY on welfare? Red states would collapse w/out blue state money!
.@SenatorMenendez @TraciLN1164 He's a very sick man. Just look at his full body twitches and facial (mouth) tics. Tourettes? Neurosis? OCD?
it happens when they catch you at stealing from foreclosures.  The "foreclosure king"
Who wrote that law and passed it?
"Another fox to guard the hen house"! God be with US. Amen.
are you meeting with this group again tomorrow??
please do not vote to confirm #Devos Save public education!
aren't US citizens taxes on worldwide income? If you're right, it's a crime. Strong accusation.
thank you for clarifying that. I think too many people actually would buy his gibberish.
@DearAuntCrabby mnuchinneeds to go fight like hell
@DearAuntCrabby liar liar oants on fire
it's also not against the law
You should know about off-shore activities that avoid detection Bob. Had any underaged girls while offshore lately Bob?
@bluedillygal thank you for representing the people we here in NJ have been suffering with Christie and still are
Hey genius, it is his fiduciary (ie, legal) responsibility to minimize taxes for clients. U don't pay more than u have to
As your constituent I ask you say NO to Mnuchin and Tillerson, Senator. And great job on the questioning!
you are a baby waaa waaa waaa
Say no
and you are under investigation for misappropriating funds #potmeetkettle #getoveryourself
@DonCheadle Not that simple, bureaucrat! It's always more than meet the eyes in high-end financial advisory!
@GovernorShehata your being investigated for corruption or did you forget...shut uo and sit down
That was pretty sexy
@SimmoneFrank ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
Your buddy still in jail? http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/04/menendez_friend_indicted_on_medicare_fraud.html …

Let me make this simple: you took his money and helped him scam medicare
Did you pay taxes on the hundreds of thousands you received in bribes? #Crook. #TypicalDemocrat
@SenateDems Why blame the people who use the loophole filled system u are responsible for. Your problem is in the mirror.
How's your corruption charges going? #hypocrite
Glad you are my Senator
Go Bob Go! But not to inauguration.
@Millenniumistic    Get em!!!!   No more corporate traitors..I pay taxes..so should they
@DonCheadle
@SenateDems questions to you all; Have you ever stated you're not paying enough taxes? If no, why not, & did you pay more?
@SenateDems Bob, you having issue with ethics issues is pretty funny. 1 question; Did he act within three law? Yes. #Shhhh
@SenateDems Please vote against confirming Mnuchin
Please vote no and make sure he does,not get confirmed. He is smug and has helped destroy this country to benefit himself
@frankdugan a common theme w/ this administration
@frankdugan Of course it was.
Make your detention heard!  Protest the inauguration by not attending.  #ivote2018 #Notmypresidenttrump
I hope you consider joining more than 50 brave House Dems who are boycotting tomorrow's inauguration.
No vote, not qualified #Unqualified Check Russian ties too #TheResistance #TrumpRussianTies #FBI
Like u are so honest:
Gee, Senator Bob.Someone should put a stop to these practices. Maybe you should legislate so they're not, uh, legal?
u da man. Tell it like it is.
@Here_ISound_Off if it's too complicated, perhaps he should recuse himself now.
I also believe companies that invest in off shore accounts are exactly "AVOIDING TAXES" a privilege reserved 4 the rich
@DonCheadle so they don't have to pay taxes
"Your college roommate......" Gosh! Was there ever a rhetorician to match you? Booowahahahaha!
http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/menendez-loses-in-appeals-court-228127 …
@rolandsmartin I like Menedez!
@SenateDems Clearly Melendez is ignorant of financial ideology. Another representative that needs to reassess his values
kinda like EVERY company that moved to MEXICO through NAFTA #BlueDressSpoogeRape850kToPaulaJones
@PoliticalAnt 
Nice, what was his reply Sir? Don't just show us your good, show his good or bad.
Please.
@SenateDems Lazy Dems have not read The Fourth Floor by Ambassador Earl ET Smith! You should all be ashamed!!
@SenateDems Oye Robertico, shouldn't you be tweeting bout how CIA put FIDEL en ciudad La Habana? How did CIA "miss" 638X?
Apparently Sen Menendez has exp w/bankers bilking customers e.g. Isaias bros from Ecuador @SenatorMenendez @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump
@TimGuinee What other reason could there be?
your asking ethical questions and your going to jail, lmao
So now you are god and know everyone intentions
@ZeldaLackner Senator I hope you are not supporting any of these fast tracked nominees
You lost so shut up and vote Mnuchin thru!
if #Mnuchin was exploiting a legal loophole then he was living up to his fiduciary responsibilities to his clients.
@Lyn_Samuels And hide the money he made partnered w/MADOFF in that Ponzi Scheme.  People forget that. #TrumpLeaks
@SenateDems Rich people don't pay taxes. I pay taxes on my SS and small pension.
He owned u Bob. Know why? He's smarter.
@SenateDems Senator you are under federal indictment!! Get down from your soapbox because you are worse than Steve
@HighSierraMan What's up with the indictment?
Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law,or convicted.
Couldn't agree more which is why I asked the question. What's next? When?
duh!
@DonCheadle using laws you passed....mr. under indictment. ...
Mabey as a U.S Senator you should have fixed the tax laws that allow this to happen. How long have you been a Senator Mr. Menendez?
@rolandsmartin I'm gonna use his answer in response to the IRS when I don't pay my taxes this year
Your so tough.
Thank you Senator Menendez!! Please keep up the good work!
oh how bout you tell us how those charges against you went away? Hint - Benghazi hearings fed HRC screened questions
Artful Tax Dodger
@SenatorMenendez @LindaCollins11
@SenateDems Ain't that the truth!
...and then what happened?!?  Vote NO! No transparency, no vote. "It's complicated" is not a reason, regardless of party
OH I watched some of this.  He will fit right in to Trump's white house.  Never answered beat around bush.
Come on! The only way to address these things is to hire the experts and hold their feet to the fire. Current admin did not
@NH92276 Funny, you didn't seem to care Geithner didn't pay his taxes or Kerry avoiding Mass taxes for his yacht.
Respect Sen Menendez 
WHO ARE YOU TO GRILL ANYONE on ETHICS especially with all the skeletons in your closet
So when I take a deduction I am? Avoiding paying taxes! Who wants to put money in a Liberal sieve?
#FakeNews Let's remind the people of your record???? Shall we
Same as Sec Geithner! Selective outrage! Bottomline, he WILL be confirmed. Sit back and watch a real admin for once!
Thank You. #Mnuchin Is Storytelling Again!
Thank you for asking him the hard question. Sorry you didn't get a truthful answer.
Dems could have closed loopholes when had majority, it is tit for tat never in the people's favor. #bernie
@MoveOn Well....tax evasion is complicated. I'm sure Trump can teach him a thing or two.
@SenateDems You bet for that purpose!
the truth rocks! Thx Senator!
@SenateDems #Mnuchin 's a lying crooked smug  VOTE NO! No transparency & He won't make Trump adhere 2 Emoluments clause!
agree. But aren't the laws the problem, not the people taking advantage of them? #Mnuchin
@SenateDems Thuthe ethical stench of some of these cabinet choices is fouling the air here in small town Wisconsin.
What about Bob? Indicted for corruption. Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
trump should be arrested for treason and election rigging, not to mention rape and sexual assault
@SenateDems Thank you Senator!
don't let this shysters obfuscate their nefarious motives or their criminal results.  Expose these fraudsters
How can we accept him as president when the ELECTION WAS NOT ONLY RIGGED BUT TAMPERED/MANIPULATED/HACKED BY RUSSIANS ?!?!
How can we accept him as president when the ELECTION WAS NOT ONLY RIGGED BUT TAMPERED/MANIPULATED/HACKED BY RUSSIANS ?!?!
OMG the Russians! I would be more concerned with ISIS & N Korea
@SenateDems He wasn't clear. He said he'll simplify tax code but is the goal to make it easier to avoid taxes?
yes the tax code that u guy make so complicated & high..thats why people avoid it
His answer starts with " NOT necessarily": meaning he agrees!
@SenateDems and now with trump as president they will all get a tax free holiday. They will wire their earnings in ASAP
@SenateDems 
 keep fighting
#if we affirm mnunchin it's like letting the rats guard the cheese.
LOL, no. offshore is also about transaction speed and "re-tax", not avoiding taxes
Thank you for holding #Mnuchin up to the light. Please don't vote to confirm #DeVos - save public ed!
.@SenatorMenendez
.@FoxNews @stevenmnuchin1 @SenatorSessions What are U going to do about @SenPatRoberts offering CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES (VALIUM)in the Senate? 
vote NO, vote NO on DeVos. No more need to evaluate these two.
is a brilliant mind and asks GREAT questions during these hearings - If I lived in NJ I would def vote for him lol @CNN
