I don't know!   Let's ask @USRepRodney , who is voting YES, what the hidden magical cure is here!
Has Rep Frelinghuysen made a statement this morning?
He moved from "not sold" on constituent call Mon to "thinks it's moving in the right direction" Thurs...sounds like a yes
@SenateDems Not enuf being said about this. Dem PACs too silent.
#SenatorMenendez  B4 Obamascrare we had to buy insurance, didn't pay penalties, gov stay out of our lives.
@Peacepox DONT ALLOW THIS TO PASS!!
@stevenphillip
take those out and what's left? "Don't get sick, but if you do, die quickly".
NJ isn't bound by federal requirement. Can't they add those benefits if they want?
You are not for a free market system? What you are describing is a single payer cradle to the grave socialized medicine!
we shouldn't say the wealthiest get better, while the poor suffer and die. We are not a third world country
Ok so what is your brilliant idea to fix the disaster dubbed Obamacare?
so we are the richest nation but don't have healthcare for everyone, right? So make it universal, like many have
@HispanicCaucus #agetax not acceptable. @GOP and @DNC must do better for ALL 
turns out junk coverage can be cheap. who knew?
@SenateDems 
No essential benefits for us, but huge tax breaks for millionaires. HELL NO. #KILLtheBILL #SaveACA
@Nortar1163 thank you!!!
when's your next trip to Jeff Epstein's island?
@SenateDems that is such BS. Are you planning to get pregnant? Why do you need to pay for it?
And another brilliant comment from @harrydaytweet who thinks babies are delivered by storks, not doctors. @SenatorMenendez @SenateDems
Thanks.
Please get loud.
#carenotchaos 
#TheResistance
@SenateDems paying your penance? Maybe they need to bring more skeletons out of your closet.  Oh wait all of you Dems lie
@SenateDems  Agreed, we need Health benefits we can afford and that cover us w/o high cost,co-pays & deductibles.
They are called "essential" for a reason.
Why should we pay for things we cannot even use? I don't need pregnancy coverage.
this is the hurry up and die plan. #NoAHCA #NoTrumpCare #nodeathpannel
@GOP sheer arrogance 
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @OfficialCBC @TomPerez @IndivisibleTeam @DNC @womensmarch @TheDemocrats
Independent voter here Bob. I lost my insurance under the ACA and now have none because I can't afford it.
We would giving $ away to ins companies&not get any coverage at all for ANYTHING! @RepDennyHeck @sethmoulton
what good is this plan if it covers NOTHING?
Tax breaks for millionaires, what else?
@SenateDems Wouldn't it be a shorter list to list what the plan does cover?
@SenateDems I don't want insurance companies dictating my healthcare. Expand Medicare for everyone.
please stop this! if ACA fundamental   health care is taken away Ins companies will never make it affordable to people
.@SenatorMenendez fire insurance that doesn't cover fire damage.
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats 
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP,
Jesus, Mary, & Joseph! What a waste! Why pay for it if you can't use it?
@SenateDems Dear Senator, what does it cover? It maybe easier to show us these services. Thank You
You CHOSE chaos when you implemented the ACA in the first place. We are not buying what you're selling.
@SenateDems what good is health insurance without being able to afford to use it
@SenateDems Men dont need maternty & newborn care or pediatric services! I dont need substance use disordr services Y pay 4
@SenateDems vote NO! Fix the problems of the ACA but don't vote yes on a hastily written bill!
@SenateDems god what a mess we will have to clean up after all this
@SenateDems  thank you. Don't rush this through. Get it right.
what good is Obamacare if you can't afford it?
@SenateDems It's better than Obamacare, more choices for what a family needs not what's shoved down their throats!!
no it is not and look who wants to shove this hastily crafted ACA down on throats
sir,  I think govt should/not b in the insurance business. People need to choose, decided for themselves. #NOINSURANCE
@SenateDems What are your plans to fix healthcare?
Only Republicans could eliminate prescription drug coverage and spin it as "tackling opioid addiction"
yea if they were so concerned about a drug problem, they would offer more help, than prison time
license educated people. Only allowed! All Law. ARDCfrauds racketeering conspiracy charge. Jerome Lee hang dead
stop all! Unfair for frauds by license  working. To oversight trust in frauds by knowledge they are all unfit Â©
@SenateDems if its a tax cut for rich it has nothing to do with healthcare. This was the grossest cruelest lie @potus made.
the "tax cut for the rich" line is so 1990.
Old men don't need maternity benefits. Why make them pay for it?
@helenehrenhofer It's not, It's a life insurance policy that only kicks in when your on your death bed.
nj says support the republican plan - be a member of the USA MAGA
why do u insist to intrude into my #healthcare? fix #FlintWaterCrisis & #OrovilleDam first then come see me
Your?
and yours too
Has anyone tried to give them a lesson in Insurance 101. Because they don't seem to get the 1st thing about it.
What Good is Obamacare if the deductibles are so high you can't use it? All politics and more democrat lies senator
Excellent question.
