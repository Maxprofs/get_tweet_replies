my community stands w/refugees!
what about the illegal immigrants, Bob? and if they are fine as well, which other laws do we get so just skip over?
@SenSchumer Unless of course they are radical Islamic extremists that want to kill Americans.
thank you Senator!
Gotcha. Does trading political favors for cash & gifts help or harm the country? Asking for a friend...
@SenSchumer Thank you for representing ALL of us with dignity. Peace be with you.
do something
You really are not very smart are you. They're not immigrants, they are ILLEGALS.  Immigrants go thru America's process!!!
Menendez a  Demokkkrat still thinks he's living in an Obama bizarro world. Illegals are criminals Bob.
TIMES have changed, we are a country of citizens!


Help us Trump is insane.
Such a Christian like thing to put in writing. Can you sleep at night? How can you live with yourself?
I think that America was a great deal GREATER before the arrival of European immigrants. #INDIGENOUS
We the people need to send a strong message to the entire country and to the world and say "this is not who we are."
What? Protecting our borders?
Keep on fighting Bob!
I should defer to u as judge, jury and executioner??
All immigrants are not convicted criminals.
So build a $15B wall so Mexicans who want to go home can't? Then round them up 2 make an example?
Our immigrant ancestors came here legally.
You do not value the law.  The US allows one million legal immigrants each year.
Bill Clinton 1995 State of the Union immigration comments https://youtu.be/m3yesvvYEvs  via @YouTube
immigrant is the name for people that come here legally. Trespasser is the name we call border jumpers.
new immigrants you don't know who is good or terrorists way diff times politicians always clueless
@SenSchumer seriously you are comparing our ancestors who if they coughed were sent back on the next boat clueless u r
only if they enter legally and obey the laws of our country
*** Illegal Aliens...
Get YOUR Thumb--OUT OF YOUR REAR POSTIER-- America Is Waiting--Do Your Damn Job! CONFIRM TRUMPS CABINET!!!

@SenSchumer we can't let this happen. We can't turn away people fleeing from wars.
@SenSchumer Then stop being an obstacle and provide a solution , rather than pandering to your outdated audience.
my grandparents came came to NJ thru EllisIsland. Legally. Legal immigration is what ppl really want, not to keep all out.
It is a far more dangerous thing.  We need intelligent, fair, progressive reform, not Nazi tactics.
Another stupid lib Senator who doesn't know what illegal means
legal immigrants
@SenSchumer Did your ancestors evade documentation?  Or did they come through Ellis Island?
ILLEGAL immigrants, minor detail you forgot to mention
it sad we have to remind people of this fact time after time.
@SenSchumer true
criminal illegals need to go. Same with sanctuary cities (sorry, find another breeding ground for Democrats)
There's a difference between *legal and illegal immigrants. You don't have right to remain here if you entered unlawfully.
@SenSchumer  LEGAL CITIZENS, not PEOPLE WHO break the LAW!! Chuckles do your damn job!
I am an Iranian graduated with PhD from the US.Haven't seen my parents for 4 years.This order means they can never visit me
Your Liberal is what's wrong with NJ. Which is why most can't leave it fast enough.  #draintheswamp #Trump
You're absolutely right Senator, this unprecedented move Donald Trump is making will hurt America even more, it must stop.
We only want to throw out the illegal CRIMINALS BOB....Now get ur skirt out of the door and breathe #UniteOrSTFU
@Potus I agree. Mr. Trump doesn't seem to understand he did not win the popular vote. The majority agrees with you!
Hear Hear! Stand up to Trump!
Illegally in the US immigrants are different than legally in the US immigrants. You want to live here? FOLLOW THE RULES!!
really Senator. Insult to our intellect
enough on that. A different world, different times. Your HYPOCRISY should go so far.
@SenSchumer I am liberal, but why not just legal immigrants? Please help me understand.
@SenSchumer Your immigrant ancestors passed laws that they would be ashamed of you for not upholding. Smdh.
who is talking bout that. If U R legal and not a criminal we love U. if U R a crook get OUT. Get legal or OUT
Since you been indicted on Federal Corruption Charges you may be pushing a broom around as part of your prison detail
no one wants to do that, stop fear mongering and start doing your job.
our ancestors came here LEGALLY
YES!  Thank you! If you want to get technical about it, if you are not NATIVE AMERICAN, you are an immigrant???
How about your daughter grabbed by the what ever, groped, and sexual words said to them.Do you like it
Dont worry Bob..justicedemocrats will replace the democrats taking lobbyist  $$$..and make life harder for Trump..
@SenSchumer We are not talking about immigrants.  We are talking about illegal aliens. They have no right to be here.
@SenSchumer force trump to release his tax returns and show all business interests with his sons major fraud
@SenSchumer Irony: Trump is the son of an immigrant. And, unless one is Native American, we are all immigrants. Fight on.
they also did it LEGALLY and there is plenty of Americans that want/need to work understand NJ is with #AmericaFirst #MAGA
@SenSchumer SO @marcorubio @tedcruz @SpeakerRyan #deportationforces ok with you or do you just lack #cajones
@SenSchumer Mr. Trump #Teardownthiswall
@SenSchumer Let's make sure we keep the legal ones. Criminals weren't allowed, in the past, either!
@SenSchumer So require their employers to provide health insurance Require Walmart to provide Free up Medicaid for others
HIS WIVE's were dam IMMIGRANTS!!! @realDonaldTrump hypocrite!!!!!!! @maddow @ABCPolitics @CNN
Good to hear from you. But we also need to hear you are on the same page re:outrage as we fight a deluded, unstable fascist
@SenSchumer Ditto.
why are they still immigrants? Why haven't they gone through the systems like those before them.
thats a great way to introduce them to America: go ahead! Break our laws!
THEN PLEASE EXPLAIN YOURSELF ON WHY THE GOVERNMENT IMPRISON JAPANESE IN WW2, IMPRISON THEM, OUR GOVERNMENT.
You are the pharma13 voting against us getting cheaper meds from Canada....I will remember what you did to hurt the poor
Are you becoming concerned that President Trump's behavior may demonstrate a mental illness making him unfit for office?
@SenSchumer You forgot the ILLEGAL part as usual.
@SenSchumer not a big fan of the rule of law obviously
@SenSchumer Our immigrant ancestors, Sen. Menendez, didn't have to sneak across a border. They became US citizens legally.
@SenSchumer be in the solution. Stop complaining. We are sick of rhetoric #unitedontdivide #independentsspeak
we are not in the Industrial Age anymore
Maybe they should enter the country legally.. just a thought
@SenSchumer My ancestors came here legally.... Look up legal.
You deport criminal illegals & help the good illegals become citizens faster.
@SenSchumer well I hope you're gonna do something about it! This is not NAZI GERMANY and "ALIENS" don't exist. People do!!!
@SenSchumer illegal means illegaltaxpayers have had itmy grgramps came in legally thru Ellis became DR. With no handouts
Don't worry Bob no one is going after immigrants. They're going after criminal illegal aliens. Two very seperate categories
I'm a constituent and am begging you to fight and stop this madness
@SenSchumer Totally agree! My grandmother left Italy in 1920 w/ her family (comfortable life) & struggled in USA everyday
are you still under investigate ?
@SenSchumer what is it about the word illegal doesn't these politician's want to acknowledge. We welcome legal migrants.
#1 indep.U.S registered citizen o.jackson turns fortunately 2 the latest revelation re: DOW- 1.25.17
