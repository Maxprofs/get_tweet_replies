@ActualEPAFacts thank you senator. The trump picks have been dizzyingly at odds with the depts they head.
I never thought clean air and water was a "lefty agenda." I thought everyone needed 2 breathe
really? How about those West Virginians poisoned by coal washing chemicals two years ago?
Thank you Senator!
THANK YOU!!
Thank you!
@SenateDems You cannot stop it either. You can just cry like Schumer. Better get a therapy puppy now.

@ActualEPAFacts yes!! Please vote no and convince your colleagues to vote no as well. He cannot be confirmed
@ActualEPAFacts thank you for standing up for our country and planet!

Thanks Senator! Mine against Pruitt too. Can you all please find a few more GOP to stand w/you to save us?
nope. If he did we can invoke the nuclear option That's to Harry Ried. U can't stop the TRAIN!
Thanks you for standing up for our planet - and our children's future!
Thank you Senator.  Please make sure the GOP knows that scientists and those who support them vote. November 2018 is close.
@ActualEPAFacts Thank you Senator.
Thank you, Sen. Menendez!
Thank you, Senator. He would be a threat to the environment and has no business in the job.
He is the PERFECT guy to rein this out of control liberal agency.
how much did he contribute to individual senate campaigns, and will calling Republican Senators make a difference?
Thank you for doing the right thing for our planet
YOU ARE MY SENATOR - SO I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU ARE TAKING A STAND AGAINST SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE DISASTROUS @  EPA.
Thank you Senator.
