@SenatorMenendez pretty low to stoop to fake photos. Lol
@SenatorMenendez is that where u house ur underage prostitutes just off shore
@SenatorMenendez Couldn't find a picture that actually backed up your rhetoric so you paid an intern to Photoshop one? #desperation
Think I see a polar bear out there. @SenatorMenendez: Atlantic shores belong to all of us - not #BigOil.
@SenatorMenendez posting this picture shows how much you don't understand about drilling for oil. #uneducated #liberallogic
@SenatorMenendez Sy, evidently I left two idiot Senators back in New York and acquired at least one idiot Senator moving to New Jersey. SMH.
@SenatorMenendez this is a joke, right?  Your people are that bad at photoshop?  Another dem lie exposed.
@SenatorMenendez wow next time you want a fake done contact me I can make it much better.  But I do work on commission.

@SenatorMenendez Re-Tweeted. 

For Sure! I couldn't believe Pres Obama was even considering this!!!!!!!!!!
@SenatorMenendez You've been in politics too long. Time to get yourself a REAL job.
@SenatorMenendez #KilltheDrill
Is this a joke?
@SenatorMenendez Only those Senators with Ds behind their names can get away with stupidity like this
@SenatorMenendez  And to think, I always thought deep water drilling actually meant DEEP water.  Silly me...
@SenatorMenendez Liberals really are that dumb to believe there is an oil rig 100 feet off shore.  That is a really bad photoshop.
@SenatorMenendez As far as I can tell, Americans LOVE sub $2 a gallon gas
@SenatorMenendez Can you tell me where this is? I'd like to swim out to that rig with a protest sign.
@Moke453 @SenatorMenendez Swim? At low tide, you can walk...#JustSayn
@daalad @SenatorMenendez I'd go at high tide so I could be part of the first water-based protest.
@SenatorMenendez  
I put this photo as my cover photo on facebook. 
I'm from Bayonne NJ. 
Fought to stop spectra. http://wisdom-sa.blogspot.com/2013/12/stop-spectra-no-natural-gas.html …
@SenatorMenendez Surprised this hasn't been Photoshopped to death yet...
Really - do you we are THAT dumb? @SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez I suspect you'd jump on that fake rig if there were some underage hookers on board you pedophile.
@SenatorMenendez Excuse me Senator but your stupid is showing
@SenatorMenendez Did you photoshop this yourself, or have one of your taxpayer funded aides do it?
@SenatorMenendez What does the NSA/WH have on you sir?The way you backed off Iran sanctions so quickly is NOT natural & you put us in danger
.@SenatorMenendez Are you done embarrassing #NJ yet? You realize a #BigOil drill isn't near the beach- right? #killthedrill nonsense
@SenatorMenendez I may be late to this game you r playing, but you r still wrong 4 misrepresening openly. We deserve better than liars.
@SenatorMenendez they can use the piece that belongs to me
@SenatorMenendez I'm confused, do you support or oppose lying photoshop crap to push partisan agendas?
@SenatorMenendez = very dopey.
@SenatorMenendez let me guess this is another bill that you haven't read before commenting on, maybe you need someone to vet your tweets
@SenatorMenendez fake, once for that rig and again for a beach in NJ that somehow does not have these guys on it
@SenatorMenendez http://cdn.frustra.org/sounds/sound_tf2/vo/scout_jeers11.mp3?id=959 …
@SenatorMenendez exactly  where  is this  oil rig?
@SenatorMenendez WOW.  The needle on my BullShitOMeter is spinning faster than an ATR-72's prop.... #killthedrill
@SenatorMenendez Sir, I voted for you. NJ shore will survive. We need this for energy independence and to bolster local economies.
@SenatorMenendez Terrible that they can build so close to shore. Where is this rig? I will join your protest.
Word from the bird RT @lordnils: @SenatorMenendez You LYING COMMIE SCUMBAG!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you retarded commies EVER tell the truth?
You useless frigin fraud, keep scaring those low info voters or as you call them...your base. @SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez Well, at least that leaves the Gulf and the Pacific for drilling!
@SenatorMenendez Are you also responsible for Obama's fake long-form birth certificate?
@SenatorMenendez Does Michael Moore know you lift images from his propaganda films?
@SenatorMenendez you are so stupid, fake picture, fake senator, loser
@SenatorMenendez Good.  That must be why #bigoil needs to be inserted into the photo.
Sadly NJ will keep electing->“@SenatorMenendez: The Atlantic shores belong to all of us - not #BigOil. #killthedrill ”
#PhotoshopWeMuch “@SenatorMenendez: The Atlantic shores belong to all of us - not #BigOil. #killthedrill ”
.@SenatorMenendez fraudulent garbage.  Is this your typical level of honesty? #tcot #tiot #tlot
@SenatorMenendez you're joking right??
@SenatorMenendez with regards to your tweet about offshore driiling, your sir are a bufoon a scalawag cheat.
@SenatorMenendez Are you really THAT stupid? Let me spell it out for you: p-h-o-t-o-s-h-o-p.
@SenatorMenendez The brilliance of idiots never fails to amaze. You're unfit to be a clerk let alone a Senator. #disgracetoAmerica #resign
@SenatorMenendez So You want to stay a servant & on the Saudi's payroll right!!!!
@SenatorMenendez Stupid much.
@SenatorMenendez You cannot be serious with this.  Have any pix of divers exploring underwater subway lines to share as well?
@SenatorMenendez you are one stupid MFer. Get a real job you lazy POS.
@SenatorMenendez Nos crees pendejos obviamente

@SenatorMenendez You are an idiot who posts false images to trick citizens.
@SenatorMenendez You are such an idiot!! How the hell did you ever get elected to office?? #smh #fail #killthedrill
@SenatorMenendez Photoshopped BS propaganda photos belong to none of us - just #BigGovernment.
@SenatorMenendez Nice Photoshop you fool!  Anyone with half a brain knows that offshore means waaaaaaaaay offshore.  Idiot!
@SenatorMenendez Pathetically fake. So you're ok with $100/bbl oil from Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia?
@SenatorMenendez Can you remind us how many times 59 goes into 15? I'm bad at math.
@SenatorMenendez For the progressive, the ends justifies any means (lie) necessary to achieve it.
.@SenatorMenendez Hey Bob! Show me on a map where this or any other rig is this close to a beach. You can't, right?
@SenatorMenendez You're really a Senator? Wow!
@SenatorMenendez Id bet you & your brethren created more than a couple laws along the way that would stop this from being built #YouAreATwit
Fake / Photoshop / Drama Queen "@SenatorMenendez The Atlantic shores belong to all of us - not #BigOil. #killthedrill
@goptraci @SenatorMenendez would be funnier to put solar panels and say "go green, just not in my back yard"
@joshuawoodz @SenatorMenendez Yeah why is that offshore oil rig is so ugly but this exudes so much love?
@SenatorMenendez I just thought you should know:
@SenatorMenendez does this mean you are trying to put me out of a job?  My family, my wife and my kids depend on income from #BigOil. #fake
@SenatorMenendez Last I checked you were doing a little off-shore drilling yourself in the Dominican Republic.  How are you still in office?
@SenatorMenendez Right, because we don't need energy or anything. Nice photoshopped pic.
@SenatorMenendez I bet the crabbing around its base is FANTASTIC!
#OhThatIsAFakeNeverMind #Idiot #Duh #TCOT
Reminder to @SenatorMenendez: Blatant fake aside, lots & lots & lots of #LittlePeople invest in #BigOil. Careful who you demonize!
#TCOT
@SenatorMenendez So, the idiots that vote for you are dumb enough to fall for this hackery. Stick to diddling little Dominican girls.
@SenatorMenendez Dumbass...
@SenatorMenendez you have got to be one special kind of idiot. Hats off to you and your amazing photoshoppers. #senatorpropaganda

@SenatorMenendez how did you get elected? Oh wait......
@SenatorMenendez .. a comically bad fake, do the workers just wait for low tide & walk to work? Go home Senator, you're drunk.
@SenatorMenendez It's ok people.  I'm sure there's a larger point to be made here, which as we all know, excuses any dishonesty.
@jasonarti @SenatorMenendez Of course...Dishonesty in the name of ones political  agenda is always "A-OK", right Senator? You got caught.
@SenatorMenendez   Lemme guess Bob - you can see the rig from your house?????? #drillbabydrill  And you don't drive a vehicle? and burn gas?
@SenatorMenendez Apparently fake pics and photoshop belong to all of us as well.
@SenatorMenendez So you do remember you represent NJ.  Thought all your time now was spent trying to start another war
@SenatorMenendez Umm, maybe to the rich and famous. The rest of us - 1 week out of the yr if we're lucky.  Drill baby, drill.
Photoshop is a wonderful thing. So, screwed any child prostitutes lately you hypocrite POS? @SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez Energy is OUR resource - demonizing the great companies that safely harvest it is evil.  OPEN DRILLING, oil prices going UP
