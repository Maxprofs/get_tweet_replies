And a lot of prisons as well! Some things just shouldn't be for profit!
For profit encourages competition which is good for all.
"For profit"isn't always a good http://thing.Read  a book or2&u may actually learn somethin!"MAY!"
Our union run school system needs change they care about teachers not students
(1/2)I don't know who loses more in quantity&value,but it's teachers who obviously get hurt the most,
Thank you for voting no!
It doesn't matter how he voted, the GOP is in the majority and all Trumps nominees with pass, soooo sweet.
thank you! Will you also be voting NO to Scott Pruitt? A #climatechange denier should not head the EPA.
It doesn't matter how he votes, the GOP is in the majority and all Trumps nominees with pass, soooo sweet.
Look at her track record in Detroit.
-I have and it's a disaster! She failed her Senate interview. She's almost as stupid as Trump. Almost.
Trump beat your brilliant candidate, Hillary thought she had it made. I trust Trumps judgement.
THE TOPIC: DeVos isn't a rational choice-based on lack of experience & track record. Google it.
@SenSchumer we're ranked 17th world wide. Surely she wouldn't do worse! My kids deserve better than 17th!

@SenSchumer No more Common Core, begone with you!

@SenSchumer maybe it is time to break the cycle of stupidity that has been allowed to run rampant in our public schools
leave MY senators alone.  They don't represent you. Talk to @SenatorCollins

You mean she never went to school?

THANK GOD SHE HASN'T OR SHE WOULD B JUST ANOTHER PUBLIC ED IDIOT ADMINISTRATOR

thAnk you Senator. #DumpDevos #DeVosFacts
I AGREE...now kick DeVos down the road plz and TU
THANK YOU FOR STANDING TALL !
It doesn't matter how he votes, the GOP is in the majority and all Trumps nominees with pass, that is sooo sweet
savor it sweetie...because Karma is a bitch that will have a really unpleasant aftertaste..
She does have a college degree.

1-Calvin College is ranked highly by Forbes & US News 2-She's been an advocate for charter schools
& school vouchers, which is why the teachers unions & Dems don't like her
3-Your choice not to like or approve her, but get your facts straight before you attack her record.

@SenSchumer we're ranked 17th in education worldwide! We should definitely put someone who helped us get there in that job.
Support Betsy Devos, our failed education system's last chance and best hope for our children's future.!
Ot the illegal immigrant kids who cost $10k (average) for state taxpayers. Or never help a non-public job...
@POTUS thank you for voting NO! She is unqualified
thank you!
Thank you, Sen Menendez
Thank you Senator, keep up the fight.
Thank you #jerseysaysno #DumpDevos
thank you for no vote on  Devos -- she is completely unqualified and not an advocate for public edu. #DumpDevos
Senator, SOME pubic schools disasters.  Give those families a CHOICE.
Your right Bobby, trust them on who can take the most Union money
I did - broken - Congress leaving students behind for decades - do your job.
obstructionist
@Matt_Stepp817 

The more I read about Betsy DeVos, the more disturbed I am about her.

That nominee hearing was awful. 
@Matt_Stepp817 because the current system has been so great for our children. They are prepared for life and college...well
please stay firm and say no!
Thank you.
thanks no to price and Pruitt
thank you  no to price and Pruitt also
Should they have had a lesser education?  If they can make public schools more like private schools our kids win.
@SenSchumer public/union backed teachers these days not that good.I know I have seen it.Change/choice can be great. Try it!
Thank You!
@SenSchumer Entrusting it 40+ yrs 2 ppl who did made it worse. Time 2 bring Betsy who isn't there just 2 favor unions
@SenSchumer commi demon devil party hasn't done so well so far time 2 try better path

Lets hope on Sessions, Price and Tillerson too

Thank you for supporting public schools with this decision!
Yay! Thank you so much!
you sent your kids to private school, didn't you? No irony there
@SenSchumer. Thank you for standing in opposition to Davos!!!!!
Your owners, the teachers' union, trained You well
@SenSchumer We also should not entrust HUD to Ben Carson. VERY disappointed on your vote. An ex. of why Dems always lose.
so where the safest country to move to until the this by seat o pants is impeached we are not safe. Now the fools of world
thank you, Senator,  for your rational thinking.
- as the mother of an autistic student who relies on the IDEA - THANK YOU!! #noDeVos
becz the public school system is such a great learning place? This actually qualifies her to clean up the mess!!
@SenSchumer what about Obama?  Hypocrite!!
Thank You!
Thank you Senator Menendez! #Devos #ImVotingNo
@SenSchumer  Well Senator, if that criteria is so important, why isn't Congress insured under Obamacare
We shouldn't entrust the future of our children to government that has consistently failed to educate previous generations
@SenSchumer thank you for voting NO

Your under indictment for Corruption Charges / The people want your resignation!!
oh come off it. where were all you big mouths for the past 8 years?
Thank you for #VotingNo
@SenSchumer   Vote no
Thank you senator
So far so good. Hope you have a concrete plan to stop her.
Thank you
Thank you,@senatormenendez,for heeding #DeVosFacts and deciding to vote against @BetsyDevos becoming the next Secretary of Education.
THANK YOU @SenatorMenendez; my husband & I gave 70 years between us 2 teaching/administration in public schools.
thanks! Pls place a hold on sessions nomination. Stakes are too high.
@bannerite. Hey kids from now on the world is flat and revolves around Donny Trump......
On behalf of my children, thank you Senator Menendez.
thank you!
@SenSchumer you must be referring to the department of education
thank you!!!
@SenSchumer kinda feel the same way about the administration
@SenSchumer Thank you for voting NO on Betsy Devos. She is no good for public education. #NoTaxesForPrivateSchools
kinda like not letting someone who doesn't pay taxes and has never held public office run our country (sigh)
thank you, Senator!
@SenSchumer Democrats are more interested in protecting future votes from Teachers Union then improving education.
Thank you.
@SenSchumer Thank you
please do not confirm her. PLEASE she is a disaster. Anyone who doesn't know what IDEA is should not lead that agency.
thank you!
@Alt_DeptofED seems so obvious. It would be nice if they had some experience in #teaching or #schooladministration #resist
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator Menendez 
Correct, so vote no on DeVos. She is a favor candidate of Trump, that's it. She is not qualified to organize a rock fight.
And our union run current education system is ok with you. I trust Trumps judgement with DeVos.
To begin w/ your premise is wrong. You don't know a damn thing about DeVos,do you ? Trust Trump all you want, she's a favor pick
@SenSchumer how about this one. Your kind of person.
https://www.facebook.com/pappajon/posts/10154199816297826 â€¦
where exactly has she been involved?
truth & Breitbart shouldn't be used in same sentence unless it's 'breitbart can't tell the truth'
already done my research on DeVos. No dummy here.
no time or no proof of your facts? Twitter is 24/7. Let me know when you've gotten your story str8
If u are against DeVos, call out the democrats who voted for her..that can be a start..complaining about it does nothing
what a baby! Grow up!!!!
U had eight years to improve the education system & US ranks 17th in global education. US spend more than any nation! Sad!
Please vote NO for DeVos! Not good for America!
@SenSchumer very true.     This is for our children......the future.  #Nodevos
thank you
@SenSchumer thank you!!
@SenSchumer Billionaires rarely have anything to do with public schools.
shouldn't socialist teachers & butts like yourself work 4free instead of mousing on benefits of free capitalism? u mouse
@SenSchumer thank you.  Please convince your colleagues to do the same!
prove it by voting accordingly
thank you Senator
@SenSchumer Thank you.
how stupid of a statement. Just because they are not a member of the establishment shouldn't disqualify them.
Thank you Senator Menendez !
@SenSchumer absolutely! Thank you!
she will be great
Agreed, please continue to fight this unqualfied candidate, and keep our education for everyone!
@SenSchumer Bob.. US is 14 out of 40 countries in education. Kids trump unions., Bob. Yours went to pvt schools. Why?
#no2devos
@SenSchumer Thank you!
@SenSchumer plus you are sucking up to teachers unions. Useless liberal unions. Plus you take money
Why not your supposed school experts for decades have been complete failures. Time for a different direction!
Vote No on DeVos. Choice = segregation by race/ religion/ income. Schools shouldn't be for-profit; should be to educate.
@SenSchumer Thank you! I wouldn't want her near NJ schools!
#StopCommonCore #StopESSA Gates Foundation funded! Unconstitutional actions!
it's to bad that @SenateDems are in the minority & your previous leader messed it up for you so your no vote won't matter
Dear Bob that is exactly who we need. Public education is broken by those who are running it, am I keeping it simple for u?
as one of your constituents, thank you!
@Maja1218 Thank you!!
@SenSchumer thank you @JohnnyIsakson I beg you to do right by GA we just rejected a charter school amendment in Nov.
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer cannot expect to get anywhere w/ business as usual or standard operating procedures. GET ON IT. 2.
OR HUD, OR Sec'y of State, OR EPA, COME ON THEY'RE ALL UNFIT
@SenSchumer 

Why did you let Rex through?
Thank you, Senator.
@SenSchumer Lotta Dems pretty disgusted with y'all right now Stand up, get loud, figure out ways to block the bs. You 1/
@SenSchumer Thank You!!!
My son with spec needs & I thank you so http://much.You  have no idea how much sleep I have lost over this. She scares me to death.
Thank you sir. We appreciate you standing up for our children.
We also shouldn't entrust it to the political party who benefits from Unions who are wasting taxpayer money. @SenSchumer
@SenSchumer Again, that's great. But u all need 2 do more than social media posts.Tweets won't stop anything. Get creative.
