@tkdmike we need to flush that swamp down the drain w/trump! Hope they all suffer more than us! Karma
building wall the Mexican people instead of knocking on our door will be knocking on their leaders doors
@SenateDems Why not let  children born here sponsor their parents?
by building wall we help Mexico, the elites like Vicente Fox & Jorge Ramos can't use us as pressure relief valve
Mexico has Oil,Gold,Silver,Fertile Land,2 beautiful coasts,the elites live very good & send their poor to the USA
@SenateDems yes she faked soc sec # so she could work, pay taxes instead of living off America and this was her offense?
no way to justify this at all, sheerly callous indifference and cruelty
can u Imagen how much money could be saved and how many american could be doing better if we just get rid of those who take
It's going to cost billions to deport that many people, most of whom work. Not beneficial to Americans. @SenatorMenendez
the burdon on our welfare system from schools, food stamps, Healthcare puts everyone at risk. Americans 1st.
I disagree. @SenatorMenendez
it is OK to have opposing views. This country is 20trillion in debt. More people r out of work than work.
That's plainly untrue. More than 50% of the country is not unemployed. @SenatorMenendez
u know I check out the numbers 320,000,000 population −123,000,000 employeed
=197,000,000 not working.
You can't count children, stay at home parents, retirees, and prisoners ... @SenatorMenendez
..they can leave complete.
@SenateDems Know how to tell when a politician is grandstanding? When they don't tweet to the person they're addressing. 
@SenateDems @POTUS better find people willing to pick vegetables for cheap or all Americans are going to suffer.
There is machinery that can plant and harvest 85% of what is grown in the US.
WRONG_ 85% of fruits and vegetables are hand-picked
vote DEms out
@SenateDems When Moms & Dads do something illegal, we shouldn't punish them because feelings?What happened to rule of law?
Do you have no respect for our laws? I can't believe you are my Senator.
I don't get swayed by sob stories-what have you done for vets?  Send them home and enforce Trumps laws!
@POTUS Trump only cares about his billionaire donors/cronies, golf and all that glitters in his personal world
Excuse my ignorance' did WH abandon weekly list of crime committed by undocumented immigrants?
@SenateDems Nobody is above the law...shame on you
@LadyHawksNest25 he does not care..that is why you and your fellow Senators must fight him every step of the way. We care!!
If you are criminals, you have to go. My wife was an immigrant, but came here legally!
@SenateDems because they are not legal citizens?
ask the same thing og BO, remember how many he deported?
Uh, because he was lying?
A lot of people see it as the parents knew they were wrong so they children should not be able to profit.
@SenateDems Will u take them into your home & support them? Put up r shut up.
@SenateDems If these parents cared for their kids, why did they not come here legally knowing they could be separated?
@SenateDems If skin ISN'T WHITE do u REALLY believe he has LOVE for them? Only thing I've seen him have love for is SELF!
Dumbest comment of the day award goes to gpgal15.
Thank you! Americans want an independent investigation of Trump ties to Russia, hacking and tax returns!
@SenateDems Your logic is flawed: you are saying we shouldn't send child abusing parents to prison bec we care for children
go home! Taxes for their homelands!All out !private equity trust! Arrest entire family for engineering fraud©®™
#POTUS didn't do this to them-they did & will U take them in Senator? (silence)  Have U checked a vet lately?
@SenateDems #trumplovesrussiamore
Trump Could CARE Less,Ryan and McConnell included .
rather than just posting about it in the public, make it public in Senate and protest there like the rest of us out here
Parents is a quite diverse, vague term that means little, or can be quite specific. The joke is you.
@SenateDems this is not @potus fault. He is enforcing the laws... not picking and choosing like the last admin.Do your job!
@SenateDems senator, as a person who is responsible to see that our laws are upheld, how can you justify no enforcement?
if they're an illegal alien and a criminal Deport them. You should have clamped down years ago on immigration
it's you lawmaker's fault he's in the position he's in. It's all your fault
if past Executives would have done their job we wouldn't be where we are now. Don't blame the current executive
@SenateDems you are getting a lot of hateful tweets, let's see what happens when it starts affecting them?
@SenateDems I am baffled by your logic. Because a criminal has children the criminal should not go to jail or be deported?
@SenateDems because it's against the law!
easy one @potus lied.he doesn't love them-doesn't even love the kids of our soldiers & closed their daycares
Trump is possessed with two emotions, self-love and self-hatred simultaneously.
Simple, 45 is a lying sociopath who can hold two contradictory ideas at once that the novel 1984 predicted.
@SenateDems You didn't direct your question to @POTUS
I want to see Trump's tax returns. If they're being audited, want to know which years, when audits began.
@SenateDems why not try pictures of puppy's and starving children in Africa to distort the truth; your despicable
@SenateDems because they're criminals...
Because he doesn't.  The end.  You really had to ask?
@SenateDems   WHAT PART OF ILLEGAL DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND!!!
Dems need to rise above the din and do something other than bitch about it
because we are freaking tire of illegals having their way and Americans being left behind
it's called defending the Constitution; something you were sworn to do Senator #liberty
Boy, did you ever nail it. Policy is just plain mean.
@eschwartz1106 Are they legal?She said she pays taxes!Must be legal,what is the problem then?Humm Fraud?
Is there a law that says the children cannot go with the parents? That would be extremely unfair.
if they are here illegally
because she broke the law. Breaking laws have consequences, citizen or not, family or not.
It's heartbreaking this happens but remember he didn't make the law, he's just enforcing it. Change the law. Now.
Thank-you for the tweet. Makes me Jersey Proud.
Adios Mexico Adios Mexico - Freddy Fender
What are you doing working the Democrats with Trump's new immigration laws? Left Hispanic immigrants alone.
“@SenatorMenendez: because they BROKE OUR LAW, had babies in this country and now you want them to be pardoned? Y not do for all prisoners
Your ancestors murdered families and nations to live here. Guess you're cool with that.
Because they r illegal Bobbie....Look that word up in the dictionary #UniteOrSTFU
What about Citizens that break our laws? Should we not send them to prison just because they have family?
I think President Obama answered this question very clearly.
