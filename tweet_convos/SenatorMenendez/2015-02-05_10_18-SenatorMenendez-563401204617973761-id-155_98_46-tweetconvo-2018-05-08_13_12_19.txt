@A_M_Perez @SenatorMenendez 2/3 of all politicians and 50% of citizens are anti gun !
@A_M_Perez @SenatorMenendez would I what !
@A_M_Perez @jerry98649 @SenatorMenendez We have plenty of room in Texas, Anna.. Especially if you're a shooter!
@SenatorMenendez @A_M_Perez You are 100% correct! 10 rounds are not enough to stop Liberal psychos. 30 round magazines minimum. #ArmAmerica
Dang. I have a little catching up to do. I'll call the new ones Menendez Memorial Mags. Heh heh. @A_M_Perez @USAPatriotSC @SenatorMenendez
@DickJunkins @A_M_Perez @SenatorMenendez Me too, Magpul makes a reliable 40 round mag. I need some of those babies.
@A_M_Perez @DickJunkins @SenatorMenendez I only need 2, one for the front door and one for the back door.
@A_M_Perez @DickJunkins @SenatorMenendez Only if they are remote controlled with a video view.
.@SenatorMenendez .@JLa_NYC This is pure common sense. Only the fanatical would see it as a 'rights' issue. #SayNo2MoreAmmo #gunsense
@iamjoequint @SenatorMenendez @JLa_NYC Common Americans disagree w/ u. If u can't raise ur argument above "fanatical" you've lost. #gunsense
@5ugarcane please define "common American".  @iamjoequint @SenatorMenendez
@JLa_NYC @iamjoequint @SenatorMenendez The millions who continue to vote against more gun legislation. They can't all be labeled "fanatics."
@5ugarcane please cite your source for that data.  @iamjoequint @SenatorMenendez
@JLa_NYC @iamjoequint @SenatorMenendez Millions of Americans voted out gun control advocates @ State & Fed levels in 2014. You're not aware?
@5ugarcane We are discussing limiting magazine size. It can save lives. @iamjoequint @SenatorMenendez
@JLa_NYC @5ugarcane @iamjoequint @SenatorMenendez "It can save lives"??? Prove it.
hey @SenatorMenendez How is a magazine that holds 10 rounds safer than a magazine that holds 11? #gunsense #Sayno2moreammo
@OneProudLiberal @SenatorMenendez Why r 10 rounds so much more dangerous than 11? Why r 10 .45 rounds worse than 12 .22 rounds?  #gunsense
@MamasGotAGun @SenatorMenendez that's the problem with your kind you make up s*** to try to justify your f****** insanity
@OneProudLiberal @SenatorMenendez Make up what? U have no answer because 11 rounds aren't exponentially more dangerous than 10 #gunsense
@SenatorMenendez what if you're being attacked by 3 criminals? That has been known to happen. #gunsens is nonsense
@SenatorMenendez A good shooter can change a mag in less two seconds.  Pretty stupid legislation huh!  Get a life or get a gun!
But corrupt politicians belong in Congress trying to curtail our rights? @SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez hey aren't you the guy that flew to Asia to sleep with children?
@SenatorMenendez And the genitals of geriatric US Senators do not belong in underage sex slaves you diagusting puke!
@RealDonnaDees @SenatorMenendez <~ DINO-a stealth republican.
@SenatorMenendez You live in cartoon land, Senator. Stats show mag capacity laws do nothing.  This will NEVER pass. #2A #NRA #gunsense
MT @SenatorMenendez: Magazines that hold >10 rounds of ammo don't belong on our streets or in our schools. #gunsense. ^ what about LE?
@SenatorMenendez false argument Right now only a select few can carry a gun at all in NJ . What about home defense? #GunRights
Firearm homicides 87% by handgun, mostly smaller ones that are easily concealed and carry 5-6 rounds. #Lrn2Shoot #GunSense @SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez Argue this sir if you will.
@SenatorMenendez That sir, is beyond stupid.
.@SenatorMenendez how is a magazine with 10 rounds safer than a magazine with 11? @jasychic  #gunsense #SayNo2MoreAmmo
@SenatorMenendez STANDARD capacity, not high capacity. This is what happens when we let dems rename our stuff. They try and take them away.
@SenatorMenendez @mcspocky Even one is too many.
@SenatorMenendez @Gunsense #SayNO2MoreAmmo And Marxists in Govt need not tell Americans we should bow to 'their' demands! Get A Clue, Dummy!
@SenatorMenendez that's right a standard 30 round magazine belongs nestled in my rifle
@SenatorMenendez support the Constitution and Bill of Rights that you swore to protect you lying pig
@SenatorMenendez @ltecato Tax that ammo! Tax it huge so it's not affordable!
@SenatorMenendez President #CristinaKirchner against the influence of #Mossad Israel & #CIA in #Argentina: http://mohsenabdelmoumen.wordpress.com/2015/02/07/la ...
@SenatorMenendez  Well, explain how you intend to remove large capacity magazines from the hands of criminals...
@SenatorMenendez but they do belong in my possession as a law abiding citizen.
@SenatorMenendez  CRIMINALS DO NOT OBEY THE LAW!!  ANY LAW!! FOOLISH TO PASS MORE LAWS THAT WILL NOT BE OBEYED BY CRIMINALS!!! #gunsense
@SenatorMenendez and yet during the AWB that banned all that, not one crime was prevented, why try it again... why not try something else?
@SenatorMenendez They already are banned from schools. But don't try to tell me what I need to defend my home.
@SenatorMenendez Darn right! Get those war tools away from cops!  #gunsense #SayNo2MoreAmmo
@SenatorMenendez  love the fact you can think of a million ways to violate my 2nd amendment to rights but yet can't pay  off our debt
@SenatorMenendez according to whom? You want to decide what is best for me and others. Typical lib thinking. #SayNo2MoreAmmo #2A
@SenatorMenendez So, you mean basically any modern pistol? It's my right to carry, and it's my right to keep. #SayNo2MoreFelonies
@SenatorMenendez People like you don't belong in the senate.
@SenatorMenendez You going after drunk drivers? Hammer manufacturers? More people are killed by those two items alone.#HandsOffMyMag
@SenatorMenendez When are the terms of these sponsors up? They need to be removed.
@SenatorMenendez and you don't belong in government
@SenatorMenendez 

Can you tell me why? They are used in less than 1 percent of overall crime.
@SenatorMenendez And YOU don't belong in a place representing Americans.
@SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez so police should be better armed than citizens? Where have we heard that before, Senator? #gunnonsense
@SenatorMenendez [zero sense] only a politician could come up with the number 10. Why not 9 or 11? cripes, buddy
@SenatorMenendez magazines that hold >10 rounds belong at the range and in the home. They're already banned in schools. #liberallogic
By that logic @SenatorMenendez you could care less about the 1st 10 that are killed  be a man, grow a pair and speak your true intentions
@M0L0NL4BE @SenatorMenendez  you know for a fact all these knee jerk reactions to guns for legal gun owners doesn't work. Pull head from ass
@SenatorMenendez Thanks Sen Menendez for standing up for public safety.  #SayNo2MoreAmmo
Only a control freak would claim authority to tell me how many rounds I may have in my magazines. @SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez  How many rounds do the guys in your security detail carry? #SayNo2MoreAmmo
.@SengFeng @SenatorMenendez They carry at least 15+1 in handguns I'm sure. But don't you know, classes of citizens exist (LEO & Senators)
@SenatorMenendez So who do you call in an emergency? Oh? People with guns?  Idiot.
@SenatorMenendez @RepEsty Actually, they belong in my firearms as they are appropriate for defensive applications.
@SenatorMenendez - No, Murderers "don't belong on our streets or in our schools." Its not the tool, its the person.
@SenatorMenendez first it's 10 round mags, then 6 round mags, then you'll want only single shot, then you'll want  our guns. Go to hell
@SenatorMenendez how do you plan to enforce this law? Standard 30rd mags are cheap and gun owners have hundreds of them.
Fortunately, mama's boys, like @SenatorMenendez, don't get to unilaterally change the Constitution!
@SenatorMenendez Learn some more! http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2001/1/cj26n1-6.pdf …
@SenatorMenendez Learn something! http://www.people-press.org/2014/12/10/growing-public-support-for-gun-rights/ …
@SenatorMenendez I'm pretty sure if any Senator backed up their ridiculous claims like that with facts, their heads would explode. Idiots.
@SenatorMenendez Wrong!  Say yes to more ammo!
@SenatorMenendez dumb fuckers like u don't belong in the Senate but somehow you still manage to get there
@SenatorMenendez why do you feel the need to defy the constitution and the will of the people? I hope your liberal agenda crashes and burns
@SenatorMenendez Looks like we need 2 FIRE more democrats next election
@SenatorMenendez Why R democrats more concerned w/ amnesty 4 illegals than the security of our country?
@SenatorMenendez somebody needs to explain "shall not be infringed" to you, senator
@SenatorMenendez So R U senators going 2 take guns personally & give up your armed security at the capital & your homes??
@SenatorMenendez why?  How did you come up with that arbitrary number?  Why not 20 or 5 or 3 or 163?
@SenatorMenendez libtard
@SenatorMenendez I agree.  They belong in my rifles and pistols.
.@SenatorMenendez You are the @BWilliams of the Senate. An utter disgrace.
@SenatorMenendez Chucklehead.
Don't you have any underage Dominican prostitutes to bother?  I'm embarrassed to have you as my state senator @SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez Exactly how will that reduce crime or make our streets and homes safer? The answer is... IT WOULDN'T. SMH @ the stupidity!
@SenatorMenendez Senators who betray their sworn oath to the Constitution don't belong in office.
@SenatorMenendez you reall should read up on the Constitution, the  #2A disagrees with you.
@SenatorMenendez I say that we should introduce a measure to ban highly stupid lawmakers.
@SenatorMenendez Criminals don't care about your anti-constitutional efforts. They'll still have hi-cap mags. Responsible Americans won't.
@SenatorMenendez Are you serious? Magazines of ANY capacity don't belong in our schools or streets.
@SenatorMenendez Maybe we should outlaw guns in schools.
@SenatorMenendez Says who?  You don't get to make that decision!  2nd Amendment says otherwise.  Learn your history.
@SenatorMenendez @RepEsty your dumb enough to think a LAW will stop a murderer from using more than 10 bullets! Ur a special kind of stupid
@SenatorMenendez @RepEsty I don't understand your logic behind your push to ban magazines >10. #YouDontMakeSense #JustStopNow
@SenatorMenendez Stop spreading lies. There have not been 100 school shootings in the last 2 years.
@SenatorMenendez Does this mean that your goons will be limited to 10 rounds also?
@SenatorMenendez   No, cops need them,too bad it takes them 5 minutes for them to arrive when a shooter with a 10 round  mag fires on kids.
@SenatorMenendez really? 90% of Americans support large capacity magazine bans? I think you need to get y a reality check, thats not true
@SenatorMenendez Well stupid, the Newton shooter changed mags 6 times. 150 / 6.  Dont use a tragedy to steal my rights
@NM_libertarian @instapundit BREAKING! @SenatorMenendez supports arming children in schools with 10-round magazine Glocks!
@brainfertilizer @instapundit @NM_libertarian @SenatorMenendez Deodand Alert! In somewhat related news, you're a friggin' idiot.
@SenatorMenendez If you want "common sense" firearms legislation, how about subsidizing firearms training?
@SenatorMenendez #NoMoreAmmo Ammo should be heavily taxed, purchase qty's limited & background checks should be required for purchase.
@SenatorMenendez Indeed ... they belong into my self-defense guns.
@SenatorMenendez thought #gunsense wasnt about banning items/commonsense measures? All it takes 1bullet from a criminal, usually have more
@SenatorMenendez you tape three together and you have 30 rounds -- you need talk to some REAL servicemen
@SenatorMenendez Why?
@SenatorMenendez @NM_libertarian Why? The only way to keep government honest is the threat of an armed populace.
@SenatorMenendez @NM_libertarian Are you going to apply this to cops as well, or just the citizens they're shooting?
The People disagree.
Glad to get you on record.
@SenatorMenendez
Why do you work so hard against the rights of good people, @SenatorMenendez? @NM_libertarian
.@SenatorMenendez Aren't schools 'gun free zones'?  Seems that doesn't phase criminals #SayNo2MoreAmmo #gunsense #2A
.@SenatorMenendez If I'm being attacked, how much ammo do you think it'll take to DEFEND myself? #SayNo2MoreAmmo #WomensLivesMatter
.@SenatorMenendez  I totally agree with you Senator.  But Governor Chris Christie panders to the gun lobby and #GunExtremists. #gunsense
@SenatorMenendez yet y do military and law enforcement get to have them? They suck at shooting? No sense no #GunSense
@SenatorMenendez yet cops can have them cause they have poor shooting skills??
You have no place determining what our rights are. Why don't you focus on jobs instead? Remember who you work for
@SenatorMenendez
Tell me more about how criminals obey the law. #fail 
@SenatorMenendez
@HarryThetech76 @SenatorMenendez Harry, your forgetting how wonderfully warm and self important it feels to for gun free zones.
Except for the ones who've been slaughtered in them
@RonRgs @SenatorMenendez
Tell me how restrictions will reduce violent crime.Especially since most gun crime involves<4 shots

@SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez Girls under the age of >18 don't belong in your bed, paid for or not, Dominican or not #commonmorality #SayNo2UnderageGirls
@SenatorMenendez   Will you help authorities confiscate?
@SenatorMenendez David Gregory was in possession of an illegal "high capacity" magazine in DC. Do you support prosecution?
@SenatorMenendez Who are you to make that determination? What are your qualifications and expertise? Do you have any at all? #SayNo2MoreAmmo
@SenatorMenendez Where is the facts that this will save lives?
@SenatorMenendez Existing laws already cover that dipshit.
@SenatorMenendez why is that?
@SenatorMenendez I don't think they're allowed in schools now, just like a PB&J sandwich chewed into the shape of a gun. RETARD!
@SenatorMenendez Most police use handguns with more than 10 rounds. Most of mine hold more than ten.
@SenatorMenendez @iamjoequint 
Why do we need 10 rounds of ammo to shoot Bambi???
@SenatorMenendez Unless you need >10.  Ask any police officer if they'd switch to restricted capacity mags
@SenatorMenendez keep your hands if of my second amendment rights!
@SenatorMenendez You do know that TWO 10 round mags are the same as the 20 round you want to ban? And for what reason? Feel good legislation
@SenatorMenendez Police officers that protect schools and ignorant gov't officials like you carry such magazines. Typical #guncontrol sop.
Why 10 rnds? What research produced 10 rounds as the max? Or are we just making things up again? ahhhh... @SenatorMenendez #gunsense
@CulperSpyRing @dadsagainstmda @SenatorMenendez well thank God i have 30 round clips
Then ban guns, cars & pools. “@SenatorMenendez: Magazines that hold >10 rounds of ammo don't belong on our streets or in our schools.
@SenatorMenendez Senator Goebbels, can I ask why you want private citizens to be virtually disarmed?
@SenatorMenendez @IamTheWindowMan so senator please make sure your body guards don't have 10 round clips.
@frank_pitts @SenatorMenendez You have right to bare arms. You can't have the ammunition to shoot them.
.@SenatorMenendez Do police need them? If so, why?
@SenatorMenendez ...stop the criminals (that includes illegals) not honest citizens...
@SenatorMenendez Then they don't belong with cops either....
@SenatorMenendez Until you get high cap. mags out of criminal hands, you have no right to tell anyone what they can carry. #gunsense #fail
@SenatorMenendez That's the dumbest thing I ever read. Limiting rounds in magazines do NOTHING to keep kids or anyone else safe.
And please be specific, @SenatorMenendez, how your proposal will get results & reduce violence - no pie in the sky stuff. @tazcat2011
I was laughing so hard at the "specific" part I couldn't favorite your tweet! :) @5ugarcane @SenatorMenendez @tazcat2011
@CulperSpyRing @SenatorMenendez @tazcat2011 Seriously though, we can't infringe upon const rights with hashtag advocacy. Let's talk facts.
I agree, but the libs never will, as they have none. 1A ticks them off as much as 2A.  @5ugarcane @SenatorMenendez @tazcat2011
@CulperSpyRing @SenatorMenendez @tazcat2011 The one frequently omitted fact: the ultimate goal of confiscation. I wish they'd just say it.
Yes - just put it out there. They are oblivious to the fact that the 2A protects the other A's. @5ugarcane @SenatorMenendez @tazcat2011
@SenatorMenendez stop stepping on my @NJ2AS
@SenatorMenendez  heck i have 30 rounds mags
@SenatorMenendez I disagree.
@billhug @SenatorMenendez  i don't carry on the streets but i have nothing but 30 rounds mags
