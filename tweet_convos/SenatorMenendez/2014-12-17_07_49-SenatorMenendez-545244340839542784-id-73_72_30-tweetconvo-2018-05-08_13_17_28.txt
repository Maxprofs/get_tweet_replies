@SenatorMenendez if conservative business interests had not been tied to Batista, Eisenhower could have assisted the revolution & (cont'd)
.@SenatorMenendez Oops, somehow you neglected to mention the US spy also coming home after 20 years.
@SenatorMenendez Your wrong on Cuba. It is the present embargo that has been most brutal to the Cuban people supported by pricks like you.
What is it with NJ-Dem Senators this AM?1st @CoreyBooker undermining public ed;now @senatormenendez attacks Obama on Cuba progress.
@nathwice @CoreyBooker @SenatorMenendez Maybe you should ask what is wrong with the democratic leadership and not these two senators.
.@SenatorMenendez Where's your statement on this? http://nyti.ms/1A85I59  cc @HillaryClinton
@SenatorMenendez You were thrilled when Obama went Lone Wolf on Amnesty, now you wonder if he violated fed law on Cuba.  Be consistent Bitch
@SenatorMenendez for the first time perhaps i am in COMPLETE agreement with you
@SenatorMenendez How about terrorist Posada Carriles you protect in Miami? how about the under age girls in the Dominican Republic?

@SenatorMenendez good job Senator.
@SenatorMenendez: I am proud of your position on Cuba & the announcement by @BarackObama. You should have been consulted or been involved.
@SenatorMenendez castro may not have had to accept the support of the soviet union. how many millionaire Batiste cohorts fled cuba to FL?
@SenatorMenendez Cubans suffered civil rights & economic abuses at least as severe under dictator Batista's regime as under Castro. (cont;d)
Not a surprise. RT @SenatorMenendez: My statement on #Cuba & #AlanGross: http://1.usa.gov/1DNQmqy ”
@SenatorMenendez so I guess you are deleting comments.
@SenatorMenendez You need to get into the 21st Century Senator. It will help you with perspective.
@SenatorMenendez ahhaha I was already pro Opening  relations with #Cuba now even more so that #DirtyBobbyMenendez is against it! @CMCSports
@SenatorMenendez Thank you Senator.Obama @WhiteHouse has harmed people all over the world w/his reckless ideological zeal. #IDontTrustObama
@SenatorMenendez get you head out of the sand. You will deal with other non democratic countries. It's just Cuba
@SenatorMenendez The policy is outdated, and so is your opinion. #Cuba
@SenatorMenendez I lived in Miami  Cuba Libre for Cubans not for oppressive policies or conniving dictators. Assure change before we appease
@SenatorMenendez don't be such a gusano.
@SenatorMenendez .but Mr Obama is surely your hero in so many ways...don't give up on him yet...America not completely destroyed. #tcot
Wrong.  After nearly two generations, it's time to do something differently, to try to actually help the Cuban people.  @SenatorMenendez
.@SenatorMenendez You do realize you're also claiming the Pope has "vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government."
@SenatorMenendez hey @BarackObama
@SenatorMenendez Open Cuba up already...it's the 21st Century!
You failed to mention the release of 53 Cuban political prisoners being released.  @SenatorMenendez #LiesThroughOmission
@SenatorMenendez today @BarackObama has proven the fact; that he's "the worse negotiator in the world".  Let's a police state win!
@SenatorMenendez your way would keep Cuban Cigars illegal & expensive like other illegal things. Capone is still upset prohibition ended!
@SenatorMenendez http://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/chair/release/chairman-menendezs-statement-on-the-release-of-alan-gross … “Trading Mr. Alan Gross for three convicted criminals sets an extremely dangerous precedent. "
@SenatorMenendez You are always a shade behind reality! @Aaron_Ouska
@SenatorMenendez  stop being a fake ass Cuban. Let me remind you that you where born in NYC in 52, thanks to your parents who immigrated.
@SenatorMenendez OUR take on normalization of relations with Cuba! :D John 17:20-23. It can't happen your way can it???
.@SenatorMenendez No, the President has not "vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government." What a shameful lie.
Maybe the Gross family didn't send a large enough 'campaign contribution' to @SenatorMenendez - http://nyti.ms/1A85I59 .
@SenatorMenendez There is the US spy angle, does this change your take?
@SenatorMenendez http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/ecuador-family-wins-favors-after-donations-to-obama-campaign/ar-BBgTqtp?ocid=iehp …
@SenatorMenendez @News12NJ Senator: after 55 years, it's time to admit our Cuba policy has not worked. Please support the President.
@SenatorMenendez If Bob Menendez is condemning you, you must be doing something right. Is @CoryBooker fence sitting on this one?
@SenatorMenendez I'm embarrassed to see my Senator opposing a long-overdue change to America's hopeless policy of isolating Cuba.
@SenatorMenendez Please GROW up. Act like an adult  We have NORMALIZED relations with #VietNam #USSR - #China owns our debt. It's time.
@SenatorMenendez we're in a new geo-political game now. Cold War tactics and thinking no longer works unfortunately Senator.
NJ's #Democrat Senator is blasting #Obama's #Cuba decision RT “@SenatorMenendez: My statement on #Cuba & #AlanGross: http://1.usa.gov/1DNQmqy ”
@SenatorMenendez is this somehow different than what was done to secure the release of Bowe Bergdahl
@AraMarCal @SenatorMenendez POTUS should have gotten more. Release some political prisoners! On lighter note a 3rd baseman for #SFGiants!
@SenatorMenendez you're a moron
@SenatorMenendez ...seriously who cares...
