@SenatorMenendez this dude is simply an idiot....If Iran gets a bomb it will be because you opposed a deal to prevent it.....#just stupid
@kengwooten @SenatorMenendez #IranDeal doesn't prevent bomb but adds2 Iran's terror funding:

@Galatiansch2v20 @SenatorMenendez if the deal doesn't work...All other options still available....why not at least give peace a chance?
@kengwooten @SenatorMenendez The deal funds terror because it lifts sanctions. Peace isn't what Iran is planning.

@Galatiansch2v20 @SenatorMenendez and how do you know what iran is planning....are you iranian...or in the room when they meet...
@kengwooten @SenatorMenendez 
See: http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/18/us-russia-iran-arms-idUSKCN0QN11B20150818 … excerpt: 'Dehghan also said Iran was negotiating with Russia to buy fighter jets'
@Galatiansch2v20 @SenatorMenendez Israel has fighter jets...packistan has fighter jets....who cares
@kengwooten @SenatorMenendez Islam is a political system.  Stated goal: world dominance. Israel doesn't desire to take over other countries.
@SenatorMenendez u r a pathetic sellout. U will never be reelected sir. U have lost touch with your PEACEFUL constituents sir.

@Galatiansch2v20 thank u T.J. I'll give them a view. Good night.
 @SenatorMenendez
@petee224 @SenatorMenendez Thanks for your willingness! :0)
@Galatiansch2v20 very 1sided videos. 2nd is like a horror film preview. Music is bizarre. Thank u though. @SenatorMenendez
@petee224 @SenatorMenendez Apparently, original video of Iranian leader & crowd was removed-sorry about that-see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT1i1L0lqD4 …
@Galatiansch2v20 @SenatorMenendez seems ur point is Iran hates us & can't be trusted. Evry1 agrees. That does not mean this is a bad deal TJ
@petee224 @SenatorMenendez It is a bad deal though & part of the reason is Iran has an agenda & has already proven themselves untrustworthy.
@SenatorMenendez @ShaulRahabi You got it ass backwards, Senator. Without this deal Iran will *surely* have a bomb, so it WILL bear your name
@AbuKedem @SenatorMenendez @ShaulRahabi its handing them a bomb in 10 years.... That's if they don't cheat.
@IsraelsVoice @SenatorMenendez @ShaulRahabi No it isn't, and ten years is a long time when you scream that they're a year away at most
@AbuKedem @SenatorMenendez @ShaulRahabi read the treaty. It's all concessions. Nothing for us. 2morrow is his trial
@IsraelsVoice @SenatorMenendez @ShaulRahabi And yeah, the deal doesn't get Jason Rezaian back either. It's not a US-Iran deal, you know
@IsraelsVoice @SenatorMenendez @ShaulRahabi It is a deal specifically and only about the nuke issue. Not terror support, not any prisoners
@AbuKedem @IsraelsVoice @SenatorMenendez @ShaulRahabi If u think no terror support afforded by deal, you're mistaken
@Galatiansch2v20 @IsraelsVoice @SenatorMenendez @ShaulRahabi The deal is not about terror support one way or the other
@SenatorMenendez That's nice but PLEASE do everything you can to prevent Iran from getting a nurse weapon! #TheFightIsntOver
@SenatorMenendez It's a good deal /w international backing & 25yrs of 24/7 inspection requirements /w sanctions in case. #lookitup #irandeal
@SenatorMenendez STAY STRONG--WE IN NJ HAVE YOUR BACK--the #BadIranDeal is worse then expected  U R right to vote NO on the treaty

@SenatorMenendez  I don't understand why you won't support Obama's deal with Iran.
@SenatorMenendez initially for #IranDeal but reading your speech left with serious doubts.  Howvr, I doubt renegotiation posbl. Rdy for war?
@SenatorMenendez could your refusal to support the Iran initiative have anything to do with your two big donors and Aipac?
@SenatorMenendez But the bombs killing countless 1000's w/o a deal WILL,you corrupt,vindictive bastard. Here's to ur expedite prison wedding

@SenatorMenendez Sorry I should have tagged @tedcruz. Ted! Meet your friend Sen. Menendez. You two have so much in common on foreign policy!
@SenatorMenendez @tedcruz Alright I'll let you two chat. Meanwhile I'm going to go hang with @CoryBooker because he's speaking my language
@SenatorMenendez  if u vote no you lose my vote I will vote for any1 else but you on behalf of Israel after all the kids they killedin gaza
@SenatorMenendez Your zeal in opposing the @President and the #IranDeal, clearly shows how deep you're in the back pocket of special Intere.

@SenatorMenendez @LanceSilver1 Your still going to the Gallows! You didn't stop it! Nostradamus Prediction will wipe out our government.
@SenatorMenendez  kill this deal don't let the president sell out this nation to a country that wants to destroy us. Hear our voices
@SenatorMenendez @FNInsiders Thank you for standing tall against this farce of a deal!
@SenatorMenendez You are a joke.  Don't worry your vote means nothing since you'll be in prison. No one will remember how you voted.
@SenatorMenendez's vote on #IranDeal makes him a tool of Netanyahu. #betrayal #Treason #DINO
@SenatorMenendez I am very disappointed that you are voting against this. Please reconsider.
@SenatorMenendez 
What  dumb reason for your decision. Thank goodness Rep Jerry Nadler decided  the Iran Nuclear with reason not politics.
@SenatorMenendez if you like we can hake ur name on fiction bomb:)
@SenatorMenendez Because @Israel and the checks are in your name already!
@SenatorMenendez Myself and many New Jerseyans have urged you to support the deal. You have lost my vote.
@SenatorMenendez I really want Senator Menendez's team  back on the Foreign Relations Committee, especially if Obama's dealing with Cuba.
@SenatorMenendez  Senator Schumer also voted no. Iran deal is wrong. I don't want billions going to Iran for an Obama deal that won't work.
@SenatorMenendez 
Iran is not acquiring nuclear bomb with the carefully designed #IranDeal. #SenatorVoteNoWar
@SenatorMenendez 
But you are going to have your name on this!
@SenatorMenendez So instead, the inevitable new war in the middle east would have your name on it. #IranDeal #Diplomacy
@SenatorMenendez Aren't there enough wars, misery and refugees in the world for you? You may belong in some Senate, but not in the U.S. Sen.
@SenatorMenendez Be honest you fraud, Reason u and schumer vote no is your both in bed w/ special interest groups
@SenatorMenendez Menendez should be in jail awaiting trial on corruption charges and not opposing the President.  AIPAC rules Menendez.
@SenatorMenendez @PJStrikeForce THANK YOU,  SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ!
@SenatorMenendez @PJStrikeForce tell iran if you build a bomb we will end you
@SenatorMenendez @LahavHarkov Thank you! Someone needs to stop this insanity!

@SenatorMenendez Robert Menendez Offers Unrealistic Plan for Iran. He sold out to AIPAC.#IranDeal
@SenatorMenendez You're a traitor to you party, president and country. You're corrupt and I can't wait until you get thrown into prison.
@SenatorMenendez Thanks for your support! You show moral clarity! We need a bit more of that in today's world.
@SenatorMenendez I'm disappointed in you. You should APPROVE the President's #Iran deal. It's an important step toward regional stability.
.@SenatorMenendez - #AIPAC represents the interests of #Likud, not #Israel. And you should be representing #America.
.@SenatorMenendez - The campaign donations from #AIPAC will have your name on them.
@SenatorMenendez Thank you for not being a party politician but listening to the US people, facts and not into fear mongering.
I will NOT support @SenatorMenendez I support @POTUS and @JohnKerry

@SenatorMenendez Again, wrong side of history. Why the grandstanding against the President? #SupportIranDeal
@SenatorMenendez 

Keep up the fight---AP revealed secret UN deal with Iran re: monitoring---scandalous----
Kerry, Obama not trustworthy.
@SenatorMenendez you're a corrupt disgrace to the Democrats & it's time for you to go to jail
@SenatorMenendez #welldone #NoIranDeal as it's written.
@SenatorMenendez Thank you for this. Thank you for explaining why.
@SenatorMenendez So you'll vote no because no deal is a better deal?
@SenatorMenendez  .. You were right. The AP is confirming Obama has lied to the American people concerning the Iran deal.
@SenatorMenendez - you won't have your name anything except prison strips when you get convicted of fraud - real loser Mendi

@SenatorMenendez Israel has Nuclear weapons. I don't pay taxes for your ideological reasons. I'm an American. Ask a 5th grader what it means
@SenatorMenendez Can you vote from prison?
@SenatorMenendez That's exactly why we negotiated a deal! Are you living in an alternate universe? Really flawed position you're holding.
@SenatorMenendez I asked the DOD to add your name to every casket of our soldier who are killed as a result of your no vote. War not good.

@SenatorMenendez @RJCHQ We all know it'll have #Obama's name on it. But he'll be long gone, making money/trouble, lying, damaging elsewhere.
@SenatorMenendez thankyou senator!!
@SenatorMenendez  - We know the two reasons why voting No -

@SenatorMenendez You re substantially and philosophical wrong on the Iran accord and Cuba, Who pays you to be wrong?
@SenatorMenendez I think your NO vote is more about $ for your legal case the. About a nuclear Iran
@SenatorMenendez @DeatonCAPT Hopefully you can whip up some more of your colleagues to vote no, making your opposition much more meaningful
@SenatorMenendez. We were happy to see you defend the USA and stand AGAINT @TheIranDeal @marcorubio @HillaryClinton .

@SenatorMenendez is just bolstering his post-trial excuses for "why the @TheDemocrats persecute me". #IranDeal
