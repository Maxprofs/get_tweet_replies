@SenatorMenendez #CreateACrisis Like Open Border & disperse illegal aliens throughout USA unvaccinated, unchecked #DontShutDownOurSecurity
@SenatorMenendez DHS is nonessential since Barack told them to stop arresting #illegalimmigrants at the border.
@SenatorMenendez let me get this right the democrats are willing to shutdown DHS to protect illegal aliens who haven't been vetted.
.@SenatorMenendez You are a liar.  Ashamed to now call you my Senator.
ILLEGAL means ILLEGAL.You swore to uphold Constitution AND its laws!
@SenatorMenendez @Yolibeans If u think Senate DEMs filibuster=GOP manufactured crisis, #YouMightBeALiberal. Dilusions help u sleep?
@SenatorMenendez Dem's don't want to debate DHS funding because American people oppose their amnesty.#DefundAmnesty #DontShutDownOurSecurity
@SenatorMenendez So HOW did the illegals get here? Transporter ? Anyway did you see the President of Jordan? Now there's a REAL LEADER !
@SenatorMenendez Then why are you doing it?  Can't get by without those Illegal Alien Sex Offenders working for you?
.@SenatorMenendez So, why are Senate Dems manufacturing one by filibustering to protect Obama's exec #Amnesty order American ppl DON'T WANT?
@SenatorMenendez The D party is chasing Jewish voters away from the Party-w/Obama, keep counting!
@SenatorMenendez #2 - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! From the party that gets elected by blaming BUSH for everything!
@SenatorMenendez 
1. ignore laws as you see fit (Holder)
2. Blame Bush
3. DHS is a joke and ineffective to begin with
@SenatorMenendez So NOW you support building a fence.
@SenatorMenendez OH? What are you doing by running around yelling "The sky is falling?" now. You weren't worried last year! Fools!
@SenatorMenendez u mean as opposed 2 the REAL crisis of open borders w illegals streaming across in2 USA?
@SenatorMenendez Hah,dems believe in security? Weak on illegals,border,criminals,weak on national security/foreign policy,embolden enemies
@SenatorMenendez you are manufacturing a crisis, send them home to fix their own country, not turn ours into a craphole like theirs
@SenatorMenendez Have you talked to Mayor Deadfish about this? The entire Obama admin is a manufactured crisis. Lock you all up!
@SenatorMenendez  Pull POTUS back to the confines of his power, Congress can start repealing regs not enumerated to them...
@SenatorMenendez WTF? You won't secure the border, you let GITMO detainees out & NOW you are worried about security??
@SenatorMenendez OK, then stop doing it.
@SenatorMenendez just stfu! Take our guns, MILLIONs if illegals, releasing terrorists wily nily & Rs are a threat to security? That's rich.
@SenatorMenendez Whatever a democrat accuses you of, its cause they are doing it themselves #UndeniableTruths
@SenatorMenendez the crisis was made by potus and the dems. Defend the border don't look for future voters. Defend the constitution.
@Bill_ADON @SenatorMenendez Just fix it. Please.
@SenatorMenendez you are, plain and simple, an idiot!
@SenatorMenendez 1. Like Barack Obama 2. Like Dems blame Bush 3. Don't you have a hooker to proposition?
@SenatorMenendez that you manufactured dipweed
@SenatorMenendez Our national security is a farce which parades as an asset when it stands as an encumbrance. 
#DownWithDHS
@SenatorMenendez The. stop Obama's illegal alien crap. Fund everything but. Simple, stop playing games with our money. Vets 1st, Amer. 1st,
@SenatorMenendez @TheDemocrats #threatenedoursecurity when they allowed, in fact encouraged thousands of illegals to come into USA
@SenatorMenendez a Democrat = you lie - at all costs - to undermine our country, for political gain.  We have you all pegged.
@SenatorMenendez  I agree...we need to keep people from being able to hire illegal alien sex offenders!
@SenatorMenendez You know where problem lies- with America destroyer Obama.The 4 tril budget jeopardizes our children's future and beyond.
@SenatorMenendez How to manufacture a crisis? Demand a ton of money. Veto a bill when you don't get it. Blame others for your veto votes.
@SenatorMenendez You are the ones trying to shut it down to save Obama. We're not buying your lies.
@SenatorMenendez You  run out of underage girls to molest?
@SenatorMenendez Then don't filibuster!  Easy peasy. It's a clean bill.
@SenatorMenendez 
1) Sell guns to criminals
2) Allow them to "walk" across southern border
3) Try to take away SA rights

There, fixed it 4U
@SenatorMenendez You're right.  So you and POTUS ought to knock it off. 5 million illegals does NOT enhance our national security. @Lizz045
@SenatorMenendez funny coming from the guys who want to close Gitmo, limit gun rights and give amnesty to anyone!
LOL. Shameless â€” RT @SenatorMenendez Our national security is too important to create a manufactured crisis! #DontShutDownOurSecurity
Hey, @senatormenendez: Our Dept. of "Homeland Security" has been 'transformed' by #Obama into a Welcome Wagon for #illegals.

@SenatorMenendez Old memes not working, you guys (Dems) are now blocking the bill and will be responsible for any shutdown, not GOP.
Stop filibustering it. RT @SenatorMenendez Our national security is too important to create a manufactured crisis! #DontShutDownOurSecurity
@RBPundit @SenatorMenendez @michellemalkin Simple solution. Pass it, put it on O's desk & tell HIM #DontShutDownOurSecurity.

@trueman57 @SenatorMenendez You don't deserve a reply-moron
@littlebitgood @SenatorMenendez There are $343000 reasons from #Aipac. Yes I do not know what I am talking about.
.@SenatorMenendez nothing protects Natl Security like an open border policy for Terrorists, Ebola & Measles to enter
Our national security is too important to create a manufactured crisis! #DontShutDownOurSecurity 
@SenatorMenendez wow, try and stop and illegal act and all of a sudden republicans are at fault. You are the problem, not the solution.
@SenatorMenendez How is it you're not in prison?
@SenatorMenendez last time I checked it was Ds who voted against the bill so maybe you should look in the mirror
@SenatorMenendez Stop hiding behind "national security" just so you can step on fundamental rights that make this country what it is.
