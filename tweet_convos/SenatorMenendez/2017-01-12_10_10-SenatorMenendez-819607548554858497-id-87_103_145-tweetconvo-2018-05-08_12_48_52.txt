.@SenatorMenendez #BobMenendez Shame on you 4 voting against lower drug prices & The People. You don't Represent American Values. #NewJersey
Look at the salaries of the leadership of major insurance co.  They are in the millions.  Business should not trump lives!
I'm beyond disappointed that you, an alleged democrat, would bend over for #BigPharma. You're a crab ass puto
Tweeting about the importance of ACA while keeping drugs expensive.  Hypocrisy is politics as usual. We are watching.
Yet you voted against Bernie Sanders' amendment to lower prescription drug prices. You, sir, are a hypocrite.
Senator Mendez from NJ why did you voted NO to Bernie's amendment to allow drug imports from Canada?
@billeniumbeach @SenatorMenendez Standards don't mean shit when drugs are manufactured in India, Turkey, etc. & no one inspects
Its all excuses and obfuscation  all the time with this bunch of Dems
It really is unfuckingbelievable
yeah are these the ones that are getting it free??????
one way to #SaveACA is to oppose Rep. Price for HHS secretary.
then you and @CoryBooker should have voted for @BernieSanders and @amyklobuchar amendment for lowering Rx costs.
AND YOU VOTED AGAINST LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS! You are no better!
Whinner
Enjoy that big pharma money?  I'll enjoy voting against you. You don't seem to mind voting against us.
why did u vote against Sen Sanders amendment? Oh, right Big Pharma gave u 296k. Got it
Senator Mendez from NJ why did you voted NO to Bernie's amendment to allow drug imports from Canada?
and you could lose $$ from #bigpharma  http://leftgear.co/2017/01/13/pharma-13/ â€¦ #Pharma13 #lapdog
hey, 'member when you voted against allowing cheaper Canadian drugs in the US? I do and it invalidates every word you speak
sorry senator but I'm tired of paying for 3% of the pop that does not contribute anything. Your base is not my problem.MAGA
Take away the benefits for people voting against ACA.  They don't even want them.  It's their decision to make.
if you are so worried about health I think bringing cheaper meds from Canada sounds great, dont you? #SELLOUT
So why did you vote against affordable drugs? Money changes everything.
but why keep medication at a high rate by voting down the Klobuchar Amendment - if safety is a concern then please bring forth another bill
Senator. We all are calling on you and our Dems. to stop the repubs destroying our healthcare. My family and I are poor.
you are a republican in dem clothes - you and Booker are a New Jersey embarrassment
Losing ACA won't matter - we can't afford medicine anyway. btw, just where ARE all the dead Canadians?
you are a #turncoat #liar!  U voted to protect the profits of big Pharma over the health of this nation.  #fakeliberal
Shameful
Saying you're a neoliberal and a hypocrite is an oxymoron. #Pharma13
You voted against @BernieSanders for lower priced prescription drugs! SHAME SHAME SHAME ON YOU SENATOR! #FeelTheBern
Why did you vote against Bernie's amendment if you care so much about low income people????????? Hypocrite.
why did you vote against access to affordable Rx meds?#ThursdayThought #Pharma13
and thanks in part to you we also lost the chance to get more affordable drugs.  We see who you stand with and it's not us.
why?
why did your vote against lowering cost for medicine???
Why did you vote against drug imports from Canada? Very very disappointed
You've got your nerve talking about the ACA and GOP re ACA, you voted against making pharmaceuticals more affordable.
please keep fighting to insure the 22 million people who need it
please continue to fight. #SaveACA @Action2getherNJ
Gee, you know what'd be great for ppl losing health insurance? Cheaper prescription drugs! WHY'D YOU VOTE AGAINST IT, BOB?
Is it true?  Have you really taken $800k in donations from big phrma?
Combined with your successful vote to block lower drug prices it's a real one-two knockout punch.
You're not fooling anyone Bob.  Spare us on your concerns on ACA when you  and Booker voted against drug importation.


please explain why you voted against @BernieSanders amendment
so why did you vote " nay" for cheaper meds for NJ??? #hypocrite
We all lost the ability to have lower drug prices because of your vote last night. Hypocrite much?
is it ur concern for the American people that had u vote with your pockets? , one of ur constituents (for now)
why vote against cheaper prices for medicine?
Senator, Where are you on #WetFootDryFoot ? Obama is a rogue President & you say nothing. #Shameful
Why did you betray the 99%? #BigPharma own you or what? #WeAreWatching
And the rest of us that we're paying for those 11Million will catch a break #IfObamaCareWasSoGreatWhyArentYouUsingItSTFU
How can u be for saying save #ACA and screw us over on #Outrageous drug costs? #YouAreSatan
All talk. When it comes to action, your #BigPharma vote speaks louder than words. WE WILL REMEMBER! #Cowards #FAIL
right. So why did you vote against allowing prescription drugs from Canada??
trump taught them it is okay to lie to Americans for ease of vindictive behaviour. I don't like that direction.
If you cared about Americans' ability to access affordable healthcare, then you should have voted for Bernie's amendment.
why did you vote against Bernie's amendment? We expect an answer
I am so scared to think about what no #ACA means for me and my community. What can I do to help in fight to #SaveACA

Thank you for being as mad about this as I am.
Irony of course is that 78% of Americans like their healthcare. Some don't like Obamacare even though they can't define it.
