Thank you!, Sen. Menendez
Because you are playing politics - plain and simple
DID you?? they are getting in regardless. What is the point? Very dissappointed. Would love to see which Dem's voted yes.
Sessions? This should be an easy NO.  Or are u in a favor of a racist rubber stamp for trump AG? #DoYourJobBob
There is not a racist bone in Sessions' body. Need facts from past 30 years of service.
Are we not seeing the same facts?
@SenateDems you people are insane. You seem to lack common sense

Thank you!
YOUR NO VOTE IS A BIG MISTAKE!  HOPE YOU DONT REPEAT IT WITH GORSUCH!  2018 IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER!
@SenateDems #RESISTANCE #opposerepublicans #blockrepublicans #fightinequality
