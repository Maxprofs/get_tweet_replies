fight, fight, fight.
@SenSchumer But, more than half of your colleagues will vote yes on him et. al. The people will have to change all of this.
that's a good thing, in case you didn't know, ACA aka Obamacare is a failure for you socialist Communist progressive hacks.
THAT MAY BE A GOOD THING. AT LEAST YOU GUYS WON'T BE ABLE TO "BORROW MONEY" ANYMORE TO PAY OFF DEBT.
@SenSchumer well price can go pump sand. 50 million Srs will say. NOOOOOO

You Democrats have not stopped a single Trump Nominee to date WTF STOP PRICE No excuses this time

My husband & I cannot afford Privatized insurance if Medicare goes to that plan & will have to leave the US. He is a vet!
Why not work towards a solution rather than pretending the pig with lipstick is pretty!  Its broken, FIX IT!
Thank you!
no you are wrong AGAIN!
@SenSchumer Pls vote no!
#reps say- will save the taxpayer money it's a lie-tea party conservative Christian will defund agencies that protect us
Okay, Senator! it is so good to have you on the side of what's right and just and protects our planet. Thanks.
This is beneath you. Disagree on facts, not fictitious talking points. Cry "wolf" = people stop listening.
Thank you Sen. Menendez!
.@SenatorMenendez @CoryBooker can you reassure the people of NJ that you will fight to keep Medicaid intact in our state?
Progressive Communist Party USA (formerly known as Democrat Party) block @POTUS to raise money from radical base.
@SenSchumer & ur Party LIED abt ACA, Now we should believe u? Like Doc, Plan, lower cost? Hav u 4gotten already?
@senschumer Trump has alfeady helped. JUST HELP AMERICA ..AMSRICANS.FED UP.OBAMACARE ...TAXPAYERS.FUND IT U GUYS DID ZERO
privatize it. Not working well under government control now.
@SenSchumer good and next social security to keep your grubby hands out of our money
@SenSchumer don't you guys have ANY friends from the other side? Find one
@SenSchumer and taking 700 billion away for Obama care is a better idea?
@SenSchumer #Priceiswrong
@SenSchumer 
@SenSchumer Ur scare tactics r old, tired, don't work anymore. Get out from under Schmucky's desk and do ur job #whyyoulost
Just vote no on everything Bobby. Why show up anyway
@SenSchumer Please don't stop fighting for all of us on Medicare and Medicaid.
Like AG Sessions is he a wretched racist ex "friend" who you allowed to desecrate the US Senate for 20 years?
@SenSchumer your system does not work.  Get big gov out of my health care #powertothepeople. No big gov
@SenSchumer medicaid is out of control you disingenuous con man
He was nominated for this reason. Cuts & privatization are an @SpeakerRyan imperative. It's why he joined camp Trump.
.@senatormenendez @senschumer DNC folk - half the country is not listening.
their family was but got sick of these mentally unstable turds too
@SenSchumer stop spreading false news one day the dems are going to open their ears n you people can lie to yourselves
@SenSchumer stop your just partisan hacks! You have no interest in serious debate. Add menendez to the clown troop!
we also need safe patient ratios please pass S1280 #NJS1280 #safepatientratiosNJ
@SenSchumer do you, Bob, or any other person (Chuck), have definitive proof of this?  Not that fabricated stuff either.
everyday more and more doomsday speculation.
However, that is not leadership and THAT is exactly why they are there, to lead and set policy. FFS
@PamelamarobiPam Before any changes are made the Social Security Fund and the Medicare Fund must be repaid in full.
And WHO is going to enforce that? These weasels cant do much w o running to thump for advice.
@SenSchumer this is just wrong
@SenSchumer This administration seems to be all about privatization--aka using the government to get rich.  Guess who loses
lady I kno as a licensed counselor has no issues with medicaid. Someone is lying
@SenSchumer All the items they are seeking so quickly to change are geared to channel $ into their crooked pockets. #Resist
There millionars they don't care about the poor! They have health care!!
@cac_ac22 Thank you for standing for Democratic values.
- Go punch him !!!
@SenSchumer Menendez I would stay away from Schumer, he has a habit of taking other Dems down with his burning ship.
@SenSchumer @RepTomPrice of course he wants that. How else can he profit from that legislation?
@SenSchumer Thank you. Medicare and Social Security is where everyone draws a line in the sand
@SenSchumer not for those 55 and older and current members. Would be nice if u told entire story for a change!
@SenSchumer OK all of you white medicare recipients remember you voted for this lunatic.  He will tank your healthcare
What Did You Spend Your Voucher Already? Well We Sent it ...so U Must Have. School Voucher Too, sorry, bummer.
@SenSchumer To show solidarity, all congress persons voting to cancel the ACA, should voluntarily give up theirs.
@SenSchumer 
Food stamp health care. Only in America, once a great Nation....pre T-Rump
I agree Price is wrong for the post, but you're gonna have to get Rep Senators to vote w/ you. Thank you.
@SenSchumer Stand strong against Price !
Medicare is bankrupt.  Because Washington put so many I.O.U's in it.
@SenSchumer Thank you! As a resident of NJ, you haven't disappointed with your vote!
@SenSchumer repugs will never vote for the things that help citizens, they tear down the US NOT HELP IT. ALL TRAITORS
man you guys have these awesome slogans it must be hard work and that's why you aren't doing your job in Senate
@SenSchumer no thanks
@SenSchumer   They better not even try touching medicare
Proverbs 28:13
Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes [1/2]
them will obtain mercy. [2/2]
Thank you!
It's too late.
please save us Senator!!!
stop racist Trump.
Ignoramus!
Thank @SenatorMenendez. Knowing my State's Senators will do the right thing frees me to fight other upcoming battles.
No. He wants to block grant the funds and let the states dole out the money. We spend a trillion per yr on it. 

Good idea
so Bob when's your trail date
this hurts individuals with disabilities using Medicare as well.
Thank you! Vote now on Pruitt please
thank you for your NO vote!
Can we remind them all of Trump's promise that they won't touch SS/Medicare? It's on videotape!!!
thank you, Senator! you have my support!
 good job  senator
