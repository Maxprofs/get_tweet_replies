2. Russia's attempt to influence White House requires independent, bipartisan commission to investigate. GOP needs to come to terms w/ that
3. The President should stop calling Russia story a ruse, and start asking some tough questions of the people he has asked to serve him.
yes you are correct!  Keep the pressure on. Proud the you are from my state!
no, he should resign. This and his link to private prison companies are clear ethics violations
he should resign!
Sessions should resign. He can not be trusted as the Top Cop.
Kinda like Obummer should not investigate himself and all of the treasonous acts that he pulled! U make me ill!
Mr Sessions did recuse himself. You need to resign from office and face your indictment #DoTheRightThing
Agree! Thank you for representing me!
he's Treasonous Handcuffs are appropriate ! Enough is enough
he should RESIGN.
TY Senator. In light of yesterday's news please join @CoryBooker & others calling for #Sessions to resign @JoshGottheimer
Recusal is not enough. Call for resignation. #SessionsMustResign #Sessions
he lied under oath!  He needs to resign.
Recusal is just the beginning. We the public demand all the answers, and if that means investigation, then investigate!
How about Trump open an investigation into OBAMA DOJ slush funds to anarchists ...
oh you mean like Loretta Lynch did after she met Bill?
TU for your Sessions statement, but he must #ResignNotRecuse. Top cop can't lie under oath! Hope U will call for that.
Sessions should also resign.
How about we start worrying about the people's business? Enough of this distracting nonsense! Do your job!
@SenateDems and you should get the hell out of parlement
Sessions should be jailed for perjury
. @SenatorMenendez we need this pushed every day from you.
U lie 2 the american people. We r sick of illegal wars killing innocents. Stop demonizing Russians.
@CoryBooker #SessionsLied #SessionsMustResign
At least recuse, resign is more appropriate. Perjury is a crime.
Thank you for speaking out. #IndependentCommission #investigateSessions #investigate @WhiteHouse ties to Russia
@SenateDems  he needs to be totally axed and tried for treason
Senator he put himself under off he should be removed from office
keep the pressure up! Remember, presidents have been impeached for less!!!
insufficient. He lied under oath. He should resign or be impeached.

@SenateDems Another corrupt dem pointing his finger. You clowns did squat w/Holder & Lynch conflict of interest.
@SenateDems Shameful that you all could not stand for the wife of a fallen hero. Embarrassing!
@SenateDems resign yourself we need people to help turn this country around thanks to obamas misguided orders, retire quit
why are you even in office when you've been investigated multiple times for corruption - YOU should be out of office
@SenateDems the way Lynch recused herself? Hypocrites. Investigate the Hillary fiasco. Jail for perjury! Treason
@SenateDems RETIRE
In the case of Hillary Clinton, the reverse happened. Obama told the AG not to investigate her even though she is guilty.
Stop lying, stop hating America stop hating OUR president Stop your wish for a communist sharia Law U.S.
pls see 18 USC 1621-perjury re Sessions
@SenateDems 
Should resign.
.@SenatorMenendez This isn't just about an inability to be impartial, this is about perjury.  We must demand #SessionsResignNOW
More than that he should resign. If we had any trust, which most of us didn't , it's gone. #Trumprussia
@SenateDems No, Sen. Menendez, AG Sessions should RESIGN for perjuring himself. #RESISTANCE #SpecialProsecutor
More! He needs to resign.
@SenateDems Good, now change that to "should be prosecuted"
Yes! We need a #SpecialProsecutor and a select committee investigation of 45"s ties to #Putin #Russia
Did you have the same insight with AG Holder?
@SenateDems Why? You guys never had the first problem with the Obama WH doing it. Ever. Hypocrisy, Democrats = synonyms
Thank you! On the heels of @HouseGOP voting no on T's taxes shows they're digging own graves.
he should resign!  He lied under oath!  #Standup #SpeakUp  #Persist
@SenateDems Honorable Senator Menendez could we please get to the hillarys emails which was originating point..
*screams at the top of his lungs* "BUT HILLARY!!!!!"  Lol the "but Hillary" defense the rescue!
@RussiaConnects u on treason trial within the World.U allowed militant atheism groups to Wage war illegal acts
Sorry sir, he should resign or be fired.
If he perjured himself, he needs to resign and face charges. We are expecting that you & @CoryBooker will NOT let this go.
THE @GOP MUST BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE! THEY'VE ALREADY LIED FOR TRUMP & ILLEGSLLY OBSTRUCTED VOTING RIGHTS
@jeannejordan_ thank u for common sense
Just as AG Lynch did after secret meeting with WJC on a tarmac. Did you call for a special prosecutor in HRC matter?  No!!!
Sessions should resign or be removed. An investigation should take place and he should be charged with perjury.
What about the speculation that the Russian Amb recruited Sessions, Flynn and Page?  How involved was Churkin w/ Trump RIP
step up your game Senator!
I believe we need an investigation Senator.
What did Christie Know?
drip, drip, drip....
