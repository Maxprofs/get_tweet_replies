.@SenatorMenendez @SenFeinstein @SenSchumer Y'all can't introduce a bill but confirm Jeff Sessions and think no one is watching #MuslimBan
Also start filibustering!  No ban, no bills!
so was Obama's ban in 2011 also a #MuslimBan? Same countries!
#ImpeachTrump
THERE IS NO #MUSLIMBAN! STOP FEAR-MONGERING AND SPREADING LIES! 2018 IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER!
@SenateDEMS better start fighting for us, or pay for it down the line.
Thank you for opposing #MuslimBan. Please vote against AG nominee Jeff Sessions. I am an NJ voter.
No on Sessions,  Please stand up for what is right.  #NoBanNoWall
Thank you! Stay focused & keep fighting! Also, #NoSessions #NoDeVos #NoMuslimBan
If you vote for Sessions, expect to lose your seat.
Thank you Democratic Senators.  Keep up the pressure.  You must not let up! #NoWallNoBan
Please also vote against Sessions's confirmation. It is crucial.
please vote no on all remaining cabinet nominations
/ You are under Federal Corruption Charges/ You still fail answer that Question
No on Sessions would be beneficial to immigrants and refugees too!
REVEALED: Trump registered EIGHT new companies in Saudi Arabia during US campaign
there never was a Muslim ban & "unAmerican" makes you all sound like Joe McCarthy. 1/2
That makes you a lot scarier than @realDonaldTrump 2/2
the so called Muslim ban, may not be politic,but it is legal and at the presidents discretion. Do ur job whole you have it!
thank you! #NoBanNoWall
Dems should refer to Trump/Ryan/McConnell as cowards afraid of Syrian women and children
Sirs--U R wrong--Trump simply enforcing Obama era laws.
It's NOT a Muslim ban! You're putting illegals over Americans.
pls withhold consent on Sen business until EO ended. No votes on noms, filibuster bills #withholdconsent #NoBanNoWall #NJ
Opps, I worded that wrong!  No Justice, No Bills!  Filibuster every step of the way when you can!
Fight to show Republicans that choosing Party over Country doesn't Work We need them to fight him
now fight against #sessions. Will be as bad for country as the executive orders.
I urge you withhold permission for cabinet hearings or BAU until the illegal order is rescinded.
Do you think they'll enforce it? Don't let your legislation be in vain. Oppose Sessions.
are you still the Senator.. i thought you were in jail... i have to pay more attention..

/ Okay follow this genius it's not a Muslim Ban / it applies to 7 countries/ Same as was done 2011
No ban, no wall, no Sessions, no DeVos, no Trump! Impeach this madman atfirst opportunity PLEASE.
You were voted into office to repr. the NJ voter- not to oppose our President. STOP grandstandin
This constituent thanks you, and I hope you are also voting NO on Sessions!
@SenBookerOffice  @SenateDems @SenatorMenendez @SenFeinstein @SenSchumer VOTE #NoSessions - don't allow #vote at all! #StandUpToTrump
Please keep fighting Senators!  Thanks, from your constituents.
Thank you for standing up for us. Vote NO on SESSIONS!
thank you for opposing Trump's illegal ban!
And please vote NO on Sessions for AG.
It is temporary!  Get over it!  @realDonaldTrump  is trying to protect us!
Let's not forget that it was Miller, longtime Sessions aide, who drafted the EO. #NoOnSessions
Oppose it, but please distinguish Trump's awful rhetoric and actual policy.  Not a Muslim ban.
thanks! Can we now assume you will oppose sessions if he comes to a vote?

No more empty talk! We must have action against this atrocity!  Do not let the GOP steamroll you
