Before #Irma the electric grid was already a disaster from DECADES of the UNIONS RUNNING it!
@POTUS wasn't even in gov. then.
#PuertoRico
3)
drivers are on strike!
Put the blame on the LEADERSHIP in #PuertoRico . Ppl like the Mayor of San Juan who idolizes Chavez & Maduro, not @POTUS .
6)
What's frustrating is ppl who r CORRUPT like u r still allowed 2b in office while you've been under indictment 4 past 3 yrs. #PuertoRico
7)
#PuertoRico has had DECADES of POOR LEADERSHIP. They had a $9B Debt before #Maria hit. You can't blame that on @POTUS .
5)
but to be fair.. at that point he didn't know that there was an ocean betw PR and the mainland
ah sorry.. cheap joke at a serious time. apologies
It is a serious time, but you weren't laughing at the people's suffering. Trump is a joke. A very dangerous joke.
Yes indeed he is
You are a LIAR!
@POTUS had help at the docks even before #Irma . 3k containers can't be moved bc of Liberal Trucker's Union.
#PuertoRico 
1)
Governor of PR is thanked DJT Admin. I suggest the #FakeNews pay attention to the facts they put out on PR ; .
I thought that Puerto Rico it's not a USA state.
The Union leadership turned away volunteer electric workers during #Irma bc they weren't in the #PuertoRico Union.
Stop blaming @POTUS !
2)
#PuertoRico has 78 municipalities, each w/ their own Mayors..most are DEMOCRATS. The UNIONS are having a political fight w/ Gov.
4)
@POTUS
In his defense, @realDonaldTrump might not have known Puerto Rico was part of the US till someone told him.
Why are you NOT in jail???
Why are they are problem how about helping. People here
How is your trial going?
So tell your constituents exactly what you would have done if you were in his place.
Follow @DCRoachsays
Tell it like it is, Senator!
Hey criminal...while you are on trial for corruption and theft, Trump was authorizing this
Can u say jailbait bob
Why are they doing all they can to prevent Trump from helping
I agree
What in hell did you expect him to do?!
Don't drop the soap dope.
Did you stop by Dominican after PR ????
He didn't respond because he was consumed with Football and flag. He is a lying pig of a man.
Bob Menéndez never care about Puerto Rico, never help Puerto Rican's... so i wonder what's his agenda? You still have a trial going on. Wtf?
That what I said to myself when I heard this madness of a news... Hi 
Albert, Menéndez just want the focus of his dirty secrets. Like having sex with under age girls in Dominican Republic of him & focus in PR
Your Right
You could have checked before hurricanes 2 ensure readiness. Not enough to call the #DonaldTheIncompetent
on his BS aft the fact. Shame him.
Never let a good crisis go to waste right you flop Menendez? Trump was golfing during the hurricane and aftermath wait..NO. That was #Obama
Democrats can never prop themselves up without lies, identity politics and accusing other people of doing horrible things.

By all means continue donations and assistance, but military needs to allocate drivers to help solve this problem. Puerto Rico is America.
I thought that Puerto Rico it's not a USA State.
Liar. I assume you are a Democrat?
Oh. You are that guy up on criminal charges. Rich coming from you.
trumph es un irresposable
You shouldn't lie like you are but then lieing fits in with the liberal agenda. That's all you have left, lies and deceptions.
they let you out of you federal corruption trial to go PR ?   are you even allowed to leave the state ?
Remember: escaping to PR won't help you because it's part of the US, Crook.
What's it like to be a dirty, scummy criminal?  Everyone, don't be a BOB!
Choose your battles wisely, Senator. #GetTheFactsFirst
Why are they even allowing you out of the lower 48?
Shouldn't you be headed for jail A sitting Senator on trial for bribery ought keep a low profile You failed your constituents badly CROOK
Stop politicizing this event. Help the People of Puerto Rico, without trying to gain points for yourself
I’m frustrated you are not yet in jail enjoying married life with Brucie
...and what did you do?
Why why why ? Advise from a Trump supporter your butt is in enough trouble running your mouth about the prez brings attention to your crimes
That's rich coming from a criminal! Can't wait for you to see the inside of a jail cell! Stop trashing #MYPOTUSTRUMP 
#CrookedDem
Why did democrats send 150 billion to Iran for infrastructure instead of a Puerto Rico?
.@SenatorMenendez are you going to PR for bribes or underage girls?
Lying thief
Your only intended purpose: to criticize Trump.
Are you not a senator from New Jersey? Why the grand standing?
The Puerto Rican government kicked out the Navy to pay for its employees and @POTUS signed emergency aide before the hurricane arrived #MAGA
Your corruption case is as slam dunk as it get!! You do favors and receive gifts. The friendship excuse could be used by every crooked pol!!
Shut up Criminal !
Soon it won't be Puerto Rico  it will be a federal penitentiary hopefully.
You’re going to jail for corruption 
I'm frustrated Trump still hasn't nominated anyone for half of the FEMA jobs he gets to give out.  8 months.  Hell, get Brownie back?
Aren't you supposed to be at a trial? #tripping
Idiot 45 will never!! Why are you surprised by this SHIT SHOW?!
So you are liar on top of corrupt?
You are going to be in a cell BOB!  Being bubba's boyfriend.  Can't wait for that! 
You're showing just how much that you are a desperate man who's on his way to prison. Spewing nothing but lies.
Going to Puerto Rico to see how much money you can skim for yourself? You're the last person Puerto Ricans need.
Trump tiene la culpa de todo, quien jes va a creer eso?
Yeah, how was it not already in the works? We knew it was going to hit.
We are all frustrated. TRUMP should've sent in military to organize relief and sent planes to drop supplies, food&water on Day 1!
The planes were probably being used by his administration to vacation somewhere.
They better put a tracking chip in this felon.... 
What a stupid statement, send help/supplies so they get blown away & destroyed too? GO TO JAIL, GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL, DO NOT PASS GO...
Senator, are you saying he should have sent supplies to be destroyed?
Liar. Much being done.
The intentional Trump delays are grounds for impeachment
To be fair, he thought they were foreigners. He just found out they are American Citizens
Hope they've got an ankle bracelet on you before you leave the country.
NJ tax payers aren't paying you to take another Caribbean trip. As far as Maria goes,did you want assets in place to get destroyed by storm?
Just go to Jail Bob, they're the only ones that want ya now,,,not even Pourto Ricans want your criminal ass down there
If you go to jail, you should be ashamed of putting the party at such a disadvantage in the Senate!
america has failed Puerto Rico. america failed the Borinqueneers
You are a corrupt politician. Go to jail!

Thank you for speaking the truth. @realDonaldTrump knew 3.4M #American citizens were going to get hit with a hurricane. #puertorico
I agree. Ships and planes should have been sent immediately.  Get h20 & electricity going.
He did act... help had to wait for the storm to pass.... do you realize there aren't any roads to Puerto Rico from the USA?
Cállate corrupto
You expected the KKK Administration to care about brown ppl? All the kneeling criticism n not one word on cops killing black people.#impeach
Surprised you aren’t classed as a flight risk.
Are u even allowed to leave the area  or are they monitoring u with an ankle bracelet ?
ANKLE BRACELET RESCUE BRIGADE, saving hurricane victims in exchange for a lighter sentence?
The Dirty Dog is Yap'n Again, but Not For Long!

BAD NEWS for Menendez on Day 13 in Trial of Corruption & Bribery —Damning Evidence presented linked Menendez to Multitude of Criminal Acts. 
Sucks to be you Bob.  Quit trashing @POTUS  did you say this much about Hussein Obama while he played golf during the disaster in N.O. .?
As I dig deeper into ur corruption and get shocked at what I find, I'm frustrated the @FBI didn't act the instant we knew you were on trial.
By the way you're profile pic is very fitting for what's about to happen. If the FBI was about to arrest me this is the face I'd make:
This is gonna be you in any any second. Can't wait!
No he only had to deal with 2 hurricanes in a week on the mainland you know while you were on trial.
It was cat 1 at best you blow hard
Your still guilty
Why aren't you in prison yet

Bob... worry about your court case!
I'm frustrated that you did favors for buddies using your position&whatever you did with hookers on tax payers dime.Thanks4the moral lecture
What did u want him to do u tell me how u would have stopped the hurricane
Crawl back in your hole senator
But I'm really frustrated that I'm on trial for corruption!
Get a job!
This clown an opportunity to loot while no ones around, something tells me he was comped the air fare as well. #thiefingovt
The difference between ordinary citizens & Congress
The're allowed to leave to leave country when on trial for Corruption

I would prefer not spending one penny of my tax dollars to send you anywhere but jail 
AMEN !!!!!!!
Say what??? Who is this corrupt politician to lecture @realDonaldTrump??
Crooked Menéndez, you're gonna be found guilty.
You are a CRIMINAL You Should Not Be Allowed To Go 
Hey Bob if u went to PR would u be looking to@score with some under age girls?  Just askin since I heard ur into that.
Bob , I'm a little frustrated that your not in a jail cell .
You not in jail yet
...
It's sad that the Dems are using PR as a bash Trump gig
Exactly!
Complete lie.
You didn't act "instant." Its an an #iSLAND for God's sake. Do Something or shut up.  Traveling isnt doing anything but causing more issues
Lets see, you bash Trump but the PR governor says he has talked with Trump daily and has gotten everything asked of him. Who to believe hmm
Senator, did you know @fema was in PR before last storm hit? Didn't  press conference today? It's an island & bad shape before Irma & Maria
Not fair remember PR is an island cannot be helped as quickly as Texas or Florida
According to the Governor of Puerto Rico, they did exactly just that.  You should be more worried about going to jail soon.
You shouldn’t be allowed to leave without an electronic monitoring device.
If trump was a “D” you wouldn’t make it An issue
You misspelled "as I head to jail..."
Why is our NJ Senator the 'expert' on Puerto Rico?  #Agenda
http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/09/27/tons-of-food-water-and-medicine-is-sitting-at-a-port-in-puerto-rico-while-people-suffer/amp/ …

Get Puerto Rican truck drivers to show up for work and distribute the supplies. Easier to bash @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Bob is trying to teach class in "morals" 

That's rich coming from YOU of all people, BOB.

Don't be like Bob.
You're going to jail dude 
only place u r gonna to go is straight to prison. do not pass go, u r done stealing the taxpayers money
Shut up Bob, you do know..... you have the right to remain silent..... maybe just not the common sense to
Recovery should have been readied before the storm even hit.  This response is a disgrace. #PuertoRico #TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
Excellent !
Wait...what? This dude is on trial ...no? WTF.
Forget Puerto Rico - go straight to jail !!!
https://twitter.com/Thomas1774Paine/status/913539166234963970 …. Haha
Menendez would've been in PR days ago if didn't have to get permission from DOJ to leave the country. Can't make this stuff up. Corrupt Dems https://twitter.com/SenatorMenendez/status/913536110181089280 …
You are on trial for stealing stop your garbage talk. Enjoy the trip soon in jail
Eye doctor "appointment?" 
Look at this idiot Democrat complaining about President yet didn't do shit to help. Just another fake outrage 
Well,you jus gonna have to be frustrated being you made no efforts at all,be glad you get to go show your support for TRUMP.
Oh goody time for politics.
Why the hell isn't this man chained to a wall awaiting his death sentence. Y'know, like in the  movies! LOL
What-a-douche!!!
and the leadership in #PuertoRico knew their infrastructure was shit but pissed away 100 billion dollars! Corrupt like you.
Except he did, but we know you are a little busy on trial for bribery and stuff so you aren't up on the news, Bob.
What did YOU do???!? #PuertoRicoSeLevanta STOP with the political crap!! #UnitedForPuertoRico #LeadByExample 
But the trial, the trial ...
.stay away from the young girls.

#Menendez is the first sitting senator in 36 years to face a federal corruption trial — but the media won't cover it http://bit.ly/2wG0tf4 
Why is the DOJ allowing you to leave the country in the middle of your criminal trial?
Well isn't this ironic! @SenatorMenendez is on trial for corruption
Wait hold on this dude is still a Senator why hasn’t he resigned? Absolutely no coverage on this I guess democrats can steal from Medicare.
What was he supposed to do? Stop the storm?
Looking forward to seeing you in prison.
He did Ahole! Why aren't you in jail?
Hey Bobby,  guess the judge gave you a pass for the weekend
Deflect, deflect, deflect. You are a crook!
Stop the criticism-where were you before the hurricane hit / that's right-court on bribery charges.  How is that going?
Good one
Me either they could have sent the military to clear the roads and put up temp bridges and more all within a week.
No he was tweeting about football players constitutional right and calling thier moms names now that is leadership
Like your post! We would like to invite you to see a cartoon about Trump.

Thank you
Big man Frank, yelling at women on the internet. You swear to god?! NO! YOU
YOU DARE?!?!
