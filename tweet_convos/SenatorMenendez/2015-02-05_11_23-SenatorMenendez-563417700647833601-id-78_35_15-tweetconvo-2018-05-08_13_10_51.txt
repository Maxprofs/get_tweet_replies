.@MarineReconDad @SenatorMenendez Same logic, but these people MUST feel like they have done something even if it does nothing. #gunsense
@MarineReconDad @SenatorMenendez We all know that's the way they work.
@MarineReconDad @SenatorMenendez HELL NO!
@A_M_Perez @SenatorMenendez time to boot this jackoff out of office! His state needs to wake up.
@SenatorMenendez Make your bodyguards give up arms. Then we can discuss merits of limiting self defense of good citizens. #SayNo2MoreAmmo
If limiting guns to 10 rounds is such a great idea, why don't Govt hacks like @SenatorMenendez limit magazine capacity for LE & military?#2A
@SenatorMenendez they also allow me to defend myself without giving the intruder time while I reload. Ever think of that? And why 10?
Don't get your panties twisted @SenatorMenendez you are NOT serving the people of NJ. You are infringing on our #2A rights
@SenatorMenendez. Yep isis uses them all the time so go tell them to disarm . #2A
@SenatorMenendez Gun control not about saving lives. It's about control over We The People. Liberals never let a good crisis go to waste.
Please define & source your claim: "The vast majority of Americans support this common-sense measure" @SenatorMenendez #gunsense #facts
@CulperSpyRing @dadsagainstmda @SenatorMenendez The "vast majority" must be these blue areas
@RandomHero30 @CulperSpyRing @dadsagainstmda @SenatorMenendez don't  hold your breath until he answers. Vast majority of what people
@SenatorMenendez Make it easier for everyone to carry guns so we can shoot back at the few crazy people you're worried about. Problem solved
@SenatorMenendez > As UR of #Cuba heritage, remember @FidelCastro! @opinionslikeblp @Ruach32 #WakeUpAmerica
@SenatorMenendez This is truly a dumb statement.
@SenatorMenendez stop punishing us citizens. Criminals don't follow laws. You're only affecting us law abiding citizens.
@SenatorMenendez GET OFF THIS SOAP BOX and move on!
@SenatorMenendez what happens next? No knives outside the kitchen? How about no killer cars outside the garage? #traitor #morons #idiots #2A
@SenatorMenendez because we ALL know that criminals will obey the law and use only "approved magazines" with 10 rounds or less. #gunsense
@SenatorMenendez suck a dick you liberal fucktard
@SenatorMenendez upon reading your #tweets for the first time, I've concluded, you're a complete moron; congrats NJ! #shallnotinfringe
@SenatorMenendez The odds of you being hit by a meteorite while being eaten by a shark are greater than you dying because of a 30 round mag
@SenatorMenendez fact law abiding gun owners don't need any more regulation criminals do.
@SenatorMenendez There is no logic here, this does NOTHING but harm the law-abiding gun owner.
@SenatorMenendez And going with underage prostitution, in Dom.Rep. Can be detrimental to your health.
@SenatorMenendez didn't this die on the governors desk last year? Your useless
@SenatorMenendez this country has already had an mag cap in the 90's. It didn't stop anyone hell bent on causing the death of another person
@SenatorMenendez Not really. You can run 10-round mags through an AR-15 like nothing. Stop trying to criminalize all of us.
@SenatorMenendez Will they prevent Senators from getting hookers? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/bob-menendez-prostitute/ â€¦
@brstanley33 that is alright he has his own harem
@SenatorMenendez Ability is not intent. Gang thugs will always have them. #2A
@SenatorMenendez No, they do not. Mag changes take one second, or less. This is an abject lie. #SayNo2MoreAmmo
@SenatorMenendez Lets #SayNo2 you control freaks in DC!!! @IamTheWindowMan
@RCamsore @SenatorMenendez You've been hording domestic amo for years, so hi-cap mags couldn't be used to defend ourselves for tyranny. @GOP
@SenatorMenendez Mag laws are easily circumvented. Useless waste of our taxpayer money.
@SenatorMenendez so NJ is unsafe with your restrictions. Stop trying to ruin my state too
@PRoseish_2 @SenatorMenendez I think he means standard capacity magazines. He also says no to more freedom. #gunsense
.@gunmaster0702 @PRoseish_2 @SenatorMenendez More freedom would mean he has less power and control. Of course he wants less freedom.
@PRoseish_2 @SenatorMenendez Mag bans are not commonsense; who the hell is the Gov to tell me  I need X bullets #gunsense #sayno2moreammo
@SenatorMenendez @NM_libertarian I'm sure that came from his PC (communist) staff. We know, and we've had enough.
@SenatorMenendez Seung-Hui Cho used 10 and 15 round mags at VaTech, many found with rounds unused. Gun Free Zone left students defenseless
@SenatorMenendez @NM_libertarian Idiotic rights grabbing significantly increases chances you won't be reelected.
This man doesn't need to be a Senator again. @SenatorMenendez

Bet he's a #LelandYee fan.
Guns for me, not for thee
High-capacity magazines significantly increase a shooter's ability to kill many people quickly. Let's #SayNo2MoreAmmo http://1.usa.gov/1AwG646 
@SenatorMenendez there is no such thing as a "high capacity" magazine. There's only standard, and fun sized.
@SenatorMenendez if you had half a clue on what you're talking about I'd be amazed.
They have almost no bearing on it, you poltroon. Virginia Tech and Isla Vista killers used 10 round mags
@SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez "common sense measures" when tied to #2ndamendment attacks = Democrat code for "we know better than you America."
@SenatorMenendez typical anti #2ndamendment bill to limit ammunition is pure political theater. Why do you love #BigGovt so?
There is no clinical evidence supporting ur claim.Also,most gun related violence involves < 4 shots fired.Try being honest
@SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez SANDY HOAX.
@SenatorMenendez NO, you are putting law abiding persons with disabilities who cannot reload as quickly at increased risk. IRRESPONSIBLE!
@SenatorMenendez #SayNo2MoreAmmo
Let's say no more condoms than 3 for underage South American girls.
@SenatorMenendez Disappointed that you don't  stand behind hardworking Americans and vote to pass DHS funding and defund illegal amnesty
@SenatorMenendez  Don't be a #marxist by accident
"Going Rouge" RT @infidelmonster: @SenatorMenendez  Don't be a #marxist by accident
@SenatorMenendez you've tapped into viper pit of pro gun proponents. More guns = misery & innocent deaths. USA #GroundhogDay #dumbgoodguys
@SenatorMenendez You do not have my support for your arbitrary magazine limit senator. I live in New Brunswick, NJ.  Thank you.
@SenatorMenendez let's say no to a solicitor of under age prostitutes, bribes erc, Keep ur hands off of second amendment rights!
You're very deluded if you believe limiting capacity will be reduce death counts

@SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez No empirical evidence, just typical ignorance-based rhetoric. You are why #guncontrol is a dying religion. #gunsense
.@JamesMAvery @SenatorMenendez 

#gunsense has narrative, not data. That's why they keep having to rebrand after they're shamed.
@SenatorMenendez so why take mine away from me? #sayno2moreammo #gunsense
@RD_MOLONLABE @SenatorMenendez Because you may not realize it, but you're going to kill people. Lots of them. <smh> #gunsense
US Homicide Rate is 5/100K. Newark, NJ is 34/100K, w strict gun laws. Mag limits? #gunsense @5ugarcane @RD_MOLONLABE @SenatorMenendez
Sounds oddly like the Monty Python Holy Hand Grenade Bit. #gunsense @_Tom_Bishop @5ugarcane @RD_MOLONLABE @SenatorMenendez
@SenatorMenendez and your point is?
@SenatorMenendez Millions of people own high capacity magazines. Limiting them does nothing.
