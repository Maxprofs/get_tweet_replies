He broke the law.
let's arrest trumpet see how it feels are what lie he tells & on who!
He was caught in a drug house his father ran! If you get caught in a drug dealers house they arrest you!
ALERT #AMERICANS....THIS SENATOR WORKS FOR YOU, NOT #ILLEGALFOREIGNERS. YOUR TAXES ARE SO HIGH BECAUSE OF #ILLEGALS.
There is no sacrifice in coming legally. Illegals are the ones who carry the heavy weight!
America was founded by immigrants & he's become a tax paying, contributing member to society. What else you want?
Your #DEMOCRATIC PARTY has lost their minds. Your hatred for your fellow law abidding #HARDWORKINGAMERICANS is DISGUSTING.
Your duty, forget politics, is to remove Trump
please, get busy
Hey Democratic you don't work for #Illegals. You work for ONLY THE AMERICAN PPL. We pay your salary thru our high taxes.
@SenSchumer They shouldn't be able to tear families apart for no reason.   Stop this.
They r not tearing families apart. They knew this could happen when they came illigally.
I believe it was stated ONLY criminals would be deported! What gives here?
If u came illegally. U r a criminal.
An admitted gang member who was picked up w/a group of other gang members. Not really DACA material is he?????
wasn't picked up with gang members you need slapped for telling lies your racism is apparent
Yeahhhhh. How about you read some of the news reports available that aren't #MSMsucks.
-STOP W/THE DRAMA SENATOR! ENFORCE #TRUMP'S LAWS AND HELP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #TRUMP #MAGA
Americans read he admitted to being a gang member. But you rich #DEMS living in your mansions don't care. #GEORGESOROS
@mskimreynolds illigal is illigal. They knew when they came they were breaking the law. Makes them criminals.  Deport!!!!!!
He' a Gangbanger! Here illegally. Stop prioritizing criminals over citizens & LEGAL immigrants. It's disgusting!
@SenSchumer Try looking at truth and quit lying and exaggerating everything
Discrimination,only targeting Latin American  immigrants, they never go after white illegals immigrants from Europe.
I don't see many Europeans crossing the Mexican border. Have you?
they arrive by plane, and stay illegal! 
it is completely wrong. Where are Melanie's papers.
trump is the criminal President
HE IS THE MEMBER OF A CRIM.GANG[SAME LAW AS THE BIKER GANGS]????
..how would you know he has no arrests?
..have you investigated his activity in LA?
Your #DEMOCRATIC PARTY has lost their minds. Your hatred for your fellow law abidding #HARDWORKINGAMERICANS is DISGUSTING.
You are a LIAR!!
Gang affiliation
@K3vinFox Hey Bob, how's your criminal indictment coming along?
I agree that thisis wrong
@mskimreynolds U need to do the job u were elected to do. Enforce our laws... Or resign!!!
@SenSchumer doesn't he have gang affiliation as indicated by his social media and his own confession? Senator, knock it off
ITS NOT WRONG. HE IS "I L L E G A L". deport immediately.
You say Daniel Ramirez Medina has no criminal record.  ICE says he is a gang member.  So, adios!
we are not going to let this happen - protest are being planned @jerseycity.
@SenSchumer it's time to return to being a Country of laws
sorry  do not agree-his parents knew they were wrong they should  have come here legally
The WH bullies like all bullies pick on the weak and vulnerable This not America Its N Korea
I agree you should have been just as outraged when obama was deporting people but hey, your hypocrisy knows no limits
gang member, quit spreading fake news
And yet for all that vetting they're still illegal.
@SenSchumer A GANG member is vetted? You vowed to enforce laws! Do your job!
@SenSchumer @SenSchumer President Trump vowed CRIMINAL illegal immigrants deported! You're promoting violence w/comments!
"Vetting" my ass!
Here's an Idea.. why don't you join him in Mexico? Go scream your demands there!
You are an embarrassment to America!
@SenSchumer oh my god this has to be stopped !!!!
@SenSchumer DEPORT HER
will the 3rd lady be deported?   Her family?
He's here ILLEGALLY and a gang member. Come here LEGALLY or Get Out
@SenSchumer wrong he is a gang member. It was on the news today.
Only if you relocate this self admitted gang member to your neighborhood
So. let him go in whichever country he came from.
Well, the courts ruled otherwise on DACA.  Elections have consequences, right? Isn't that what Pres Obama said?
@senschumer YOU BETTER LOOK UP VICTIMS OF ILLEGALS MEMORIAL..YOU DONT CARE ABOUT AMERICANS ..WE WILL FIGHT FOR OUR OWN
@senschumer in one state alone 4,197 illegals molested OUR CHILDREN NC JAN 15 500 SEX KIDNAP KIDS ILLEGALS WHERE WERE U???
Open your eyes
Please sir fight for him!
Come on Bob! He admits he is in a gang. Deport him. Frankly, I don't care that he arrived as a kid. We owe him nothing.
@SenSchumer let's adopt Mexico's immigration policy. Look it up fellas.It's more than fair.If Mexico feels this way,why not
The ICE agent can't even look. She must be a mother.
@SenSchumer it started when his parents refused to go thru the proper process of citizenship. Illegal is what it is.
Helpful Americans will relocate and/or hide DACA recipients who have previously registered. #BreachOfContract
@SenSchumer please fight, fight, fight!
So, are you legal?
@SenSchumer chuck, if you disagree with a law, then introduce new legislation. How is this hard, Chuck???
no. Obey the law. For you can ignore any law, then laws have no meaning.
@SenSchumer is it the law or not?  We are a nation of laws, which are black or white, nothing about gray laws
How come U support the End of the Cuban Policy, but all these #Illegals U accpet. #IllegalsVote
But You would Arrest #AmericanCitizens. They are NOT UNDOCUMENTED They are #Illegals #Deport #Hooray
@SenSchumer That's not happening!  CRIMINALS are the ones being rounded up.  #scaretactics #tellthetruth
UMMM did you check to see if he committed a crime? fear mongering doesn't become you.
should end in jail...she broke a Federal law. HER CRIME WAS STAYING HERE ILLEGALLY AND NOT BECOMING A CITIZEN .
She grew up and didn't try to become a citizen, she voted and knew you had to be a citizen....her sob story..
Arrest him. Illegal is not our problem. Could we go to his country and get free education? AMericans first
DACA gives free education to ILLEgals while USA wait for class over crowding and pay $100,000 in tuition,
@SenSchumer What part if illegal have you guys forgotten about. There is a legal way to migrate here. No lawbreakers
we should have more important issues 2 deal with!?
. How about criminal and stupid.  Trump = Gestapo
If you jerks would work this hard to solve the immigration problem I would back you, but you don't and I don't.
@SenSchumer This should be illegal and not just wrong.
Send the whole family back so as not split them up. All illegals are criminals to start with
illegals R law breakers/criminals & must abide by the laws of the land like all citizens No special treatment 4 illegals
Hope you will vote across party lines when time comes to reform policies. Partisan ways are why nothing has changed for yrs
thanks for standing up for the innocents. legal doesn't mean right. #fightback
@SenSchumer Barack did the same thing and U did nothing! The RULE of LAW! #MAGA . Stop Whining!
@SenSchumer Is he a US Citizen?  If not y not?
Jersey Girl With you Sir!
supports criminal activities and should be removed from office
illegal immigrants are illegally in the US- start working for your constituents! #maga #stopsanctuarycities
@SenSchumer the law is the law idiot
@SenSchumer I don't agree. Can I untweet?
#DACA recipients have NOT been absolved of their illegal status, just as you haven't been absolved of corruption charges.
@SenSchumer did they break the law?????
@SenSchumer Law is Law clown
Did u know we have laws against illegals? Well, that is y Trump got elected, cause u dems r a lawless bunch of
@SenSchumer He has gang affiliations! That is why he is being deported!
@SenSchumer Any undocumented who voluntarily fills out an immigration form now should expect deportation. Don't/move/wait.
@KLewis44 Illegals, not undocumented! Enforce our laws! Remember Kate Steinle, she is who I care about!
#SaveDACA
@In4mdCndn Trump said in December he would help DACA not deport them.
@SenSchumer why don't we ignore/eliminate all laws? we wouldn't need congress, or all the bureaucrats - save the money
the wrongs are not right even over time. Illegal people in our country is still aginst the law. You are a bleeding heart
@SenSchumer If he came illegally he/parents have broken the law. Mexico does not tolerate illegal entry by Americans. #MAGA
@SenSchumer lock them up throw away the keys
if you over stayed your visa and you are caught, you gots to go ma friend
I rather he stay and you go.
Trump (Putin's Puppet) has no idea what he is doing. And like most idiots, he just does something! No Idea!
No he said he was a member of a gang. Get your facts straight
@CNN @nytimes Now I get it, this is Trump's form of a draft for his war in the middle East
@SenSchumer offer local vocational options; interpreters r priceless, US offer trade schools why not add t/ resource.
@SenSchumer THIS BULL SHIT IS GOING TO CAUSE A REVOLUTIONARY WAR!? RACIST AMERICANS NEED TO BE CONTROLLED OR LEAVE
@SenSchumer He is an admitted gang member.
@SenSchumer 

Sorry gentleman, we are not pointing fingers anymore. This is not new for you. Get to work and find a plan
@SenSchumer 

We keep passing the buck. With all your years of service to not have a plan in place-Now we are to be sad?
I bet his real picture is nowhere near as sappy as this picture in your post.
@SenSchumer no I agree with it
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You lawbreakers are why these other lawbreakers are here, consuming my tax dollars!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump if you dems don't like to see these sad pictures than stop your illegal alien racketeering!
you sure are selective about which laws you choose to enforce, regardless of that oath you both took
You are lying by not telling the whole story. This 7yo has 50 -100 family members who will come in & take jobs & resources.
@SenSchumer Except he came here illegally and will vote Democrat thanks to your illegal alien racketeering scan. Jail Bob!
@realDonaldTrump I watched you say DACA people should not be worried. You lied. You have lied and lied and lied
He is a self-admitted gang member ...get him out
They have been vetted!! Let them be!
@SenSchumer then why has he NOT made himself legal. If I don't buy my tag for my car every year I am not legal.
@SenSchumer ICE raids are both an attempt to distract and a retaliation (narcissistic rage) when DT humiliated/ threatened.
yes, blatant cowardice and comic-book level "macho".
Yes!!
His lawyer say he was DACA twice. They were coming for his father. He told ICE that he had the permits they didn't care.
Not only is it wrong, it casts a pall on the good faith part of the good faith and credit of the United States of America.
@SenSchumer DACA unconstitutional, we are nation of laws. If you are here illegally, the law says you will be deported.
As a child of divorce who had to move 4 times between age 10-16 because parents, this is a no-brainer
.@SenatorMenendez @SenSchumer How much in government welfare benefits did he take from taxpayers ? Blame his lawless Illegal parents.
ILLEGALS PAY 12 TO 15 BILLION A YEAR IN AMERICAN TAXES. TRUMP HASN'T PAID ANYTHING FOR 20YRS
That's a very ignorant comment... why hasn't he ?
@SenSchumer Ms. Del Rios could reapply if her non-violent record is expunged. Most HR background checks look at last 7 yrs.
We need to send them back. Every other country does.
@SenSchumer And Trump said he had a heart; yea right
Agree. And wrong to take mothers away for 20 year old petty crimes.
@SenSchumer He send home Jamaican too who are mix up in illegal things.
@SenSchumer this is disgraceful. Keep fighting
@SenSchumer My husband had to come to this country legally- notice I said -LEGALLY!
Did she come here legally?
@SenSchumer I did it the right way, why didn't he?
he was 7 did he have that option to do it legally?
would you like a dictionary so you could look up the definition of illegal?
And what about the time your people snatched this country from the natives
#dumpchump #ditchmitch
@SenSchumer all these perfect people
@SenSchumer get a life worry about us
@SenSchumer Did he come here legally or illegally?
We will NOT let Trump turn America into Nazi Germany!
This is not Menendez first rodeo. Years and not a plan. Get to work and find a better way
You forgot to mention his gang affiliation
Where are his parents? You don't seem to care what they're doing.
Randm unregistrd hndgun murdrs, crazd semi-auto mass shootings, & rampant drug overdose deaths are DYING AMERICAN HISTORY.
Traitor
Ignorant Obama deported 400,000 immigrant x year. Menendez & Melgen were indicted b FBI in connection with a bribery scheme
if Obama was really for immigrants he would have given them amnesty.  Now it's too late. it was deferred which = temporary
@potus ---still "illegal."  Did we, as a nation, vote to support the Liberal insanity agenda?Libs determined to destroy US!
