@NancyPelosi why dont you and your constituents pay more attention to the CITIZENS OF THE USA?
@CDrac Those are citizens of the U.S !
@real_gags if that is remotely true. Why refer to them as immigrants?
@CDrac they were born outside of the U.S but are now legally citizens for some of them but the coach of the team is German
@real_gags  its moot. American born citizens need the govermemts attention more than people who became citizens just to play a game
@CDrac @real_gags stop commenting on things you know nothing about. These players were American before they player soccer.
@coolguymccoole @real_gags oh and ill bet my last penny They were not citizens of the U.S.A. UNTIL THEY WERE RECRUITED TO PLAY
@CDrac @coolguymccoole @real_gags No fool. they have always been citizens, born as citizens. None of them had to obtain citizenship to play.
@NancyPelosi  one tweet make so much rage.by the way all of us are illegal cause we came after the Indians.# restinpeace
@jewin44 @NancyPelosi The "Indians" did not originate here either silly, LOL #IgnoranceMustBeBliss
@aeconnelly @NancyPelosi  true but they were the ones that discover this continent and we snatch it from them
@jewin44 @NancyPelosi Also the irish migrated here first, so do they have more rights than hispanics?
@aeconnelly @NancyPelosi  by the way spa ish came first right after the Indians. Then Portugal then English. Irish were were colonized
@jewin44 @NancyPelosi R u really that dense? I didn't mean the Irish were the first settlers. READ. I meant they came before South Americans
@aeconnelly @NancyPelosi  nope south American were easily to transport and acomodate. Back then
@jewin44 @NancyPelosi What? Whatever. You're very uneducated. You're wasting my time. Again #incoherence is deafening
@NancyPelosi All are U.S. citizens, your point? What doesthis have to do with illegal immigration?
@NancyPelosi Who cares about soccer in the US except the migrants who play it? Any contributions from them to traditional America?
@NancyPelosi Kinda, sorta. Aren't they all American-born but lived abroad? That means they're American citizens
@BeastFromTheNE @NancyPelosi No, the reverse, I believe. They're foreign-born but are now US citizens and therefore play for Team USA.
@DonGiovanna @NancyPelosi oh, ok. I know Johansson was born & lived in Iceland. Thought I read similar for a few more. Thx!
@BeastFromTheNE @DonGiovanna Even if born here? Johansson, Bedoya and Altidore were all born in the United States.
@xylaurazee @BeastFromTheNE I don't make who me was born where but I think tim hoes players blanked out in Pelosi's pic were not US-born.
@DonGiovanna @BeastFromTheNE That's what I'm saying. Three of her "blanked-out" players were born in the US. Two in NJ, one in Alabama
@xylaurazee @BeastFromTheNE Ah. Then idk why. I'm not very soccer/World Cup savvy.
@DonGiovanna @xylaurazee don't worry, neither is NancyPelosi's twitter
@NancyPelosi http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/19/nancy-pelosi/are-there-immigrants-2014-us-mens-world-cup-team/ …
@NancyPelosi aren't all of the team natural born citizens?
@NancyPelosi Your ignorance is mind-blowing! Fact checking prior to tweeting asinine statements may help you appear a tad less insane.
@NancyPelosi Has BOTOX cut off blood to your tiny brain?  ISSUE IS LEGAL IMMIGRATION versus ILLEGAL CRIMINAL ALIEN INVASION #dimwit
@NancyPelosi Now Nancy you are telling whoppers. they are the children or our servicemen who got married while stationed over seas.shame
@NancyPelosi Lady, you are equal parts Botox and shit. Get a clue. #liar #racist
@NancyPelosi You lie to try and serve your agenda.  All of those players were born on American soil.  Learn to tell the truth be informed
@NancyPelosi your just a senile old granny aren't you?  Go retire to The Villages or something.  Let people who really care run things.
@NancyPelosi @SenatorMenendez Stupid Pelosi, it's highly educated legal immigrants drive America's success, not uneducated illegals!
@NancyPelosi lol, great fact checking. Almost all of the players on your list of "immigrants" were born in the U.S. #CantTrustTheGovernment
@NancyPelosi Uh what????Over half of the players here are not immigrants at all...Namely Altidore, Howard, Gonzalez, and Green. #typicaldems
@NancyPelosi I agree, immigrants help drive success in other countries as well http://codehesive.com/wc-ancestry/ 
@NancyPelosi @patrickoyulu Now who is not an immigrant?.....tell the truth and shame the devil
According to @NancyPelosi New Jersey, Alabama, Florida and Texas are no longer part of the US #LieToMakeYourPoint -- Exploit #USMNT
@NancyPelosi @SenatorMenendez I left my 3rd world country 30 years ago. I won't allow Democraps to turn U.S into a 3rd world country!
@NancyPelosi dumb, several of them were born stateside, others were born with a American parent , does that make all army brats immigrants?
@NancyPelosi you're mistaken. All #USMNT members are natural born citizens. If they are immigrants, then ... http://tmi.me/1esuc8 
@NancyPelosi #misleading http://www.ijreview.com/2014/06/148607-laughable-dems-use-misleading-u-s-soccer-team-photo-promote-amnesty/ …
@NancyPelosi actually all of them are natural born citizens. You should do your homework, or just stop lying
@NancyPelosi your wrong. All are American born except 4 European born with at least one American parent. Check your facts.
@NancyPelosi All of the players there are native-born US citizens. Not sure what definition of "immigrant" is being used here.
@NancyPelosi Did they sneak into the country or follow the rules? I'm going to guess they played by the rules.
@NancyPelosi It's clear you're suffering Alzheimer's. It's time to retire and check in to Shady Pines, #tranny. #retirePelosi #dragqueen
@NancyPelosi oh nm you and your friends think service members aren't citizens.  #StopLyingToPromoteYourAgendas
@NancyPelosi Immigrants are an entirely different matter from ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. Your tweet is disingenuous
@NancyPelosi If lying were an Olympic sport you would be the government's Michael Phelps! #liarliarpantsonfire http://www.ijreview.com/2014/06/148607-laughable-dems-use-misleading-u-s-soccer-team-photo-promote-amnesty/ …
@NancyPelosi ummm... Most of these guys you are calling immigrants were born in the US... Shows how much of a fan you are of the #USMNT
@NancyPelosi You dopes!  Not a single player in that photo is an immigrant.
@NancyPelosi not one immigrant on the team. All natural born citizens. You are a disgrace.
You lie @NancyPelosi Howard born in Jersey, Bedoya, Jozy, Altidore, Green all Florida, Jones-Chicago, Gonzales-Dallas, Johannesburg-Alabama.
How fucking despicable of you! @NancyPelosi
@NancyPelosi @sdutzeigler yes. LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
@letsgofathers @NancyPelosi Aren't we all more or less immigrants?
@sdutzeigler @NancyPelosi absolutely! Big difference between proper path to citizenship and breaking law to parasite off of citizens
@NancyPelosi 100% false! Who told you this!?
@NancyPelosi You need to research the facts.
@NancyPelosi Legal immigrants are not the problem. #longsigh
@NancyPelosi You haven't got a clue. How about telling the truth for once, at least about a U.S. soccer team if nothing else!
@NancyPelosi - seriously? You need to quit your job ASAP.  #doyourresearch
@NancyPelosi @RepSamFarr Uuuuuhhhh... True & Smart comment! Blessings!
@NancyPelosi Liar!!  All of those men are American citizens, most born in USA but all have 1 US parent.  Misleading and a lie!!
@NancyPelosi the fact that they aren't immigrants  #stupid
@NancyPelosi uh what? Half of these guys were born IN the US. Where do you make this stuff up from?
@NancyPelosi How stupid can you be? Every single player you whited out was born in the UNITED STATES. Stop lying to make your "points".
@NancyPelosi Hah, all of them are natural Americans. None of them are immigrants. Pretty moronic of you. :P
@NancyPelosi Bedoya, Tim Howard and Jozy Altidore were born in New Jersey. Julian Green was born in Florida. Gonzalez was born in Dallas.
@NancyPelosi you are a lying sack of drug-addled shit

@NancyPelosi talk about politicizing everything you hypocrite, and you still can't get the facts right, they are all americans.. wow #USMNT

Choke yourself.
@NancyPelosi political rhetoric backed by false information.
@NancyPelosi Check this one out. Blatant lie from Pelosi @factcheckdotorg
@NancyPelosi Jozy Altidore, just to name one, was born in New Jersey. All on photo were either born in the US or born to military.
@NancyPelosi You need to do your homework.  They're all American born, US citizens.  Another failed attempt at politics by a brainless lib.
@cacesmith All due respect, but I believe @NancyPelosi is implying they are children of immigrants. Not implying they aren't natural.
@NancyPelosi, Nancy, Nancy ... #TeamUSA are all #Americans!  Someone on your staff got it wrong!  GO #TeamUSA
@NancyPelosi Except for the fact that they're all native to the United States...
@NancyPelosi #fail None are immigrants, all are Americans #pelosiisamoron
@NancyPelosi you do realize half these "immigrants" were born in the US. The other half have one American parent. Idiot.
@NancyPelosi for a group who loves to harp about how educated they are..the left is full of morons
@NancyPelosi  one problem those that are out of the picture,aren't ILLEGAL.
@NancyPelosi Stop lying to citizens for political gain. 5 of those players were born in the US & ALL have 1 American parent #FactsOnly
@NancyPelosi 
Unfortunately every last one of those players is a native-born US citizen. #FactCheck
#TimeIsNever #USMNT
@NancyPelosi Bedoya, Howard, and Altidore were born in New Jersey;  Gonzalez in Dallas, and Green in Florida, you moron.
@NancyPelosi @SheilaJacksonLee Immigrants are great! It's ILLEGAL immigrants that are the problem you dullards
@NancyPelosi bitch they were all born in America
@NancyPelosi @RepSamFarr  Even if that were true most of these illegal immigrants are children, we will have to wait until they grow up!!!
@NancyPelosi So NJ,AL,FL, and TX aren't part of the USA. Plus the others have American parents. Hit the road you need to go #Libtard
@NancyPelosi All of these player were either born in the US, born on a US Military base, or have at least 1 American parent...
@NancyPelosi please do some research before tweeting

@NancyPelosi all of those players are natural born US citizens. Last time I checked that doesn't make you an immigrant.
@NancyPelosi Wow. So you just pick a few people with different colored skin and call them immigrants? Fucking racist.
@NancyPelosi Please stop existing, you stupid bitch.
@NancyPelosi lol when you find out that every member of the team is a natural born citizen of the US and 0 are "immigrants"
