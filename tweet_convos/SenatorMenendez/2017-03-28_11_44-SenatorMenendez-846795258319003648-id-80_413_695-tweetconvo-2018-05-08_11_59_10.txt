@SenateDems FAKE PRESIDENT
climate change is a myth
And the world is flat
if thats how you feel...
Trump will regret it
@NancySinatra @voxdotcom You act like 'Trumbpty Dumbpty' cares about others!!. He only cares about making more money!!.
Good! This damned Green economy and over taxation crap is over. Liberalism sucks, period!
the reason Trump is doing this is because Obama did the opposite. simple as that. no thought involved.
@NancySinatra @voxdotcom Buffoon that he is...
what would it take for this idiot playing to be #POTUS to be impeach.
trump and his sycophants don't care about our planet...just making money
@SenateDems @voxdotcom Where is Al Gore? He needs to do a rally on the steps of the white house. Invite the world.
Democrats do something to get this sorry excuse for a president out of office. #impeach45
@SenateDems We just love the Ammonia DEF liquid pots in the air thanks to u Dems & Cali. That's much better to breath.
climate change is a hoax
@WomenSaveUSA and his LIES about USA carbon emissions vs. China and India's.  #bringscienceback
is american politics now only done via Twitter?
@SenateDems @voxdotcom Where is Al Gore? He needs to do a rally on the steps of the white house. Invite the world. Asap
Cheer up.  Climate change will probably be rendered moot by global thermonuclear holocaust.  See, these things always work out in the end!
Look at that idiot
@AllLeftNews
Trump has set us back...disgraceful. 
There are more solar jobs than coal jobs...
This is not about jobs.
what can we do about this, Senator?
...well then help us fight Senator if you care so much. You're there, speak for US the voice that #resist Trump.
@SenateDems get honest...climate change has existed since God created earth!
@SenateDems @voxdotcom hope he looks that smug when hes impeached.
An E O to remove an E O is dangerous. Is it bad for poor people to have affordable energy? Just pick up your ck
I wish someone would steak 45 naked out in the desert and let him experience his own climate change !
Perhaps, Bob, if Democrats were not so insanely belligerent towards @POTUS you might be able to rationally work with him! 
and what are you doing to protect your citizens?? pollution is more dangerous than terrorism..
he is s idiot
@PaladinCornelia POS trump POS trump
@SenateDems impeachment is taking too long.  Investigation going on since July.  What's taking so long? America in danger
Oh really Senator? Is this more or less dangerous than Gore's AGW scam to sell carbon credits through Gore and Blood Ltd. of London?
You Dems know that climate change is a hoax!  America needs all forms of energy!!!!!
what can we do?
Do something to stop him, Bob!
Climat change is a total hoax.  Obama and you Dems were sold a buncch of bull!!!!
With all due respect, u r in a position to oppose the GOPs dismantling of our country. Please do something
@PrincessBravato @voxdotcom one word " TROUBLING "
Court rejects Sen. Robert Menendez's attempt to get corruption case thrown out..facing 12 felony charges..
If this goes through, US will lose all their credability in the rest of the world.
@SenateDems @POTUS @GOP Idiotic move placing US against the balance of the world! Desperate acts as he heads for the door!
I'd say other countries on this planet may want to impose sanctions until the U.S. lives up to its responsibilities.
@SenateDems Climate change is all a bunch of poo poo!
@SenateDems @voxdotcom Democrats always trying to shame someone in an attempt to control the narrative pathetic
@SenateDems Our world is changed, nothing like the past, let's not repeat past mistakes, create a better world to live in!!
this will not make America great (again)... behind the real facts, known worldwide 
@sejorg @voxdotcom Perhaps the biggest under statement of the entire NEXT century...
@SenateDems AGREE
@SenateDems He is a bull in a China shop! He doesn't consider consequences of his actions. Please stop him!
@SenateDems @POTUS @realDonaldTrump   A Real President would not do this the our world and our future generations! Period!
Why don't big oil companies invest in renewable energy so they don't have to lie about climate science?  Tons of profit in renewable energy.
because they own the land that holds the oil, the refineries it gets shipped to, and the pumps where you fill
Many of us do not buy the climate change theory. How many of u own or your family have financial connections...
in these climate change facilities? Some of u or family lose invested monies?
What good's a pristine climate when 1 is out in the cold w/o job, home, or any prospects. Balance is needed & Dems = no bal
it seems POTUS is more interested in destroying any trace of Obama than what is good for the planet and the people
@SenateDems find a way to make enticingly profitable clean energy industrial complex over fossil fuel industrial complex
@SenateDems @voxdotcom  Trump is a FUCKING RACIST & committed Treason to 2b elected inorder2 Destroy everything Obama did.
how much longer do we have to put up with this idiot?
This nightmare of a fake president is ruining my beautiful country. This is not the world to leave to grand kids
@SenateDems #theliarinchief is a disgusting human being! Where are his despicable? All the same!
@SenateDems @voxdotcom so much for the future.
Seriously, can we LOCK DONALD UP while we figure out the whole Putin thing? This is ridiculous. Do something.
People clap while he destroys us. He does no research he has no knew ideas, he is taking us backwards!
@SenateDems @voxdotcom go cry your liberal tears somewhere else
Can't wait till we can get rid of this guy so we can #MAGA
I'd like to see a list of all companies that will comply w the energy regs as if EO did not exist & thank them.
GO TRUMP.   Stop the destructive policies of the liberals
@SenateDems @voxdotcom SHUT UP....
Look at this POTUS laughing at ALL of you for doing nothing .
Since Climate Change is not man made ... probably not.
