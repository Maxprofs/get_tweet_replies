RT @SenatorMenendez  Hey Republicans, don't worry, that burn is covered under the Affordable Care Act // #burn
Cool cool cool @SenatorMenendez. Does it also cover your federal bribery and corruption charges?
Chris, I get it, but don't be for the removal of maternity and mental health care?
sure. But is a guy who takes political bribes from medical professionals the best person to be mocking healthcare policy?
honestly, I'm okay with anyone mocking this healthcare policy. But I get your point.
Double-burn!
That didn't really make sense but okay
Yup! Women having the right to do what they want with their bodies is so absolutely ridiculous what was I even thinking!
Ya sorry we are too busy paying for his wife and son to live in New York everyday. Who needs meals on wheels or pbs?
@ntvnyr173  what happened to calling that hot mess Obamacare?
that's the party of no solutions making ppl like Nazi soros rich rest of us who gives a damn screw him
his party destroyed healthcare in this country, and now he puts his smug face on Twitter to criticize.
his party failed America like GOP did . Trumps agenda elected not Dems or GOP bush bullshit
sick burn dude
Hey @SenatorMenendez the affordable care act made my insurance premiums the same as my house payment, got anything for that?
HAHAHA 
SAVAGE
@saffron__rose
.@SenatorMenendez won twitter
Bobby, actually it's not. The deductible is so high that no matter how bad the burn, Obamacare won't cover it. #OutOfPocket
and my premiums went up $400 per month last July.
Hey Bobby, what do you say to Johnny about if he liked his plan... Should he get boned in the process? EVIL
Because I have thyroid disease (pre-existing cond) pre-ACA I paid $750/mo with a $4k deductible. Now it's less than half that; $320, $1000.
That's FANTASTIC! However, your results aren't typical. Many insurers have pulled out of the program as they're going broke. #NotWorkingWell
I'm paying $1650 per month now. Can't keep doing it.
That's ridiculous
We need single payer for all. We already cover poor kids, poor adults, old people, disabled, and vets. It's only civilized
My only condition: mild hypertension.
Did you co-sponsor #STARAct for #ChildhoodCancer?  Instead of gloating (so unattractive), #StopTheirSuffering. #STARAct 
.@SenatorMenendez
@LeGrove The Affordable Care Act. The most ironically named law on the books today.
@mattyrauch hahahaha. Amazing.  Gotta love Jersey
That's enough shade for the whole USA.
.@SenatorMenendez
.@SenatorMenendez @KirillWasHere
@MissDanniBBA only preventing burn was covered but burn itself isn't until u meet ur 5k deductible then it's 70/30 maybe 
and under the ACHA? Oh yeah! That didn't even come to a vote it was so horrible. #winning
savage lol 

Gawd somebody unplug me LOL
sadly, you sound happier about the other side losing when your concern should b 2 make either 'act' better for those w/out!
@SenatorMenendez looks like it's now a second degree burn.
I bet you just love the pig pit !!!!!! With comments like that we know it's all political ~ you're not for the people
@lynxhollow SAVAGE
LOL, you mean this one?

“@SenatorMenendez: Hey Republicans, don't worry, that burn is covered under the Affordable Care Act” this is my new favorite
@naejasme @odbahena
he's being investigated for corruption right now...
Not once your Ocare - aka -  the Hindenburg  implodes on its own.  Which is happening as we speak. 
That is all on u.
lol!
Hey Senator Bob Menendez get back to NJ. Ice agents harassing innocent people in Elizabeth NJ
If they are here illegally, then they are not "innocent people."  They are guilty of a federal crime.
my wife and I have never even stepped outside the US. Ice agents are the new brown shirts, wake up.
This reply has nothing to do with what I wrote. Evidently, it went over your head.
it has everything to do with it. Our families and loved ones are harassed and inconvienienced by ICE, and we are citizens.WakeUp
@dirtypreston with a premium of $353 a week, I would really hope so! Yay!! What a big win.. jerk!
my wife and I have decided to stop paying HC insurance for a couple of years and just go to the E.R.
THE GOAT SPEAKS

@loweslady48 @SeanSpicerFacts @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @SpeakerRyan The worst Administration since the Third Reich
Funny but you own this garbage health care. When it implodes in a year you’ll be begging .@realDonaldTrump to help.
@PedroAidaRVA @mattprousalis
@SiriusBlack32 @SenatorMenendez you know its bad if you don't have enough republicans backing his Healthcare bill
@jeffpearlman Assuming it also covers Dems and others who might still #feelthebern right?

Props to @SenatorMenendez for his epic incineration: "Hey Republicans, don't worry, that burn is covered under the Affordable Care Act"
.@SenatorMenendez Funny, will your health care plan cover you in prison soon?  Laugh that off.  Ha ha ha. #GlassHouses
American hero
you win the internet today, sir! :)
this is the best tweet I have ever seen in my life.
this tweet alone has me following you! Lol
why don't YOU feel the 'Bern' and support  #singlepayer #UniversalHealthCare
Wife needed an MRI, with ACA out-of-pocket $2100+, negotiated same MRI, same provider to do for $450 cash! #NoCoverage
Had to create a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for my Mom's deductible so she could receive cancer treatment.
Exactly! My brothers best friend also priced out of his insurance waiting for liver transplant?!?!
Sorry to hear that Nani. Ill keep him in my prayers. We need relief.
We will keep ur continued recovery in our prayers as well. Thank you.
Thank you cuz.
Haha! We just turned on the heat! They are refusing to talk to voters! Hiding and harming Americans for political grand standing!
Is your Burn covered under the new plan Bob?
Oooh, I love a good snark. Well done. Keep up the good work #Democrats #America stands with you #TheResistance
@Menendez4NJ Filibuster today. Right side of history, Senator.
@kharyp They are voting on TRUMPCARE again next week. @Reuters @AP @ABCPolitics @CBSPolitics @NBCPolitics @TODAYshow @GMA

BUM LIKE YOU ? YOUR ON OBAMA CARE ,TELL THE TRUTH !
@DarkerThanAkon 
The good news for you is the govt covers all health costs in prison. Enjoy your stay.
Not funny completely unprofessional and unbecoming of a Senator.Step up!
your Tweet was quoted by @washingtonpost
really? Are you 5? How is it possible that such childish people R elected? Grow up. Do ur job. Unite & work together 4 US.
Hey Trump, the treatment you need is covered under the Affordable Care Act.
No one couldn't have said better than this!
@TexArcana @adriana700777 Awesome 
lol don't worry you'll get free health care in #Prison.
.  Here's an idea...How about both parties stop tweeting insults and serve the people. #disgusted
@CollabFeature that's a good one
@sferguson98 Quite ironic and I'm a Republican. Great quote!!! 
Bob lays it down with with a hefty splash of #sriracha, #habanero & whoop ass. Good one Bob
Mmm Senator are you on the ACA? Why don't you try it?
@dzsteph

@laurennsong
LOL. GOOD ONE
Hilarious...LMAO!!!
@ashmore_rob Yep No thanks to them. They can thank the American public
That is until the turd sandwich that the Dems gave us called Obamacare collapses under its own weight.
@_LauraWalsh
@Ike_1919 Senator Bob throwing some deliciously snarky shade!!! 
You are so witty. There is nothing affordable about it and I have paid $800 in fines. Go visit your underage hookers.
@SamanthaSarube #tellingitlikeitis
probably not. Insurance plans keep dropping.
@Owen_LKH haha
One of the many reasons we love you in NJ, Bob! Need a little humor amidst all this darkness. Just say no to #wealthcare
Well aren't you a class act S E N A T O R?!!
@satanscake OH SHIT GET IT BOI
No provider should know I have Obama care..it only causes discrimination. Disgusting.
I have Obamacare  then I languish in a hospital in horrible PAIN while medical staff withholds my morphine
.@SenatorMenendez @GenevieveAngel
@AmberLotus21 hahaha amazing!
@KendallForward. We'll see for how long, when it tanks and goes belly up!

This makes me even prouder to be from the Garden State!
Having coverage you can't afford to use, is THAT BURN covered under the ACA?! #RepealandReplace #NoSinglePayer
My wife can't afford the sky high deductible and co-pays! Having it & being able to use it are two VERY different things!
You'll get a script for ten thousand Oxycontin.
@candiceosborne love you both but mind the hubris. Fix what's wrong with ACA and be heroes.
@djautomatic savage
@MaurineRam NJ senator coming through with the jokes and I'm here for it 
funny but this guy should be in jail for corruption, he also voted against importing drugs from Canada. NJ hates you Bob
Hey, when is your trial?
mic drop 
@DanielClaeys Lucky for them, they can afford Barry Soetoro's Socialist Health care grab.
@DanaTheriault3 lol  the imploding ACA? What a joke! Worse HC plan ever! Dems are incompetent and corrupt
Too bad his water failed too. He could use some to douse the flames from this EPIC BURN!!!
@MohammadEthar

@WinonaJ Wow wow wow you just dropped all of the mics!
.@SenatorMenendez
@kallllisti Great tweet! However we still want universal healthcare!
@JoeBiden @BarackObama @LeBatardShow

@JustPlaneNuts OMG! OMG! OMG! This is brilliant Well played Senator! #trumpcaredefeated
Hey, @SenatorMenendez, how's the investigation into your corruption going? Probably won't be around after the next election cycle, too bad.
@naahid_s یا به قول محموتی؛ آبو بریزین اونجاتون که سوخته!
I don't know you but that's wonderful
@Easter_Rebel_19
@SubodhChandra I like what you did there, thanks for standing with New Jersey. #saveourhealthcare
 #Obamacare
@GOP and if Koch bros. are so far up your ass that they resemble a hemorrhoid, ACA can cover that, too.

@KirillWasHere sassy senator I love it
Union City in the building!

Do you know about burning from the STD's you got from those underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic?
@ShawnOConn
his profile picture only makes the tweet better.
@chaelafowler
@flynnstonesf you seen this 

@JoshuaSevier 
@BrienneKaye bloop
@kelseymarie64 DAMN
I hit retweet so quick I got whiplash
is the affordable healthcare act really that affordable tho
Does the #ACA cover hospice services? Your Democrats ACA will be entering hospice soon. Start saying your goodbye's Bob.
What's your plan when Obamacare collapses? You were hoping under Hillary, it would become single payer. Ooops! We've got other plans.
Single payer system with secondary mkt for ppl with $. Every developed country has it. With better outcomes.
Hell no. We're not socialists.
@AyZiggyZoomba ... Hope Dems understand - this is actually worse for Obamacare. If Reps get together, full repeal will come
I read a full repeal will force less to lose insur than ACHA & you'll need dems to repeal.Won't happen. That's why they used reconciliation
And that still didn't work. @ end of day, they had 7 years to come up with something and couldn't because so much of ACA is Heritage anyway
And people like it. To get FReedom caucus, @realDonaldTrump was willing to get rid of popular protections. Foolish. Work to fix ACA now.
... Agreed! - work to fix it now
Release the memo. Dems are going to go down in flames.
You have no right being this arrogant after getting your ass handed to you in the 2016 election. That ass whooping was not ACA covered
The leftist agenda is smoke and mirrors
Your going to jail for fraud. RESIGN before your forced out
yeah but the Bern they get in 2020 wont be
Actually burns are not covered. Treatment for burns probably is. Again I am in awe of the genius of your tweets!
Mr Senator how's that burn going to feel in court?
When is your court date? Can't come soon enough. #EnjoyPrison
@joshuacobin Are you still feeling the burn ? #LMAO #PINGPONG #TINKLY #SENMENENDEZ #ANTIFA #GODADDY #OB/GYN #NONOS #MORON #MAGA #Trump2020
Aren't you in jail?
Not like the burn you got from your Indictment. By the way, the doctor that would have handled that, he's not under the Affordable Care Act
The burning from Winning so much? 
Shouldn't you be busy preparing for your trial for corruption charges, Senator ?  In case anyone was unaware:
please tell people how the ACA can be fixed and how the Republican plan will hurt them
When is your next court appearance?
