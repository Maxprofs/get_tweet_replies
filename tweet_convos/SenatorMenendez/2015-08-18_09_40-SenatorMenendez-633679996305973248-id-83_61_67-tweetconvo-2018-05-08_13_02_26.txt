@SenatorMenendez you are a profile in courage! You have stood up to the haters and the Iran apologists. God bless you.  You are a true hero!
@Ehsrabbi @SenatorMenendez We choose diplomacy over war - working w/ world instead of standing alone. You're wrong on this. @NoWarwithIran
@NJPeaceAction @SenatorMenendez @NoWarWithIran This deal creates war! Iran will use its funds for terror throughout region.
@Ehsrabbi @SenatorMenendez @NoWarWithIran We disagree fundamentally. If U.S. Congress rejects deal, the U.S. will stand alone. NOT GOOD!
@NJPeaceAction @SenatorMenendez @NoWarWithIran in the past when sanctions were passed u.s. Did not stand alon
@Ehsrabbi @SenatorMenendez @NoWarWithIran What was the case before is not the case in 2015. Sanctions will not be supported by all in P5 +1
@NJPeaceAction @SenatorMenendez @NoWarWithIran http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/democratic-blues-121561.html?hp=t4_r#.Vdc-KGb3aJI … policies opposed by the majority of our nation not good  for democrats
@Ehsrabbi @NJPeaceAction @SenatorMenendez @NoWarWithIran The majority of this nation and also the majority of Jewish people favor the deal.
@RoryBBellows1 @SenatorMenendez the traitors are those who would give Iran a pass, they burn effigies of president Obama!
@Ehsrabbi @RoryBBellows1 @SenatorMenendez dont use those inflammatory actions to support your biased ideas against deal for war end of story
@DemHugh @RoryBBellows1 @SenatorMenendez This deal leads to war.  Sanctions are nonviolent. Keep sanctions, reject the deal, choose peace!
@Ehsrabbi @RoryBBellows1 @SenatorMenendez we have to be good stewards and love our brothers and sisters you side is not doing either
@SenatorMenendez you've been bought for years, this was no surprise. Now, go cash that check.  #ChaChing
@yvonison @SenatorMenendez why did the senator oppose the Iraq war? Why as a congressman from Hudson county did he take on Iran? He is. hero
@SenatorMenendez AIPAC will get its money's worth from Schumer and Menendez.
@SenatorMenendez We choose diplomacy over war - working w/ world instead of standing alone. SenMenendez is wrong on this one. @NoWarwithIran
@SenatorMenendez thak you4your goog dessision  never trust #Iran’s words #no2rouhani #IranFreedom whit leading #MaryamRajavi is salutation
@SenatorMenendez Thank you Senator Menendez. Your country loves you and your family loves you!
@SenatorMenendez     About the Iran Deal
@SenatorMenendez I voted 4 you 4 many years; never again. I am #Jewish. #AIPAC, #Netanyahu and now u are pro-war. None of you represent me.
@SenatorMenendez Problem is that what people think about this doesn't matter to Menendez or Schumer.  AIPAC checks will flow.
@SenatorMenendez will never, ever vote for you again
@SenatorMenendez Your vote will lead to Iran getting a bomb sooner. Suggesting voting #IranDeal down will lead to 'better' deal is a joke
@DavidGuggenheim @madamecrab @SenatorMenendez this is a great deal and there no other deal Menendez is scum,on his way to prison
@SenatorMenendez thank you my Senator for your "no" vote on this frightful #IranDeal.  I am a Staunch Conservative & support you 100% here.
@SenatorMenendez Oopsy daisy, u said u looked into ur "soul", truly looking into deep pockets of ur CRIMINAL defender..Israel, bitch #iran
@SenatorMenendez How are your corruption scandals  weighing in!
Isnt Sheldon Adelson controlling you by paying for your defense lawyers?
@SenatorMenendez As you have witnessed with the BLM movement, blacks are holding all candidates accountable for their actions!
@SenatorMenendez I wouldn't watch you and your betrayal of my @POTUS if that was all on TV! U & @SenSchumer kick rocks
.@BishopJones51 @SenatorMenendez  @SenSchumer what has your @POTUS  done for Black community? Squat.
@dauphin__ @SenatorMenendez @SenSchumer @POTUS people like you are hilarious
@BishopJones51 @SenatorMenendez @SenSchumer @POTUS 10 years from now, lightbulb will go off. Remember me then. #beentheredonethat
@SenatorMenendez we all know how powerful the Israel vote is. Any other reason is BS.we need a voice to tell Israel off, n ur not it.
@SenatorMenendez He has "Faux Phony News,"  Adelson, Saban and AIPAC's support. Think he might be less than objective?
@SenatorMenendez What makes u think YOU ARE IMMUNE?
#Vaporize
@SenatorMenendez @cerenomri 
@SenatorMenendez @Ostrov_A Sending 
.@SenatorMenendez reason #IranDeal gains traction is bc networks are censoring Iran proxy Assad carnage. PLEASE investigate media blackout.
@SenatorMenendez bravo, Senator Menendez, altho you now have a target painted on your back
@SenatorMenendez You are a traitor. And a warmonger and an @AIPAC tool.
.@SenatorMenendez I'm ashamed to have you as one of my NJ senators.  Failing the people of Cuba is bad enough; now you are voting for war?
@SenatorMenendez You belong in prison Menendez!
@SenatorMenendez ashamed I've voted for you. You are a disgrace to not only our party but more importantly to common sense. #Moron
@SenatorMenendez Your country is the US, not Israel! The deal brings PEACE. It saves the life of many young americans.
@SenatorMenendez How big was the check, Senator?
@SenatorMenendez you & Schumer = AIPAC propagandists. When did Israel become our 51st state? Please, take Chuck & move to Israel #IranDeal
History will not remember you kindly @SenatorMenendez on your decision on #IranDeal. It is your duty to put US national interests 1st!!!!!
@SenatorMenendez we Iranian hard-liners thank you! Keep your inspectors out of our country by killing the deal!
@SenatorMenendez So AIPAC was the highest bidder huh? Getting really sick of this "Boners 4 Bibi" tour by our pols. YOU LIVE HERE! Enough!!!
@SenatorMenendez You are as corrupt as they come. Enjoy the blood $ from the zionists and tell Bibi we said hello when you are on your knees
@SenatorMenendez Thank you for having the sanity to see how disastrous this would be for the world - a deal giving Iran everything & US-0.
@SenatorMenendez  
@SenatorMenendez you're a corrupt asshole representing my old state that tends to be corrupt..,traitor who belongs in Jail...
@SenatorMenendez FYI, you were elected to represent NJ, not AIPAC. This is disgraceful.
@SenatorMenendez as a nj resident: thank you!
@SenatorMenendez Thank you sir, those who now condemn you 4 doing the right move will soon regret, as they'll realize Obama led them 2 war
@SenatorMenendez Great decision! Thank you
Expected nothing else from one of the most corrupt politicians, the one & only @SenatorMenendez, a top recipient of AIPAC $.
@SenatorMenendez you should consider stepping down senator as youre serving israel's president and not your constituents or your president
@SenatorMenendez Do not sale weapons to Nigerian government.they uses the little they have to kill innocent civilians.
@SenatorMenendez once again you let me down senator  #NoWarWithIran
@SenatorMenendez If the US disapproves the #IranDeal, many countries would abandon sanctions. Leverage to get any Iran deal would be lost.
@SenatorMenendez owned by AIPAC ~ you are voting for war. Shameful
@SenatorMenendez @paolo_sf I hope you oppose it from PRISON!!
@SenatorMenendez was there any doubt??? Wreck anything Obama as much as you can until ur trial, huh?
@SenatorMenendez // We don't need your statement. We knew where you stood all along.You're on the wrong side of history on this.
@SenatorMenendez can't wait until you go to Jail, you pathetic hack......
@SenatorMenendez well you are AIPACS biggest bitch so your vote was never in doubt u r a disgrace to the US congress , a TRAITOR.....
@SenatorMenendez Didn't realize till read it below that pop-up blocker has to be off. You made the right decision not to support naive deal
@SenatorMenendez...he is a crook, prostitution, money laundering...and beef with #Cubadeal...that is why he is opposed to #IranDeal
@SenatorMenendez And the war with Iran which is the alternative Senator? Will THAT have your name on it?
@fin487 @SenatorMenendez Funny, the only ones talking war are Obama & Iran's mullahs. That is, of course besides you https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/1905 …
@kem451_ @SenatorMenendez And there were TONS of WMDs in Iraq. Pull the other one it's got bells on.
@fin487 @SenatorMenendez What does the Iraq war have to do with Obama's Iran Deal? Are you saying Obama is misleading the American people?
@SenatorMenendez FU very much @Ostrov_A
@SenatorMenendez  IranDeal  Very proud you chose Country over politics. l pray more Dems. will follow. Please continue to fight for us.
@UNCLEFUNK @SenatorMenendez He's extremely corrupt, even for a politician. I hope he ends up in prison.
@UNCLEFUNK @SenatorMenendez lol, exactly, one of the most corrupt politicians in one of the most corrupt states. What a gem...
@SenatorMenendez Thank you for opposing the bad Iran Deal.  To be pro-deal is to be pro-war as lifting sanctions enables Iran to weaponize.
@SenatorMenendez Few Dem Sens/Reps break rank w/WH re Iran Deal, seems WH will succeed any way b/c "legacy" more imp. What a way to govern
@SenatorMenendez Sorry that I missed your livestream.  Perhaps, people need to be warned to turn off their pop-up blocker on your website???
@SenatorMenendez at your site. where is the stream?
@SenatorMenendez shouldn't you be in jail already?
@SenatorMenendez So you're voting for war??.
@TyJuanOn @SenatorMenendez Kari, IMO, being pro-deal is being Pro-War. The deal causes nuclear proliferation and enables Iran to weaponize.
@SenatorMenendez With respect, its Good v Evil!
