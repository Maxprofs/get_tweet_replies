@jorgeramosnews keep up the good work!!
@jorgeramosnews @SohrabAhmari Did POTUS and Raul discuss reparations for Americans who had their property confiscated by Fidel?
@MHB2012 @jorgeramosnews @SohrabAhmari 
why do you think they owe anything?
@FourthN13 @jorgeramosnews @SohrabAhmari If NCCACP, CBC, BO, MO and Val all want Af-Ams to receive "slavery" reparations. Castro owes too.
@MHB2012 @jorgeramosnews @SohrabAhmari 
No it don't mean anything! 
They don't deserve shit either!
@jorgeramosnews of course not! But our President knew that already!
@jorgeramosnews @benshapiro List of 47 FREEDOM "Fighters" Jorge. ¡Cuba Libre!
@jorgeramosnews Not a chance in hell. Everyone on that list will get 10 years added to their sentence
@jorgeramosnews @lldzne If they're taking lists I bet there US have more people unjustly imprisoned. Thousands
@GavinCurnow @jorgeramosnews I would take a bad trial than an unjust gov that has no regard for consent or political change.
@jorgeramosnews ah the group's founder that provided you with that list participated in the bay of pigs.maybe try a more credible org
@jorgeramosnews In Castro's Cuba, there are no political prisoners, simply ordinary criminals. Dissent of any kind is a crime.
@jorgeramosnews @otos_austin because our embargo sure got them freed
@ZaneWelker I agree, embargo only hurt the Cuban people never the regime. Economic freedom is key in bringing down communistic dictators.
@jorgeramosnews Mr. Ramos as a Christian, please spend as much time and effort with this issue as you do with US politics
@jorgeramosnews 
FREE THE PEOPLE " LET MY PEOPLE GO"
@jorgeramosnews Ramos is a fool & a fraud.
@jorgeramosnews @MattWelch maybe we could simultaneously release Gitmo prisoners as a twofer
@aspasia_project @jorgeramosnews @MattWelch 
Ya great idea! Just release a bunch of terrorists!
please retweet this list.  Are these people still in Cuba's prison?
@jorgeramosnews I will gladly pay money to see YOU ask him that question, face to face,  but you won't, you don't have the cojones!
@jorgeramosnews @1jelliott1 
After the game?
Hore-Hay, ask your co-religionists Obama and Kerry @jorgeramosnews @benshapiro
@jorgeramosnews

Obama with FARC Terrorists in baseball

FARC kills thousands with coward bombs

Okay @jorgeramosnews here's now we can get this done. 
We send YOU to Cuba. Once they lock you up, we ask if they will free all on the list.
@jorgeramosnews Why so late???
@jorgeramosnews 
Here's another idea! Stop worrying about everyone elses problems and worry about things like Flint and all other US issues!
@jorgeramosnews 
Here's an idea! Maybe we should mind our own business and let him rule his country as he wants!
@jorgeramosnews @guypbenson. Wish on
@jorgeramosnews @benshapiro 

Gosh, if only there was someone of influence visiting Cuba to press him on the matter.
@jorgeramosnews @guypbenson If not, then make Barry #48.
@jorgeramosnews @TheRickWilson no he's not, dummy.
@jorgeramosnews @benshapiro @POTUS Care to share this with Raul while you're there?
@jorgeramosnews @benshapiro Now Jorge wants 2 b a real American Sorry we dont need u once in a while try every day upholding the immigr laws
@jorgeramosnews @seanmdav No. I do not believe he will free them by tonight. And Prez O went down there and agreed w/ Raul's critique of USA
@jorgeramosnews @TheRickWilson  Nope
@jorgeramosnews @Crimson_Rei  WAY TO GO, JORGE!!!  I'm pleasantly surprised, but proud of you!
@jorgeramosnews @benshapiro why would he release them? The Administration gives them everything they want, no strings attached.
@jorgeramosnews @benshapiro don't hold your breadth Jorge. Illegal immigration must be stopped..look at EU.
@jorgeramosnews @benshapiro wow Ben RT something from Ramos
@jorgeramosnews @warriors_mom Obama can negotiate a deal as he did with Iran.
@jorgeramosnews @benshapiro 
So where is FBI MOST WANTED Joanne Chesimard AKA Assata Shakur?
The "INSPIRATION" of Racist #BlackLivesMatter.
@jorgeramosnews @guypbenson Will there be a spaceship in your driveway by tomorrow?
@jorgeramosnews Not a chance.  Obama will give up Gitmo first and turn over his girls to be wives of Castro family before that!
@jorgeramosnews  Oh!  There's the list! Maybe Raul didn't know of a list because they are dead?
@jorgeramosnews @benshapiro Let me give you a hint Jorge. No never! You know why because that limp wristed party you support!
@jorgeramosnews Perhaps you should check with his BFF Obama!
@jorgeramosnews @exjon Anyone who protests a society free from inequality of any kind is probably a racist and belongs in jail #FeelTheBern
@jorgeramosnews @TheRickWilson Forward the list to OBama and see if he does anything at all with it other than shred it.
@jorgeramosnews Thank you for sharing their names, sir. @TheRickWilson
@jorgeramosnews Cruz don't defend his people,because he is illegal,Castro is a traitor to his revolution and his people,to me are the same.
@jorgeramosnews You always see the straw in someone else and you are not fair with your country,first fix your government that is garbage
@jorgeramosnews Send a list of ex-presidents,president,and politician from Mexico to the world court,criminals that put Mexico in bankrupt
@jorgeramosnews usted no puede entender muchas cosas sólo al alcance de los #cubanos pero gracias x su apoyo pero la culpa es nuestra.
@jorgeramosnews #RaulCastro puede sacarlos de la cárcel pequeña pero #Cuba es una cárcel grande que los #cubanos hemos permitido x cobardes.
@jorgeramosnews Thank you for posting this. Our president seems OK pretending these people don't exist.
@jorgeramosnews ¿Y por qué ningún periodista de @UniNoticias dio para balbucear al menos un solo nombre?
@jorgeramosnews @POTUS  Here's one list with 47 political prisoners in Cuba. Is Raúl Castro going to free them?
@jorgeramosnews gracias Jorge
@jorgeramosnews   No -he's - not. Next query
@jorgeramosnews @RevistaD_USA USA En lo Que Quedó de Risa de Lis Castro Obama ha vendido a los E U de A 
@jorgeramosnews @RevistaD_USA y mucho menos Quiso oír lo de los Presos Políticos ,Raúl se hiso el que no Oia .USA en lo
@jorgeramosnews @RevistaD_USA y Este  no Dejo que Obama le diera un Abraso y el Pobre Obama solo Se Rio. aque Pend..
@jorgeramosnews @RevistaD_USA Ni tan siquiera lo Fue a Recibir al Aeropuerto y hiso Que no Oia lo de Los Presos Politic
@jorgeramosnews @RevistaD_USA Obama solo Fue a Cuba a Que lo Ridiculise Ese Viejo de Raul Hasta el mas Bobo vio
@jorgeramosnews @erikasaldana Ningun periodista abrio la boca para decirle a Castro un solo nombre, PATETICO! culpables, complices!!!
@jorgeramosnews @rulajebreal If nobody has given him the list, no.
@jorgeramosnews thank you!
.@jorgeramosnews Qué cantidad de idiotas comparando Guantánamo con los crímenes cometidos por los Castro en #Cuba!
@jorgeramosnews probably not remember he shares your leftist ideology. Dissenters can't be tolerated.
@jorgeramosnews @RosaMariaPaya Well I guess not. But at least he recognized publicly they violate #HHRR in #Cuba. Can't take that back now.
@jorgeramosnews @billpostmus would have made more sense to give list BEFORE lifting sanctions- what a disgraceful end to his presidency
@jorgeramosnews It's the 1950's.Times are slow.They don't work that fast. POTUS pilgrimage is sad
@jorgeramosnews About as fast as Bush got the HUNDREDS of Saudi Arabian political prisoners released. @jmartNYT
@jorgeramosnews @jmartNYT Sadly - no. The Castro regime will retain it's hold on Cuba until they pass away. Makes me sad for the people.
@jorgeramosnews I realized u mislead people on the facts, all descendants of slaves are political prisoners
@jorgeramosnews yea if you free political prisoners here also is what he said its called a "negotiated deal"
@jorgeramosnews you should had given this list to president Obama. You knew he was going to question Raul Castro in regard to the prisoners.
@jorgeramosnews Guantánamo; so shush!
@jorgeramosnews @joannesmoot  This is the first time in a long time we are really looking at #Cuba The #POTOS trip was a success
@jorgeramosnews.Aquí esta el Listado q pidio el Tirano Dinosaurio de Raúl Castro.Y como ya anochesio,ya deben de estar en LIBERTAD.
@jorgeramosnews Roberta Jacobson mencionó su nombre en el famoso intercambio de Alan Gross y los 3 (cont) http://tl.gd/nm3sec 
@jorgeramosnews el nombre de un prisionero político es constantemente olvidado: Ernesto Borges Pérez, confinado en precarias condiciones
Those aren't political prisoners. They are just undocumented Republicans. Obama is going to recommend audits. @jorgeramosnews
@jorgeramosnews @DaphneBarbeito Well, @Potus can start doing the same by releasing 74-yr old political prisoner OSCAR LOPEZ from PUERTO RICO
@jorgeramosnews pienso que cuba saldrá perdiendo todavía mas con esta  "amistad". EU presionará para privatizar el sector salud y educativo?
@jorgeramosnews Normally, I do not agree with you. But, good job! Now let's see if @POTUS and his twin Raul Castro follow through.
@jorgeramosnews @PoleoRafael no he isn't
@jorgeramosnews que vaya Obama a Venezuela. A ver si sueltan a nuestros presos políticos.
@jorgeramosnews muy bien!!!
Ahora que libere a todos los presos políticos esta misma noche!
@jorgeramosnews bravo Jorge!! Las mentiras hay que exponerlas venga de cualquier partido,país, y político!!! Mis respetos!
@jorgeramosnews why are they imprisoned?
@jorgeramosnews @typeslowly1 ¿quién se anima a descubrir lo que se encuentra detrás de sus indignaciones selectivas? http://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa …
@audiodelica @jorgeramosnews Qué bueno que estemos empatados en indignaciones selectivas.
@typeslowly1 @jorgeramosnews con el tema salud pública desempatamos.
@audiodelica @jorgeramosnews Es cierto.
@jorgeramosnews You should take a stand, be a rebel, and go ask him in person.
@jorgeramosnews Cuba is not the US.  They are not going to let groups from other countries dictate their policies.
@jorgeramosnews When will the United States free its own citizens held as political prisoners? #FreeRon #Anonymous
@jorgeramosnews @BretBaier here is a list of 47 #ObamaenCuba
@jorgeramosnews Here is list of Cuban political prisoners Jim @Acosta #Cuba
@jorgeramosnews I guess #RaulCastro has a few hours to comply with his own words, but I have a funny feeling he won't
@jorgeramosnews Hell no
@jorgeramosnews What do you say @BarackObama ? Will Castro release these prisoners as sign of goodwill
@jorgeramosnews como siempre JORGE, valiente y grande, sin pelos en la lengua!
@jorgeramosnews You think Cuba is going to cower down to the US like the US cowers to Mexico?
@jorgeramosnews Submit it if youre confident the names will be recognized as pol prision by Castro. You think they are dumb like the US gov?
@jorgeramosnews ramos should meet with the Castros
@jorgeramosnews y los de guantanamo?
@jorgeramosnews  A chameleon doesn't change colors that fast.
@jorgeramosnews That many in Gitmo? Wow!
@jorgeramosnews @rulajebreal is Obama going to bring back to life all the black men and women murdered by American Police?
@jorgeramosnews I don't think so...
@jorgeramosnews si te atraen los rebeldes , cual es tu problema con Trump? No entiendo
@jorgeramosnews @FactsVsOpinion We can hope
@jorgeramosnews @rulajebreal maintaining the embargo sure isn't going to free them either.
@jorgeramosnews Are you pretending not to love Fidel?  Do you deny that you have a tiny Che tattoo on on your cock?
@jorgeramosnews @rulajebreal Maybe Obama can be an example by freeing a puertorrican political prisoner by the name of Oscar Lopez Rivera.
@jorgeramosnews @rulajebreal Hopefully Obama will also release the political prisoners currently in US jails. #FreedomForOscarLopez
@jorgeramosnews @Rambobiggs Obama is an absolute clown, but hey he's your guy Jorger.
@jorgeramosnews @Dereckb send him inmediatly
@jorgeramosnews @Rambobiggs Too bad our Prez didn't have EVEN ONE of their names on the tip of his tongue today, when Raúl asked for a list.
@jorgeramosnews @ChuckLane1 Perhaps, but arrest them next week.
@jorgeramosnews @MattWelch no and neither will Obama or Hillary. Trump on the other hand.....
@jorgeramosnews NO.LEHAGAS EL JUEGO A.LOS REPUBLICANOS Y A.TRUMP
@jorgeramosnews
@jorgeramosnews culero
@jorgeramosnews ojete
@jorgeramosnews lamesuela
@jorgeramosnews pendejo
@jorgeramosnews poca cosa
@jorgeramosnews that will be the right thing to do. 
@jorgeramosnews @ChrisMegerian Is the US freeing Chelsea Manning? Letting go of vengeful pursuits of Julian Assange, Snowden?
@jorgeramosnews I don't know if it's current but, here's another list: https://nycabc.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/nycabc_polprisonerlisting_10-2mar2015_booklet.pdf …
@jorgeramosnews @Rambobiggs MR. JORGE, I BET U THINK THE U.S. SHOULD INVADE CUBA & FREE THEM. LET PROGRESS TAKE PLACE 1 STEP AT THE TIME.
@ISAACYASS @jorgeramosnews @Rambobiggs yeah, the US is progressing little by little, good to know... But there's Trump and Hillary
@mendezki @jorgeramosnews @Rambobiggs ABSOLUTELY #TRUMP!!! HILLARY HAS NOTHING 2 SHOW 4 ALL HER TIME AS SCY OF STATE..
@ISAACYASS @jorgeramosnews @Rambobiggs I'm saying that #Trump and #Hillary are not progression, 1. retrograde, 2. Stagnation
@mendezki @jorgeramosnews @Rambobiggs I'M SAYING THAT IF WE WANT TO START BALANCE OUR BOOKS-19$$ TRILLION IN DEBT- WE NEED A REAL NEGOTIATOR
@ISAACYASS @jorgeramosnews @Rambobiggs first it's important to stop investing on military, then stop giving money to pariah states
@jorgeramosnews y Obama tiene a Oscar Lopez
@jorgeramosnews No creo que sean liberados, es una pena que @RaulCastroR rinda pleitesía a @BarackObama sin pensar en Cuba @padresolalinde
@jorgeramosnews , its time for America to fuck political correctness & look after its own people who came from across the globe for benifit
@jorgeramosnews /  Gracias Sr Ramos, por su valiosa y solidaria cooperacion profesional.
@jorgeramosnews have you sent it to him???
@jorgeramosnews the human rights commission they form can deal with this and keep pushing it even after Obama unless repubs take us back
@jorgeramosnews @erikasaldana está bien, esa puede ser una lista, ahora veamos los delitos que cometieron, les parece?
@jorgeramosnews Quick give that list to Andrea Mitchell @mitchellreports!
@jorgeramosnews @davereaboi And that's just the all the cells down the hall on the left of the south wing.
@jorgeramosnews Release only to re-arrest them a few days later, but Obama will cite their release as progress.
@jorgeramosnews Maybe they can be traded for U.S. political prisoners, e.g. whistleblowers.
@jorgeramosnews obama is all 'hope' , no action. he was mocking the CNN reporter
@jorgeramosnews @jdbalart give it to him
@jorgeramosnews are you crazy?Castro like all the socialist are lying all the time
@jorgeramosnews did you see how Castro scorned female pundit for asking him a question? I think he's tired of Liberal agendas!! @cnn
@panchovilla9999 @jorgeramosnews @CNN I hope it's a good change. Get her out safely! @mitchellreports
@jorgeramosnews Why is this an issue? The USA has millions of political prisoners incarcerated for things white people are scared of...
@atx787 @jorgeramosnews
@jorgeramosnews lets give it to Pres Obama @BarackObama  #CubaLibre
@jorgeramosnews #FreeOscarLopez @BarackObama @POTUS @WhiteHouse
