@SenatorDurbin Yep, and I'm still waiting on those "good guys with guns" to come to the rescue. Good grief the NRA really has won.
@ChipmanJamie @SenatorDurbin kind of hard 4 good guys to have guns in leftwing california. duh.......
@SenatorDurbin @TYTNetwork More than 1 per day.  Incredible. Yet no gun regulations.
@SenatorDurbin blah blah blah and more blah. Do something @SenatorMenendez
@SenatorDurbin @BlueDuPage Maybe if the our Congressmen and GOP were not owned by NRA that would help. I know some Dems are too.
@Plantflowes @SenatorDurbin @BlueDuPage i am the NRA. we do not own anybody!! we have nothing to do w/ evil people. shame on you.
@stephaniew1978 @SenatorDurbin @BlueDuPage Keep dreaming. NRA is nothing but a lobby for gun manufacturing
@Plantflowes @SenatorDurbin @BlueDuPage false. that is totally false. it is a civil rights org who stands 4 the 2'nd amendment.  wake up.
@stephaniew1978 @SenatorDurbin @BlueDuPage Actually, it really isnt. It is a gun-manufacturing lobby. NRA spent 30 mil on GOP candidates 12
@Plantflowes @SenatorDurbin @BlueDuPage  that's a flat out lie repeated but left wing morons.
@stephaniew1978 @SenatorDurbin @BlueDuPage LOL When no facts, name call. I assure you it is true. Bye
@Plantflowes @SenatorDurbin @BlueDuPage not name calling. just stating a fact. sorry i offended you.
@SenatorDurbin 

That was a terrorist attack
@frankwilliams55 @SenatorDurbin no, libs rather want to distract us w/ this bull than talk about obama losing to isis.
@frankwilliams55 @SenatorDurbin   oh great. i must have missed that one. oops.
Coming from a guy @SenatorDurbin who refuses to even DISCUSS #KatesLaw ......
@SenatorDurbin so what are u going to do about it? Why r u #libtards so afraid of citizens? http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/04/09/law-enforcement-poll-obama-s-gun-control-won-t-lower-violent-crime-armed-citizens-will/ … #2a
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall it's you and yours Dick, that's been minding the store, with your open border policies !
@SenatorDurbin What can i personally do to endorse gun control for our increasingly violent society??  PLEASE RESPOND!!
@SenatorDurbin guns don't get violent. people do! we have a SIN problem,. not a gun problem!!
@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez But what are you doing about it to help?
@SenatorDurbin The guns were purchased legally. Terrorists passed strict background checks!
@SenatorDurbin There have been almost 3,000 in your city of #Chicago. Strictest gun laws in the nation. All do respect. But you're wrong.
@SenatorDurbin @2sense2 Do something about it. Like start a movement to repeal the 2nd Amendment to restore sanity in our country.
@SenatorDurbin @jeremyball3 f*** me. This should open eyes! The NRA should be ashamed.
@SenatorDurbin awesome let's end global poverty and create peace in the Middle East while we are at it
I need a link to share off Twitter @SenatorDurbin
@SenatorDurbin @SenatorMenendez Why don't you start in your own state Sen.Durbin. And what is your point Sen.Menendez?
@SenatorDurbin @TYTNetwork It won't stop. As long as the NRA and payed politicians block this process. They don't care how many people die.
@SenatorDurbin @SusanDanzig219 Absolutely. America should know that guns kill!
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall YEAH!!! Let's get those Concealed Carry classes going!!!
@SenatorDurbin You have to do more! Thank you for not being insane like the GOP, but you gotta cut through and make something happen!
@SenatorDurbin @TYTNetwork most not reported because they didn't follow narrative of white nut job shooting people.
@SenatorDurbin @MarkTLive Let's elect Trump n aholes like Durbin will go away,I'm sick & tired of Libs doing nothing just pandering!!
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall _ Strart /w insisting your POTUS calls it what is, #IslamicTerrorism. #Truth
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall - How? Your rhetoric is exhausting + pointless. Evil ones do evil things no matter what. #CommonSense.
@SenatorDurbin @LeaAnn_fracasso playing with stats. Defined as 4 or more deaths including suspects. It's a problem, skewing it costs cred
@SenatorDurbin @eastvillagetwt Corrupt Illinois govt.
@SenatorDurbin this is terrorism not climate change
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall tell me how Illinois and California gun laws help anyone...obviously not enough! Dems controls those states!!
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall absent the gun, wouldn't the violence still occur in just a different form? #MentalHealthMatters #sadsociety
@SenatorDurbin @RobertaSaidThat do something!
@SenatorDurbin Agreed. What are your recommended action steps? From your position, but also for IL citizens in general? Thanks.
@SenatorDurbin Then work to stop it.
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall Agreed! What is your plan?
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall i call bullshit define mass shootings! If true then im glad we have freedom to bare arms.
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall Stop Taking Americans Rights to Protect Themselves, Gangs, Terrorists Always Armed!!
@SenatorDurbin then stop the illegals from coming across our porous borders. They get these semi-auto weapons illegally. NRA not problem
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall If he's so concerned w/ the # of murders in the US he should start w/ #ChiRaq in his own state #2ndAmendment
@SenatorDurbin 
Chicago has the strictest gun laws and the most killings so can you explain that?
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall Including in states with the most restrictive gun laws, like, for instance, um ... oh, yeah, YOURS.
@SenatorDurbin @LeslieMarshall Sorry, tweeted too quick & misspoke. Lots of gun violence in IL, not sure if they qualify as "mass shootings"
@SenatorDurbin @Maggyw519 Add this, happened today. Savannah, Ga, 4 shot, woman dead, 3 men injured.
@SenatorDurbin @grammy2 i should like to see this next to police involved shootings
@SenatorDurbin Talk is cheap, Senator. DO something about it! You can get millions to the Wall St Banks--but can't stop NRA?! Unbelievable.
@SenatorDurbin maybe as Illinois senator you should concentrate your efforts towards the gang violence in Chicago, instead of the leftist bs
@SenatorDurbin @CelinaGrayMusic how many more before it stops???
@SenatorDurbin @Nrtheast4Bernie You are a Senator, Sir, do something about it then.
@SenatorDurbin this misses the shootings in #Houston and #Savannah earlier today
@SenatorDurbin Stop setting the staffers to tweet and have them start drafting meaningful legislation
@SenatorDurbin So DO SOMETHING. You’re our representative! BG checks, regulations, hell liability insurance for gun owners. GET IT DONE.
@SenatorDurbin Good call! I'm so tired of people saying mass killings are good for the country. Thank you Captain Obvious!
@SenatorDurbin @Karen_Pickell The spending to fix overseas nations while this occurs is outrageous.
@SenatorDurbin @BonnieRenouf When is Congress going to do something about it?  Too busy defunding PP?  Too busy defunding the ACA?  we suck
@SenatorDurbin @TomHurleyOSP Then Congress needs to step up! Defy the NRA, and protect the sanctity of life here in the U.S.!!
@SenatorDurbin @terryamerson You're in the senate dude. Do something.
@SenatorDurbin be the voice that leads this to stop.  Too much violence. #peace
@SenatorDurbin @JoanieGentian With all due respect Senator, your colleagues need backbone transplants & to get off the NRA pad first.
@SenatorDurbin thank you. Arming anyone/anywhere is not working. We need our elected leaders to stand up to this epidemic.
@SenatorDurbin what's the excuse for your chicago constituents?
. @SenatorDurbin what do you plan to do to reduce gun violence?
@SenatorDurbin I mean YOUR graphic. My graphic is a gift. Peace.
@SenatorDurbin Great graphic. Perfectly displays "Insanity -American Style"
.@SenatorDurbin @Jeff_Gabe Yes, the shootings have got to stop. #EndGunViolence
@SenatorDurbin they have now disappeared,  a professional hit!  In tactical gear armed with long guns no way this is just a mass shooter
@FredaLombardi @SenatorDurbin Being paid to do something makes one a professional. Many terrorists are paid by one group or another, no?
@SenatorDurbin filling out a form for a gun license or doing background checks. It was well thought out, these shooters were prepared!
@SenatorDurbin stop making a tragedy political to fulfill your gun control agenda!  This isn't about someone going into a local gun shop and
@SenatorDurbin What is your plan?
@SenatorDurbin men in body armor with mass weaponry!  well thought out exit plan means professionals!  this isn't about the NRA or gun laws.
@FredaLombardi @SenatorDurbin Actual, this is about gun laws, the only developed country that has this problem and our laws make it easy.
@SecretlySophie @SenatorDurbin criminals will always get guns no matter how many gun control laws u pass. Chicago has strict gun laws and
@SenatorDurbin What is your source for your stats? VOX? Wikipedia? MSNBC? Sesame Street? All equally credible!
@Dcoxboomer @SenatorDurbin You, @Dcoxboomer, with your comments are a HUGE part of this equation...I have right NOT to have guns everywhere!
@BonnieRenouf That doesn't make sense. You don't like guns so the rest of us must be defenseless. @SenatorDurbin
@Dcoxboomer @SenatorDurbin  Christian Conservative...
@BonnieRenouf @SenatorDurbin And....
