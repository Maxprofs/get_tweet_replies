~ANYONE THAT LOVES THEIR FAMILY WOULD NOT PLACE THEM IN A SITUATION OF POTENTIAL RISK SUCH AS THIS.

To the so-called party of family values: Tearing immigrant families apart is NOT the answer. #ICERaids 
Says the crooked senator from New Jersey.
~Is he still under ethics investigation?
@SenSchumer RAID THEM ALL.WHEN FINISHED WITH THE ILLEGALS THEN WE CAN START WITH LIBERALS,WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN CONSTITUTION
@SenSchumer what a fool
@SenSchumer well... BOB next you will say tearing families apart by putting father's who broke laws in jail is wrong too!?

Wait, are you telling me there are consequences to committing crimes in the #USA? WTF is happening here, this cant be true!
Why does the POTUS keep saying that the majority of the people are behind him regarding Immigration/refugees? Protesters?

CHUCK FIND A WAY TO DEPORT THE CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENT ALL THE ONES UNDER 21-NO TEARING APART FAMILIES.???

Obama is not prez anymore his rules are gone.Illegal aliens are all CRIMINAL aliens. Do your job for Americans they pay you
@SenSchumer illegals you mean
@SenSchumer Wjat do you not understand about the words illegal amd criminal
"Illegal" immigrants,u forgot that little word which means they should never have been here in the first place.Citizens 1st
Where were you both when Obama did the same thing?
Look there is a legal way to come here. Its their fault for not following the rules of our country.
Excuse me. These are illegal Immigrants you're talking about. The word "illegal" still exist in American Dictionaries.
@SenSchumer if they're illegal they shd be separated-from the benefits they TAKE from legal US citizens-get'em outa here !
How about the baby rapers, leave them here? I don't think so. Trump is doing the right thing.
@SenSchumer  thank you senators!
@SenSchumer immigrants coming illegally is what is tearing families apart. Comitting crimes is tearing families apart.
You both need to change your Diapers
@SenSchumer if thier illeagles they got to go,plain and simple, you politicians have to wake up and enforce our laws
@SenSchumer But it was ok when @BarackObama did it??? #Hypocrites
@SenSchumer you not listening. That's why Trump won. Time to start or you'll be gone soon .
The woman voted 5 times and she isn't entitled!
@SenSchumer Removing convicted criminals who have warrents and deportation orders.Tell the truth.
. Trump admin will have no relationship w/family values.  Follow the money & power, that is what they embrace.
Thank you for standing up for these families.
how many families have the dems destroyed or never given a chance due to planned parenthood?
Enforce immigration laws because we have rights too.  They know the risk when they break the law. ICE is doing there job.
@SenSchumer despicable lying hypocritical left. I will never vote for democrats again!!!! You have lost another one.
family values without laws.
@SenSchumer http://ln.is/www.fairus.org/issue/Z9OkL …
@SenSchumer They are NOT law-abiding immigrants!  Quit the BS, illegal entry is breaking the law.
@SenSchumer if they are illegals the have to go,you idiots wake up!
@SenSchumer #traitors
We ain't buying the sob stories anymore. What about AMERICANS who have sob stories due to the damage. FU
There are no immigrant families being torn apart. ILLEGALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CHOICES are being removed
@SenSchumer exactly!!! The hypocrisy
@skennison If you are here illegally... You should deported! Historically, immigrants went through the process. #MAGA
@BarackObama averaged 6,010 weekly deportations over his 8 years. Here were ur tears then?
@SenSchumer U forget that Bro Bammy deported 2.5 milln. U don't care, ur motive is solely political. Hack scum #whyyoulost
1/2 @SenatorMenendez @SenSchumer Is it fair that immigrants WITH families work hard and do all the legal things necessary to stay in this...
2/2 ...country yet you and Dems want to allow illegals in and break the law!  #supportice #supportthepause
@SenSchumer Hey guys,,, they STARTED the whole process breaking federal law. What don't you get? Like you care...
u r a comunist...look up the word
omg really? By this time last yr obama had over 2000 criminal illegals deprted
Stop your fear mongering, PLEASE!
@SenSchumer then deport the whole family!
spoken like a true law breaker...if not for your title you'd be doing 10 years....a real conman
I agree,,,,the entire family should be sent back home and out of the USA.
why is the media not covering this? @CNN help! Perhaps this is why @POTUS pulls moronic moves. To divert from atrocities!
illegal is illegal - did you not take an oath to defend the constitution alt left libtard
@SenSchumer  American citizens who break the LAW are separated from their families everyday! ENFORCE ALL LAWS!
@SenSchumer So committing crimes against the American citizens should be ignored because we feel sorry for these punks
ICE reminds me of DAPL and that scumbag JAMEs Comey fuckhole.
nobody's forcing the illegitimate anchor babies to stay. The whole happy familia can deport together. Great bonding for all
stop being dishonest
You know very dam well CRIMINAL ALIENS.  You know you are an agitator.
@SenSchumer Immigrants enter the country legally, people who enter illegally are called invaders and be deported
@SenSchumer Murder suspect sentenced to prison. Judge tears family apart. Get. A. F'n. Clue. It's. The. Law!
Thank you for speaking out Senator. These sweaps are inhumanely ripping families apart. This is not "immigration reform"
what confuses you about ILLEGAL immigration?
Maybe U can explain to me that if Obama Care is so good 4 my family, why did U exempt U & UR family from it??
"Family values" here is you working for USA citizens- not against them. Can't do that, you need a different profession.
need to ask obvious, are you for the USA?
@SenSchumer What s bunch of lying hypocrites! Why you both support murderers and child molesters? anything we need to know?
@SenSchumer why did they come over here together? I am sure many vane separate, so why the concern now
ICE reporting 75% to even 95% caught in raids have criminal records. You favor jailing over deporting? That benefits USA?
@SenSchumer HEy Mememdez why don't you handle your legal business &b quiet
well, they are not WHITE families!
thank you for being our voice
what part of convicted felons, gang members don't you get. U don't get to change the facts. #notmysenator
@SenSchumer illegal criminals IS a reason to deport. Being a criminal is a choice. Sorry their luck. Not.
@SenSchumer  Why arent you in jail Bob?
@SenSchumer EXACTLY! DO SOMETHING. WE NEED HOPE!
GOP = selfish party
So if I break the law as a CITIZEN, I can argue don’t send me to jail b/c it will tear my family apart? ABSURD
That *Family Values* party meant THEIR families - not yours or mine. Immigrant rights are human rights. #Resist
Not if they break laws. Why do lefties always forget about that silly thing called the law?
@SenSchumer don't tear them apart. Sent them all back together. Problem SOLVED.
what are you doing about Flynn and Russia scandal more important right now
@SenSchumer Neither is opening the borders.
@SenSchumer U forgot to mention the word ILLEGAL show me 1 legal family that's been torn apart U can't stop pandering
@SenSchumer dodnt see you complaing when Obama did that to my family
Thanks 4 speaking up.This ethnic cleansing is immoral & affects both citizens & non-citizens. Hurts communities& economy.
they should have thought about that before they broke the law! No sympathy here! From an immigrant that came in legally!
They knew it was a possibility when they came & stayed illegally
Bobbie, we DONT CARE about immigrants, We care about ILLEGALS BOBBIE....Illegals. #UrBiased
@SenSchumer   No need to rip family's apart. There family's can go back with them.  Problem solved
@SenSchumer  me River! Follow the very laws that Everyone else's family to, to immigrate here or don't come at all! #MAGA
"They" only care about themselves, it's the selfish party
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez they can leave with them we don't opject to that
well, the children have dual citizenship, so you can deport their children with them.
@SenSchumer We want legal immigrants not illegal immigrants! The immigration laws should be used let them come legally!
The party of legal families....YES! Not the party of illegal immigrants.
@SenSchumer Idiot liberals will never admit/understand this: How to stop tearing families apart -- STOP BREAKING THE LAW!
@SenSchumer deporting criminals is.
@SenSchumer go Trump get all of those free loading convict illegals out of our country, since the left won't do it!
LOLOL Why didn't you tell Obama that?
@SenSchumer neither is allowing them to rob, shoot and kill or deal drugs to our youth. SWTH.
@SenSchumer Illegal aliens tear their families apart. Unlike our deployed military, they have a choice.
well if the immigrants break the law they should be sent back. Many immigrants with documentation and don't break the law
Do you say the same thing when a Heroin Dealer is arrested and separated from his/her family?
@SenSchumer hey Menendez your a crook and you want to stand there and lie about felons being deported! Go to clown troop!
@SenSchumer  disgraceful. Childprotect. laws separate family2. Safety 1st. ur party represents US w/ corporal punishment
@SenSchumer Then send their family back with them. Problem solved.
@SenSchumer these r known criminals. If they were Americans they would be in jail. Why do Dems continue to protect criminal
because dems support murderers, rapists and child molesters..they hate law abiding citizens
Rep'ns should be ashamed not pushing back on breaking up of families! Impeach @realDonaldTrump
Illegal aliens are responsible. Deployed military families are separated, too.
Thank you for that. You are correct.
@SenSchumer Bob, buddy, tell us about that girl under age in Porto Rico? Wife know?
@SenSchumer Americans pay for it that's bull.shite an.we don't like paying for abortion an baby parts either with our taxes
@SenSchumer well if you both had got off your lazy rumps & followed the law & stopped breaking law wouldnt have this mess
can you ask @CoryBooker if he thinks Tim Scott from SC is an Uncle Tom he won't answer
@SenSchumer  I am glad to here illegals are getting out of America. They all can come back legal..an the work you say us
@SenSchumer   As they gleefully rub their hands together and smile at what suffering they brought... in the White House
IF YOUR LEGAL-NO PROBLEM !!!!  WELCOME TO AMERICA!!
@SenSchumer They are illegal!
@SenSchumer try 2 understand that  illegals put themselves in that position there are plenty of opportunities 2 do it right
name them ? There is no real line to obtain a visa . And the only way to do it right is by having money .
where was your outrage when Obama deported 3 million
Well said! So heartbreaking to see this! As a white man I am ashamed & angered, feeling helpless but protest to stop it
Man up!
@SenSchumer why don't you Democrats start thinking about the American citizens illegal seem to be your number one priority
@SenSchumer And your compassion for the families of the victims of illegal criminals crimes falls where? Our safety first.
Dufus. If someone comes into your home uninvited, it's ok to tell them to leave. Adult Illegal is responsible for own fam.
@SenSchumer this is the law of the land. We are not tearing families apart we are enforcing THE LAW.
Thank you @SenatorMenendez for standing up!
@SenSchumer No one is "tearing families apart"--criminal illegals can take their anchor babies home with them.
Thank you for your public speaks on immigration and ICE raids!
@SenSchumer Using your flawed logic,  we shouldn't send anyone to prison either,  tears families apart.
Or, we should just nix all laws. After all, it's optional to enforce them anyway.
@SenSchumer They'll know we are Christians by our love.
Demonstrates love of country when we put thieves in jail, send illegal aliens out.
Now that's  the NJ I love!
@SenSchumer so many crying liberals I love it
We may not agree with the practice but we need to be honest about what is unusual versus what is normal US practice.
To be fair, more than 2 mil. people were deported under Pres. Obama, including more than 409,000 people in 2012 alone.
@SenSchumer Thank you!
@SenSchumer What you are saying is tearing any criminal away from there family is wrong # very sad
@SenSchumer So by letting this woman stay you condone the stealing of social security numbers - asking for more trouble
It appears to be the party of white racist men.
haha... that name calling no longer works especially when coming from supporters of murderers an rapists
@SenSchumer they need to take responsibility for their own actions! They knew the risk. They alone are responsible!
