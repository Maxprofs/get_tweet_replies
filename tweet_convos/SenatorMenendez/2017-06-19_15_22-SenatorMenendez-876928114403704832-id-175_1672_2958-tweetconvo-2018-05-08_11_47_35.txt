@SenKamalaHarris The quickest way to change the dynamics of this healthcare bill is to VOTE FOR JON OSSOFF...23 seats to change in Congress!
ACA was kept a secret, then passed without asking GOP. Turn about is fair play, it couldn't be worse than what we have now, that's for sure
You mean like you and the Democrats did with Obamacare?
DEMAND IT. Seriously. Storm their offices if necessary. This isn't something to teeter on.
@Senate @Congress @RealDonaldTrump The Republicans Can't Do Better Then ObamaCare! LET IT BE! Harming USA Citizens Health Care, Their Lives
You obviously are not a self-supporting Obamacare victim.
As usual the deception  continues . The only way the GOP can get things through is with ugly tactics in secrecy
the same way you fools did Obama
Won't be secret by MID-TERM ELECTION time.
Thank you Senator for holding your colleagues accountable. Hold the Floor and fight the bill!
Bob Menendez - Why debate? The Dems should be co author of the bill if you acted in the best interest of the American people!
It's about freakin time you spoke up.  Crickets from you and Booker on the disaster that is Washington DC.
he is part of the disaster
Just following Pelosi's example--just saying
ya mean like Christmas eve 2010? Like that kind of secret?
You had nothing with obumer care, WHAT have you done to HELP, NOTHING, just whine & whine like all the libs & create usless programs ,
looking for targets with Liberal faces.. just for motivation.. it is getting harder to find the enemy when the enemy is in our face..
Now you're sounding like a real Trumper 
lol.. Did you hear that this guy endorsed the targeting of GOP's last week? I just play and have fun on here..lol
Where have you been all these years while Obamacare choked the middle class? Not a word from you. You haven't cared.
.@SenateDems as U passed #Obamacare, replacement is something U live with-@Gop learned #DemocratFilthyTricks WeThePeople sick of all of YOU!
Mitch doesn't want a serious debate nor any debate at all. He said enough to debates. ie Time to swear allegiance to the Kremlin.
Like "We have to pass it to see whats in it" ???
Karma America. Lest we not forget what these Republicas r doing to us
@splcenter @therealnews @thenation @democracynow @jaketapper @wkamaubell @kboo @kyaq @zakburnskirofm
Thanks for keeping them accountabke
Ask the Insurance Companies if you can take a look at THEIR copy.
When does your trial start or is that secret as well?
Call down! What's your solution? Haven't seen it. Does your caucas have a plan? All you seem to do is B****.
They aren't looking for debate just abeyance

A Wise man once said: Never trust a turtle doing a rush job 

        .      .             

…
Just like w/ACA. "We have to pass the bill to see what is in it." Dems just don't like the same rules that was used on GOP in 2009 & 2010!
2% of all mankinds income, all will be covered
At a max, $ 500 per month, a ceiling
I agree senator. You have to protect American citizens. Senators should have the same healthcare as we will have.
Maybe they should pass it via reconciliation after MA elects a REPUBLICAN to fill Ted Kennedy;s seat. Wait.....
I hope the Democrats keep making noise about this. Keeping this a secret is true treachery!!!!
The same way Nancy Pelosi wanted to pass ACA  to see what's in it
Thank you and please do everything you can to stop this horrible bill. #ShowUsTheBill
This is kinda' cute!
CROOKS & DICTATORS WILL ALWAYS WANT TO HIDE THE NASTY TRUTH BUT THATS HOW MCCONNELL WORKS HE SMILES THEN LIES AND KILLS CONSTITUENTS #CROOK
there is no debate... just pass #NIMA 

save the theater for Cesar
@SenatorTimScott @LindseyGrahamSC Do y'all know where it is? The people of SC deserve better than this. VOTE NO on #ACHA
Dude is the mack
SOUNDS LIKE THE OBAMACARE TRADEMARK,VOTE FIRST-DONT TELL US WHATS IN & WE'LL GET FINED IF WE DONT BUY. - FIX - F.D.A. U FIX HEALTHCARE !!!!!
You need to pass it so you can see what's in it.
Sometimes you just gotta pass the bill to find out what's in it. #obamacare #Pelosi
#ShowUsTheBill  Dems attitude prolonged seeing this bill but I support #TrumpCare but I want/need #Dems input for fair bill
They don't want to spoil the surprise.
Provision called Flexcare.  Healthcare with Flexseal included for those in government where Depends aren't enough to plug the leaks.
Say it
Democrats set the stage with the piranha attacks on the current admin.  If you don't want to be helpful then just wait until they are ready
Mystery meat.
Your not going to debate it... it will be passed just like obama care

When are you and the democrats gonna take responsibility for that shit sandwich called Obamacare that you people shoved down our throats ?
Thanks for standing up for everyone who needs healthcare!
This is why Republicans will win more seats in 2018, voters remember when the Democrats passed Obamacare without knowing what was inside.
It's a huge steal from the poor and give to the rich con job on the American people. why else would they be hiding it. Even they are ashamed
They want us to die. They aren't humans, they are paid to make certain companies win big. Follow the money.
Any good legislation will have its proponents singing from the rooftops so everyone can see how great it is.

Bad legislation is 'hidden'!
Lower NJ property tax first u crook
GOP, show America the healthcare bill!
Thank you @SenatorMenendez #NoHearingNoVote
What's your plan Mr. Senator? We all understand how ridiculously pompous, arrogant and shamelessly un-American this is. #WhatWillYOUDo
@GeorgeTakei I suspect the #GOP #Healthcare bill is hidden where the #Iraqi #WMD are stored: send #W out again to find it 
... well, to be honest, half of that failure is on Trump. xD
Let me remind you folks that the TPP was kept secret too. And in the end, it floundered from lack of blind support.
https://twitter.com/SenatorCardin/status/876939832341221378 …
Trump care is just a bill. Need to try to prevent this from becoming law.
A quick lesson for my friends in @SenateGOP, who seem to have forgotten. #Trumpcare #ShowUsTheBill https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0 …

Well that says it all. 

Schumer: The GOP's "radical departure from normal procedure" leaves Democrats "little choice but to depart from normal procedure as well." 
May the Russians could get hold of a copy?
Trump doesnt know whats in it ... so no
@SenateDems #HoldTheFloor Stand strong. Thank you!
They probably don't have much and are embarrassed.  They are still trying to put it together. If they were proud, @gop would show the bill
How can it be legal or "Democratic" for them to do this???
Good question.
aren't you awaiting trial?
Because they are sneaky criminals
You do realize the Constitution was kept secret too right?
Why in NJ if a family has dependents over 20 they r charged more then dependents under 20 & why in NJ r they charged per dependent 4 first 3
Keep pushing for them to show us their HC plan- We demand to see it, read it, debate it BEFORE you vote on it #ShowUsTheBill
Weren't you supposed to go to jail awhile ago?
Why r u making it harder 4 small biz in NJ 2 buy health ins for example b4 Jan 17 a employer was counted as an employee and now not why????
Maybe they'll have to pass it to find out what's in it?
@SenateDems 
Republicans do not know how to act in a democratic society! This is not Russia! Not yet anyway. Shame Shame
#nj voters support you and @CoryBooker taking drastic measures. This is life or death not just partisan obstructionism. #AHCA #HoldTheFloor
Ask @NancyPelosi how. And FFS, @OpenTheDebates
Are you proud of the new Russian base in Cuba?
Its ng they aren't showing it, but u have no intention of debating it. Perhaps if Ds were willing to work with Rs something good gets done.
Founders never wanted today's morass and would be appalled by Rs actions over healthcare bill. #ShowUsTheBill
Thank you, Senator for fighting for my healthcare. Thank you so much! #ShowUsTheBill 
#ResistGOPCare 
#ReconciliationAmendments
DON'T LET THAT DONKEY FACE MITCH MCCONNELL TAKE AWAY OUR HEALTHCARE FOR RICH WHITE REPUGS LIKE THAT DISGUSTING DEVOSS! RESIST!
They are such greedy cowards.
I am assuming I read 2k pages from ACA? If yes- y don't I help the unaffordable ACA in ur own town of NJ we haven't heard anything from u!!!
They don't want a debate. So what are you prepared to do about it? Stop whining and act.
Did you read the #AHCA ? Why don't I review  & show us ur proposal bc there is nothing from u!!!!
Good lord, the irony is smothering.
I hate it when Republicans copy what democrats did. LOL
Cheesy but effective
is this the new Dem strategy? To troll republicans via twitter vids? IDK if it'll work, but it did make me chuckle.
You don't need to see it there is only one provision-INS co's can do and charge whatever they want.
Will you #WITHHOLDCONSENT in order to urge GOP to openly debate this critical legislation? NJ and all Americans want it, deserve it!
They don't want to debate, just like in 2010
Republicans don't want a debate. They want rule by any means necessary in a very bad way.
#PartyBeforeCounty #Cowards
Thank you Senator Menendez. I called your office today as your constituent. I fully support you in rejecting @SenateGOP 's #AHCA
Welcome to totalitarianism Bob.  Get used to it if Trump and his Republican lackies in Congress have their way.
Check Hillarys email
????¿?????????????????
Senator did you read the whole ACA the Obamacare bill  when you voted for it ?
It must be one f'ing horrendous bill since they are working so hard to keep it secret.  These people are going to kill us all.
Stop promoting violence and hate. The Dems didn't let the Republicans read their bill. #Karma You're not the majority anymore
Bullshit.  There was over 18 months of debate and over 80 hearings and debate on the ACA.  There were even Republican amendments added.
It was passed in the house without one Rep reading it and most Dems didn't read it either. Not sure if even Obama did since he lied to us
Thank you Bob! FIGHT!!!
Clearly debate is last thing they want. What they respond 2 is tremendous backlash from railroading thru ag public interest. We'll remember.
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Your a crook
Thank you @SenatorMenendez for speaking up for the voiceless, #ShowUsTheBill 
But I m sure you can find that cornhusker kick back from Obamacare
They don't want to be bothered to have a debate.  They are being like an evil dismissive step mother waving away the " annoying" children
Like the #ObamaCareBill U approved B4 U read it? The bill is available 4 everyone Open your eyes & stop blaming the GOP 4 #Obamacare failure
Stupid stunts they haven't even got the bill drafted just stand around grandstanding Democrats are worthless
Thank you sir for fighting for ALL of us who face this crisis.
We don't need debates you've had years of debates stop stalling & make an effort to contribute & stop using your time on silly videos
So you're fine with a bill that has no input from other senators? And "stalling?" Who's stalling? That's impossible.
Chuck just announced a sit in to stall the bill from a vote and yes if senators DEMs want to stand there and not put forth anything to help
Lol in Soviet Russia Dems stall you! 
MY LAST NAME MEXICAN YOU ARE LOSEING YOU BASE ALL YOUR VOTERS stick a fork in the party they are done screwed the puch
Sounds like Obama care again!
There were 100s of hours of debate on ACA.   160+ changes were made based on recommendations from GOP. NOT EVEN CLOSE to current GOP crap
"Have to pass the bill to know what is in it" does that sound familiar?
It wasn't written in the dark  100hrs. 160 recommendations incorporated.
Still not passed yet. Stop the hate
Wow...no hate, just education.
Now if I said Obama's crap you would say it was hateful. Now let my kids choose if they want to pay for health care.
Unfortunately that's the problem... those without insurance still need medical. We ALL pay for the uninsured.
Amen!
i think SenatorMenendez is lying and o am sorry i EVER VOTED DEMOCRATIC. my friends see the news of what they are saying SAME THING
Can we get Russians/Wikileaks to put it online?
@SenateDems like obamacare. Hypocritical dem. Nothing positive. Obstructionist.
Republicans were too irresponsible to put them in complete charge of our govt. It was clearly a huge mistake.
you.go.guy!!
bupkis.

That's kind of the point... 
Love you Senator Keep them honest!!!
