@SenateDems even Oprah supports charter schools....nothing wrong with school choice
Except the significant amount of academic evidence against it as an effective policy.
I find that hard to believe
I've spent my entire adult life working in school improvement and pedagogy. Evidence overwhelming.
you cannot possibly suggest gov knows what's best for parents and their children
It would be staggeringly arrogant to suggest that all parents have all right answers in all cases.
I'm see you have a lot of exp with education, but you are in favor of taking away the right to choose
School choice shown not to work. I'm in favor of teaching in ways that work! :) Is my life's work!
@SenateDems you mean she is pro school choice and anti indoctrination camp...get it right
@SenateDems Thank you Sen Menendez. Thank you for trying.
Thank u for trying. A very disappointing day but we fight on! I hope there is a way to #stopsessions and #stopmnuchin!
Thank you for standing up for what is right. That's what we ask of you, & you answered.
thank for no vote on DeVos
It's a sad day in the US when the VP ignores the calls & emails of the American Public to further an unqualified candidate
Thank you Senator!
you voted with @harryreid2016 to remove the need for 60 votes to confirm appointees.  Shame on you!!
Thank you for voting 'no' for DeVos. Continue to vote for the benefit of the people so that America stays great!
exactly. We've  called Senator Burr but he seems to be hard of hearing. Hopefully he will vote against her confirmation.
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU FIGHT HARDER TO STOP THIS????  YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SHOULD BE SHAMED.
Thank you for trying your hardest. Devastating results but there will be more of those---keep fighting, we need you!
@Minan21 I agree with @SenatorMenendez but remember that it was @harryreid2016 who removed the need for 60 votes to confirm appointees
thank you for voting NO Senator!!
Thank You for trying.

@SenateDems ¡Oye Comemierda! No necesitamos mas hijoeputas tragandose dinero sin resultados ¡Si con DeVos!
@SenateDems Thank you for standing to stop DeVos.
Thank you Senator Menendez.  DeVos is simply trying to buy her way into our government - not fair, not good
I thought the Dept of Education was going to be shut down.
yes thank you Senator #Holdthefloor
@SenateDems Being unqualified for the job has not kept you out of the Senate. You've advocated bad policies for years.
thank you
So True
@SenateDems How about getting rid of the Sec. Of Education all together.  Let states handle it.
keep up the good fight!
@SenateDems Says you.  Obstructionist
@SenateDems I really agree. She has no place overseeing national education.
@VozdeRaquel http://ln.is/www.c-span.org/video/KJFqu … #StopDeVos
thank you for being a voice of opposition against a highly unqualified candidate for SOE & 4 listening
TY TY TY!!!!
@SenateDems I only wish the @GOP were actually looking for someone to improve, rather than destroy, public education #devos
@SenateDems not one of his cabinet is a sane person, not one !!!
@SenateDems Nope just the strangle hold the teachers unions have on Washington DC.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your hard work
Plain & simple, Dems are whining & stamping their feet because they lost the election. We get it. Now time to grow up.
stamping our feet to save the country from fascism. If you are not worried you are not paying attention.
Right, anyone who doesn't subscribe to your group think is fascist, Hitlerian, or racist, blah, blah, blah.
@SenateDems look what all the others in the past who had so called experience destroy our educational system

Wld DeVos Dstroy School 4 Military Kids w/ Disabilities?

.@SenatorMenendez Thank you Senator for standing up against unqualified people trying to cut down our public education system.
@SenateDems Please don't vote for #Sessions either.
Sirs @SenatorMenendez @CoryBooker  giving #BetsyDeVos Education is readying  for corrupting the minds of minors with nonscience & fiction
Look your a Senator right ? OK So she is qualified just like you VOTE YES the game started are you in or Out
@SenateDems who do you recommend and why? PE has been in the gutter for yrs, what is your solutions?
@SenateDems you are right about that #StopDeVos
And the GOP know this is true. But they will sacrifice our children, America future rather than concede to Democrats.

, thank you for supporting the millions of HIGHLY QUALIFIED educators across America. #DumpDevos
you mean the teachers union
No, I did not mistype. I don't belong to a union and neither do millions of people opposing DeVos.
do you think the Public Schools are the best they can be
There are issues with our current system, but Betsy DeVos does not have the depth of knowledge necessary to bring change.
there pin issues for the past 30 years time for drastic change
Not in the way she wants to do it. Trust the experts. We work with kids and families every day.
the same ones that were there in the late eighties and nineties when I was in school no thank you
Thank you senator!
She will be confirmed.
thank you for voting no on this thoroughly unqualified candidate. #noDevos
classic pay to play
