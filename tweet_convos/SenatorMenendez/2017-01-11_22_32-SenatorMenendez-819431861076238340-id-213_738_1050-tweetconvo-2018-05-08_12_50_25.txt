You know what else is shameful, voting nay to lowering prescription drug prices for seniors. Looking at you @SenatorMenendez. 
Democrat voters need a new party. These corporate democrats are worse than republicans. At least Rep. don't fake it
@SenSchumer yes and there are so many of us that will be affected! Hear our stories http://facesoftheACA.com 
our story is rated up forty percent. Two providers left. Doctors dropping out like flies. Repeal. 
I encourage you to get real facts from reliable resources & develop some empathy for fellow citizens who have health issues.
I do have the facts. Our friends who lost their health insurance bc of Obummercare. $3000 deductible to $10k.Double premiums.
@SenSchumer  stop the kick backs
Politically motivated efforts to deny entry to Cubans seeking refuge from a totalitarian regime are also shameful.
@SenSchumer republicans just hate President Obama. They have a new plan. Here is what Donald says
I depend on ACA  I'm a contract worker. it's the only affordable way  we will watch n know midterms are coming up
Why are they so greedy and just plain Evil? Do they think we are all blind, or as stupid as trump voters?
@ forcing me to get health ins. put me $40,000 in debt with no way out I'm caregiver for my mom who is severely handicapped
this is a shame for all Americans. How can they rob healthcare for the most needy without implementing a new one?
simple they have not done that- someone is lying to you
send a message for all NJ and BOYCOTT January 20th!!
and yet you voted against the importation of identical pharmaceuticals from the same reliable countries we get our food...
why did you vote against Bernie's prescription drug amendment?
needs more kick backs to get DEM to agree
@SenSchumer : Do you have one? Let the people know it 
@SenSchumer  I am 63  mid class & been uninsured for 4 years OBAMACARE is $822 a mo + 6820 deductable unaffordable still !
Hey Unpaid Intern.. Let @SenatorMenendez know that he voted in his Investors Best Interests and not The American Peoples.
Hey Senator Bob you are supposed to be looking out for everyday Americans Not your Corporate Sponsors. Shame on you
@SenSchumer Repeal without replace is both immoral and irresponsible. #trumpsamerica #notmypresident
to remove the pork you must repeal 100%
ur shameful
. @SenatorMenendez Oops https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/29/how-sen-bob-menendezs-corruption-case-could-change-the-way-members-of-congress-do-business/?utm_term=.368d461db876 …
typical Democrats
And you voted to keep drug prices the highest in the world! You sir, are a hypocrite and we shan't forget your record.
Yes. But you were terrific. Kudos for standing up against pure evil.
look in the mior for pure evil, look at the media, look at Killary, Sorro + Obama if you want evil
@SenSchumer lies
And you joined them. You voted against a bill that would have allowed sick Americans access to cheaper meds!


The rest of Americans across the US must suffer and die under OBAMACARE for 30 million! The 30 million already get it free!
@PrincessBravato Also shameful: your vote yesterday to protect #PhRMA profits
the people that took  healthcare away from people are people like you making it unaffordable for people like us
@SenSchumer You mean give PEOPLE their healthcare back! Dems are the one's who took it away.  It's a raging failure
no, only in ur mind. Watch & learn
and you failed to get the American people now affordable drugs.  You are just as shameful.
...and our PEOTUS congratulated them for it on Twitter. Twilight Zone meets Celebrity Apprentice meets House of Cards.
Is this how the dems are going to help make Wash do something again?
What is shameful is how so many dems are lying to scare people. You know what you posted is dishonest.
What is shameful is your lack of support for lower prices on prescription drugs. HIPOCRESY!
@SenSchumer  "you have to vote for the plan to know what's in it " N. Pelosi .  Knock off the malarkey & fearmongering !
let the people die that's what republicans hid from their voters!
@SenSchumer you know what else is shameful, superdelegates and the dnc.  If primarys were fair a Democrat would be elected
I'm 1 of the 2000+ NY/NJ families still not home from blatant Sandy insurance fraud & NJ DCA probs..that's shameful
@SenSchumer those fxxkers
thank you for standing up. Please keep up the fight. #SaveACA
also shameful, not supporting access to lower cost pharmaceuticals from CA. What do you propose to lower $$?
@SenSchumer Help us... Please!
I am so glad that you are fighting to maintain the ACA
@SenSchumer Oh no please help us..
not something you need to worry about is it Bob
its shameful you voted against lower dug prices!
you should be ashamed!!! Why?!?
@SenSchumer You understand that you favor 20 million people over 310 million people right?
What's 'shameful' is that you Democrats put it in play in the first place.  You FU*KED UP THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.  Time to FIX IT
how much does Big Pharma give you to vote against @SenSanders Rx bill?
@JerseyStrong11 Mike Lee said they want to repeal it to get you to come to the table to help them replace it
Please do everything you can to fight for us! @SenateGOP are literally trying to kill me & millions of others with pre-existing conditions.
2 bad you didn't vote on bill to lower drug costs! Need New dem leaders who are willing 2 fight for progressive values
@SenSchumer how come your not in jail yet. Sick of your lies
This would be a catastrophe if they dont have a proper replacement for the 20 mill losing healthcare.
Yes it is, and I hear you voted against Sanders's bill to import inexpensive drugs from Canada. True?
says the guy who voted no on cheaper Canadian drugs while taking BigPharma's $! Shameful...
Your NO vote on the Pharm Bill is what's shameful...and this>>
@SenSchumer no Senator. The ACA was the largest transfer of wealth in history. You stuck the Middle Class with the bill.
you lost MI, WI, PA, and OH. Have you not figured out why? Your Leftward move is running Moderates off Senators
Senator Menendez, You're Shameful and YOU SUCK.
Repeal & Replace makes no promise 2 kill ACA tax penalty, will you commit to ending tax penalty if law changes?
@SenSchumer hey guys maybe u should have crafted legislation back in 2009 w full GOP support. Oh well, u own this mess now.
@SenSchumer stealing while America made the mistake of sleeping!
@SenSchumer having nothing is better than obama care
Are you trying to create chaos via Twitter??? Shame
Replace... say it with me r-e-p-l-a-c-e..good
now if we have a "LATINO" that will stand up for lowering drug prices, so poor Latinos will benefit!!! Nope, not here...
@SenSchumer @MitchMcConell @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @MikePenceVP bob if had built good program wouldn't be revoked #TX
What's shameful is that you lying frauds exempted yourselves.
if its so good, how come you and congress are not on it?
face it, the insurance rates for ACA have become to high
Why did you vot NAY on lowering prescription drug prices?
I have faith that it will be replaced with something affordable to every group. And will give access to legal immigrants
@SenSchumer You need to start working together and stop  fear mongoring to your followers. #CloserNation
@DiamondandSilk  whats shameful is you senator made sure congress was exempt from obamacare so dishonest
@SenSchumer You and Chuckles should look in the mirror if you want to see shameful PS how are you still allowed to be a SEN
Maybe if you didn't sell out against the @BernieSanders amendment to lower prescription drug prices we could trust you.
@thefive  whats shameful is you senator made sure congress was exempt from obamacare so dishonest
@GodStinks #ImpeachTrump
@SenSchumer Bob you have now moved up to the number one clown position. You and Chuckie are clowns.
obviously don't realize why you lost elections,obamacare has killed middle-class,should've read the bill first
@SenSchumer It's a sad day. How could they?
It threatens my sister’s life. I don’t know how they live with themselves, killing Americans for campaign contributions.
@SenSchumer 
Are u 2 blind&deaf? Americans don't have healthcare-premiums&deductibles TOO HIGH- OBAMADOESN'TCARE
@SenSchumer Yeah....get rid of The Unaffordable Act
even more shameful is you voting against cheaper drugs from Canada. how many lives are you campaign contributions from pharma worth?
@SenSchumer 
Shame!
Ha Ha, this partisan tweet blew up in your face. Winning!!!!!! The veil has been removed from Americans eyes.
@SenSchumer Stop lying Bob... Rand Paul's outline is smart and streamline get on board or get out of the way!!!
Please do everything in your power to resist this.
Thanks for taking a stand for All Americans
@SenSchumer I bet senate Rep personal cvg  is going to increase but that's ok right bec they are not "one of those people"
Yes & shame on u & Sen. Booker voted against having lower cost drugs imported from Canada. @SenBookerOffice. NJs too costly
The healthcare people have dropped because they can't afford the premiums?  That healthcare Bob?
THIS IS AWESOME. Because it was sold as a lie by the worlds sleaziest sales man.
. @SenatorMenendez how is your indictment for underage Hispanic Hookers going?
@SenSchumer you're jeoulous because you're not prevy to it.  So you talk BULL to scare people.  Pathetic!
1. we don't believe you 2. we weren't dying in streets before hilarious 'ACA' 3. do your effing job for a change
Major Insurer in IN,WI and MI no longer accepting payment plans. Forcing patients into bank loans.
You should probably stop tweeting. You do realize the public knows how you voted on Bernie's amendment, right? #Disgrace
how do you say this but vote against Sanders' prescription drug plan? Even fucking Ted Cruz voted for it. Shameful.
Not my healthcare, jackass.
Thank you for standing up to #saveACA
Trying to erase @POTUS from history. Shameful.
hey buttmunch- insurance isn't healthcare
@SenSchumer don't be disingenuous. It was a resolution. Stop your fear mongering. U r better tan that
you took my healthcare away when you passed #Obamacare without reading it. Looking forward to better insurance
@SenSchumer Thanks for cramming ACA down our throats resulting in our premiums ^62% and deductibles ^130%. Epic failure!
@SenSchumer The American People have rejected Obamacare.  We want it gone.  Repeal it NOW.
I am uninsur so Medicaid  is what I have. Like ACA it will be gutted by vengeful GOP.dt's agenda will hurt all
A good replacement for ACA would be a single payer system.  Hate to help your GOP colleagues but why not?
Shameful and Wrong. Americans will DIE. 52 million will become un- insurable.
The sheer # of shameful acts we r being subjected to is both  breaking & maddening The ACA shld b left alone
@SenSchumer this is going to be like the last time Republicans held both houses and it will be the Dems to go in and fix it
@SenSchumer DO SOMETHING!!!!
bro you just voted against an amendment last night that would have helped control the cost of medicine. WTF do you care???
it's like they want the end of the world so bad that they are attempting to create it...
They do need a replacement but Dems should be ashamed of lying to America about cost etc.
@SenSchumer they are pathetic. Thank you doe doing your part and voting against it.
Let them dig their own grave (or in this case, others' graves). Sad.
Repubs. obsession w/ destroying the poor & mid class is perverse! We are people! Not pawns!
We want to keep our ObamaCare . Disappointed on the nay for lowering prices on meds. So not cool
People who can't afford their prescriptions are also "denied health care." Shameful that some Dems support that.
One of my pills is $4K/MONTH!What you dems have done to American medicine is a CRIME!U better HELP him fix it.
Not True. You taken away some of our freedom by mandating a fine, so don't give me this crap about Rnc
And this?
and yet you voted against @SenSanders amendment to lower drug prices. You are so corrupt!
@LiberalJaxx why is no one discussing the billions this will cost us?
call them what they are. REFUCLICUNTS
you are bought by big pharma. I'm from NJ and I know you voted against Bernie's work. Dems deserved to losethe WH. #demexit
Please fight them every step of the way. You are our voice. This is unacceptable. #resist Thank you for representing us!
thank you for your support Senator!!!
#obamacare can't go away quick enough. I am tired of no insurance
don't replace it just for replacement sake. Do the work needed so that if is functioning and cost effective.
taking away a system that doesn't work is NOT shameful. Throw it away quickly THEN figure out a good decent healthcare.
most of us in America need coverage that works. #Obamacare DOESNT!  Give us GOOD healthcare we can afford
why'd you vote with them to keep our drug prices high
no replacement? Everyone should be outrage!
Was about time you are another disgrace for the great state and people of New Jersey. You should resign Domenican Republic
way to cross party lines & vote against lower prescription costs! At least u can afford #Ambien to help u sleep at night...
Please fight them.
Senator: stop with the political fear mongering. There WILL be a replacement. It will be better.  MAGA.
and I cant get Phys Therapy. Worked FINE w/ Medicare. Obamacare DESTROYED pain coverage... cept for the MILLIONS scamming.
yet Obamacare will cover drugs4KIDS, and promote giving EVERYONE antidepressants+tranqs+benzos to shut up the masses. NOTHX
Even when having coverage my health was not even 5% covered=95% OUT OF MY POCKET. Obamacare=RUINS disabled lives even more!
Not as shameful as FORCEFEEDING this ObamaGarbage+ stealing away old system that worked FINE! 
DEF better than O-lackaCare
you should have read the bill first! It's crap and you know it.
Important coverage 4 families of children with MH, medical and disability issues? Look after these families?
@tuckercarlson Corrupt SenMenendez opposes the Will of the People. #LockHimUp #LockherUp U R going to jail Bob!
Thanks! Good to hear from you. And you did us proud at confirmation hearing! @SenatorMenendez
if people are losing healthcare cheaper drugs sure would be swell. If only there were some bill you could vote on for that!
These generic drugs r watered down Not the same. No one Monitors this! Do something!
Great job.The women in white deserve credit for their courage,Thank U. China is taking over Cuba.Raul will be out 2018 .
VERY SHAMEFUL....they are power DRUNK.
‘Corroborating Evidence’ Backs Underage Prostitution Allegations Against Senator Bob Menendez http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/24/department-of-justice-corroborating-evidence-backs-underage-prostitution-allegations-against-senator-bob-menendez/ …  @SenatorMenendez
You could have voted for Bernie Sander's prescription drug amendment, but you didn't.  You're just as guilty.
And YOU just voted WITH the Republicans AGAINST the American people and FOR Big Pharma!
always had healthcare from employers when you WORK. Why did ACA remove incentive to find employment?#handouts not good
it's shameful the Dems have done so much to destroy this country and the Constitution! Obama Care is garbage!
@ormazd72 #ACA  When Jesus asks "why they killed all sick people ?"  "Because we hated Obama" won't fly w/ Jesus
If you care abt health WHY DID YOU VOTE NO? How do ya'll sleep at night?
Why did you vote against reduced cost RX imports from Canada? These are the same RXs sold in the US but 1/4 price. Explain
Don't try to act moral. You just voted against the lowering of prescription drug prices for Americans. Whose side are u on?
too many pockets lined w $$ in DC. That goes for GOP and dems.
@RobertGammon May God forgive them. Because low income people can't
Down with ObamaCare immediately
Thank you Bob Menendez for standing and voting no with fellow Democrats.  We appreciate the hard work! #TheResistance
@JumpTheRework I thought there were still a few decent Republicans. I was wrong.
