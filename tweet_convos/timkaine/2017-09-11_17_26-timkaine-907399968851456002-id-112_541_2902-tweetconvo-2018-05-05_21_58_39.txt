Don't listen to this idiot, Senator. We know what's going on with the neo-Nazis and extreme alt-right. We will beat them again!
Do you have any adult children? Do the always do as you wish?
I'm in China.
I'm a U.S. citizen, and I never miss a chance to vote.
.@GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
Trump should apologize for his comments. They were the most offensive words ever spoken by a President
If you're looking for political correctness ain't gonna happen, the man don't talk the talk,he makes results, if feelings hurt,wear earmuffs
Well if I run into those fine Nazis well I let them know

Thank-you, Sir. Hope that it will be Law by this Saturday. Glad to see that Heather did not die in vain. Keep up the great work!
Heather should have heeded the governors warning and stayed away! Anarchy was going on. I thank God I was not in a car that day or street.
Where is your compassion? She had the passion to stand up to hate! I see Bible scripture on your page: judge not or you will be judged!
Great, but why does this even have to be a "thing?" The callousness and political terror of many of your peers is pathetic.

You make it sound like a process . The rest of America new that day to condemn the hate , and recognizie the white supremacists as losers
It shouldn't take any human more then seconds to recognize. this let alone weeks the Senate should be ashamed

Yes and your son is part of the hate group Antifa so are you finally condemning them
Your such a insincere phoney you could care less all your interested in is votes
The life lost was due to @MikeSigner & @TerryMcAuliffe telling the police to stand down. They chose politics over safety! Shame on them
Let's not forget Senator 
H. Clinton got medical aid for first responders to this tragedy. She went straight to Bush for their health needs.
That's great but you're dropping the ball on healthcare.
So you're good at the obvious and innocuous.
U and Joe biden shld run-on a presidential ticket together. U decide who is president,   wld both be great.
Justice for #HeatherHeyer ! #charlotesville #forbiddingforget
I assume ANTIFA will be significantly noted in the condemnation.
Don't hold your breath.   Kaine despises this country.
That's fucking politics folks!! U have to spend taxpayers money to pass a resolution condemning hate. I mean fuck, really?!?
That's awesome news!! Thank you sir
You should co sponsor the Medicare for all bill.
Idiotic
IS TO THEM AN END OF ALL STRIFE.V17. WHEREIN GOD,WILLING MORE ABUNDANTLY TO SHOW UNTO THE HEIRS OF PROMISE THE IMMUTABILITY OF HIS COUNSEL
Will you support your President and repeal Obamacare?
No.  He has no good replacement.  Without that there will be nothing for you.
You go glen coco!
Yeah, that's nice, but won't save future lives like SINGLE PAYER will. You can't get behind that? You need to go.
Idiotic
too bad you don't condemn ESPIONAGE/treason in our country such as AWAN-contra and secret servers for sending and rec TOP SECRET info
Don't you have real stuff to work on
Does that include the hate crimes perpetrated by your son???
BTW
Vote the Out
@democrats Ed thinks we should "vote the out". I don't know what that means, but it has something to do with COVFEFE I think. @SenateDems
All slaves were owned by democrats.
All thugs live in white. Hse with Donny the vampire
You're mistaken. Hillary didn't get elected.
She is old hat.
U really have no clue about how to govern do u? Is ur son included in the condemnation of hate as he is a terrorist??
Thank you Senator Kaine! We appreciate your efforts on behalf of ALL of us.
"Mmm, Nazis are bad, okay? Killing is bad, okay?"

Real profile in courage there.
Stop hate! All hate! left wing extremist
Still waiting on the condemnation of ANTIFA, your son's bffs. Man up slick.
Can you request investigation into the bleach.bit server. Thousands of missing emails? Why Comey refused to investigate????
Oh yea, your the phony politician that took money from Bob Menendez!
You seem to know enough about so called "white supremacy " to enact legislation but not enough about Antifa. Only one side @ fault???
He should know a great deal bout antifa his son is one
Can I come out of my safe space yet?
Thank you, senator, and thanks to all the senate members who made this happen.
Now if only you would get on board with something that's not symbolic, like single payer
Stop working AGAINST those lives then. Playing politics instead of helping your constituents (#SinglePayer), speaks to your character. #dino
Dropping my $27 on people primarying against #dino incumbents.
Amen!!  I think cleaning the rot from the @DNC might be our most effective option.
Its tough being on a losing team right kaine you were as big a part as losing as clinton was. Get out of politics losers and go home
We're nowhere if the POTUS has to be told to condemn white supremacy. That he is a white supremacist should be grounds for impeachment.
Yes yes yes yes yes
Can U also Demand #Justice 4 lynching(attempted MURDER) of 8yrs young Child, simply 4 color of his skin.This is what #H8 breeds
When will you be introducing a response to the Senate condemning the ANTIFA violence yesterday in #Portland, and the threats in #Berkeley?
Destroy hate! Outlaw Antifa!
Thank you, Senator!
Have you condemned your ANTI First Amendment son or do you send him money so he can protest against America & destroy others property? #MAGA
Lol - Took you long enough to play racist card against Trump.  You should've done that 3 tweets ago!
Is there a list of the senators who voted against?
It was unanimous, no one voted against.
I saw 55 votes. Isn't there 100 senators?
I'm just going by Senator Kaine's tweet above.
Yea the Antifa hate that's been spreading without a word from any of you! CAUSE your the party of hate intolerance an racism glad you lost
Thank you Senator Kaine.
Like the hate of your violent son?
How about full censure? Or impeach??
Were proud of you everyday @timkaine
Your son is a member of Antifa...thoughts 
Why no concerns that the mayor & gov failed to keep people safe? Because they both Dems, right??
That this still an issue in 2017? #fail
You should try recognizing that Medicare for all will save lives.
What a waste of time! Of course America condemns this type of hate. Don't you have better things to be working on? Taxes / Healthcare?
Thank you.
Still wish you would have condemned the hate that led Virginia to execute a mentally ill man.
Another senator wasting taxpayers money. Totally Useless.
Well done Sirs/Madams/Ms'
On only one side, right?
Kaine represents all that is Wong with America.
