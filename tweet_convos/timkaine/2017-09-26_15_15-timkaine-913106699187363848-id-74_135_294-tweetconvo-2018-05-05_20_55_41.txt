@timkaine  is about as moral as the Mayor of Gomorrah...
Which moral authority?
Too late
Agree about the Iran Agreement, but sadly, I'd say our "moral authority" has already been thoroughly trashed.
Wait. American morals. Does Iran have any to speak of?  Get real. Even God said kill them all but some Jew general said I want women. Dam.
Toxic @realDonaldTrump has already diminished our morality, credibility, and has torn friends and families apart
.America's moral authority died on 11/8/16
BS...SIGNING THAT FAKE AGREEMENT WITH IRAN LIARS WAS TREASON AGAINST THE USA
Russia is trump's country 
His actions taken thus far hurts Americans 
One grp or another 
Wake up people 
These are yur lives he's tkng
@realDonaldTrump has destroyed America's moral authority.  He must be impeached.
Our moral authority has been repeatedly trashed under 8 years of Obama. Any action by @realDonaldTrump can only restore it
The Iran Deal was a joke and you know it senator. It's time you work for your state and not for another country
We have to stop trump from continuing to hurt our world standing
We already did that the night @realDonaldTrump and the Russians were elected.
Our Trust factor too !! 
We no longer have one due to @realDonaldTrump
Our moral authority may be damaged beyond repair already. But this would not help.
HAHAHA..  Yeah that's certainly more important than Iran's Agreement going the way of Clinton's North Korea deal....
That ship has sailed..
Somehow I think that ship has sailed...
Trump has no morals. The things he has said about women other races r proof
Would giving back "donations" you received hurt yours?  -asking for a friend.
Moral authority, need morals first @realDonaldTrump
Grateful Senator Kaine still thinks we have some moral authority.
moral authority? 
Speaking of moral authority, how is your antifa son doing?
Decades of endless, winless, PROFITEERING wars, most prisoners on planet & CORRUPT OFFICIALS already damaged our "moral authority." #SitDown
Can't Mueller put a Rush on the arrest?
Don't worry Timmy we the people in Virginia will vote you out in 2018 . You're an embarrassment to Virginia.
I suppose giving them millions didn't damage Americans morale authority when they support terrorism
Haha. Obama's secret deal giving 400 billion$ to a country that sponsors terrorism was hardly morally correct. As usual you're off base Tim.
Sad to ask but do we have any moral authority remaining?
Tim Kaine - dumber than Joe Biden
So would leaving the Paris..... shit... nevermind....
DT is erasing all the good worksof Pres. Obama.  What a shame!
Tim, these people have little concern over morals or country.
Especially when we have a leader who reacts to FAKE NEWS.....he's nuts.
As long as cheeto is in the white house we have no moral authority
As if it hasn't already been undermined by you-know-who
They still havent released the hostages they promised
LOL TIm KAINE-u mean the JOKER? LOL HES A KREEPER! Put him on the LIST OF DEMOCRAT SEX OFFENDERS ;  Hillary/Huma dont care bout that NOR US
Sorry @timkaine , the USA lost its moral authority on January 20, 2017.
AMERICA'S MORAL AUTHORITY.
TRUMP HAS NO MORAL
NO AUTHORITY. 
HE IS IRRATIONAL, BELIEVE ME!!!
DONALD TRUMP is the best in the world
It's ruined until the next election cycle and a real president is in office.
Your title should read 'would damage it further'
That's a concept that is far beyond this administration
After electing Trump do we have any moral authority?
Rumpledthinskin has pretty much destroyed any moral authority the country had.
Moral authority? That was lost the day of the inauguration
Do we still have moral authority?
moral authority? Lol Everyone but American's know they are Shady As F
I think it's a bit late to believe we still have any moral authority.
We lost it last November.
It is a shame nothing can be done about @realDonaldTrump . Hope those around him just placate him
Especially based on a truly *fake news* account of a test in Iran! #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNOW #1stAmendmentRights
Under the new leadership, US has no moral authority.
America's moral authority has no support from an immoral president. Making America.........
Time for a shadow government!
@AP @NPR @MSNBC @FoxNews @foxandfriends @dailykos @thedailybeast @CNN @WSJ @Newsweek @nytimes @ABC Electing Trump has already done that.
US has no moral authority after lies about Iraq WMDs and supporting terrorists in Syria.
The current "president" is a toad. That ship has sailed.
Oh, don't worry @timkaine. America is DEFINITELY not the moral authority anymore now that we've elected @realDonaldTrump
