How much more do they need.  Money or volunteers
You should open your pocket Tim, didn't you and Hillary make over 100 million for your presidential run? I know you guys didn't give refunds
Senator, watch the hearings on the Jones Act. It is a good law.
Trump is way ahead of you, buddy. As usual.
Kaine is such a douche bag and a puppet for the Dems he's too stupid to realize it....
Our military can set up camp in a matter of minutes complete with fuel, tents, beds, food.  Why aren't we doing it in Puerto Rico?
Jones Act needs to be waived more than 10 days.  It adds huge costs to an island that has been devastated.
You should just shut up!
I am glad you want to help volunteer at FEMA for a 45 day deployment or donate your fat pay check
Why do you expect Democrats to carry the burden individually, but ignore the Republican Admin inaction?
Tim Kaine makes a blanket statement what WE need to do but does not lead by action there hundreds of Govt people here volunteering for min 45 day deployment he can be first to lead by example
You have high expectations for Democrats.   Spend your energy encouraging Repubs to serve rather than whining about the Democrats.
Personally I do not care about what Democrats pursue in my opinion they are a waste of good air space. I think Senator Kaine should lead by action rather than pontificate what he thinks others should do as he suggests
Waive it forever
Statehood for all Americans.  1 week to make a 3hr flight across a "big big ocean" is genocide by neglect.
Can we gofundme Airfare for US truck drivers to get to #PuertoRico
DUMBASS

Why not make it permanent? Support Open Americas Water Act. Support #PuertoRico
The Jones Act should be waived and repealed. It is oppressive and unfair.
Please GO 2 Puerto Rico. You have a unique background w/mission experience +R fluent in Spanish. There is NO REASON PLANS WEREN'T IN PLACE!!

Stop lying. Feds were there prior to hurricane and still are.
Trump's delay in providing the essential needs (food, fuel, medicine and water) to our Puerto-American citizens is tantamount to genocide.
Oops!  Hillary Clinton "supported" the Jones Act!
Thank you for your voice of reason.
45 said protecting American lives was his priority. Therefore, like Nike says, Just do it! #NoExcuses! #BeaLeaderforAllAmericans! #JustDoIt!
Also, the US Virgin Islands are in great need of relief support.  If you could use your influence to help them, that would be great!
Don't forget the US Virgin Islands! The suffering there is as bad as in Puerto Rico. Very little being mentioned!
IMO, it is an act of legislative cruelty to continue to impose Jones act while #PuertoRico is suffering. @realDonaldTrump needs to act. History is watching. #USPolitics
He did the following morning of the request.
Let's talk eliminating Jones Act or at very least, permanently exempting #PuertoRico
Why don't rich guys like you volunteer?

Jones act waived for Irma and Harvey but that was to move petroleum, this is just food and other supplies
absolutely senator,I&my @margbrennan discussed,I concerned lack of response to provide emergency relief aid,funds,by Pres Trump,#PuertoRico
It would've been better if it was repealed. Can you do that? This would help puerto rico's economy in the long term.
Uh....it was?  And Trump's had FEMA there.  Wtf? This isn't racist or a "Katrina moment".  Get over yourself
Our voices of reason n compassion

How can we aid with the supply of potable water? @galmobiletm Mobile Desalination Vehicle produces clean water from any water source in 5min
waive it

You guys are brainwashed by Dems and Repubs
CNN reporting, the Jones Act has just been waived
Better yet, now is the time to push for repeal of restrictions for all US overseas territories. Jones Act is an economic noose #puertorico
They got a 23% turnout 4 their election to become a state because the democratic socialist to Puerto Rico hate America Republican Democracy
Most people don't know that fact.
Neither of U don't know Puerto Rico can NOT vote for a POTUS because they are not a state.  

Go figure, two Trump fans don't have a clue.
I am not talking about voting for trump lol. I am talking about when PR voted to become a state in June.
Exactly
Really?  @POTUS has gone above and beyond the Jones Act and has done much more then I would for a colony that more then half hate America.
Have you read a newspaper or watchedTV.?Obviously not!

We cannot pick and choose the laws we want to follow. I don't like the current situation either, but my doctrine is called the rule of law
Just get rid of the Act please..do the humane thing.
Absolutely! The mayor of San Quan asked FEMA employees already there to work, not stand around and wait for orders.
Get it done! Wave the Jones act
Then introduce the legislation to do it, stop tweeting!
Thank you, Sen. Kaine.  It looks like PR has deeper needs, but this will help.
It doesn’t help long term, either. It’s an antiquated law that strangles the PR economy on a good day!
Why do we even have the Jones Act it has crippled Puerto Rico for years, get rid of it.
30,000 Feds to Tx 40,000 Feds to Fla. Puerto Rico? 7000.  The response on every front is disgraceful. Ppl will die. Other than racism, why?
There is INSANITY in the White House!
Your country needs you both to bring Respect, Peace, prosperity to great country and its people.
Hillary &Kane run again.
IF? It will. Go ahead! DO it! Don't wait and dither while people die.
Yes!! Do it now. These are our citizens, our fellow Americans, HELP them!!
WELL DO IT GOSH BUST UP IN THERE AND DEMAND IT GET YOUR COLLEAGUES THESE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF HEARNG OPINONS
Thank you Senator @timkaine !! 
Yeah, don't bother mentioning #USVI

US citizens! 2 hurricanes & waiting THREE weeks!

#USVirginIslands #StJohn #StThomas #StCroix
Leave it to Tim Kaine to Lie, Lie, Lie to people in vulnerable place. Shame on you. You're a dirty politician. Shame...
Wrong again Tim. Billions$$/H2o/Food/Med/infrastructure already there. Homeland Security said NO Drop Jones Act. Has Reasons!!!!
Please please we must help them. They are Americans.
Did you do or say anything to the murdered Americans family's whos children were Killed by illegals like in Woodbridge VA???
They r n need of food medical needs n water wake up usa it could b us
They need to impeach this man ppl r dying n living with dead relatives he is heartless n unfit
Pass the #AmericasOpenWatersAct introduced by @SenJohnMcCain
I just read an article with a short report on every municipality. They need a lot of help now.
Does the Jones Act apply to American territories?
The Jones Act of 1920, is a chock hold especially for Puerto Rico which has cost it millions of dollars. This is sick and trump can override
Agreed
It was done for Texas and Florida, so why not PR  & US Virgin Islands ?
You of all people know how fucking unreasonable @POTUS is not to mention he lacks a heart & soul - cold-hearted is #PutinsBitch #Impeach45
Yes!! Puerto Rico needs help! Shame on MIA TRUMP.  Do whatever In Your power to Waive Jones Act.  Lives over money 
It is shameful that POTUS seems to think that the people of Puerto Rico don't need help , the way Texas and Florinda did! An outrage!!!
Thank you Senator! @SenSanders @SenWarren @marcorubio @SenGillibrand @tedcruz
Can you join the effort?
also, I will NEVER forgive what YOU & HRC did 2 the USA by guaranteeing a president tRUMP! you should've stepped aside 4 bernie! you FOOL!
Why do anything different for PR than FL and TX? Seriously.
Trump told us already... because debt...
Why not repeal it?? Products shipped from US to PR cost 40% more! The law rips off Americans. Check it out!
I just want you 2 know I HATE you! that said, I agree with you about waiving the Jones Act. I'd agree with putin if HE said it!
Don't just waive it, get rid of it! #PuertoRicoRelief
So you could fill up the port with even more containers? Get on the ground before you tweet. They have supplies they don't have truckers.
Wonder how much HE contributed?
Why short term? Why not just repeal it? They can't afford the tariffs!!!
I wish they would, it's ancient. I'd settle for the waiver. Quicker.
#MariaTrumpsKatrina #BrownieYouAreDoingaHeckuvaJob #HistoryRepeats #Sad #POTUS #Fail #PuertoRico #CrimeAgainstHumanity @realDonaldTrump
Finally getting their head out of the ....sand...
Repeal Jones Act or at least waive it. It is a law and last time I checked Congress' job has to do with laws, including amendments.
Tim, in that statement you lack los cajones for Puerto Rico.  Weak statement!
He lacks the big boxes for PR? Why does PR need big boxes? Oh, I see... I guess you lack the spelling skills for PR.
Yes. NOW!

Send your criminal son down there to help. Put that little prick to work
do it, don't tweet
Would calling my dem Senators help? I assume they are on it, but maybe they need to know the people want this.
That is, can Congress even do anything about this?
Yes! Of course! Please!!! 
The President is busy helping Russia, the rich, Nazis"s, and idiots. Otherwise the deplorables. Not Porto Rico, or the middle class.
Please someone explain why the Trump admin is placing travel restrictions on prohibiting US lawmakers from travel to PR and USVI? So why???
My fax to you earlier today
Trump this is your Katrina. The relief is being run like your presidency. One GIGANTIC CLUSTERFU*K
Not waiving the Jones Act because it might infringe on someones profits when Americans are dying is a very pathetic excuse.
Agree. We did it for FL & TX. How can we treat one group of Americans so flagrantly different from another? Doesn't PR have equal rights?
The waiver was for fuel and always has been. PR has supplies. Over 3000 containers sitting in port full of supplies.
so true, we should help all of us, citizens and the government alike!
I'm sure @SecElaineChao family shipping Foremost Group will benefit tremendously. They are not US flagged, so they don't pay US taxes....
The very fact that you are still going on about the Jones Act is proof you have no idea of what the actual situation on the ground there is.
So do it. What do you need from us-your constituents (and I voted for you)? I’m frustrated at lack of help for PR, too.
Introduce a bill with McCain to take this out of Trump's hands
That would be fine but the ports are damaged and waiving the act still will not get ship in. Be real.  Gov. of Puerto  Rico praised Trump
And set up a sponsorship to bring vulnerable citizens to the mainland until its safe for them to return.
They need an aid package.
We should help Puerto Rico and waive the jones act short term
It proves the lack of competence
It must be done without a doubt
I am appalled that in a time of crisis, that we have to ask this be granted.
When was the Jones Act waived before, and who makes that decision?
During Harvey and Irma. President decides.
Oh no, Trump is afraid it might hurt the shipping industry. Unreal
Elaine Chao doesn't want to upset her daddy, the shipping magnate. 
USA should stop keeping Puerto  Rico as a colony. This is unacceptable  during the XXI Century! Wake up Puerto Rico!
So do it! Call on your senators to call for the potus to help!
Just a thought for PR leadership....a solid infrastructure,  building codes, emergency preparedness,  the simple ability to help yourself
Short-term? It cripples PR's economy and should be withdrawn indefinitely
So normally it is acceptable to cost them twice as much for basic necessities?  Thought your party was for the people?
He gave the money to FL before Irma even came ! Let's die like in Nixon times let's stop this mean evil administration !
Deployment!
ABSOLUTELY RIGH T IF MY AUNT WAS IN OFFICE INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT DUMBA$$ WE WOULD BE IN THERE HELPING
We need a military top strategist to stary supply of goods and medicine flowing asap on the island.
So just DO IT!! is there anyone in Congress who disagrees? Pass it NOW
Yes we must
Since PR Commissioner seems helpless pls coordinate w ur colleagues 2 put pressure on #Trump against the shipping lobby who's against waiver
They need our help, how can the government sleep at night knowing ppl are dying,hungry and suffering!#ImpeachTrump
Repeal it!
There are 3.5M Americans at risk! Please move quickly!!!
The son of Tim Kaine is a member of #Antifa
And I'm sure the Antifa members are ready to help out wherever they can!
Can #Congress take action? Let's do it tomorrow. #PuertoRicoNeedsHelpNow
This appalling and disgusting @realDonaldTrump
Our government wants Pueto Ricans dead, if you & other cowards in the Senate don't throw this admin out, 3.5M dead will be nothing
Why is FEMA asking ppl in PR to do everything online when they know theirs is no power much less internet service???
Thank you for this but please ACT quickly.  What are you doing???
Of course we should it's a no brainer...
Trump is bowing to the shipping industry so he's not waiving the Jones Act
Jones Act certainly does not help their debt situation, doubling prices of goods. #PuertoRico #PuertoRicoRelief
Last I heard we were human and humans help humans in distress.
We are supposed to be a Civilized Nation that is  with an uncivilized #DOTARD
We are no longer a civilized nation. Sad.
45 buddies have a problem with that. So people suffer.  
Really? Why hasn't the jones act waved already? Brown and poor people.
Please abolish the Jones Act. Its draconian. We now live in a global community.
That would take the praise away from trump to boast..he wants the praise alone from PR
It doesn't help, Senator. That's the problem. It's not a real solution to get them help.
At the very least keep a low profile! You're lying and helping people die! Have some shame. @BrianSchoeneman @timkaine
I'm being honest, and providing the best info I can.
With all due respect, you're a lawyer. I've worked with many and covered many more. Lawyers always lie. @BrianSchoeneman @timkaine
That's a cynical and ignorant thing to say.
Why congress doesn't get rid off the Jones Act is killing Puerto Rico.
Colonialism is so 1900!
Time to treat Puerto Rico with respect, 
rather than existence for our exploitation.
How could we?
Money over people.  Every damn time.
You probably need to save your money to keep bailing out your criminal Antifa kid.
So wish that you and Hillary were in charge. Puerto Rico would be so much better off if you were.
Definitely yes as well another islands! #PuertoRico
#invadepuertorico why cant our Military set up shop all over that island. no way we can conquer a counrty in a week but cant get this done?
I wonder how many Trump friends ship to PR - I just wonder....
Send in the military!
Then why is your ass on Twitter @timkaine?
He's a squirrel!
Then do something!
But Big Orange said his rich white friends don't want that. Seriously
And, frankly, if it doesn't hurt, in the short-term, we should do it, too!  Let's do it!  #WaiveTheJonesAct
