Statehood for Puerto Rico and Guam? That'd change everything.
When??? Do it!
Talk about how you are supporting antifa
Must vote Puerto Rico a state. Trump dismisses Puerto Ricans because they can't vote. So, not worth his time. Give #PuertoRico statehood!
You should probably just stay out of it, our president has it under control.
The footage is horrifying. What can we do to get the supplies to those who need it.
Hey Tim. Tell the narcissist that it's "not when the time is right 4 her" but when the time is right 4 the victims.
Kaine: Clinton will speak out on Harvey Weinstein "when the time is right for her" http://hill.cm/qMMxeZJ

SEND YOUR ANTIFA SON TO PR, MAYBE HE WILL LEARN SOME HUMANITY
Purely political move.  What have you, Pelosi, Clinton and Obama done for PR?
The best thing to do is to elect Republicans at all levels on the Island to ensure prosperity and conservative values.
Puerto Ricans do not even pay Federal taxes. They wanted nothing to do with the USA untill they bankrupted themselves. We give them Billions
They believe in the most fundamental American standard: "No taxation without representation." You may have heard about it in grade school.
