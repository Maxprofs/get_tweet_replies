Vote No!!  how do we get to Reps who have full vm's?  I know where you stand but how do I get my voice heard among GOPs?!
When no one has insurance, what happens to hospitals & dr's bottom lines? Close their doors?Do we start paying them with chickens and crops?
THIS IS NOTHING BUT A DEATH SENTENCE FOR MILLIONS CAN U IMAGINE TRYING TO PAY GOR HEALTHCARE AND YOUR MEDS? UNBELIEVABLE JERKS
I've called everyone on the lists and their voicemail boxes are full. How else can I help stop this travesty?
This will backfire in the @GOP miserable for years to come.  The trump train riders are in for a rude awakening if this passes
never mind lifetime caps on spending coming back.  talk about death panels...
It's been tripled to $138 billion.  Tell the truth.
YOU don't want people to know more control going back to the STATES is why Federal rollback IRS and FBI corrupted CBO as well? LOTS mistrust
We are counting on the Senate to vote no!!
Please fight for us.
We need a new election since this past one was stolen just like scotus
Another form of legal Robbery of the Sick and Poor by the Greedy!
Robin hood in Reverse!
#SHAMEFUL @HouseGOP @SenateGOP will pay the price for #AHCA it will b @GOP Failed Legacy & many will Lose Seats/End Careers #VoteNo
But they will still b alive.
However @HouseGOP committed #PoliticalSuicide aka #AHCA & proved they do NOT care how many @GOP Voters LOSE HealthCare
Probably worse than death for those w/ big egos who had dreamed of being POTUS #AHCA = #PoliticalSuicide
Thank you Tim!
@GOP Has absolutely no conscience. #SHAMEONGOP
Just what your party did in 2009 Senator.  You can't sling mud from your position.  Work on it!
@timkaine I am a numbers person. I think many of us are. Be sure the CBO report gets explained in a way we can understand ramifications.
They want to help there big deal buddies in the insurance companies and big Pharmacy! Get in on the Carpet Bagging!
Donald don't want us 2 no about his taxes & real health report w/his fake ass president.
Ultra-credible @timkaine should find another criminal to run with and stop trying to have an influence.
Fix ACA.
Dems rushed the first vote too. Remember we have to pass it to see what's in it.
Mr. KAINE PLEASE HELP LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST THE ACHA! MY OWN SENATORS MCCONNELL AND PAUL WANT US TO SUFFER! THEY R PARTY OVER THE NATION.
They are hoping Senate says 'no' to it. They appease their base but don't deal with consequences. I hope they are right about Senate.
Dem propaganda. Bill provides $8 Billon in High Risk Pool for pre-existing conditions that are not covered. Now covered!
Send your son to protest
@scott_catharine you must stop this bill please
Thank you. We do know. And we need bold leadership to wrest our country fm these cretins. Outside the DC swamp, Americans are crystal clear.
You are the VP of my heart. Thank you for speaking out against this terrible act of terror on the american people! #Trumpcare may kill me!
@WeinfeldRuth Well, duh. You don't send advance notice to a bank you are about to rob.
Pregnancy. Domestic violence. Asthma. What's the other one?
And the gutting of special needs education funding too!
@ezlusztig and that pregnancy is a pre- existing condition!!!
Truth.
Do they not know we have the internet and REAL news to tell us what's going on???? They all need to be voted out.  They are a disgrace.
lets pray this move creates a huge backlash in 18 and 20
What can we do?
As I recall @NancyPelosi said House could read Obamacare bill after they voted for it. That was a rushed vote
Two wrongs don't make a right.
Tim, my rep in va1 is voting yes, I've called him, went to his office, emailed him, the GOP house is going to pass this, it's up to you now
And that they want exempt from it.
Or that they and their staff are exempt.
they also do not want CBO assessment of losses.
So Senator @timkaine, it truly will be up to the Senate to make sure that this law is never passed. Far too many Americans will be hurt.
Are the Republicans going to use a budget reconciliation trick to get it passed in the Senate?
Will the Senate save us if this passes? #AHCA makes sexual assault survivor a pre-existing condition.
You have to pass it to see what's in it!
Maybe @SpeakerRyan should go back and watch his own speech
Certainly hope @SenateDems & @SenateGOP can and will take time to review the AHCA so many are not harmed. @HouseGOP will answer for this.
Or how many millions of $ this bill transfers to the wealthiest people in the US leaving the rest of us too broke to pay for health care.
We know! This Killer bill that will provide incentive for states that gut the pools giant tax break for richest 7 million a year!
Scare tactics are so yesterday be original
Facts are scare tactics? That actually makes sense from a Trump supporter.
It would seem that they're counting on Senate Dems to filibuster the bill. Ds can save thousands of lives at the cost of also saving the GOP
Oh, we know.  Believe me, we know.  #EvictionDay2018 coming to a congressional district near you!  Thank you Senator Kaine, for a strong NO!
#Trumpcare #Ryancare opens a backdoor 4 Americans who get healthcare through work 2 b hurt as well. #VoteNoACHA
Only the Senate can save us.
#dumbasstrumpcare lol @maddow @JoyAnnReid @CharlesMBlow @angela_rye @latinorebels @LatinaLista @donlemon @Bakari_Sellers @MariaTCardona
I find it very irresponsible to be rushing the vote with no input from the CBO
No kidding
We know Tim
