trumpcare gonna be the death of all those poor whites that wanted to make America great again

welp.
didnt take Trumpnut to long to show how he feels about u podunk rubes
Prove your massive tax cut statement.
Liar
It's #wealthcare!
.@timkaine America elected a parasite  #TheResistance #TrumpCare #RussiaGate https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/opinion/trump-and-the-parasitic-presidency.html?smid=fb-share&_r=0 …
this what happens when people carelessly throw their vote away... #everyvotecounts
Just further proof that he just said anything to get elected. His concerns are solely for the 1%. #IWishYouWereVP
Even scarier that there are hateful masses that support him. He is the swamp monster.
@holesinthefoam On smaller scale we have same in Holland. Populist rightwinger Rutte won elections. Bad for healthcare for poor.
Thought the Greens won big.??
No. The current PM’s party (VVD) has won big. Unbelievable and disappointing (for me).
@potus talked a good story and people bought it. He's rich, he doesn't care except for what helps his corporations and cabinet
yawn.
Drove >600 mi. to beg our rep (R) to heed CBO/Brookings.We need you & @SenateDems & @HouseDemocrats like @RepAlLawsonJr! #SaveACA
Are you that delusional that you completely ignored the people that were kicked off their insurance because of the ACA?
Dems must force the fix of ACA.
Fake @potus golfs at FL club weekends; kids make biz deals with Russia, China; GOP rapes ins. All Trump cares for is DJT.
Better messaging : Trump/Ryan is charging grandma and grandpa more to give wealthy people tax breaks.
I like angry old voters.
We are all in complete shock that such an honest man would lie to us 
for Trump and the GOP it's all about wealth care not health care
having insurance is one thing, having health care is another. ALL healthcare quality went DOWN under ACA.
@worrisomewrld why do you want use gov force to pay for other people's health insurance? SAD- Chairman Mao would approve!
Back to"Trickle Down"economics of the last 35 yrs-tsk tsk.Perhaps we should try"Trickle Up"economics to rebuild the middle class?
FAKE PRESIDENT
He didn't just say it Senator, he PROMISED to cover EVERYBODY.  He owns this.
so what does this mean for his promise not to touch Social Security and Medicare?
lie after lie from trump.
more fraud from a loser kaine
Does buying a govt mandated ACA card equal healthcare?  Come on Senator, step up and do something, you sir are part of the problem

81% of W Evangelicals, 61% of Mormons and 60% of W Catholics voted for Trump...there is a moral crisis in the church. /1
Have you even read the ACA?  You are not insured if you have $2000 deductible. You’re not going to be re-elected.
just like the LIE you can keep your Dr. You are all crooks. We need Trump to get rid of career political leeches. #marchmadness
More & more lies from Trump & the republicans. They don't care about people, but the people will show how they feel at election!!
I hope you realised that you completely ignored the people that were kicked off their insurance due to ACA.
Complaining Kaine, again.  You lost and now sit in the Senate complaining.  What legislation are you working on sir? Do something
I am still in shock how he was put in office.
This whole administration just makes me sick
@cynben711 I was at a loss when Hillary lost. You would have been a spectacular VP,  Sen. Kaine.
Your argument may be good in the future... I have a time machine, Lets go see! Until then............
Actually, he didn't lie because he said nobody will lose coverage and he sees the people losing coverage as a bunch of nobodies. #TrumpSucks
Vote Out #GOPDeathPanel in 2018.
wcg50 people who live in glass houses should now throw stones, wait for all the details LOSER
@Stay_up_Stay_S Senator that's the problem, to DJT I...AM...NO ONE!  I'm one of those losing coverage.
The wealthy could take the tax cut money to pay for the health insurance of some of us regular folks.Unlikely, but a gal can dream
I don't take broken promises lightly.
get it AMERICA...tax cut to WEALTHY!!!
it's vile. Thanks for keeping the pressure on @GOP - and looking out for all Virginians
Pres Donald Disappointment, 1600 Pennsylvania NW, Washington, DC 20500.  He needs to hear from #TrumpRussia #impeachmentparty
POTUS said muslims lined NJ skyline cheering 911. POTUS said Ted Cruzs dad shot JFK, said moon landing hoax. POTUS nuts
sad for so many.
that sums it up
the election is over. In other words get back to representing your constituents. You will not get anywhere tweeting
@DisavowTrump16 I prefer to call him the creep.
If Wealthy are required to pay for yours they should get a tax credit to do it; they are doing it instead of Gov.
LMAOROFL! @timkaine
@andybrwn Any saving made by #Trumpcare is Blood money its that simple. Made off the backs of the millions it won't be cover.
How does massive tax cut to the wealthy help healthcare???
@PrincessBravato WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?
@realDonaldTrump wasn't a liar?
no, it's to get rid of Obamacare which has hurt middle class people
not surprising.
Keep fighting Tim!!!
So sad that both Rep and Dem candidates have been known to change their tune once they win their election... same as it ever was.
just let Obamacare collapse under its own weight.  Let the Dems own this failed policy
@SKavchok yup, that was the plan!
And don't forget he also said it would be affordable.
I suppose it didn't occur to you that because of the expense of Obamacare, and now given the "free choice" they can drop it!
Thank you for standing up against Trumpcare.
Demonicrat president Obama said we could keep our plans & Doctors. Talk about lying to the people. All to profit Special Interests
You forgot to mention how much coverage was lost under Obamacare
Don't call the Am Healthcare Act #Trumpcare. Hold the whole GOP accountable, esp. @SpeakerRyan. Call it Republicare.
and your hero said if you like your dr and health plan you can keep it. again hypocritical Dems
@db5277 And the #GOP beat goes on. Rich get richer. Poor get screwed. It's the American Way! AMERICA...WAKE UP!
Notice a pattern?
He VOTED TRUMP because he was "told that Mexicans were robbing him and raping his women" Trump says"HOW U LIKE ME NOW" ?? RT
.@timkaine @physicsiteach
If you're going to bash a horrible plan at least don't lie. No tax cuts for wealthy. More taxes to give to ins cos
removes taxes imposed by aca on those over 250 k no matter if they work for ins co or not, so no.
.@timkaine @physicsiteach It's not a tax cut 4 wealthy. It's taking $110 billion of our tax $ & giving in to insurance cos.
U know better.
I do.....removes tax on those over 250k. Do you know better?
And he called Hillary crooked! He's not MY president!
are you talking about Obama? Cause he is no longer the Potus but he did say that!! Original sin! Second liar ain't gotta chance!
Better than Communist Dem Gov Controlled Med, Edu, Media, etc.
Freedom of Choice!
@caspian5690 SCP Trump lied then & he is lying now. How gullible are his supporters.
my family is going to lose our health care under the @GOP plan. #SaveACA
@SenSchumer @ChrisMurphyCT B Honest @SpeakerRyan 24M off Ins. frees up Docs & whitens up MD lobbies! TY!  @Lawrence @maddow
POTUS lies like a rug. Anyone who believes him, about anything, should do so at their own risk. He cannot tell the truth. #LyinDon
Truthfully, 1 good thing about plan - not FORCED to buy HC by government - where 24M # comes from honestly
sir, it's a @GOP based plan did you expect anything else (other than the truth from @POTUS )
that's what the GOP had in mind all along..Ryan keeps saying how excited he is..must be getting a bonus check from insurance lobby
Go home and spank your son.
@Mmkco19 Apparently, they are able to lie, and then just "walk it back," when caught in said lie, by saying we "misunderstood."
@shanleeha the wealthy need to pay more taxes. The poor never get a break. Even middle class get a raw deal
if you like your doctor keep your dr. We can't call it a tax people won't buy it. The American voter is stupid remember
what is happening is a disgrace.
POTUS lied! #Trumpcare cuts $1.5 trillion from Medicaid & ACA Subsidies. Plenty to cover tax cuts for wealthy.
Duh.
@TexArcana you folks on the Hill still think this is a presidency meanwhile Trump is literally dismantling out government WAKE UP
u are probably excited that you get that tax cut.
#TrumpCare is an oxymoron
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenSanders @RepAdamSchiff @RepWalterJones @RepSanfordSC, @RepSwalwell
Before Republicans start attacking the CBO's legitimacy, here they are praising its ObamaCare estimates: 
How come you are one of the few @DNC to speak up.  My local @dnc office doesn't answer and has a message about weekly Bingo.
@AKimCampbell I still think it should be called DonTCare in honour of Don Trump and his attitude.
EVERYDAY, I think when is this craziness going to end?! Can't he be stopped? I pray that good people are working to get him out!!!
Trump and his cronies are such liars. None of them care about Americans just corruption and filling their pockets.
to any insurance.even Medicare or Medicaid. So many Americans will loose in this battle that trump is fighting against his ego
nothing new,just another lie from trump! I benefited from Obamacare,and still do. If trump takes it away,I won't have access
we need universal health care NOW! @potus Anything less is immoral. #GetHonest
Here's an idea, Senator. Don't vote to approve Trump cabinet nominees. Don't vote with him at all, ever.  Thx
you're not supposed to take him "literally"
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenSchumer @SenSanders
#Trumpcare ends all the ACA  #BlackLungBenefits....but don't worry, Trump is bringing back #coal jobs....you can't make this shit up. 
provision of  ACA allows widows to continue receiving black lung benefits when their spouses died.
@SandraPitts14 Trumpcare blows
wake up!! The ACA was a disaster to any one who made just over the 4 times poverty.
Please fix it. F.I.X.I.T.
...Absolutely ~ that's why he ran for POTUS.  To take care of himself and his cronies.
Ur party passed a bill it hadn't read in '09, one costing far more than the Country can afford. Oh, & u lost in Nov so GOP's turn
please don't allow this to happen.
@nm_hart lies lies lies!  Absolutely not ok to bankrupt the middle class for your own agenda. MAGA!
if ppl don't realize by now that this man is the biggest liar in the history of American politics they r really stupid. Wake up.
He IS right No one who earn more than 70,000$
Please stop calling this fiasco #Trumpcare. That's what lucifer wants: things to be named after him. Why he hated Obamacare
who believed him??That's on them. Fool me once , Shame on you, fool me twice Shame on me. This guy means the USA no good.
please help us stop this madness!  I am afraid for my family not having healthcare and that I will lose my job due to this maniac!
@Oregonemom.Trump is a talker.he talks in Circles.Jump on the Merry.go Round.Trump has

how about the millions who can't afford ACA and are penalized? You're so selectively critical. It's like you're just a politician.
millions can't afford ACA? There are subsidies for low income on ACA. Where you getting this info from friend?
my point is that politicians sling mud at opponents and support allies regardless of the parallels of their stories.
No one believed him, its the long & agonizing con. #DonTheCon #ConManInChief #WhoknewHealthCareIsComplicated #MakeAmericaSickAgain
Trumpcare is what he wanted. Something else named for him. Terrible
don't forget to support the GOP donors: insurance companies and big pharma!
Imagine that?
lol
Terribly wrong!
Does that schook you start impeachment u probably new pres in 2020
please fight Tim!
Please call it Republican Care- they are promoting it and will swoop in to take over when Trump is long gone
Is anyone shocked?
Well let's use the Democrat's plan to fix ACA.

Oops.
I wish somebody could show the numbers on this instead of just saying the headline.  Americans are tired of headlines.
disgraceful
shouldn't be a surprise.   He's a liar
The system is was set years ago. Enough of the bullshit. Red Dawn!
No donations till you impeach the thieves who trumped America!
DontheCon .... those who voted for him deserve what he actually gives
Otherwise known as club members, cabinet and Republiackers
Have no idea why anyone thought otherwise. Con man running the con for the uber weathy.
Congressman Gallego called out Paul Ryan at #sxsw #Trumpcare
Paul Ryan literally makes me feel ill.
@realDonaldTrump @RealBenCarson How do think on DI&CC&NT?got a super-caucus & intelligence?FTF?
Thank you so much "ACA repeal" vice POTUS44Care (I will never say/write it) #TyRYANtBill is a #WealthyTaxCredit!
Also said it would be better and cheaper. He's 0 for 3. Let's hold him accountable.
what did we expect from him...Not surprised at all...Please STOP him and the GOP
Trump has been and still is a liar. Never believed him.
Elections have consequences...your campaign sucked.
.@timkaine .@MarkWarner how can any legislator possibly call themselves "pro life" while simultaneously condemning so many Americans to die?
whst happens to families who purchase stand alone policy not on exchange bec employer doesn't offer insurance
we need to #impeachtrump
@DearAuntCrabby Tim, stop this nonsense when the House sends their corrupt ACHC bill to your chamber. Please?
Truth is the enemy of people. Trust in Trump.Thanks to you neoliberal-neocon Dems this is the world we face.
GOP stays true to form. Is anyone surprised?
@DearAuntCrabby POTUS is a pathological liar
Can u help us Sir?I didnt vote 4 Trump.Plz help us sick,poor,disabled, dependant on free Medicaid health services to live not die
@DearAuntCrabby Sad thing is, to the super wealthy the  amount gained is minor compared to the wealth they already have. .
Democrats need to step up and give input. Appears parts are broken.
Keep fighting for America!!
Wait!Lemme go get a shovel!
He lies. #ImpeachTrump
We missed our best chance as a nation to help everybody. #ImStillWithHer
why doesnt everyone realize this???
I wonder if we required congress to use Trumpcare how long it would take to adopt single payer #SaveACA
All the leaders in congress r billionaires &can afford everything they want. Poor take what they can afford,not much
yeah, but a lot of rank and file would feel the impact :)
You are correct Senator.  Stop Gorsuch!
So tell me how Obamacare promises worked out? $2500 premium savings? If you like your doctor...? If you like your insurance...?
The ACA is a complete fail!  I trust @POTUS to MAGA!
Ryan said some people don't want healthcare - I'd like to meet those people who don't want healthcare! Everyone wants it!!
Yes lets just let Obamacare go down the tubes, ALL Dem's voted for it and supported it!
however it didn't intentionally exclude anyone. wake up Rico Trump lied to the folks that voted for him.
Why don't they just say it: they want all healthcare insurance/coverage to be privately funded, & if you can't afford it, too bad.
is your son still in jail for vandalism?
yes Knuckle Dragging Trump supporters how do you benefit from this plan????thanks DEPLORABLES 4 TRUMP now we have to save U&US
Continue to educate what is happening and cut through the GOP lies. No time to hide from this fight! Folks are going to lose big.
No surprise from our Chief Liar. People need to unite across parties, embrace differences, and work together making country work for all.
best thing I have heard Scott.
AND keep taxes from ACA on all but the richest.
TrumpCare=Chump Change Care
Keep educating a d exposing the details to the public please!
Speak out loudly for those who cannot
ok..as loud as I can! This is OUTRAGEOUS! Those unemployed who voted for Trump are getting what they voted for..
It seems the tax cut is the most important thing in #Trumpcare Not the actual insurance aspect #careaboutyourcitizens
Do you have a plan?  What can you give to the American people that is better. Stop talking, start finding solutions.
hold him and GOP accountable. Vote NO and get some repubs with u
24M will lose according to CBO, no wonder Ryan & co were trying to ram #Trumpcare through B4 CBO scored bill.
