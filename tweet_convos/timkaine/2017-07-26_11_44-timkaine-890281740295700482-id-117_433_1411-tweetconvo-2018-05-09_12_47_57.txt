You are trying to help. The @GOP has sold its soul to big money and keeping 'power' by throwing the voters under the bus.
Great question! And how much tax dollars have been wasted on both sides bickering over health care. Get some work done.
We've been fleeced the last 8 years!
Spoken like a true liberal snowflake.
Again spoken like a true libertard snowflake.  Tax me more so libertards like you can sit home with your hands out.
Obamacare has increased my health bills. Something needs to be done. Your not contributing anything.
Your premiums are high because Republicans cut off subsidies to private insurance companies – the very thing that keeps premiums low.
Because the worms want their tax cuts.
You are in a no win situation. Either way, YOU have decided that Virginians will lose their health insurance. YOU are doing that. YOU!
That's madness these are the facts
Fight for ACA today,but look to the future..single payer for all citizens. ACA failed too many. Fight for healthcare not for ins. coverage.
Did senator should feel airplane and enroll in Obamacare instead of his Cadillac plan that's provided for the government employees.
I suggest all Democrats that want free health care pay for it.
Because Hitler is is charge.
Obama care is dead in the water. Entitlement that Democrats put into Obama care is one reason it a failure. Buying votes is all it was
Your rates are high b/c Reps sabotaged the ACA through 100s of lawsuits which cut off subsidies to private insurance companies. Thank them.
He is Like NovaCaine!
Because that wouldn't erase Obama's legacy and give money to @GOP's rich donors.  They don't care about people, only politics and party.
Because of people like you. All you do is blow smoke. Don't act like you care because the American people know better. All you do is resist.
because we have a moron in the wh. AND Republicans who don't have balls enough to stand up to his orange ass !!
Ck his #s out 4 the no. of ppl who will lose OCARE. They change per tweet, as per #LiarsofAmericaRStrongerTogether & there's a batch of them
Q: Why aren't we helping people get better care?
A: Because *you* haven't passed MedicareForAll.
Just remove the three words "65 and older"!
A study published in the NEJM found the US will save $400 billion per year switching to single-payer. Tax breaks for all, not just the rich!

You forgot one part. If you are any of those things, we want you to get the hell out.
Party before country? You are just another traitor and should be treated as one!
make more noise @TheDemocrats  you can and this is why you guys were elected...you have our support so go do it!
Funny thing, yoy don't look like the type looking for a govt handout. Ooh wait, yes you do.
naaah we're looking for intelligence and people with plans
You aren't helping Virginians by keeping Obamacare as it is. REPEAL Obamacare now!!!!
Why aren't YOU on ACA?? #hypocrite
WHY Timmy? Wanna know why? because Democrats refuse to participate in the process, that's why! McConnell wouldn't B secret IF U participate!
You had your chance & is not working. Why are you upset with @gop for trying to fix it?
The RAM event across the state line from me last week showed the need for help.
you do realize many places have 1 choice and premiums are sky high now
Because you lost the election and the reputicans won!
Why aren't any of you senators using obama care ? If it's so good why don't you lead by example
Tim.  You have not been reading.  Do u realize what we are paying with ACA.  No because u exempted you and your cronies.  Wait for voting.
I'm sure the Jesuits will have a better healthcare plan....
I for one saw the vote and pulled myself out! I'm not paying anymore! All free Americans need to stop paying for extortion insurance!
You mean like ACA? Don't be a cuck Senator Kaine.
Healthcare is not free and I'm not interested in paying someone's share who is not contributing to society.
Actually, it doesn't affect the benefits my employer gives me in exchange for my hard work at ALL, so...f the leeches.
This is the age of Nationalism, baby. If you're not helping to #MAGA we're not helping you. Get off your assess and get back to work.
Kick those who refuse to work for a living off tax funded healthcare to allow those of us who work for a living to afford good healthcare.
How can you say that Sen? You said you were shut out and they were doing it in secret. So how can you say this? You are lying Sir!!!
I totally agree with you, but it is time for the Dems to reach out to their Repub colleagues and work together despite their leadership
O'Care has caused me to lose four meds I need. Money taken from vets to support O'Care is a horrible thing.
Tim, you know it and I know it. Republicans are dicks. Plain and simple.
Why?  Because the right seems hell bent on destroying the ideals of America.  Keep fighting Sen. Kaine.
No, we're just sick of the welfare class talking or hard earned wages. What has happened, America? If you want something, work for it.
Because the Republicans would just as soon see them dead
Yes Tim - why arent you? The Democrats screwed up healthcare for millions & now want to scare the hell out of everyone! Do the right thing
if you're so clairvoyant why could you not see the problems with Obamacare before it was rolled out now you're mr. Expert? #PUTZ
Exactly.  Why aren't YOU [democrats] helping people get better care?  Plenty of effort spent on complaining, zero effort on doing @SenateGOP
I don't see you or the Democratic party trying to help, all you guys are doing is hindering and you need to be voted out!
Pay even more?  I already pay $1,100 per month with a $13,000 deductible, I am middle class and can't afford to see a doctor. #health
16 million of 22 million, to be “kicked off” health insurance are people who didn’t want to pay for health insurance in the first place.
Repeal and Replace!  The ACA is destroying the middle class and has to go.  You are stealing my retirement Senator with these premiums
Now Tim Kaine will turn out and say people will loss their insurance, premium will be high? As u already know premium is high
Why were you and your friends quiet when 7 million, who actually pay, lost our plans? $2500 increase in premiums.... crickets
GOP are saying that because of ACA Americans are losing their insurance, premium are high and people will not be able to buy ACA
Ask crooked Clintons n O.
you can thank @TerryMcAuliffe for that. He said over the weekend that he wanted ppl to spend more money in Virginia. He must love this bill.
Senator Tim Kaine, is all because of ACA that insurance are collapse, premium are high and this is what GOP are telling the public
Stop lying senator Tim Kaine, you perfectly know that you are lying, premium is already high because of ACA
1/ @GOP @DNC @timkaine @markwarner #Resistance The Patience of the people is not infinite. We have called, protested, mailed cards, faxed
2/ and tweeted. The GOP knows the will of the people. Every day 45 & family sink to new depths of treason, lies, inappropriate behavior
3/ It won't be long before there is no more room for patience. I am in grief over the state of my country and all I see is our
4/ Government, our reps, impotently saying things like "this is troubling". The people are not impotent. The people are getting angrier.
5/ So I beseech you, in the name of justice, to lead us out of this moral quagmire - now!  No more cool slogans. Call them out! Please
Oy. We ALREADY lost insurance and are paying much more because of YOUR plan. This FIXES it. Get on board, man!
You beat me to it. I guess Timmy forgot all about that.
Because they voted against it.
Yes, why?  @GOP is running over the needs and will of their constituents. Why?  What have they to gain, besides a infamous place in history
Vote your #criminal party home or prison or institution they are all nut cases and we need ppl to work 4america not complain 4america
Why aren't you busting the door down between Dems and Republicans??? You Sentators need to get your crap together and FIX ACA!!
You need is your own Tommy Douglas. Google or ask @RealKiefer Sutherland. Ted Kennedy tried hard. Dems have been trying for generations now
Um, i don't know. Why aren't *we*?
Just another liberal lie Timmy. How's your queen Hillary?
Why aren't YOU making it better? Where's YOUR proposal #Fake #Catholic #Pro-Abortion .@timkaine?  All the Dems do is obstruct (and lose)!
How has ACA actually reduced the cost of healthcare?
that's what Obamacare has done, but since we pay for your gold tier healthcare you wouldn't know that.
Became the so call President, don't understand and it hadn't affected him directly. We have to fight for our people. Standing strong.

Remember: Mitch McConnell's end goal is "skinny" repeal. It's a fraud. House won't accept it. It's an on-ramp to #Trumpcare, nothing less.
...because GOP rules now and is protecting Tbone. Other than Mueller, nothing can be done...but submit.
We'll settle for that Cadillac plan Congress gets.
We need to make our voices heard and get both the U.N. and the Geneva courts including the hague involved and condemn the GOP. #KillTheBill
They are SELFISH @timkaine
The U.N. and the Geneva courts including the hague must punish the Republicans for abusing and violating human rights. #KillTheBill
Goldegg Utility Law says drop Hospital prices on partial - MRI & c-sections by 65% and prosecute 3week outages by Utilities withpartial-help
Why aren't folks outraged about employer mandate? Lose employer #HealthCare! #NoTrumpCare
Every promise you made for Obamacare turned out to be a lie. Every. Single. One. Why should we believe a word you have to say now?
We need to not comply with this outrageous Republican healthcare plan as it is an abusive violation to human rights. #KillTheBillDontKillUs
Because THEY ARE wanting that BIG TAX-CUT for FAT CAT rich! & they hate Obama & want to try 2 ERASE all the good he has done for!SHAMEFUL!
If our Citizens aren't allowed good healthcare then our govt employees need to lose their Cadillac Care!!!
because #GOP wants 2 get re elected. Who profits from denying healthcare 2 millions? @SenJohnMcCain treated w/health insurance we paid for
Because some unenlightened Americans voted a lunatic into office.
@realDonaldTrump 
@HillaryClinton would have accomplished much by now.
Yoy mean a majority of Americans.
The GOP want the poor,  disabled and elderly poor to die. They're actively & purposefully are trying to kill us
Because the rich need more tax cuts. That's all the Republicans care about.
& all democrats care about is keeping the poor down while they line their pockets with cash. Look at every Democrat run city period the end
Republican run states use more welfare and contribute less taxes than blue states. GFY.
Yeah, why aren't you helping people get better care? I bet you would if you had to sign up for ACA. Pfff
Trump and his filthy cabinet want the middle/lower classes to die while the top one percent grow richer and richer and richer
Good question.  What's the answer?
No the ACA @timkaine HAS already done that.
We r toast !!!
Don't worry--The Republican Jesus they serve...is going to send them all to hell in a hand-basket.
All this and you don't even know what's in the bill. Kaine said he was shut out and didn't see the bill yet says this garbage. WhT a liar
Want to know why Tim: because ACA is a disaster. do you really think that ACA raTes tripling is helping people get better NO IT ISNT .
Because the majority rep senate doesn't care- this should tell U how 2018& 2020 will go
Maybe Trump just wants to sell cemetery plots...
I don't know why you aren't. it's been 7 years of blocking and stall tactics... why aren't you working to improve the bill
EGO, GREED , BIG CORPS
, DEMORATS
