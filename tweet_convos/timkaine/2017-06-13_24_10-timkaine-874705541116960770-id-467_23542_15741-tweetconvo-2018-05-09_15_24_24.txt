In the meantime, tell your constituents that a bill written in secret must be so bad that it will hurt them--count the ways.
You mean like Obamacare ?
Prior to passing Obamacare
‚ñ†the Senate debated 25days
‚ñ†filed 506 amendments (228 from GOP)
‚ñ†took 34 roll call votes
And it failed
No it didn't I'll agree changes are needed but the GOP BILL is a real DEATH PANEL
Really how do you know. Msm
AHCA is opposed by every doctor, nurse, hospital and patient advocacy org.
No it isn't stop watching msm
serious question: how is it that the dem senators are so powerless in this situation?  Can't you do anything about your colleagues?
They lost. That's why   the house the senate and the presidency
The GOP can't do a full repeal of AHCA bc they need 60 votes. This will be a partial repeal thru reconciliation, nothing dems can do there
No they dont
They won't. They hold all the cards, & they don't care. #ElectionsHaveSevereConsequences
Holding the cards 
Why didn't @HillaryClinton show us her emails?
LOL, focus!  I know that's next in your line of retorts, but it is a weak one.  Bots say what?
How's this "we've got to pass it to find out what's in it" - Nancy Pelosi. #hypocrites
Obfuscation by taking out of context: another expected response.  Name calling too. Be part of the solution.STOP.#SeeSomethingSaySomething
Aw, come on now you is giving me the sads. Didn't you start the name calling by calling me a "Bot"?
No name calling. Did ask you to focus, but seems outside of your wheelhouse.  Dialogue someday when you can stay on topic! 
Did the Dems do that.No they had to pass it to see what was in it.
They work for us, hell yes! Think there is dome confusion on that point.
Senate GOP needs to be terminated, all of them. More secrets and lies to Americans. We demand justice. Remember next elections.
McConnell and company do indeed need to be replaced ... with REAL conservatives who will support President Trump!
Amen
Where is the Dem plan to fix the cluster f&$k #Obamacare ?
Obama care did a lot of good for a lot of people. The vets I work with actually have better health insurance w Obama care than ever.
Same for my family, for $12K/year LESS in premiums, better benefits & real consumer protection. We want to keep the #ACA.
Yeah, they have free healthcare (Medicaid), same as before.
What?
@timkaine  you're right to ask this, but what about when the DNC did this exact same thing with the ACA? Both sides need to be fumigated.
1) Congressional Democrats did not do the same thing

2) You don't know what the DNC is
Pelosi told Republicans. "You will have to wait til it passes to read obamacare". Hypocrites much?
Do you all get a newsletter with tweet points? 
You're not wrong on the literal definition, but again I'm not using as it's literal definition but an all encompassing one.
How could they not??
I have to agree with you on this one. Obama did the same thing.  It needs reviewed to make sure it is good for all Americans.
You mean as legislators "should've done" before passing the current affordable healthcare act?
Obama did public hearings. Where's any semblance of transparency here?
He did not

Molly's Mom's dog doesn't do research
She She's gone!
Do You Have A Pre-Existing Condition?
pre  existings were covered......
@timkaine @MarkWarner #Withhold consent. Shut down the govt until we see that Senate healthcare bill
my goodness.. does that mean  Nancy Pelosi shouldn't have urged all to sign Obama Health bill first.. then find out what's in it??
How bout no.  We dobt need you.  You had your chance.  Obamacare passed with ZERO Gop votes, fool.
this shouldnt even be a question, all legislation should be debated openly and considered carefully.. this is a sham.
Like obama care was?
there were over 100 Republican amendments in ACA obama care the only way that happened is that there were meetings was discussed and debated
What's her face said u must pass it to see what's in it back in the day about OIDIOTCARE, didn't care then so why the fuck  do u care now?!
You mean the way Nancy & her alt-left minions did with Obamacare?
If you think
If they don't,  they just prove they're not for the country, just for themselves: @GOP @SenateMajLdr @PressSec @SpeakerRyan @VP

They will share that bill, Dems will not read the bill & not stop being obstructionist-it's true Dems ignore the disaster of AHCA-sad denial
Chris Whiddon the GOP house released the AHCA a day before it got passed
Thks for the update
Like you READ the ACA before you passed that crap? #Hypocrite The GOP bill sucks too BUT #Obamacare HORRIBLE
I read the ACA through out. GOP bill on the other hand we are being denied to read. Against history and ethically wrong.
up yours and the aca
Nope, Timmy, you gotta pass the bill, before you can see what's in the bill. Just ask Nancy.
no democrats pushed Obama care thru before it could be read
You are believing a lie, sir.
It was extensively debated, scored twice by the CBO.
I've listened to it it's mostly lies
Please gather your fellow senators and make some news over healthcare. There was NOTHING about it on WP, NYT, LAT, or WSJ front pages today.
Fake news won't help
No, your party didn't.....hypocrite's.....the kind of people you are
it's hard to fathom that my senator can't remember just how o'care psssed a few short yrs ago. #obstructionist
this is why you lost and will keep losing.
drms said vote on it then read it
nope, you didnt show us, you dont get to see either. surprise surprise surprise!
just like the Dems did? Oh wait THEY DIDN'T
Pelosi, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to pass the bill so that you can find out what‚Äôs in it.‚Äù
you mean like y'all did with the previous  no-healthcare at all bill ?
Why? I don't remember Pelosi giving Senate that option on O care?! In fact I remember this "u 1/2 2 pass it 2 see wats in it!!"
Sorry. We have to pass the bill to see what's in it.
why didn't they do that with Obamacare??
We‚Äôll have to pass the bill so that you can find out what‚Äôs in it.
Just as you did for Obamacare?
Amazing the fate of people is in the hands of others who are not effected by their votes! Congress must pass NO law to which they are exempt
I thought Pelosi said you have to pass the bill to know what's in it ?
#Paybackisabitch
Once the bill is passed you can see it!  Sound familiar jackass?
You mean like "we have to pass to see whats in it?"   You fuckn frauds!  Dont worry loser. Mcconnell is on your side i assure you!
Like the plea of @NancyPelosi to pass ACA? That's just plain #hypocrisy. Congress should be ashamed of the disregard for the American people
RT if you thank God this liberal hack isn't vpotus.
I think you should denounce your call to fight in the streets and issue a public apology to @SteveScalise for your irresponsible rhetoric
Kinda like Obummercare...
We've got to pass it to see what's in it!
#HitTheGrassroots
Are you planning to #WithholdConsent on all non-Russ. Sen. business & utilize the #VoteARama to slow it down & drag it into the light?
and NO business as usual until they do! 
#stopTrumpcare
#ImpeachTrump
What did obama do Tim,  are there double standards here remember pelosi "we have to pass it to see it"
WTF, do I think? This is so fuckin* out of control. Does @GOP think that they can decide "OUR" healthcare options without "OUR" input?
I thought you had to vote for bills to see what was in them.  Isn't that what @NancyPelosi said about aca
"You can keep your doctor,  your premiums won't go up," obamacare implodes. You havent earned the right to even have input into the new bill
Democrats- no one on earth is more hypocrictial than they are. "We have to pass it to see whats in it"
Tim Kaine, worst kind of Democrat, a Lying, stupid hypocritical PROGRESSIVE PUPPET!
#ShowUsYourHand!!!

#LetThePeopleHaveSay

#ITS OUR COVERAGE
F**ck them. They got nothin'
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE A #PayCUT TIL THEY CAN #ActRightPUT #TaxPayer WHERE IT BELONGS #4ThePpl #Prosperity üõá
I've come to believe that the GOP WILL DO NOTHING that would benefit me or my family. What they should do and our needs don't mesh.
@realDonaldTrump has completely ignored the emoluments clause. #ImpeachTrumpNOW
GOP you work for we the people. Hold hearings now that we can analyze
Since congress seems to be unable to do anything about it, can't the courts get involved?This goes against everything our nation stands for
No kidding smh
Please hold hearings on the healthcare bill in full sunlight so all voters can understand what the GOP plan is that affects millions of ppl
when it is ready to be voted on I imagine you will get to see it. Didn't like Pelosi saying we have to pass it to see what it is? Me either.
We probably have to pass the bill to find out what's in it.
It is utterly ridiculous that something like health care legislation that affects every single American is being planned is Secret by GOP!
GOP is so ashamed of their ugly child of Satan they won't dare let the world see it.
Will you go to the mat to #ProtectOurCare? Will you withhold Consent on Reconciliation? Will you use vote-a-rama & filibuster by amendment?
@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr are the most arrogant and misleading leadership of my lifetime. Shameless lie after shameless lie. DISGUSTING
Yes we should be able to know what is affecting the people of the US
Thank you!
Citizens of US + congress Dems have right to know
Retweeting won't help much. Start demanding! Start raising the roof! Start a protest! A sit-in! Get in the headlines and provbide details.
#ShowUsTheBill
Absolutely *ucking yes! They are a bunch of cowards seeking to harm the less fortunate, while making $ doing it!! GOP works for lobbyists!!
Counting on you and Senator Warner to do all in your power to shut this down.
#WITHHOLDCONSENT til plan is public &hearings debate!
@SenateGOP If they want to get it right, they should!  I guess they left their nonpartisanship out on the baseball field! Shamefully sad...
#ShowUsTheBill  All Americans matter, not just Republicans. All Americans should see the proposed health legislation.
The #GOP #CONGRESS #RICO #ABUSEofPOWER has had consequences, stole seat on Supreme Court that belongs to Merrick Garland. #McCONNELL #HUBRIS
Show use the bill it's our lives
DITO PASS IT ON & RE-TWEET
Why?  Did you ever read the Obama bill before it passed?  Just get to work and stop belly-aching!
Stop demanding they show bill.  Start suggesting it includes Death Panels.
Can we see the bill for your incorrigible son?
We are still a Democracy. What happened to transparency? Public servant is a term that reads to be revisited. For the people, by the people.
You have to pass it to see what's in it!
will you commit to #WITHHOLDCONSENT #FilibusterByAmendment #VoteARama #noAHCA
#ProtectOurCare #IAmAPreexistingCondition
Maybe Pelosi should've showed the Obamacare bill as she said it had to be put into law to find out what was in the bill. Rep/Dems corrupt.
Both parties need to sit down together & fix what needs to be improved in the ACA.
It's ridiculous, nay dangerous, to play healthcare reform without lots of differing input.  Hearings, of course!! #ShowUsTheBill
How the Hell can they pass a bill on health care in the middle of the night and not show the public or Dems what's in it Tim? Null and void
If the #AHCA were actually doing something GOOD for the people of the US, @SenateGOP wouldn't be hiding it from us. #ShowUsTheBill #ATN #TW
Like when Nancy Pelosi said we had to pass Obamacare to know what was in it? Sure thing, Skippy #frauds #LiberalLiars
Please enlighten us what happened to debate after Sen. Scott Brown was elected? You guys rammed it through with reconciliation. #history
Secrecy and rushing this bill is UNACCEPTABLE @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP NO to #AHCA @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @realDonaldTrump
should? I cannot believe they can legally pass something without it being seen...there is something wrong with the system here...
Absolutely.  When are they going to include the citizens of the US?
You mean like obummer care? Let's pass it and see what's in it shall we?
Like the Dem's showed us the Obamacare bill?
Hypocrite.
Hmmm, proving insurance or taking it away! Trump supporters statistically have the most to lose, again my original point! Bye!
Healthcare in its current form is a problem! You should be working with the GOP to fix it instead of the hateful rhetoric we hear from you.
You didn't with OCare... Pelosi famously said 'pass it 1st, then we'll read it and see what's in it', remember Tim?...
Yes, show the bill.
I think they should do what the people want and that's either leave the ACA ALONE or fix what's broken..NOT TAKE IT AWAY FROM MILLIONS!!!!!!
Gotta pass it to see what's in it.
That would only be fair!
#releasethetaxes
@SchmidtVicki LETS SEE 9-TRILLION LOL LOL LOL FROM OBAMA BOY MOST EVER COMBINED OF ALL OUR PRESIDENTS & U CRY ABOUT THIS SAD SAD
@SchmidtVicki  AHHH!  LIKE OBAMA DID WOW REMEMBER THAT U HAVE TO PASS IT TO SEE IT DO AMERICANS A FAVOR & PLEASE STOP TWEETING!!!
@SchmidtVicki SORRY TIM BUT THE OBAMA BOY SAID U HAVE TO PASS IT TO SEE IT & U WANTED TO BE VP OMG !!! YOU WERE ONLY A TOOL & FOOL
We should send you Democrats the bill for 8 years of dealing with that stuttering cluster fuck named Obama!
Absolutely!!!nothing ever good comes from sneaking! Shame on them!!!!!
Wasn't it your friend Pelosi that said "you will have to wait til it passes to read it" to republicans about Obamacare?? Why yes it was
If no one know by now, the GOP party is as corrupt as trump has been for over 30 yrs. being se ret, changing rules is no exception.
GOP must allow open hearings on bill or Senate Democrats should stop all other business in Senate
Go away Clinton henchman!
Come fight in the streets
They're hiding this health bill the same way 45 is hiding his taxes. What are they afraid of?
When did we start measuring the success of a gvmt program by the number of people on it instead of the people not in it?
So you're saying you don't like bills passed the way democrats passed a bill?
SHUT THEM DOWN...THE GOP MUST HAVE PUBLIC HEARINGS ON "WE DON'T CARE BILL"
Why! You guys passed failing ACA Bill without even reading it yourself with only Dem votes! What a hypocrite!
Remember Peolsi telling everyone that if they wanted to see what was in the Obamacare bill, they had to pass it first?  You are a hypocrite!
MOST DEFINITELY, the American ppl deserve n demand that they #ShowUsTheBill.
Like the ACA which @NancyPelosi famously said "We Have To Pass It To See What's In It"?
without a doubt after all the bulshit they did with the #ACA. if it wasn't for the @GOP, we may already have universal healthcare by now!
Keep this trending#TheResistance
My question is "Why in the hell @HillaryClinton made you her running-mate"? Part of the reason why she lost and we all suffer politically!
I, a mere citizen, had access to and read the ACA bill THREE TIMES before it passed. GOP didn't. THIS one NOBODY has seen but Gang of 8.
You're damned right they should! We aren't asking GOP.   #TheResistance
Show us the bill NOW
Nah, let them keep it secret so it gets rotten in their chambers and the voters make them pay in 2018. We need a blue shallacking!
RT if you know Trumpcare is nocare#TW#showusthebill.
yes
@CoryBooker @SenatorMenendez  DO NOT give up the fight against the ACHA. NJ and the rest of America deserve better.
Of course! Absolutely!
#ShowUsTheBill and #TaxReturns
Definitely, the people of this country need to know what is being discussed!
They wont though. They have made a mockery out of our democracy and are desperate to pass anything. Sad for the people
Why did the Democrats not show their Healthcare plan until after it was passed. Remember Pelosi stating that it can be read after it passed?
#NoTrumpCareEver #VoteNoOnTrumpCare #23MillionAmericansDeserveToLive #NoTrumpCareEver
Insurance good for Americans is good for federal employees.  No more gold ins for House & Senate.  Currently & retired just like 3M
go away Kaine - you & hillary gave us this clown president

did Obama? showed on tv vote then find out whats in it..
@SuperJewGirl Who makes these rules? The public interest is not being served. Pitiful.
Completely agree. Shortsighted because it will cost GOP in 2018. Now that people have access to health care, they don't want to lose it.
The whole point is to hide the "mean" bill from the people it will screw over the hardest. Can't object to what we can't see, right? 
Hell yes 
Senator, this is your job
Oh magoo
I'll retweet if you filibuster
ummm did y'all say we have to pass the bill to see the bill ?
Hell yes, they should. They have NO SHAME. Classic sociopath behavior.
#ResistGOPCare and say STOP to the #Gangof13
#SHOWUSTHEBILL
It's the Golden Fleece
Of curse they should. I find it hard to believe the deplorables have the brains to keep going.
You would've made a great VP!! Thank you @timkaine
we are, after all, not an authoritarian government! we must fight for our constitution and democracy, transparency, & participation
Absolutely!
What about the bullshit Pelosi pushed for Obamacare? "We've got to pass it to see what's in it." It's ok for Dems but not GOP? Hypocrite!!!
Um Jay... by the time that bill passed everyone knew what was in it. shit was floating for months.  I was able to print it. All 2000 pages
Thanks for the info. I was unaware, I just remember her saying that.
It was a talking point for sure because truth be told? some dems DID NOT read the damn thing. It was pushed thru with no GOP support.
MR DURBIN MS DUCKWORTH WE DEMAND U GO TO COURT N FILE INJUNCTION SO THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT BILL THE SENATE HAS WRITTEN. ALL STATES EQUAL.
GOOD SIRS, I DEMAND YOU SHOW MY REP WHAT IS IN THE BILL. AT NO POINT DOES YOUR STATE REP HAVE THE RIGHT TO BLOCK MY SENATOR FROM ANY BILL.
This bill is Domestic Terrorism, no guns, but has put us in terror for our lives & loved ones' lives. Kills defenseless American for TaxCuts
Get real! EXPLAIN the HIGHEST price in the WORLD for #gop 2003 MED D DRUG $$$$ for ALL those #trump senior voters in FLORIDA #Trumpcare
i agree, what are they hiding from us i want to know if  i am gonna have insurance
Massive boob alert, stuttering bumble headed dope tweeting, prepare the rubber room, Tim "Kan't" is in the house...
Nothing you say has any meaning to me with your hateful rhetoric!
??????
You and Hillary.  Both of you are cancers
We have the right to know what we're paying for.
Absolutely! Not showing every senator and the American people what is in the healthcare bill is a disgrace and cowardly!
#ACA = #HealthcareCoverage #ACHA = #healthcareaccess What good is access if you can't afford coverage? #trumpcare = #deathpanels
Well for God's sake OF COURSE THEY SHOULD! It's OUR FREAKING HEALTH. Duh!
#ShowUsTheBill #ShowUsTheBill  #ShowUsTheBill  #ShowUsTheBill
Why not just pass it to see what's in it
I think you should tend to your out of control, radical child. We would like to #showyouthedoor. Made of fool of yourself during debates
FYI: staff @senpatroberts office says Dems are currently actively playing a role in this.  Nothing is being done in secret. Idiots.
Retweet if you think the Rs are wrong just as the Ds were when @NancyPelosi said it must be passed to know what's in it.
Oh like Pelosi did w OBAMACARE? DEMOCRATS have convent memory loss! BUNCH OF HYPOCRITES!
Kiss off just like obama did to GOP with ACA
