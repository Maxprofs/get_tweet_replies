Nope - Go Hoos!
.@timkaine
. @UVA @timkaine Pfft.
Mhm.
We're just gonna leave this here. 
@TheHokieBird @UVA @timkaine This is why I love the state of Virginia
A.A.Ron is on twitter!?
Bruhhhh I've been on twitter LOLOL
maybe you should spend your time fixing Healthcare not on college basketball
My thoughts exactly!
I wish but they have to kick it up a BIG notch! UVA defense great, Offense not so much...
Let's go...  Hokies!!!
this bracket is TURRIBLE....just TURRIBLE. #MarchMadness
Same here...and I go to uva
you done messed up A A Ron
how could you overlook Wisconsin again?
You chose poorly.
You're fucked
- all due respect,just throw your money away Senator Kaine 
but this isn't football senator...did Steve Bannon put you up to this #moneytalks

That's about as likely as Donald Trump winning the presiden....

Must be an election year.
too much like Obama let's get some work done
Wow #UVA losing to #Vt Senator I may need to reconsider my support in '18 #okaynotreally
I picked gongzonga.
good pics Senator!!!! #GoHokies !!!
Picking Gonzaga over VCU thaaaaats fake
mi pick de #marchmadness es #UNC over #villanova
unfollow
.. your writing is atrocious... Sister Angelia would have told you to rewrite legibly
All the way??? I thought you were predicting the 8-9 upset in Rd 1 over Wisc. I couldn't even bring myself to do that. #wahoowa
I love it.
seems a tad unlikely. But still. I love it.
guess I won't be voting for you next year anymore
@LaurenStroupe42 @nitipaudyal sorry, we can't like him anymore, friends...
where's the love for @VCU_Hoops ?
just remember VT fans vote Republican
well it's a good thing you don't know how to be on the winning side 
Not my senator! ;-) Go Hoos!!
if Virginia tech wins the tourney I'll walk to Virginia barefoot
My husband says I'm crazy, but mine has VT beating NC in the final#GoHokies
you are being bold!
sorry. VT is one and done 
WTH taking back my vote.
.@timkaine this is why you're not vice president #gohoos
you'll get there tim #gobblegobble
ok to have questionable judgment 4 FANTASY basketball brackets; but stick to facts in politics! @UVA for the win! #wahoowa #UVA
this is your first questionable choice. WahooWa
Wow @timkaine I'm hurt
I'll allow it.
ha with you in spirit Senator, but the blue devil half of this VT/Duke household is a better bet. Son off to his Dads VT this fall
Go UVA - WaHooWa!!!
vote no on Gorsuch
when is your next townhall to discuss your bracket?
once again, you are governed by your heart and not your head.
Hokie Nation!!!!
That's fine, just don't use that strategy in the Senate, OK? 
- That is a long shot for sure!
This would be amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ily
That prediction is one big #maddowfart
No wonder why you lost the election.
Well, at least those Kansas roots of yours are showing a little  #RockChalk
Another reason to dislike you.
hmmm
treating Wisconsin lightly again; didn't learn the first time?
Donald Trump has a better chance of winning the national spelling bee than this bracket has of winning.
VT & KU, your bias is showing lol
I hope you were not at work doing that
What? Giving up on KU, again?
Timmy, as a constituent please return to work.
Hope you're right, because I did, too!
tech over the cavaliers???
and I thought VT was UVM... go Vermont!! #UVM #catamounts
Rock Chalk!!!
I will still vote for you but I am forever a Wahoo.
First productive thing you've done this year!
Boo.
love Sen Kaine, but your wrong about my @KentuckyMBB Wildcats.  A whole lot of Big Blue Nation lives is western Virginia...
yikes
VT over UVA? That hurts.
I'm a Hokie fan but questionable judgement there, Senator,
no VCU? Damn 
bahahahahaha #seriously 
Cannot believe you didn't pick @MT_MBB. Sad!
VCU! VCU! VCU!
Every year I go with the Yale Drama School Fighting Thespians and every year my heart is broken.
@JacobEmert
lol that's grounds for impeachment
you're notorious for picking losers
