BREAKING!  Roy Moore & Doug Jones tied in #AL-SEN @FoxNews #Poll MORE: http://fxn.ws/2yQglRI  
Not to not pick... but maybe you should be tweeting and fundraising for our state's Governor candidate?
Voting is Dec 12. If all liberals don't support, trump/NRA handed another Senate seat, and we all loose - especially women & children.
I get that and will certainly help support Jones. But our Gov vote is less than 3 weeks away. Id like my senator to put some focus on that
Roy Moore 42% now that is creepy
Could you talk to @BenSasse & other sane R senators about endorsing #DougJonesforSenate? They don't need Roy as a coworker.
@sweetnonnie Get out the vote!
Why you should support Doug Jones in Dec. 12 election: http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/us/politics/doug-jones-democrats-alabama-senate-roy-moore.html … …
How you ensure Jones has shot:

Thanks Sen. Kaine for supporting Doug Jones!
Nope!
VOTE BLUE Alabama as if your life depends on it WHY Because it does
Yes! Urge Dems to pour $$$ into an unwinnable race in AL. Great advice Tim.

I donated!
Is he 100% on prolife views or just 60% like you?
In Mobile Alabama and I can’t wait to vote for @GDouglasJones 12/12/17! 
Now that it’s getting close, the Koch Brothers will send money to Alabama. Let’s hope the voters show up AND vote Doug Jones.
MOORE has no shame.He thinks his beliefs r dominant in Alabama. I don't think so.A racist segregationist has no place anywhere in America.
Vote Doug Johnson!!! Make America lawful again!!!
Lets get out the vote 2 get rid of this person!
So make an effort get out there and help him win. You're my boy Tim but seriously let's win this one.
Please donate NOW! TV ads for rural women needed for #DougJonesforSenate or WE ALL get another NRA/trump wacko in Senate! DONATE!
You could try to target rural women with a tweeting bank. http://dougjones4senate.blogspot.com/2017/10/index-of-tweeting-banks.html … #DougJonesforSenate #alsen #alpolitics #MooreSenate
We DEMS have to fight harder than ever to regain control. We have to take our country forwards not backwards as the REPS are doing!!#VOTE!!
Please donate all the money you can. Borrow against your retirement, every dime counts. (Of course Roy will still win by a huge margin)
Thanks for the endorsement Sen. Kaine. Doug Jones will make a great colleague. #DougJonesforSenate #ALSEN
Why would anyone follow  your direction Tim Kaine?
@MuellerTimes @foxnewspoll @FoxNews I just can't fathom any fairly educated American wanting a Roy Moore repping their state.
You need to worry about your seat.
Be certain that poor people that owe fines can vote. Alabama is suppressing votes because of fines that are owed to the state.?
No more Moore
Let’s turn that 11% to votes for Doug
Don’t forget to bring your Harmonica this time when you come back through Alabama to support @GDouglasJones for #ALSEN  #VoteNorthram
Or at least wear this t-shirt
I did from DC!
Donated from VA (my current home state) for the future of AL (my original home state).
Great candidate??  So he opposes tax cuts, more jobs, fewer regulations like you do, Kaine?  NO THANKS.
The Virginia Governor race is CLOSER!!
We have our own battles to fight!
Roy's a better candidate!
Well. Better watch your home state. If Gillespie wins, you know that Virginia is firmly in the grip of racists.
I donated, have yard sign & will vote Doug Jones! Best for Bama!
Can one make calls from out of state?
There's a reason why Roy Moore was almost fragged - he truly is a monster....
Doug Jones can win this with focused all in response from Democratic National & local committees. 
Best of luck to a wonderful man. The people of Alabama deserve a Senator that stands up for the rights of everyone.
Make Al proud again !
Thanks! Here in AL we are excited about #DougJonesforSenate and his chances. It's time for AL to move forward!
@foxnewspoll @FoxNews I would vote for the candidate that is not supported by @HillaryClinton ‘s running mate.
How can #Alabama voters be so ignorant as to even consider Moore, who was REMOVED from the AL Supreme Court bench TWICE? He’s a nut job
It's not even close
Why to have another obstructionist. No thank You! Time to get things done! BTW, what was the last thing you did for VA or USA but ask for $$
Go JOBES! Beat that Brokeback Mountain dresser wannabe
JONES
Take action Alabama!! Pls don't sit on the sidelines and let the @GOP and bigots like @MooreSenate take another Senate seat. #resist
I'm more worried about the Va. Gov race.  I heard today Gillespie is now in the lead.
Come on Alabama. Don't you want be better than a failed GOP run #takerstate ? Ever?
If ND can elect a woman democrat, it's possible anywhere
Thank you for your support!  We really #digDoug!  #DougJonesForSenate
How is it close, what is wrong with people what no one needs healthcare, or to keep money in your pocket, let me guess give to Trump 
Let Republicans take all the money out of public schools and give to private schools.  Come on people, we got this
Yes, the crappy ex governor of Virginia who had 10 people show up during his v.p. rallies wants your money, go ahead and give it all to them
#DougJonesForSenate is the candidate that can bring Alabamians together! He’s focused on #KitchenTableIssues #ALSEN
Donated!!
Y’all better stand up! Get out and vote  You know what they pray for in Black Communities on Election Day rain & bbq  & they’ll stay home
Tim, serious question: are you always drunk? Or do you just look drunk all the time?
But Moore has the Russians.
Yes! Please help us here in Alabama. We are not all crazy! Many of us are working hard to get Doug elected to the senate, but we need help.
I’ve donated from SC. Would love to see him win.
Doug is sane and Roy is nuts come on Alabama vote your mind not your hate !
Bye bye
Roy the moron Moore is praying for a miraculous event to create a plague of Frogs on Election Day.
No more talking about how a Dem can't win in Alabama. Donate now please.
So this means Russia will be throwing more rubles and resources at Roy Moore... good luck Alabama. Hope Doug Jones wins.
Do we know if ALL votes will be counted.  Will people be allowed to vote?
Thank you Senator Kaine! In Alabama we are fed up with crooked republican politicians! We are going to take back AL! #DougJones4Senate

IFYOU’RENOTENGAGEDINTHE2017ELECTIONSYOU’RENOT#RESISTINGPROPERLY

…
Obama’s whole administration is under investigation. Yes you should listen to him... 
Senator Kaine, why are you watching Fox News?
Republicans and conservatives should never be allowed to govern.
These people are lying. They will vote for Moore.
or dress like a clown in honor of Tim Kaine, or antifa moron in honor of is son.
they are trying to freak their base out to go vote. Some dems stayed home/threw a vote 3rd party in nov because they thought HRC was a lock
You lost go away.....
Senator Kaine, please pass along this info to the Dems...run ads showing how many laws Roy Moore has broken.
Your #1 priority is supposed to be VIRGINIA. Not Alabama. Please consider immediate resignation from the Senate. You lost in 2016 Timothy!
Hang in there @CoreyStewartVA will retire him in 2018.
Corey stewart the primary loser?
Ha!!!!
Unsure?
Right?
Wait for the russian trolls.
