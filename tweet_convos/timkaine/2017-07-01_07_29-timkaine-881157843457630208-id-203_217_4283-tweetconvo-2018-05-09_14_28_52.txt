Congrats to you and your family, Tim. You're our REAL Vice President.
keep these families stories to yourself! No pictures please!!!
Here's a thought: Don't follow.
I like to know what the enemies are up to. This weekend is wedding, next day they go back to beat up people, burn...
I feel sorry for you. Truly.
feel sorry for yourself! You are the one in the resistance! We are winning!  You are whining! Fools resist #MAGA.
I don't see anyone as the enemy. I don't whine. I am not hateful to people I don't know. Especially when they post positive messages. Sad.
just because the enemy posts a positive message it doesn't make them good people. Tim Kaine is vile & hateful person
Spare us the pictures please
Congrats!!
I wish them a wonderful future
Congratulations!
May God bless you and your family, may their lives be blessed by the removal of this joke of a President and a new world come to America
