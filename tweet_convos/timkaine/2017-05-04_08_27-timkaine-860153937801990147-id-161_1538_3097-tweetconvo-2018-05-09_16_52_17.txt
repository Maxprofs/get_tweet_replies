If 60 percent of the people approve of Obama care why is it being repealed
Do you think there's a chance to defeat Goodlatte after this vote? I didn't call bc he's a shoe-in no matter what he does.
59% <— The % of votes Trump received in the 6th running on Obamacare repeal

67% <— The % of votes Bob received running on O-care repeal
No they didn't cause no one wants to pay for 24 million illegals getting healthcare. Please go away. You lost - fade out #pizza lover
My son nor mother are illegals!!!
Every year medicare participants "lose" their coverage and get something new - it's called a #newplan :New insurance  Plan
No she doesn't, before ACA my mom lost her house because she couldn't pay out of pocket. She had to choose between meds and food.
Sorry I deal with patients struggling before and after Obamacare ... it means she was never pointed to resources ... besides NO MORE ACA
My husband is RN extended Care. He sees that his patients will pay. My mom was ineligible. We did try. Still has to pass Senate. We'll see.
I called for you to vote no on Obamacare and it didn't work.
I did call - but the mailbox was full for Congressman Fortenberry and one of his aides.
Well...you are my house member and thank you for #VoteNoAHCA
Kaine is in the Senate. There's still a chance to block the bill.
Such hateful tweets from supposed "enlightened" liberal people.   majority of Americans wanted this.  This is a democracy!
Vote No on AHCA and leave Americans with a broken DEAD ObamaCare & ZERO Med care.
Is that a Smart Dem? NO!
Its a Dumb Ass Kaine!
They are doing this to provide a "win" to trump; this will be the worst win in history. I hope the @UN follows up on what they said in FEB.
and to do this on National Day of Prayer? & remove seperation of Church and State? These people are beyond help.
Sent e-mails. Also asked governor to let me know if he intends forTexas to opt out . Need to know before I retire
I called @DaveBratVA7th yesterday and asked him to vote no.  We will repeal and replace him 11/18.
I hope you and the Dems in the Senate are up to the fight ahead. I must admit I don't have much faith in you.
And we do not have much faith in you because there will be more info about bill and how bad it was!
Oh! You don't have money to pay for doctors and medicines? 
You voted for Trump! Your Choice = Your Health. Die if you are poor!
My @RepKevinBrady voted yay today, so I called+tweeted to put him on notice. People with autism vote too. (Lol, *religiously*!) #autismvotes
Didn't work Tim! I faxed Wittman 4 tines
Like we did for u and corrupt Hilary? That was fun.
Didn't work 
I have been but got the answer machine, Congressmen Brat  couldn't even answer the phone this is bull shit please help
Unfortunately @RobWittman doesn't care about his constituents. Thank You for representing Virginians.
Rep. Wittman voted Yes. I will now work to make aure this term is his last. He clearly does not care about his constituents.
Cannot believe they took this extremely unpopular step which only makes our Healthcare system worse.  What a bunch of fools. Vote them out!
Didn't work. It's up to you guys now.
I have tried the aren't taking calls
What are you doing @timkaine ? Anything? #verdad #ACA
Thank you Cain
#MedicareForAll or we'll watch @TheDemocrats burn to the ground in the hopes that something good might rise from the ashes! #NoMoreClintons
No more uninformed republican votes to give POTUS a win!!!
You bet the voices were heard, that's why you're still just a Senator. 
I support replacing you in the US senate!
Tim what happened? What did the Republicans. see on the GOP medical package this week, compared to last week? It may not survive anyway!
I make too much for Medicaid but not enough to pay as much as 2/3 my mortgage that's why I went to marketplace,
Keep calling!!!
They didn't listen. Guess they want to be voted out. Out they GO!
@RepMcEachin needs to vote against AHCA!
Representative David Rousers phones are "busy". Mailbox full.... He's hiding from his constituents.
Insurance companies drive up the cost of healthcare by half trillion per year. The only way to remove insurance companies is #MedicareForAll
Just 1 prob: @DaveBratVA7th  said not changing his mind. VA07 will see a change in 2018.  @BedellforVa  in 2018.
my voice is falling on deaf ears sadly. Thank you for caring about us.
My house member "Mailbox is full and is not accepting new messages"
This guy's a FRESHMAN Republican!!
Call #TrumpCare what it really is #TrumpDontCare  Let's be clear...Alt-right GOP's genocide on minorities, the sick, aged, underprivileged.
Frelinghuysen knows the Ecumenical Council is outside his Morristown Office Praying for him to VOTE NO, remind please. Thanks.
Or pass it so the hillbillies that voted for a billionaire can have a wake up call. End of story; be rich or have a great job. #Ryanisaknob
Called my @RepJoeBarton.
He votes for Oil Companies, Big Pharma, Tax Breaks 4 Wealthy. So that he gives them another tax break in tax bill.
my voice falls on deaf ears here in Arizona! They refuse to listen to their  constituents. #VoteNoAHCA #NoTrumpCare
My representative is lyin' Ryan. He takes the phone off the hook, because he has no intention of working for the people in his dist. #20%
Called, sent an email, and sent a tweet to @RobWittman I hope he votes for improving the ACA, and against the AHCA which is a catastrophe
I wish my Rep would listen, instead he is the ring leader of the GOP three ring circus! I cannot believe just to repeal ACA, they pass this!
Calling. To many "mailbox full" messages!!
I did and I guarantee a no vote at his next election if he votes yes #timriceisatraitor
Called @RobWittman this morning. Couldn't leave a message. Voice mailbox full. Town hall might be nice.  
This bill must be stopped!!
Occurrences in the third world countries where predecessors  build and successors take apart.
It's a shame that the Trump administration is bent on undoing everything done by His predecessor. It only reminds me
Buy I am for it. Whom do I call?
Most of their mailboxes are full and not taking calls.
My reps already are against this!! 
Scott Taylor is a lost cause and trump yes man...
You are right, our voices were huge last November in electing Donald J. Trump President and not your crooked running mate and you.
Vote yes comrade
No Timmy. This bill is imperfect but far better than the ACA. Americans see your hypocrisy. This is just step one. At least they are trying.
They will change the rules to need 51 votes like they did SCOTUS @TheDemocrats made HRC's loss 2016 the issue this week NOT #TrumpCare mess
Mine won't budge. I live in Utah. 'Nuf said 
Is there time?  Been calling!
Except their VM are full and they are not taking messages. We have tweeted but not sure we are being heard. Your ins should not be exempted.
The problem this time is that we don't really know what it is in it, and they didn't give us time to find out. But we're angry.
I have never seen a time that healthcare legislation hasn't had text available, open debate, but most importantly A CBO SCORE before vote
It's insane. It will cost more than what they want to repeal. But white people are repealing a black man's law. That's all they care about.
U r dead on w that. They r committing political suicide. The Dems pushed through an unpopular bill. And paid dearly for it in congress
I can't wait for #GOP suicide. The sooner the better.
Yep. Me too. The amazing movement of deep red to blue or to purple at least is so good to see
Trying...busy every time....
I called @RepKevinYoder @RepKevinYoder
I can't wait for @IngrahamAngle to take your seat. Get ready!
Dammit!! You should be VP. America lost.
Done. But we have @jaredpolis so I asked he stick up for waiting until CBO Scores the bill. Irresponsible @realDonaldTrump And republicans.
Congressmen, if you want to keep your jobs, then vote no on AHCA. In my county, even the conservative Republicans are .
Tim, up to the Senate to get this bill to die a painful death and then reach out to have both parties to FIX the ACA.
My congressman says no
@USASafetyNews Done. Now making friends & family do same
I am tweeting but the GOP does not take calls

Should The Republican Congress Push Passage Of A Health Care Plan Without A CBO Score Of This Said Plan?
Tim, the GOP don't give a damn!  God could tell them to vote no and they would still vote yes and take millions off health care!
We need a real solution not just a one sided view. Right now some Americans are bearing an extra burden while others reap the benefits.
I'll pray that our elected officials start REPRESENTING the people not their wicked parties
Will do. Thanks Senator!
@Rep_Tom_Garrett Called to urge our Rep Garrett to vote NO and listen to his constituents. #VoteNoAHCA #votenoonahca
Text RESIST to 50409 to have them auto fax a message to your reps to vote NO!
Yeah right
Better yet, repeal ObamaANTIcare for now.  That piece of crud needs to go.
Sounds like yall need another time out in a safe place.
We did, they don't care!
I did, was very respectful, and staff was incredibly rude to me in return.
Cannot get through! They are playing games with calls. They will pay in 2018!
Congressman @RepMGriffith won't answer my letters anymore and phone lines are busy.
@SenateDems Did it today. And yesterday. And the day before that, and so on and so on and so on. Even tho my Rep is an idiot.
#IL06 @PeterRoskam has openly said he doesn't care what we think. Says he was elected on his conservative views. #FlipThe6th
#AHCA How GOP reps end their political career in one vote! Bribes must have been sizable!
Didn't do any good
They won't pick up the phones this time. They're cowards. They should be cowering b/c we will see to it that they all get voted out in 2018.
We're trying, Senator! "mailbox is full" @RepTomReed. #TrumpNoCare is unconscionable.
I want a "No" because the ACA is failing and the Dems should be held accountable for it
Fortunate to have Representative and Senators who already #Resist and vote our best interests. Sent you letter anyway, tho.
Called @RobWittman to say DO NOT VOTE for this bill.
Done, but Frank Lucas is unmovable.
Thank you, @timkaine! I did, tho I already knew how he would vote. Thank you @RepDavidEPrice for voting for the good of your constituents!
Had you bought-offs supported #MedicareForAll when you controlled Congress, we wouldn't be having these problems. But no. You didn't.
Working hard
Called!!
Wish we could, Tim. Busy or full voicemail boxes, every one of them. Cowards!
My brother Freddy passed from Cancer, in 2009, at just 36 years old. He was denied coverage and therefore proper treatment. Too many have
Done! #SavetheACA
Called them first thing this morning.
No one to answer the phones!
Sadly our Oklahoma Senators @JimInhofe & @SenatorLankford are soulless autocrats, lining their pockets off ignorant voters
Thank you Senator! Called @RepTenney  in DC & Binghamton, NY. Got voicemail & a full box @ these numbers. Will try other offices.
I did but when you're jerrymandered your voice means nothing
I have tried to call, voicemail boxes are full.  Help get our messages to congress, vote no on Trumpcare.
called @RepGoodlatte this morning... all the good it will do.  
Is it better/more effective to call district office or D.C. office?
@StewartforUtah is hiding! Won't answer, won't clear messages. I've called, faxed, tweeted. If you see him pls tell him I'm looking for him!
His Twitter bio proudly extols service to god. 
What fools these Republicans voters are.
DONE!
been working hard!!  Seems deception is at work.  This is so tragic.Ocare can b fixed.Repeal is a waste and preexisting will hurt
Their mail boxes are full. We are trying!
Hahahahahaha
Why they are chickens and not answering their phones.  Vote them out with recall elections
but they won't listen as they are TrumpRyan-washed
Called Rep Rothfus' office this morning
My House representative is voting no. I hope that you all are trying to whip some Republican 'no' votes to fight this abomination.
Mine is GOP and he will vote yes.  I will be a avid campaigner to oust him in 2018!
