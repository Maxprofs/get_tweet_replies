&thank you so much for being a sore loser & dividing the country even more. How's it working for ya,US against THEM great message
I would like you to ask for an independent investigation into the President and the last election.
@Marina_Sirtis What’s even more important is that you, as a senator, stop voting for any of his nominees or policies.
When visited Woodstock VA homestead where my grandmother lived they told me "Manassas" came from Indian word "Mass-of-nothing".
Called office.  Asked how the info from our calls was tracked. Not as reassured as i had hoped.
So are those signs directed at you? You propogate hate and fear.
Trump must go
Good job to you senator!!  Wish you were our VP. We need cooler heads. We are so frightened by what's going on.
You and your leftist anarchist libtard friends are creating the fear. NOT Republicans & and @POTUS.
@Marina_Sirtis those hats on the right invalidate any point they have.
Thank you for all you do!  So proud and grateful to have you as one of my Senators. 
@LisaHauser8 stop all the bullshit.
 Word on the street is,Bill Clinton had his way with you!
LOVE MY SENATOR TIM KAINE...the rest of you should be jealous....
I would be, if I didn't have @amyklobuchar and @SenFranken to represent me!
I have family in Minn and love my annual visit. These two are icing on the cake. Proud
Thanks, Tim.  Good message!
please ignore these haters on here. Thank you for being amazing! Wish I had a senator who cares as much as you.
thank you so much Senator; we need real men like yourself (& of course women!!) who will listen & take a stand. THANK YOU SIR!!
You sir advocate hate.  You also perpetuate lies and misinformation. "Fight them in the streets" is exactly what radical left does
"Mommy what's a p*ssy?" Tim Kaine is dear, Tim Kaine #MAGA

@twright55 @timkaine. What is the going rate now, Tanya? #ElectionIsOverKemlinTrollsStillVeryMuchHere
@twright55 Tatiana Wright who is spreading #fakenews here about HRC and Panama Papers and Podesta and Russia is a #kremlintroll.
Sad that a mom would put these hats on her children, take pictures and post, knowing the meaning the hats sent! Sad, indeed!
Anti Trump? Anti American you should be ashamed of yourself.
Oppose Scott #Pruitt confirmation for #EPA climate change denier
why aren't Dems doing anything in Georgia, Price's vacant seat? Trump barely won GA ! Empty seats = no Dem presence! Crazy !
weird that you use pix of children? No, that's your norm! The kremlin thinks you guys should go to Siberia
thank you #butshepersisted
Ty Senator for being our voice. Love you & @MarkWarnerVA from VA! 
You dems. sure are showing your hate and fear when it comes to @realDonaldTrump , his supporters and Russia.
#traitor
I called Manassas today. Will you be hosting a Town Hall during the recess?
When are you going to do something?  I don't mean photography either, I mean real action.
what the hell
Thank you for projecting our voices!
Thank you for your support, Senator Kaine.
We are just getting started. 
Thank YOU Senator Kaine for being a voice for US!!!
Democrats are putting every America in danger by all these distractions and stall tactics it's not right Tim should be ashamed
.@timkaine I hope @SenThomTillis takes a lesson from your book and welcomes our @IndivisibleNC @IndivisibleCLT voices and hears our concerns
you're a class act!
Plan on making my voice heard time after time, day after day til yr gone. The past 8mos, your alt left pedigree has been proven!
If drugs that killed people are coming in the mail from other countries why is this not terrorism
@LeslieMarshall Child abuse us pathetic.
Will you push for an investigation on Flynn? To see what damage has been done?
@LeslieMarshall Thank you commrade
@LeslieMarshall
love the pussy hats the kids are wearing, must be a great parent
debate instructors?
Great pictures! Thank you for still fighting for what is right!
Pussy Hats on children. Seriously?
did they bring you gifts?
Thanks for wanting to hear from your constituents! Wish @RobWittman would do the same.
look at those paid protesters. They must work for cookies. 

these parents should have those children taken from them, horrible parents
Seems that all negative comments come from those out of state.
you used bs science to get your way
Trump's CFO Allen Weisselberg should be offered a deal if he "sings."
Good parenting
why does Indivisible waste their time on you? Everyone already knows you're part of the Trump coup machine.
Explain
and this is how to get and keep constituents!
Thank you Senator Kaine.  One member of congress who is listening to the people who elected them.  What about the rest of them?
now THAT'S how you respond to constituents showing up!
Having your children wear hats symbolic of female genitalia is #childabuse
Please do ALL you can to remove @POTUS from office. You and @MarkWarner are my Senators. Remove ALL traitors from D.C.
thank you! You listen to hear and not simply respond and we so desperately need that now.
#HillaryClinton campaign chief #JohnPodesta linked to corruption in Russia and Russian bank
