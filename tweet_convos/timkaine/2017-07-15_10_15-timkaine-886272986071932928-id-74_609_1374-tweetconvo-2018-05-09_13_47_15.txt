#BCRA threatens my child's life & adds stress to my already stressful life. 1m's of mom's r like me! https://youtu.be/ZgNg0hiCYqQ  @Nataliew1020
And don't say work to fix Obama care, putting tape on a rusted sinking ship won't keep it afloat
You globalists are getting kick back from the insurance & pharmaceutical companies so you don't want to repeal Obamacare. Hint: NWO IS DEAD
Lies lies lies. Tim Kaines life is a lie.
OMG!! My fam's healthcare cost $7k to $21k in 3 years!!!  INASNE!  Insuring 21m uninsured would have only cost us each $580/yr! EFN Ocare!
Please don't vote for any health care bill that would hurt millions of us Americans. Thank u for being a wonderful Senator.
And don't forget to call it Treason Tim.
#BCRA would hurt my daughter, Charlie. After everything she's overcome, bad policy will be what robs her of a bright future.
Because it sucks!
Shoo troll
And you guys sat by and watched #Obamacare implode under the weight of big gov and did nothing. #DrainTheSwamp

REPEAL Obama socialized mandated crap! ROLL BACK PreObama; expand Medicare/Medicaid, Cap Malpractice, regulate % PI,Pre-ext punishments
I live in Rhode island and it would hurt alot of people in my state. I rather see him just fixs it. We all deserve health care.
So when the last insurer leaves the exchange next year. What insurance are these states going to have to offer their people?
 I WISH that Republicans would #BreakDown & invite the DEMS in to amend and #SaveACA for the BENEFIT of MANY instead of TAX CUTS for a FEW.
Hurt ? HE WOULD DESTROY US. TRUMP HAS NOTHING GOOD INSIDE ( or outside) OF HIMSELF. I FEEL LIKE HE'S WITH SATAN. BUT GOD IS COMING !!!!
I TAKE THE ISSUES. I DID THE WOMEN'S MARCH IN WICHITA KS around 5 thousand ppl. I work hard DAILY since Obama was running. God is with me.
Hi
How about a vote with @realDonaldTrump? Why not extend a hand and work together?? Hahaha bet you won't!?....
OC is a joke.  Did no good but help the slack ass freeloaders in the country.
The ACA needs minor adjustments. The #GOP cut funding is why it will fail. #CORRUPTGOP will have their way one way or the other. #VOTEBLUE
Only the greedy governors that fell for Obama bribe of temporary funding. Probably got some through an election, now time to pay the piper!
Nobody can ever take a thing you say seriously after your "treason" accusation.
Dem, Rep & ObamaCare Designer agreed ObamaCare was designed to fail! Now Repeal the Obama Failure!
STATES CAN INCREASE PROPERTY TAXES TO GIVE FREE CARE TO THE LAZY
Why is it the people of the US and state Governors  know this plan would be detrimental... yet the Republicans refuse to listen.
#ThisIsWhereWeDoubleDownLikeGeorgeWashintonAtValleyForgeAndLikeTheSwampFoxesInTheSouthWeGetStronger
Thank you for keeping the news real.
Over 60% of Americans now want single-payer. Don't back down and meet the Republicans half way
They wrongfully think single payer will fix insurance-without-coverage, can't-afford-the-deductable Obamacare
I am glad @VP couldn't sway the governors.
Senate Trumpcare is more cruel than House Trumpcare #Withholdconsent
Yes
Will 'they' have the integrity, backbone and conscience to vote no?
Now what flor the health care bill? How will they fix Obama care?fix what don't work!
From what I've read and hear, the proposed healthcare act will cover pre-existing conditions. Please explain why don't think so.
Which do you prefer: #TrumpDoesntCare -OR- #Wealthcare?
What did they say about Obamacare? Perhaps they just like to have the Fed pay for things.
So don't vote for it
I Hear you're heading off to a fundraiser in Nantucket tomorrow .....um that's not in VA
Betcha only those in opposition spoke which means that's not an inclusive tweet by any means. Stop skewing the facts, it's half the problem.
As an Ohioan, not in love with Kasich but, happy he is standing up.  I would like to think he is putting ppl before .
The Medicaid expansion reached a lot of people in Ohio.At first, Kasich was hesitant to take it. Perhaps he sees value.
All about buying votes and keeping people dependent isn't it Tim?
Nothing can hurt states and people more than obamacare that aims to give everything (opioids) with little regard for what is actually needed
Hoping the governors keep resisting the bill and telling the senators why
Working on the weekend Senator!! #dedication
Of course not, golfing. Tweeting done by under-paid, no health care intern.
Time to start using the "I" word... IMPEACH!
"Impeach" Tim Kaine? I'm all for that.
Government should get out of the healthcare business.  It's only wealth redistribution & Dumbocrats know it.  Timmie is a con man.  #MAGA
You mean Trump no care.
What do you do if you're old a child, or have an existing condition?
Idea: After you've fixed disastrous VA medical care system, THEN why don't you tell us about your wonderful plans for the rest of us?
Doctors agree: Lucky Strike cigarettes are less irritating.
but it makes the BIG MONEY GOP DONORS happy
In adiition to 0utting direct pressure on the Senators, put pressure on the governors to put pressure on the Senators.
Now if you can get the Senators to do the same, it will be beneficial for everyone
TrumpCare or BetterCare is Deathcare!
Repeal & Replace Trump America Instead!
Trump's the Chief Thief & Top Liar of the USA  lives over 
@EricGreitens IS THE WORST! Please pull him aside before he DESTROYS what left of Missouri! Created CHAOS in ST.L with min wage repeal! #sad
