They only need 50 votes... The triple threat may not falter this time, its going to be interesting and scary. 
that is an untruth, support #GrahamCassidy
The sky is falling. The sky is falling. Join Hollywood Tim, you're such a drama queen.
This is what they're proposing.
Clearly propaganda written by democrats to scare ppl into a frenzy. Just because it's a meme doesn't make it true.
That's nuts
Isn't your white supremacist son an #Antifa domestic terrorist? #AntifaTerrorists
How many folks have to tell you Timmy we can't afford your plan
We can NO longer afford to pay for everyone. Admit it! $1473 premium per month--we can NOT pay for your care. WORK & PAY YOUR OWN INSURANCE
I hope you never find yourself in a position where you need help just to stay alive and it's not there!
please do whatever possible to block this! Terrible!!! Seniors, Vets, Disabled, Addicted need medicaid!! @SenSchumer @SenSanders @SenWarren

Warning. It s a thread about the current state of healthcare insurance and its bleak future. It's very blunt. Crude. And it's our story ..
And also VA's veterans. http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/07/25/436583/keeping-promise-americas-vets-saving-medicaid/ … #handsoff Medicaid #protectourcare

Kaine you are a piece a crap.

In other words, it's the GOP's pledge to the middle class and poor, plain and simple.
This hurts the nation, not just Virginia

Your son is who is hurting Virginia's children via violence.
Please vote NO to the GrahamCassidy bill!
What has been hurting since its implementation is the failed DemocRAT idea of ACA. Talk about that don't scare people.
This is 100% UNAMERICAN! CRUEL, MEAN,HORRIFIC! I cannot believe that this is even under consideration. There is NO caring for Americans!
Old Man Mitchell wonders how many illegals voted to get you elected...no way VA is full of that many idiots
Where is ALL this money suppose to come from?Obama Care is hurting Seniors, no new Medicare patients being excepted.Or Medicaid for children
This bill in disguise #Trumpcare garbage! @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC @SenateGOP
So important to actually read and understand this legislation. If you do, you will agree with senators Kaine and Warner.
Thanks for your leadership on making healthcare better and not throwing the baby out with the bath water!
They plan to vote without knowing who it will harm and how much. They are screaming I DON'T CARE WHO I HURT. 
Make them pay for callousness
Kaine & Dems already destroyed healthcare for millions by forcing Obamacare on the USA. Stop the damn bs. FULLY REPEAL OBAMACARE.
You must be completely oblivious. Do you not understand Obamacare already hurts millions with high costs and no choices. SMH
Liar liar pants on fire.  Fear mongerer
That's not factual at all
With GOP it's like watching out for  ISIS, & NOT KNOWING WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO STRIKE US, all you understand  is it will be deadly when.
Please talk to Collins McCain Murkowski Capito    please
Call your senators call again and again burn up the phone lines
What's your plan, Timmy?  Other than status quo and spending an ass-load of money we don't have. Do nothing Senator(s).
So if you don't mind the people of Patrick County Virginia would like to know what you folks in Richmond and DC can do for us
That is the only hospital that we have in Patrick County. The VFD are taking emergency patients to Henry County or down to Mt Airy NC
Sen Kaine what are you doing to help Patrick county since their hospital including the ER was shut down last Wed with only a 4 hour notice
Virginia only has one choice of providers in 63 counties and cities with Obamacare?
J'espere, Monsieur Le SENATEUR, avec tout le respect que je vous dois, que vous nêtes pas raciste .
And the ACA  rate increase to Virginians in 2018 is?
This bill is designed to do one thing & one thing only: Hurt & Kill Americans by making healthcare unaffordable again.  #SaveTheACA
What do you think Obama care was going to do.Dont you think you should work for your health care.
And it fails Cassidy's own "Jimmy Kimmel Test". This bill will kill American children thru uninsurance.
And at the price tag!
Here are what the premium markups would be for various health conditions:

We All know this Tim. The problem is that the @SenateGOP doesn't represent their Constituents, They represent Corporate interests
I'm a Virginian and Tim Kaine doesn't represent a single damn thing I stand for. He cashes corporate interest checks though
Tim.....are you losing your mind yet? How do you stand working with these deceitful bastards.
Is this why no deal on CHIP? Kill healthcare all together?
Starting calling the GOP swing senators and promise them something they want, that is reasonable, to kill #GrahamCassidy.
@tedcruz @JohnCornyn - Vote No on #GrahamCassidy healthcare. Don't hurt Texans w/disabilities or seniors. @elpasoindivisible #Healthcare
Call (202) 224-3121   And make your voice heard. Government should work for us. Demand it!
#peoplewilldie #lying #hack #MAGA is #abetterdeal!
Don't you mean substance abuse?
Eliminating preexisting conditions protection means it hurts EVERYONE.  Everyone. Whether your plan is through ACA or not.  Hear that.
All for the 
If you make a bill to take care of the homeless situation in America it would bring down the crime which would bring the economy up
Nice how you make untrue, broad generalizations. It would actually probably help many of them.
How do you know this?  Have you read the bill?
That's what they're hoping! Freedom! The freedom to die, to never reach your full potential- woo hoo!!
Kill the bill !!
