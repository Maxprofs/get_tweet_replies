At least they didn't "PASS THE BILL IN ORDER TO KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT" 

Please fight it. What can those of us in the field do?
And dems kept their whole policy secret!   WTF are you talking about?
We are with you 100%. Defeat this bill. It's going to kill millions of Americans. Filibuster till July 4th. Let the Senators face the people
Same reason as Dems did
Oh yeah
Because they didn't want to have to listen to the bs from u all
Where do I get a copy?
Y'all said you had to pass Obama care to see what was in it lol your a joke.
We've always known why Senator.
Maybe the dems should propose o bill that congress needs to be on that very same health care
#GOPShitCareBill2017
It's a disgrace that this is all they can come up with who they trying to help the majority of the people hate it , please help!!!
Like you and your inbred Dims did to pass Obambacare?
You saw obama care plan and passed it, it was a disaster!
@POTUS  Sen Kaine needs a couple of doses of #PelosiBismol.
Why do @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP represent corporations not the people? Why is money more important than life? #HealthcareBill
Please go away @timkaine we are HERE because you were THERE. A Progressive VP would have changed all this. Piss off.
Sounds like "We have to pass the bill to know what's in it"...Pelosi.
Like we have to pass it to know what is in it?  You have a short memory.
It's sickening.
Bullshit.  You are going to vote against it no matter what is in it.  It could be a duplicate of the ACA and you would still oppose it.
Well, you kept Obama Care completely secret and Pelosi told the Dems you have to pass it to see what's in it. Your memory is very short.
Because it's Obamacare-lite?
Gee, you would know all about secrets, Mister Pro-#TPP!
Oh, we KNEW  why !
I never thought I would see such corruption in the US. It makes me want to cry.
Work the floor and vote no.
Every day I wish you were our VP.
#SpecialElections are done?
Stop the #SenateDeathBill: few #benefits, millions condemned to die, majority of #citizens to die sooner, costly #SenateHealthCareBill #Sad
Convince your colleagues to vote no!
And ObamaCare was shoved down our throats. Feel good? Eat it!
At least the comments let's pass it so we can see what's in it didn't come about this time
SENATOR KAINE TO CRAFT SOMETHING GOOD ;IT TAKES PATIENCE AND TIME! AND THE  WILLINGNESS TO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM!
Please continue fighting. This is not acceptable.
Pitiful!! Ridiculous!! "Mean"!!
a society that doesn't help those who need it cannot continue. They are leading us to destruction, I fear. What an awful future.
@snyder2020 It isn't a healthcare bill. IT IS A DRAFT. Get your facts straight #RestoringtheAmericanDream - Spence Snyder
You all did the same and never looked at it until passed. Why not helpand make it better?
Too bad for rest of us. With no #Employermandate this impacts all- no one is safe outside 1%! #Trumpcare #KILLTHEBILL #Mean
And many Senators have not read the bill later expected to vote on it!!!
Have to pass the bill before you can know what's in the bill.
Please lobby your Republican comrades to vote no.  This is a terrible bill for everyone I love.
it would put the entire Medicaid program on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that now exists.
You must do something @timkaine! We are counting on you.
like how y'all said that we have to pass obamacare so we could see what's in it? #HealthcareBill
like how the democrats said if you like your plan you could keep it. if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor?
Resist!!  Fight!!  Add a thousand amendments!!
#ProtectOurCare
It's like your dog left a pile of GOP and you stepped in it and you can't get it out of the cracks of your shoes. #AHCA #Resist
"You have to sign the bill before you can read the bill" Sound familiar? #Pelosi #HealthcareBill #FullRepeal
This makes me livid!!!!
Troll.
Because it's ready?
Republicans enjoy seeing the poor and working classes struggle and die.

How can they claim to support the Constitution when they ignore the first three words of it? They wrote "We the People" large for a reason.
Go back to sleep. Ur buddy was spotted in the woods. Go find #mrsbillclinton and leave the grown-ups to do the work
Nothing like getting screwed without the benefit of a kiss.
At least we get to read it before they pass it
Did they finally let you off the bus?
Please use every option to defeat this evil legislation. #TrumpCare #McConnellCare will bankrupt Americans as will as cause loss of life!
Are they that stupid think Americans are"by going to understand GOP trying to kill us? Or that we don't know they're stealing our money?
Well do something about it I'm a vet
I am a senior now I am going to pay more for my ins & get less do I put food on the table or pay for my ins that will not cover what I need
Omg..the GOP..I can't even....
SO DO SOMETHING
It is not health care. #wealthcarebill #wealthcare
Speak clearly about what dems will do to IMPROVE ACA!  Regulate Insurance companies? WHY ARE HEALTH STOCKS, DRUG STOCKS BOOMING TODAY?
They have no answers they have no change they just collect money from the taxpayers sad
You mean wealthcare bill.
Acting like corrupt Dems???
This really is sickening.

Ouch
They are inhumane
We always knew why sir. 
How is your Left Wing terrorist son doing?
I mean, we knew why all along.  It's not like they were going to be like "Surprise we don't hate poor people and minorities, fooled ya!"

JFC!
#HealthcareBill 

The bill isn't done. If Dems would work with @realDonaldTrump instead of him needing compromise with #FreedomCaucus , we'd have good bill
Sen Lee, Utah was on committee and said he hadn't seen it so I don't think someone named Veritas should make that statement.
