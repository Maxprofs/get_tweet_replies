Me too!
Still no boats/pickup trucks headed to Houston with BLM, Liberals, ANTIFA, Leftists, DNC or Congressional Black Congress Caucus members
Call 911. Really? That all you have? Good grief...
Im praying too
Or 311
Thank you for that piece of vital information. If you can't help, at least shut up so that people who are helping can communicate
That's what our Tx bros & sisters need -- a Va Senator telling them to do the obvious, which apparently is not the right thing to do now
I'm praying for the millions of unborn babies killed in the womb each year with your support. #nottruecatholic blood on your hands
Finally you say something sensible and humane.
Unfortunately they can't get through!

don't bother ! The god of Abraham Isaac Jacob doesn't listen to baby murderers ! Especialy left wing Communist !
Thank you, Senator Kaine! The President should have said just that! Too busy talking about himself!!
Senator Tim Kaine voted to provide aid for Sandy while the GOP who are begging for aid for their states voted against providing aid for us
thanks for sharing that. Tim Kaine is a gentleman and I am so happy he is in VA. Prayers to TX
Get some pickup trucks with BERNIE or I'M WITH HILLARY Bumper Stickers and head to Houston with your boats. Ooops, those don't exist, right?
If you are in need of rescue, call 911 or the U.S. Coast Guard Houston Command Center at 281-464-4851
