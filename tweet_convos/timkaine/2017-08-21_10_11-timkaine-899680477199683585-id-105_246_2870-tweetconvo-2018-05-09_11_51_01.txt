You're a little older than me. I was cutting class that day, senior year. Now I'm in my senior years (qualified via AARP).

Do you think @POTUS and GOP are denying the eclipse?
You sure that was an eclipse on your 21st birthday?
In 1979 I was in boot camp.  I actually got to see this one
I've never seen one....i was born Nov. 1979

I'm sitting in my driveway, about 20 miles south of st. Louis, mo.... this is so cool.
Lots of little eclipses on the ground right after totality...
Where are you watching it?
the sun reflecting on the ground.
I watched in 1970 in Alexandria. Dad was a photographer & took amazing serial photos. Great event for us kids then.
I remember that one!!
