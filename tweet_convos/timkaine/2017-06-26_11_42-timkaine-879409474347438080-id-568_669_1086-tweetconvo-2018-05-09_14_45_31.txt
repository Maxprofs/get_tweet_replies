I'm a cancer survivor. I have a pre-existing condition. I'm 52. I won't be able to afford health care. #AmericaSpeaksOut
me too

What's hilarious is all these nitwits thinking the world will end. Pre-existing stays. Medicaid not cut. Increases slowed. (See Illinois)
I'm very concerned about my brother, who is disabled, uses a wheelchair, and requires 24/7 care. #AmericaSpeaksOut @timkaine
#AmericaSpeaksOut Dad, WW2 vet, needed skilled nsg, hospice. Medicaid made possible. Can't imagine what families will do w/out it.
#Trumpcare will lower my health insurance premiums #AmericaSpeaksOut
Thx to #ACA, I can afford hlth ins. Now that my ded. is paid my Rx's are free. W/o it, my 2 Rx's would cost over $500/mo. #AmericaSpeaksOut
great for you. Guess what, I am paying for your shit. Thank me not the ACA.
I pay taxes too. 
taxes have NOTHING to do with it. My ridiculously high monthly premiums and huge out of pocket costs subsidize you.!!!!
Do you want a trophy? I'm not here to argue with you, why are you attacking me?
hardly attacking but to say the ACA is great is a joke, unless you are heavily subsidized or have a severe pre,it is completely unaffordable
The healthcare system, in general, in the US is broken; however I feel that we should try to fix the probs w the system rather than scrap it
Totally disagree. Simply can't amend something that is making it worse.  Scrap it all and start fresh. Shame repubs ain't going to do it
#AmericaSpeaksOut I’m 70 & have been fighting terrible osteoarthritis for ~30 yr. If I lose med care, I’ll just lie in bed in horrible pain.
This will stop me from getting yrly screening 4cervical cancer,  breast cancer, my annual "wellness".#Americaspeaksout
#AmericaSpeaksOut I am in a rural area, and our hospital is likely to close under #Trumpcare. I see patients daily benefiting from the ACA.
I have narcolepsy. Thanks to medication, I'm able to hold a full time job and live life. #AmericaSpeaksOut @timkaine 1/
Without it, I wouldn't be. #TrumpCare at it's best will significantly increase costs, even with insurance through a job #AmericaSpeaksOut 2/
Redefined essential benefits and coverage caps would eliminate access to the medicine which is over $10k/month out of pocket @timkaine 3/
I'd be back to square 1, would likely not be able to continue full-time work, and would have no coverage left #AmericaSpeaksOut @timkaine 4/
And there are many who have stories just like mine. Ocare isn't perfect, but #TrumpCare is NOT the answer. #AmericaSpeaksOut @timkaine 5/5
No taxpayer should be subsidizing your healthcare period.  Pay your own way.
As a51yr old self-employed single parent of a College student I will have to choose btwn child's education and healthcare #Americanspeaksout
not if you were illegal alien in Ca. Free tuiton
I work in long term care. Most of my elderly residents are on Medicaid. If they lose coverage, my facility doesn't get paid, we close. 1/2
Worst #Medicaid long-term care cuts won’t be right away. Worst cuts in 10 yrs when #Boomers need long-term care en masse--get #LTCi now!
Got notice that Innovation Health (AETNA/INOVA) will no longer participate in Virginia. Being forced to change health plans in Dec.#timkaine
Son needed life-saving surgery@birth. Luckily we had good insurance. Lifetime caps could mean no insurance going forward. #AmericaSpeaksOut
Fyi:  2009 Harvard study finds 45,000 deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage. #AmericaSpeaksOut
Putting our heath care in the hands of politicians
Obama Care or Trump Care or Mao Care
is an existential mistake

We curse our children
Um. Bill. What is your suggestion for healthcare?
Rather than surrender & say "its the government's job"
we must realize politicians can't do the job
We must create charities
as many as need
I've had depression and anxiety since I was 11. (I'm 29 now.) I cannot be without medication. Mental health is important. #AmericaSpeaksOut
What is your point? Your meds will still be covered.
Did we read the same bill? Even if they are covered, my premiums and deductibles may still go up. Stop being so insensitive.
Did YOU read the bill? At 29, your premium and deductible will probably go down.
2 healthy kids, employer-based healthcare. I want my taxes to help keep my neighbors covered. #americaspeaksout
Since one size fits all really only fits 10%, I'm assuming a better fit once freedom rings again.
My son has Down Syndrome.  Medicaid is key to his ability to be healthy, educated and employed.  #AmericaSpeaksOut
Anything will be better.  I'm willing to take the risk.  Premiums up 50% and deductibles have doubled
Have a pre-existing condition, melanoma. Will go on Medicare in Nov. Worry re younger friends & costs. #AmericaSpeaksOut
My sister has cerebral palsy and Dad is on the heart transplant list. Medicaid helps them survive, live, and thrive. #AmericaSpeaksOut
I had 4neck surgeries in May. Spent a month in the hospital. don't know what I'd do w/o the aca. Please keep fighting for families like mine
What is alternative keep giving to takers
My 9yo daughter has autism, relies on Medicaid for school & community supports. Wants to be an astronaut. #AmericaSpeaksOut
My daughter who lives in NYC can't afford Obamacare.  Paid the penalty.
even cheapest Trumpcare option will be far more expensive & will cover much less. Won't cover emergency svs, prescriptions, maternal care
It won't. Worked 4 decades to insure a retirement with insurance, paid my taxes for SS and Medicare. Stop stealing from us!
I work hard & pay my taxes for SS/Medicare as well. I also got cancer. Does that mean I shouldn't benefit from the programs I pay into?
Absolutely. One step at a time. My husband died 2 yrs ago from cancer. God provides but in His timeframe. Never lose your faith n God's plan
God's instruction is to help the poor, sick and elderly. To love thy neighbor. I guess that's why I don't understand.
Yes but we have a separation of church and state. The government isn't under God's instructions.
Or is it?
Well in reality the earth is the Lord's  Try getting a liberal to understand that.
You can't say separation of church & state and then holler but, but it's Christian to help the poor.
Optometrists meet many uninsured patients who can just afford eyeexam:then when it reveals Serious medical issues, they can't get treatment.
I don't want to go back to the days when I diagnosed diabetes,ms,cardiovascular dis,brain tumors and patients couldn't afford medical care!
(3) A landscaper had lost all peripheral vision. Diagnosis: pituitary tumor. No health insurance. Needed brain surgery to remove tumor.
(4) 23 yr old with recurrent optic neuritis. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis. No health ins. & now a preexisting condition. A lot of crying.
My son is Autistic and is on my insurance from my job. If my state does an essential health waver he can lose his therapies and services.
@timkaine My 3 yr old was 4th in world diagnosed w/a debilitating neurological disorder #HIVEP2 - needs lifelong care #AmericaSpeaksOut
Oh my he’s just darling.  Prayers 
My 74-year-old disabled mom gets key home care funded by Medicaid. Because of Medicaid, she can remain in her own home.  #AmericaSpeaksOut
I couldn't have cared for my disabled mother at home after her stroke at 57 that lived to be 82 with the help from Medicaid.
I survived a pulmonary embolism & need lifetime meds (unaffordable w/out insurance). This bill will literally kill me. #AmericaSpeaksOut
That is not ok. We need to bring awareness so we can get support. I work my ass off to help. I am a survivor. 
My son has Lyme's disease and asthma. My sister-in-law has diabetes. My niece has a heart condition. Another niece has allergies and asthma.
will have 2 work past 65 need 2 retire 4 caregiving 4 spouse & daughter now but need insurance 4 me cost too high  #AmericaSpeaksOut
Why can't I re tweet some of your tweets about your situation?  People should be made aware!
PhD student w/a stable, controlled mental illness. The AHCA jeopardizes my stability, future, and ability to help others. #AmericaSpeaksOut
No it doesn't.  If you continue to have healthcare? Nothing is interrupted. Guess comprehension of The BILL is lost on you.
Ins Co s premiums 20%, s deductible, s co-pay % & covg is less comprehensive. That's not the same. Difficult 4 anyone to sustain w/job
U really think CEOs $ will  w/GOP plan? They left ACA b/c their PROFITS  from previous yrs, not b/c of lost money. They'll  w/GOP plan
It doesn't effect me at all (I don't think). But I want my tax $ to go toward helping those who can't afford healthcare.
Your copays go up. No essential coverage. So mammography, pap smears will cost more.
Meds go up for everyone
Had healthcare for years; used it twice. Paid for it in case of ER. Insurance companies make a killing off of my fam.
A car crash, house fire, sudden cancer diagnosis changes that instantly. Ur house insurance company is making a fortune bc your not using it
I'm a healthcare provider. I've worked with critically ill, injured people who never used their insurance until something happened.
If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. Obama is a lair I bet his pants are on fire! #AmericaSpeaksOut
Did you lose your Doctor?
I know people who have. I think a person needs to take responsibility for their own health by eating right and exercising.
So, it is my brother's fault because he was born disabled. WTF, was he eating that he shouldn't have? Did you miss your meds. today?
As a #Veteran I am a walking talking preexisting condition. 

#AmericaSpeaksOut #VeteransResist
I developed occipital neuralgia w/a migraine component from my immunizations for the 1st Desert Storm. I have a constant h/a w/o treatment.
Ouch. As a migraine sufferer for 36 years, I cannot imagine.
It's been pretty horrid. Actually sent me to bed for a year with massive depression. Chronic pain is so hard to fight every damn day.
I hear you. And everyone thinks they're an expert on migraines who's ever had a tiny little twinge.
OMG, right!? "Have u tried this, what about that?" No, dude, I just suffer w/constant headaches & migraines & I haven't tried anything. 
First time I had 'just a headache' I didn't recognise it at first! Seriously - it was annoying but really minor.
Mine started out as migraines only & I kept going to ER, throwing up. Like 4, 5 x a month. They thought I was a medication seeker.
Special ed will be affected by Medicaid cuts. Fighting for special needs kids is hard enough. This makes it impossible! #AmericaSpeaksOut
Why is Medicaid funds being used for Special Ed?  More mis-appropriations?
Short answer: because the budget for spec ed is never enough in districts. Spec ed is expensive and Medicaid makes up difference.
Misappropriating money responsible for is criminal except inside of the beltway. What a disgrace.
You and Hillary should be in Oval. We wouldn't be going through this!!!!
Saddened by the Christian Coalition. Trump? Blind Party faithful. Read the Bible you carry Sundays to Church. WWJD with HC? Pls Answer that.
Reps crippled ACA in NC, placing insurance out of my reach. Trumpcare will make it impossible. It makes me fear aging.
Because my anxiety shouldn't be a pre existing condition. #AmericaSpeaksOut @timkaine
I am a RN disabled by RA & autoimmune disease. I will be crippled & unable to care for myself w/o infusions. I will die. #AmericaSpeaksOut
My family is insured with ACA.  We are 59 years old with pre-existing conds. We can't sleep through the night with worry. #AmericaSpeaksOut
I could take the money I have left because I don't pay the fine, go to Thailand, catch syphillis, and pay for it outta pocket. Still cheaper
4 brain surgeries/4 yrs post-ruptured brain aneurysm in '12. Annual brain scans =$30K which #ACA covers. #AmericaSpeaksOut
Husbands co doesnt offer family coverage. I work 4 Public School n get care 4 family. District furloughing I may loose job. We wl struggle.
My sister in law is diabetic and early dementia  Her daughter is blind with a very bad heart. The family doesn't need this ACHA stress.
Won't be able to pay for  the insurance that I have, see drs & get the meds that keep me alive and healthy. I will die in less than 4 years
@timkaine I had a heart attack. W/O ACA I'd've been bankrupt. But Trumpcare will box me out w/double whamy 61 yrs old & pre existing cond.
So sad 4 our country This is not who we R R what we stand 4
#AmericaSpeaksOut I will die. Not putting my family through bankruptcy.

My mom is 56. Born with FAS, cognitively & emotionally delayed. She can't work, requires Medicaid & Medicare. #AmericaSpeaksOut
I have insurance but wouldn't be able to leave my job due to ore-existing conditions like... a sprained wrist and an ear infection. 
Always pd my taxes& wked since highschool,54yrs old,after 3brain surgeries now Epilespy. MayB GOP with kids should pay 4 own HC?
I pay $143 per month for next to top Kaiser plan, and Republicans tell me Obama Care is messed up. I beg to differ
My dad is a 30 yr Army vet. Served in Desert Storm. Had a stroke in '04. W/O meds & access to VA, he will die. #AmericaSpeaksOut
@timkaine #AmericaSpeaksOut I'm a future doctor. A person once told me that "Trump will make it better for you to be a doctor." He meant
that I would get paid more. I don't understand that. I'm not on this path to get paid more - I'm on it to help more. My hands will be tied
You should b asking terminally ill they r next 2 death!Start counting @GOP & @realDonaldTrump malicious attempt 2 kill!
#AmericaSpeaksOut My self-emp'd sister broke BOTH legs on the job. With ACA, her $500 went to $114 Incl dntl & pain meds. She can still work
#AmericaSpeaksOut @timkaine I am bipolar, but have managed to create a sustaining and loving home. Take away my meds and I will suicide.
#AmericaSpeaksOut cancer runs in my family losing healthcare would mean no cancer screening for me or mom. Don't let them kill us
Single Mom, business owner, autoimmune, already pay high premiums. If premium goes up can not afford RX , will be unable to run business.
My mental illnesses would be considered preexisting conditions #AmericaSpeaksOut @timkaine
My brother is severely  Autistic. I care for him since my mom passed. I would not be able to do that if they cut his Medicaid! 
Tim, where do I get a copy of the proposed bill?  When I read it, I'll be able to tell you.
I have DM, a mental health disorder impairing my ability 2 work. I have a preexisting condition.I'm 58 yo living on disability
Now he will die without $3,500 per month in prescriptions. 4yrs ago they were $1,800 per month. Same pills now $3,500 per month
I'm not sure, but I know under Obamacare my premiums went up 130%.
Friend had rheumatic fever at 10/dnk. 45yrs later rushed ER/needs valve replacement. No insur. Dying & Obamacare happened. New valve!  But-
I wish to work less as I get older (& before Medicare). I can't afford an individual plan based on costs to those 59-64 #Americaspeaksout
Disaster hasn't struck yet so I don't know, but I know I'm not rich enough to benefit from the massive tax cut. #AmericaSpeaksOut
This bill will force me to choose - healthcare or home. Diabetes, high blood pressure, mammograms. #AmericaSpeaksOut
My daughter has meningitis when she was 9 mths old. I'm concerned for her future now!!! Will she be able to get insurance?#AmericaSpeaksOut
Read & RT (202) 224-3121. Or enter 504-09 enter resist follow prompts to generate letter or fax to reps. Health care is at stake.
As a boomer the higher rates will destroy our finances, savings & ability to retire. Pre-existing will create jeopardy. Fear & anxiety.
My concern w #TrumpCare is the potential for Medicare supplement healthcare premiums to > where seniors will struggle to pay them.
@SarahLSmith677 Mr. Kaine, i have a medicine that I MUST take to live. If I lose insurance i will DIE w/o that medicine !
Rx @timkaine Wife's company will reenter the individual marketplace and friends can buy cheaper/better individual coverage #AmericaSpeaksOut
@timkaine I will once again worry about my son with T1 diabetes losing his insurance.  I'm terrified.  #AmericaSpeaksOut
Lifetime limits will make my husband's lifetime limited. #AmericaSpeaksOut #Trumpcare @timkaine
With Medicaid, my mom can get in home care and support to remain in her home. She spent time in nursing home before. 
#AmericaSpeaksOut
#AmericaSpeaksOut @timkaine Trumpcare is said to actually benefit me, 20s mid income, healthy. I just don't want OTHER AMERICANS to die.
#AmericaSpeaksOut  I am 55, high BP, cholesterol, precursor to colon cancer. I make $28,500/yr.. I pay $151/month now. W/trumpcare im done.
My sister has mental health issues and is on Medicaid/disability. w/o it she would have taken her life a long time ago. #AmericaSpeaksOut
Chronic migraines, 3+ a week. W/o essential health benefits, couldn't afford physical therapy, meds, or ER visits #AmericaSpeaksOut
We have to pass it to see what's in it.
I feel blessed to say my family would be fine under #Trumpcare. I'm opposed because of all the families who wouldn't be. #AmericaSpeaksOut
THANK YOU!!!
#americaspeaksout The more SENATORS DELAY healthcare, the more the uninsured suffer!
#americaspeaksout Not insured due to Obama! YOU are delaying!
#Trumpcare will put me in a kind of low level of terror wondering when the next shoe will fall. If #AmericaSpeaksOut, we can avoid that.
It will be better than Obamacare
My premiums will decrease with this new bill. Left great plan when #obamacare caused rate increase of 36% 3yrs in a row
My premiums, which have doubled under ACA will likely decrease along with the deductible #AmericaSpeaksOut
I'm a Virginia voter and it looks like the GOP Healthcare bill will save me money on healthcare and taxes. #AmericaSpeaksOut
It will be almost as bad as Obamacare, which isn't an acceptable solution. Let's go back to when the gov't stayed out of it altogether.
#AmericaSpeaksOut I won't be forced to buy coverage I don't need.
#AmericaSpeaksOut  It likely won't impact me in any significant manner whatsoever.

My mother had a stroke and dementia. She was in a nursing home for 2 years. What would have happened to her without Medicaid?
I want to know why so many veterans aren't receiving the treatment they need? Should have nothing to do with ACA! Eight years under Obama?
Democrats used to be good ppl, but no more. Dirty politics is your game. Look inside yourself, Tim--you're  misleading these people.

Even as a young woman, I struggled with health issues a good majority of my life. It wasn't because I abused my body, either. Its genetic.
Fake news from Kaine. Don't believe any dems vote them out they are liars
It's going to be fabulous because it's taking Healthcare out of the hands of the government which had no business to be in it to begin with
My son has epilepsy. I can't imagine what happens if he can't get insurance to cover his meds. #AmericaSpeaksOut
#TrumpCare is going to uninsure a lot of Americans, especially those who depend on mental illness medications. This is inhumane.  @timkaine
It will lower my premiums and make health care more accessible by opening the door to free market principles.
Ready to retire. Will I be able to pay for my supplemental policy? Will caps result in early death?
