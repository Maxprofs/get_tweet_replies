Mayor Ooker looks like a smart man ... he has a TRUMP-PENCE sticker on his boat.
Too many people vote against their own interest.
That Mayor voted CORRECTLY ... just let a shitty rat on his boat.
I never said anyone's vote is correct or incorrect. Trump isn't going to help the citizens of his town stay afloat at all.
@realDonaldTrump won the election and he is @POTUS

AND Mayor Ooker is very very happy about that CUS Hillary & Kaine lost lost lost 
I know Trump is POTUS.  I know most of the people who voted for him that won't get one iota of help from him, either. That is all I said.
Gloat if it makes you feel better, but it won't help you unless you are the mega-rich. If so, congrats!
I don't gloat, or have a single iota for that matter
I do see DEMs doing NOTHING but lying & spitting in our faces
Hell is too good for DEMs
Did you both discuss who he voted for?
what about doing your job & getting Obamacare out & the new healthcare in for the people & the tax reform what about that.
Priceless pic
We just keep winning
Kek
Yes, you are
Criminal Kaine can learn a few things from Mayor Ooker. Like better parenting skills
I heart the sticker
@realDonaldTrump Pence. Good!

#maga
Priceless
Now, if only Tim Kaine was puking sea sick, while a beagle was pissing on his leg...
You mad, bro?
No, pretty happy, actually. He's just a sympathizer to Radical Islam, so it would make my day to, see that weak nut puking & get pissed on.
Mayor Ooker can only hear "Blah, blah, blah......blah"
Love the fact that Kaine had to deal with that sticker the whole time! #MAGA #TrumpPence2020
The mayor supports trump. Ha
Love the Trump Sticker
Do you denounce violent antifa leftist thugs who attack citizens who wear patriotic symbols & burn the American flag or hate the U.S. ?
#TRUMP2020 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THIS IS THE BEST TIMELINE, FOLKS! #MAGA OUR @POTUS IS THE BEST
Or maybe he's not as petty as Trump supporters and can handle those with opposing views.

That boat  is racist and we should destroy it. It must come down. Burn it now. #maga

I don't usually spell PUTZ...
But when I DO...
I spell it...
TIMKAINE!
Stay thirsty my PUTZ @timkaine

@realDonaldTrump RT this
Please stand for life Mr. Kaine. One good, brave man can help reform your party's platform. Shake things up. Stop following their playbook.
Tim, shut up.
What's up with the Trump sticker?

Senator kaine owes POTUS and Americans an apology.  And he should own up to his son being in the fascist group antifa.
Nice to see you finally supporting President Trump!
In These times your lazy ass should be working you overpaid thief of the commoners.  We will prevail!
Insane Tim NoBrain Kain!

                 #TrumpTrain 
Love the 20/20 decal. Everyone has seen this, embrace it don't delete it.
Thank you for supporting Trump supporters, Timmy. It really goes a long way.
I love the Trump/Pence sticker! This is so priceless 
Wizard!
:takes breath: How you got elected to any office confounds me. Thanks for the lulz 
LOL
How about damage from your son and his Antifa peace mongers?
Senator, please help me teach my 7th graders & add your voice to my project. Only takes a minute! https://flipgrid.com/3cf73b  #globalcitizen
That island will be gone in 20 years. We must try to protect it. What are you doing about this?
Obviously they'll make another movie on how it will be gone in another 20 years.
Not sure how good a crabber he is but he is definitely politically astute!
Tangier isn't being victimized by rising sea levels.  It's salt marsh and sinking. The Bay is on sedimentary soil. Geology 101.
So what are you DOING legislatively to deal with #GlobalWarming? 67+ attempts by #GOP to knock out ACA. 0 #Dem attempts to override #Trump
The weather it is a changing . . .
You moonbats have been singing the same song for over 50 years.
#ImpeachTheRacist. For the love of all that is holy and sane, Do. Your. Job!
You'd think a lawyer might know that you have to commit a crime in order to be impeached. Yet you don't know that; go figure. #TDS
Senator, please run.
Yep! As far away as possible!
Guess it's a good thing you can now accept bribes and gifts
A RACIST. !  Tim Kaine Hanging with White Trump supporter Racist, say it ain't so
The only thing wrong with this pic is @timkaine isn't getting tossed out of the boat
Senator Pence understands that you don't vilify the other side of the spectrum, you do the slow, hard work of bringing them to your side.
Then why was his son arrested for committing political violence?
To bad ole boy didn't vote for your ass
I'll bet there's a 'Kick Me' sign taped to your back too.
#jackass
Hey! Mr Kaine where is the life vest? 
For the record there is nothing wrong with/in this picture, but I have at least 3 questions.
So.. nice sticker... guess he's.. ONE OF THEM...
Oh look another brain dead lemming
boi wyd with that trump pence sticker
What's wrong with this pic?  The Star of David, the Fish (symbol of early Christianity) and Trump/Pence sticker? Really?
Where is this?
Shameful that Donny doesn't care about them, yet they still voted for him.
Whats shameful is your support the Democrat party that created the KKK and has slavery all over its hands
SENATOR IT MUST OF BEEN A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT! I REMEMBERED MY TIME ON A CRUISE A LONG TIME AGO ;THE BAHAMAS! THE SIGHTS WERE BREATHTAKING!
What's stinkier - Mayor Ooker's crab boat or his campaign sticker?
KAINE, YOU NEED TO BLAME THE GORACLE FOR THE WEATHER. YOU SAID HE KNOWS HOW TO CONTROL IT.
