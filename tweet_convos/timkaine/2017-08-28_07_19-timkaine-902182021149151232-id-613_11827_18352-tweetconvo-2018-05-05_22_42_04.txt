Red Cross bad Salvation army good as they give more for free than anywhere. Eighty per cent of every dollar raised by Red Cross 4 payroll.
Really!? Prove your words!!!
Check Charity Navigator.
I did. Says 90% of donations are spent on programs; 3.8% on admin. FYI
Yes their programs not the help of the people deviated and surely not for their food or materials to rebuild. That's shameful of them.
Whew, at least Prog cant take my blood. Though they'd try just bc I live in Florida. You do know you aren't the only ins company, right?

What nobody knows,German policiy is a korrupt, for old sick people living .Still Nazi teiy castrate in Psychikal KZs
I worked 4 the Red Cross for 20 years &also Public Education for 15!! I cant even get a response out of a political figure through twitter!!
What about visiting a real shelter and walking among victims?
Please helppp
Salvation Army is a good way to donate.

Teiy give us a law to die,before we are alive.Treat us like animals.
Germens are default .
Bad food made by Doktorsience.
I donated!!!!  And to the Humane Society!!!  You are such a humanitarian!  Keep it up!
I remember what Red Cross did with donation money after 9 11 it was criminal.            I don't support Red Cross
I won't send money but will send cloths
Quick question: at what point do you consider climate change might be real?  Serious question.
At what point would you consider the crimes of weather modification by our dear, selfless govt? Look it up, check it out, do not deny it.

Where is @RedCross in #PuertoRicoRelief ????
Not a word!
Just more & more & more @FEMA_Brock documents.
No food deliveries until DOCUMENTS?
I & my family were survivors of Miss. flood in 1993-red Cross was so appreciated! They were first responders and provided food, water daily!
neeeeeeeeed of getting fuuuuucked in a virgieeee asss plssssss
Load up those TRUMP planes with the much needed people and supplies and fly the sick back to the mainland DO SOMETHING to help US PR
Red Cross should use ALL funds donated. CEO is overpaid as Im sure other staffers are. Donate elsewhere.
Red cross is a scam they pocket most of the money for their profit.  Goggle it and u will see they are a scam
Please send finances directly 2 @RedCross do not give 2 private individuals  RedCrosd can give to those impacted now! Texas needs help Faith
How much of the money is going to the CEO
No ww2 vet, nor many vets in general will ever say a good thing about the red cross. While in navy, was told not to donate to them
If you have a phone, signal, satellite phone, etc
Ashy, Can you do me a fave? #Cinch. I'm guessing me trying to convince @TimmyDaly & @TeaLeoni to donate to RC would be like pulling teeth. 
- This was terrable. God be with and comfort you. Have hopes and pray harder than before.
I'm from the Boyscout Troop 194 of Beaumont Texas , and I wanna volunteer and help out but I'm not 18 , I'm currently 16.  Can I still help?
You can make your donations by gift cards to the age under 18
Red Cross is a money-grabbing racket.  Give your money to those who really need it, not to these opportunists.
United Way helps alot
CEO Brian Gallagher of United Way was paid $1,236,611 in year 2015.   United Way tries to explain it away here:  https://www.unitedway.org/ceocompensation#salary-faq-1 …
Yes he was however it continues to be a major force in charity and helping those in need. However many charities in TX need help, so donate
Thanks, John.  I donated to the Salvation Army.  God bless everyone in Texas.  And a salute to you, for the Purple Heart.
Thank you. I have it up as my home country declared Purple Heart month for August but got a collection of them. Proudly earned.
County not Country.
Please send a boat HELP!
God be with you

Go where your money goes further, Samaritan's Purse, Salvation Army, and Operation Blessing.
They maybe helping but to turn away food brought to feed people from churches!!! TG they didn't stop us!!!
BOYCOTT this disgusting bunch BIG Slaries, crap help. Cheap food stale, a few crappy blankets. GARBAGE CHARITY BOYCOTT!
What are the phone numbers for FLORIDAY? #TuesdayThoughts #TuesdayMotivation
while @Progressive can't help their customers. Allow a customer to pick up a rental in Dallas. Your Weather Team does not answer the phone.
My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Texas and Louisiana.
I wonder if Hillary is talking to Eleanor asking for help
ThousandOaks CA moms and kids trying to to help victims of Texas.   Could really use help of celebrity to retweet. Need social media power
Good luck!

ALLOCATION???
Avoid @RedCross they only give 10% donate to LOCAL charity @Mercury1Charity which has NO overhead no admin fees 100% goes to TX!
SAMARITINS PURSE.. THE BEST
American citizens and the world should be happy by having a Godly giving President Trump and Vice President  Of American Pence.

Samaritan's Purse is a very Safe place to donate.

Ask all unaffected TX summer camps to become shelter operations with gov't supplying subsidies.
Don't give a cent to these thieves

Fhjgh
Sorry, Red Cross only spends $.08 of every dollar on the actual cause. I'll give elsewhere.
I donated, again, but now Im hearing you mismanaged all previous disasters....whats up?
I don't trust the Red Cross. Please donate to a Huston Cherity.
How much of http://redcross.org  donations going to victims. Just wondering?
Unless you want to line the pockets of CEO's and executives, I suggest donating your money to another organization.
@RedCross also spent 600 million to build 6 houses in haiti
Yes
#Harvey
Glad to see volunteer groups helping, wondering what the government is doing besides tweeting.
How do we get food to those in pearland

Remember when the world donated to hurricane Sandy the red cross held back 75% of the $$ that came in and there are still people r homeless
Don’t send the Red Cross a dime, send it elsewhere,
I wouldn't give the red Cross a dime......they would of to give the fund they collected for Haiti to the Haitians
do not give money to Red Cross, there are better charities where your money actually helps the victims
Yo. Just make sure every penny goes to those in need and not in your pocket.
@Tip @KevinHart4real @JoelOsteen
I would like to give back. Willing to lead the red cross
What about Haiti?  http://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482020436/senators-report-finds-fundamental-concerns-about-red-cross-finances ….  Where is the money?!
They will all be safe by Allah's power.
I live in NYC how can I join your organization to go to Different states and help out ??

You want people to give the Red Cross money yet you resist all forms of oversight??
Seriously
Uhm, no thanks
"what a crowd, what a turn out" and what a golden opportunity to promote  his new white baseball cap. me speaking: "what an idiot".
Battle On Mr President Trump
