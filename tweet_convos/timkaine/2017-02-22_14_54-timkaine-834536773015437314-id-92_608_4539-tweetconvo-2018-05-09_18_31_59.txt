Still can't believe Trump mocked the Pope. That alone should have disqualified him.
@JESBulldog @Pontifex Did you promise the Pope to defend Roe v Wade.
Thank you
What a blessing! Congrats!
Congrats for what?
Are you trolling? He's been guided to justice & service by his Cath. faith. Meeting the Pope is a big deal.
Not trolling. One can be guided to justice & service without adulation of a man who hasn't adequately addressed abuse by priests.
I had the privilege of seeing Pope Francis in Central Park last. sept, I was thrilled 
Why were you thrilled? He is just a man (I am sure he is a good human being) in a white dress!
Mr Kaine, did you talk to the Holy Father about your absurd position on abortion?
NY Bishop: Pro-Abortion 'Catholic' Politicians Imperil Their Souls, Create Scandal http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/ny-bishop-pro-abortion-catholic-politicians-imperil-their- â€¦
@MrDuckstep @Pontifex Did you ask the Pope why he says Muslim terrorism doesn't exist?
Why the yes vote on Ross Senator?
how's the pope feel about abortion
How we wish you were there as our Vice President!
@DeanDettloff  kaine 2020?
he's actually sadly a pretty slimy liberal. He's like Trudeau but in dad mode.
Mr Kaine, what did Pope Francis think when you said that women can morally choose to abort their own children?
Is he as cool in person as he seems?
the only time you'll admit to being catholic. Because he's a socialist global warming feudalist. #NOTMYPOPE
Very Proud of you Senator......Amazing!
What an honor. I hope to meet him, myself, one of these days.
dude...the Pontifex is just a man, another human.
But you're not a Catholic you numbskull. You've excommunicated yourself by supporting abortion and LBGT - U R Hellbound
Humbled? And you approved Wilbur Ross? Hey, Tim, I voted for you as vice president. What happened? #SeparationOfChurchAndState
Timmy, you are a fake "catholic".
KAINE CALLS HIMSELF A CATHOLIC? BUT HE CALLS FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST TRUMP SUPPORTERS
Don't go to Vatican City to discuss this crisis, come back, have a town hall and listen to your constituents
Senator, as a Protestant, I'm happy for you.  Please continue working to resist the #TrumpAgenda.
- he's misogynist Tim. He doesn't believe Magdalen was a disciple as history reveals. SHE is "disciple who Jesus loved "
even an agnostic like me can respect this pope....
this Catholic loves this!  How can I help?
so awesome!
Urgent need please @pontifex access His Majesties account at Italian Banc use as needed.
With my blessing.
