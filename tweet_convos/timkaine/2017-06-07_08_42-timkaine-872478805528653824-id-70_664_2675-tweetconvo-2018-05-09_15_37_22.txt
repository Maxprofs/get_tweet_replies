would U just please stop arming the ISIS instead of emphasising the danger of extremism??? Please
Thank you from tehran
Thanks for condemning extremism, please delay the vote for sanctions on Iran as @SenSanders suggested
you are a favorite and keep on smiling.
I appreciate that Tim Kaine but you will still put sanctions on Iran & make those same families you prayed for suffer even more.
Thank you Senator (should have been VP) Kaine
Someone sounds like someone is colluding with the Iranians. Shame on you senator Kane.
THANK YOU.
Thank you senator! #PrayForTehran
thanks! and please don't ratify new sanctions against Iran which could put JCPOA under threat
Many thanks from Iran
fully supported by Saudi and funded by the US and its alias. 
thanks for your prayers, foolish individual.
Learn to spell. Then learn not to just trust everything you hear or read.
Terrorists get money from Tehran, terrorists bomb Tehran... nature always finds a way..

Thank you Senator- @niosha  @FatimaFayea  @AmirSalami2  @AKx1K  @kusha_alagband
Thank you for your compassionate words.....
Prayers doesn't stop attacks only action!!!!!!!!
Extremism?  Like holding Americans hostage for 444 days?   Financing terrorism? seizing & boarding US Navy vessels?
Only peace can bridge the gap, thanks for all you do.
If Obama had helped Iranians to get rid of this regime on 2009 ..we had a better world ..no appeasement with mullahs
Don't act like you care Timmy boy. Iranian government  is dirtier than you and Hilary.
Tim, you're a real wiener.
Winner
Prayers Tim for what ? Iran the No 1 sponsor of terrorism ! How dare u we have lost so much to these bastards. Remember your son is a Marine
Thank you for the voice of reason.
These news are being buried because the three Intel stooges were testifying to NOTHING!.
Says the man who raised a domestic terrorist thug.
If you live by the sword...
Many thanks.
Thank you Senator! @timkaine
This morning's attack in Iran re-emphasizes the threat of extremism. Prayers for Tehran parliament & tomb victims, wounded & their families
They r chanting death to america. Wish sunnis hit them sooner for yemen, iraq, syria & lebanon. U r naive sir.
...starting war to hide truth...
thank you senator!we dont forget your support!
Thank you for doing the right thing and offering support. Damn, I really wish you were VP.
.Did you support the Obama BIG NICE to Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood?  If so you were supporting terrorism so stop acting high and mighty
As long as selling weapons is the 1st priority, our people (US, Europe, Iran, ...) will be killed by ISIS in streets.
thanks from Tehran

Thank you senator but please stop arming the Saudi's
Thanks Senator,but why have you forgotten that 15 of 19 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia at 9/11 disaster?
What kind of extremism?  What is the basis?
Doesn't recourse to terrorism inherently demonstrate extremism? Does it matter what kind?
So we can know who to go after and how to combat it.
Thanks man.  fron #Iran
Thank you senator. As an Iranian, I thank for your kindness
Your running mate wanted to bomb them and you want to pray for them.... seems sincere
With all due respect, "prayers" do nothing. Many so-called Christians pray for God to smite Islam. Humanism, not prayers.
Thank you for saying this! They deserve our support as much as any terror victim.
You're a real man. Regardless of our ethnicity you're my brother
SENATOR KAINE LOVE YOUR ENEMY !
2. No illegal immigrants EITHER!!
SENATOR KAINE JESUS WON HIS BATTLE AGAINST THE ROMAN EMPIRE! WE USING JESUS'S APPROACH; WILL ALSO WIN!
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT REASONS FOR EXTREME VETTING ANYONE ENTERING OUR GREAT COYNTRY... THE SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS IS OUR NO. 1 GOAL!!

SENATOR KAINE WE SHOULD SHOW ALL THAT WE DEEPLY CARE; FOR OUR MUSLIM BROTHERS! TO FIGHT THIS IDEOLOGY,!
Was it Muslims?
Well stated.  Thanks Tim.  Wish you were leading this nation...
