Everyone feels contempt for resume liars who claim to be "fluent in Spanish" but actually only speak "espanglish".  https://www.google.com.do/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.univision.com/noticias/convencion-democrata/hillary-clinton-presenta-en-miami-a-su-candidato-a-vicepresidente-tim-kaine&ved=0ahUKEwjXuLiwxPfTAhXLNSYKHf39Bu0QFggeMAA&usg=AFQjCNGwIg9hboDFRK-YO5gEHV1jawmCoA&sig2=KQNZxp3up2-LveR9sxph8w …
and that has exactly what to do with my retweet? 
You retweeted @timkaine and so I responded to HIS tweet.
Please next time leave me off if you're not responding to me. Thanks!
If you retweet a man who executed 11 people, including six Blacks and five whites, you are inviting controversy.  Progressives oppose death.
bye  I have no time for this . We have a criminal fascist in the WH and you still haven't learned.
Had HRC not nominated a 49th consecutive WM VP and nominated Holder instead, she might have won w/runningmate who never executed anyone.
If you believe that, why were u HRC running mate?#wontForgetRiggedPrimary
Bernie would've won
If he'd run for president? Oh no--wait! He did run. So he would've won if...what? If he'd been backed by the Russians instead of Trump?
He would've won if HRC didn't collude behind the scenes with the DNC to cheat him out of the nomination. DWS literally said that
I disagree w you;I think Bernie's too much of a Socialist to stand a chance-but I don't fight on or off twitter-you seem determined, so bye!
And that ignorance isn't bliss for the people around you.
The Pharisees best stop playing church being lukewarm is something the HE, JESUS, Does NOT play with!!!!
Well said Sr.
What a different world it would be under President @HillaryClinton... sigh
Says the guy who supports genocide.
You are the VP America needs
Sen. Tim Kaine, I sure wish you were our Vice President right now!
Actually, Senator Kaine is supposed to be our VP.  
IKR? I agree Anita.
Does this mean you're moving out of the country?
such a scary time.  When I was a girl I wanted to be the president because that was the most honorable profession I could think of.  now?
Which is why YOU and SHILLARY aren't in the WH- you're neither.
I am counting on you to keep the lights of liberty and truth burning, in my life time never seen a reversal of Good as now
may want to remember that next time you're sharing your contempt for conservatives. we're all humans.
A lesson liberals desperately.  Stop the HATE!  Stop the RIOTS!  Stop the attacks on FREE SPEECH!
This wt Hafter do in Libya he is American
Yes Sir!
Greatness comes with words of greater fruit you know what I'm talking about hypocrite.
Well said!
Amen!
Very true sir.
You are nuts.
What about Genghis Khan?
A rare imperialist,  to promote religious tolerance as he did. I do not agree with imperialism in modernity...though his efforts are noble.
Too many pyramids of skulls to fit comfortably into the Good category.
Indeed! :)
Why do you think Hillary lost. Trump will overcome the disgraceful DNC smear campaign but DNC will not overcome @dncfraudlawsuit
wcg50 practice what you preach
Please investigate whether CrossCheck was validated to ONLY remove duplicate votes (not single) before but in place.
"Well said"
I keep asking what you and @MarkWarner are doing about our Betrayer-in-Chief, but so far not seeing any action, just platitudes.   Help us!!
You are the best Tim Kaine. VA loves you
Thanks. Senator.
Trump is the face, the voice, and the moral mirror of the republican party. It is time to move toward the center and away from extreme.
So true.
We need you & Hillary in the White House. Please save us!!! 
And there can't be goodness without Jesus Christ.
Great tweet! 
"your job as a decent human being is to constantly affirm and lift up and fight for treating people with kindness and respect" -- @POTUS44
thank you. In the long run integrity and character are more important than power.
We are screwed. I miss my country.
And there's no goodness with Donald Trump as POTUS.
Oh look the one I voted for making sense
You couldn't have said it better!
Moral superiority cost you the election last year. When will you learn? Tweet about single payer...
Amen brother, these est. Dems will never learn. As long as we don't have a real lefty party, the idiots on the right will keep winning.
Guess that is why HRC was not elected?  You tied your wagon to the wrong star!
don't worry timmy you'll never be great ! Because murderers like you will never know what being good is !
Beautiful. Thank you for that.
Does this mean that Americas not great because neither Reps or Dems are good? If so, smartest thing ever said from guy who lost to Trump
and your side has no goodness left, let's be honest! LOL #MAGA
Thank you!
GREAT Illinois Dem Party #legacy has been ruined by Jesse Jackson Jr. whom 4 some reason thought 2 fund raise off my @Advocatehealth #career

And also: Wherever you go, there you are.
This is beautiful and so true. Thank You!
Amen brother
Greasy one-note politicians don't get to talk about "goodness" - at least @POTUS is the kind of slimy that doesn't masquerade as righteous 
Thank you Tim
Truth, Senator Kaine!
And, if I may add: character.
Amen
Well stated!
So when are you going to start?
We need Leaders who commit 2the well-being of all people-Trump WH has encouraged fear&hate-Just happened in PortsVA
Americans are being reminded 3 consecutive all-white tickets lost and @timkaine 's '16 lies are partly responsible.  https://www.google.com.do/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.univision.com/noticias/convencion-democrata/hillary-clinton-presenta-en-miami-a-su-candidato-a-vicepresidente-tim-kaine&ved=0ahUKEwjXuLiwxPfTAhXLNSYKHf39Bu0QFggeMAA&usg=AFQjCNGwIg9hboDFRK-YO5gEHV1jawmCoA&sig2=KQNZxp3up2-LveR9sxph8w …
Nimrod was a valiant warrior and became a great and mighty man on the earth. Definitely, greatness without goodness. Next quote. "Nimrod."
And we will never be "good" as long as we continue to slaughter our unborn, and "Catholics" are remiss in defending these most innocent.
Tim: Please Shut it down!
So simple and true. Thank you for the reminder. Our families, our communities, our  neighbors, our country this is what binds all Americans

Thank you Senator Kaine. Well said.
Amen to that
Preach 
Everyone should listen to @timkaine talking with @davidaxelrod on #axfiles podcast. It confirms what a good/decent person Kaine is!
Either #ImpeachTrump or invoke the #25thamendment. Then lock up the liars working for him and against this country.
I almost cried after reading this becos this has been d major premise of my opposition to Trump! He advertises the worst path 2 greatness
You're the best!  So sorry your team isn't in the WH.
Keep up the good work!
#resist
And loose lips sink ships. #shuturtrap
Agreed, yet @realDonaldTrump 's lifetime of conning and defrauding people has been a bit shy on goodness. History will not be kind.
I'm glad you are my representative  @timkaine
So so right, Senator.  Please continue to press for the truth.
Thank you sir
Amen
Trump has neither, for sure. He is being used while he uses the country for his own gain along with his family and friends. Lock Him Up!
Something majorly missing in folks like @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr
Love that!
And good is the enemy of great!
I love your tweets, Senator Kaine. You always have the gentlest approach to the most scandalous events, as all true gentlemen should. 
He's a true dirtbag
will you ask @StateDept for a comment  / denunciation of the Turkish Embassy thugs?
Proud racists be on of those deplorable Americans who love this county.  Thank God the democrats are out of power and will remain so.
nobody has asked about the Americans in middle America who has just seen their lives turned Upside down because of sever weather.
Maybe they can start a prayerchain to their messiah, @realDonaldTrump
But today the Republicans are crying "poor Trump" someone is out to get him.  What will it take before Congress does their job?
And go vote no matter what the pills say
Or the polls, lol.
So well said
Enough talk on Twitter. It's time for ACTION from Congress.
Amen.
Goodness is in short supply
Yes! Well said!
There is also no greatness without courage and integrity.
Amen brother. But unfortunately the majority of the electorate didn't understand this.
and government is capable of providing neither..
but you're a pedophile.
You must be on wrong feed go answer to your leader trump...every one knows he is.
