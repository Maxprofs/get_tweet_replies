Because she has RA and will be 55 soon we will lose our insurance and my wife will die
#AmericaSpeaksOut #TrumpLiesMatter
Thanks for the like and retweet.  There is no worse feeling than watching the GOP become my own personal death panel
I can only imagine, Jay. Bless you both.
Both of the wage-earners in my family are on the ACA. We can't afford #Trumpcare. Disability before dying. #AmericaSpeaksOut
Until it's actually written out as a law and passed how is one supposed to know, are we all clairvoyant?
I am a woman with pre-existing conditions. #TrumpCare will be detrimental to my health and financial stability. #AmericaSpeaksOut
Made up fake lies. You have not read the final draft
You really have zero credibility to speak about how this will affect me.
Unless you can see the future and what the final draft will be
You can't control what I say or how I feel. I've read and researched enough to make my informed opinion.
MAKES SENse. Just like you thought I was talking about your condition. Stuff must just pop into your head so enjoy the fantasy. Goodnight
You may think you are belittling me but you've only made yourself look foolish.
Mhm
#AmericaSpeaksOut I am a freelancer. Hubs and I talking about him doing something similar...but that would mean insurance from ... cont'd
3/ Of course, we're lucky in that we don't (yet) have terrifying pre-existing conditions that would make us un-insurable.
it will FINALLY HELP Us get our HEALTH CARE BACK! We are DESPERATE for it. WE NEED IT BADLY! we have NOTHING because of OBAMA!
IT GIVES ME HOPE THAT MY PREMIUMS WILL GO DOWN OBAMA LIED
I LOST MY DOCTOR MY COSTS HAVE SKYROCKET
THANK GOD TRUMP WILL SAVE US
And my son lost his job because of Obamas coal war he has asthma and was told eventhough he is unemployed that his would be 270.00 a month.
#Obamacare saved America. It was so terrible that America rejected the @HillaryClinton Tim Kaine ticket. @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @GOP
I expect to see you speaking out against Obamacare as well. With Premiums @ 1200 per month and only 1 choice in my ST I hold u accountable
Ive had pre existing condition for over 10 years from working and paying taxes into a corrupt government, my back is now gone
#MuchBetterThenObamacareDid
Counting on senate to create  bill covering all. When I read the list I couldn't  think of one person without a preexisting condition.
I will tell you how Obamacare affected me both of my daughter single mothers do not have healthcare their premiums went 5 tomes higher.
Obamacare hiked my employer insurance policy up 4x I'm paying $800 a month just for medical. With an employer.
Its very simple. I will die w/o my medication & healthcare. I have 7 preexisting conditions & just told I have GHF & PAH. #AmericaSpeaksOut
You have esp as no one has seen the final work. Amazed at how many fall for kaine's pot stirring
you mean amazed how many drain the scrote of a corrupt prez? Oh I thought so. !
Quit crying and put forth legislation
They already did, look up H.R 676
Will §101(a) allow this law to apply to persons not in the country legally? If so, good luck passing this through the GOP.
Is there a law yet?No.Are you saying U will just allow Obamacare 2 reach its natural unworkable death like U were doing be4 Trump elected?
You know how we fix this quick, give the American people the politicians insurance and give the politicians Obamacare. Obamacare would go.
Can't be any worse than obamacare!!
Well, ObamaCare made my health insurance unaffordable. So now I don't have any! Thanks Democrats!!!!
How my wife had Obama care and the cost doubled?  #fail
I'm on Medicaid. 58 yrs old. Need I say more? #AmericaSpeaksOut
It will be great. My taxes will go down.
Hopefully I can have insurance again. Obamacare robbed me of mine.
Since I was 20. Throw in PPD and Im nothing but preexisting conditions. Too 'rich' for Medicaid, too 'poor' for ACA. 2/2 #AmericaSpeaksOut
I have been battling macular degeneration since I was 19. PTSD/depression/anxiety since I was 9. A heart condition 1/2. #AmericaSpeaksOut
Until final bill is signed by Trump we do not know what the bill covers.  Dems are lying about the bill, there is no bill yet.
#AmericaSpeaksOut I have three very serious autoimmune disorders. Please call me to testify before congress. #sickinvirginia
Fellow walking, talking pre existing condition in VA. You have my respect for wanting to speak up.
It is not final so you ask laumen to discuss outcomes of a possible scenario. How msny pages is it? Most on here have no idea of good reply
It will benefit me. I work for myself and do not rely the hard work of others to get me by. Healthcare is a privilege; not a right.
In my 50s, life is a pre-existing condition.
#AmericaSpeaksOut
54, PE asthma (nonsmoker), PE RA, PE FM, PE arrhythmia, PE heart murmur, PE allergies, PE menopausal female.Retired disabled, no benefits.
Also I want #Termlimits for all of you in Washington...!! Taxpayers employee You.. time to get off your ass and get this country going #MAGA
Well right now Obama care is costing me $15,600 a year in deductible and $2200 a month in premiums anything is better than this.
I will be homeless without medication for schizophrenia because of #trumpcare. #AmericaSpeaksOut
You must be psychic as no one knows the final draft. LOLOLOLOL
Cant be any worse than what Obamacare did, tripling premiums & deductibles. Daughter lost coverage #AmericaSpeaksOut
Stop lying. Oh wait! If you do you'll lose your job...right?
Has anyone thought of the hit the cancer, Diabetes, MS, etc industries will take when patients don't have coverage and can't pay.?
I have several pre-existing conditions; cancer, hypertension and hypothyroidism. I'm guessing I'll go bankrupt and then die. #trumpdontcare
Tim with all do respect we all know how 45's care will affect us & u know that. We want ur efforts to get to the bottom of 45/Russia
Dems have not a leg to stand on..evidence speaks and there is none. Not that dems have not looked
Son-in-law on dialysis, daughter-in-law advanced scleroderma, 72yo husband in therapy after Guillan Barre, SS suplmt = $0. #AmericaSpeaksOut
In ObamaCare they don't ask u about medical history. In TrumpCare they Will Do. Premiums will b impossible to pay!! #AmericaSpeaksOut
How do you know. You got the final draft from asange?
Healthy, 58, but have minor issues that are PE conds. With #Trumpcare I go back to denials and higher premiums. #AmericaSpeaksOut
How do you know have you read the final approved work?
#AmericaSpeaksOut 8yr Heart pt. 6 mo.✓ups w/ blood work. Daughter diagnosis MRKH still looking to major surgery. Pre-existing concerns!
Concerns but no solid data yet
Looks like just the uncertainty about it will cause NO (ZERO!) individual plans to be available in Iowa next year. #AmericaSpeaksOut
I will be able to afford my premiums and get actual healthcare because my insane deductible will be gone. #AmericaSpeaksOut
Tim, just an FYI. Know two people who died and one who went bankrupt due to inadequate health Care. Would have been fine under ACA.
Damn a real positive thinker. But it is not finished. Too early to tell
#Trumpcare #AmericaSpeaksOut you're my senator #millionsmissing myalgia encephalomyelitis bedridden

No care since I pre-exist as a woman
Don't you mean "trump lack-of-care?"  Thanks for standing up to the bullies, Senator. You're a class act. America (and the world) needs you!
How do you know it is not finished silly lady
Per @RepScottTaylor at https://taylor.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-scott-taylor-statement-ahca … the $1200B cut in HC will do $30B damage to VA HC ind. Are GOP HC promises unfunded mandates?
I'm going to get a huge tax cut, but I'm happy to give it back to help cover those who can't afford insurance. #AmericaSpeaksOut
I'm working for AmeriCorps in underfunded schools in Cleveland. I'll lose my health insurance & care for my PCOS. #AmericaSpeaksOut
Senator Kaine, someone should explain about No Medicaid expansion in most states since the ACA was enacted.
My state
It will hopefully let me go back to my Drs of choice and will cut my premiums and oop from 12k a year in half, just like before Obamacare
My mother will have to fight with her insurance company even more than she already does. People will have to go without medicine.
So Ocare is not easy for her?
#InvestigateTrump #InvestigateTrump #TrumpRussia #TrumpRussia
#AmericaSpeaksOut will restore my state's health insurance marketplace and allow me to keep my doctor.
Sorry Tim, today we deal with traitors in the White House.

improve healthcare lower cost
Trumpcare will allow me to be proud to be an American and will result in agitated replies to this tweet I'm writing
