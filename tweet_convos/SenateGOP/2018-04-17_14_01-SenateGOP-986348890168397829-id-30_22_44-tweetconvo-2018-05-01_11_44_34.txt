Today, we celebrated historic #TaxReform and said farewell to the old tax code https://www.uschamber.com/press-release/us-chamber-celebrates-historic-tax-reform-and-says-farewell-the-old-tax-code … #TaxDay 

@SenToomey sucks.
#GOPTaxScam sucks
Expats are still subject to #CBT, denied financial services thanks to #FACTA and now benefits paid by foreign govs with not a cent of US tax are considered passive income - hurting disabled & unemployed. We are still US citizens & should be treated with respect not like criminals
Yeah, and did you take a look at the debt bill that you also gave the American people to pay for your tax cuts for the rich and for corporations...but of course you will recoup that in taking support for the poor.
Scoundrels
Lol lol lol republicans crack me up. you ARE NOT the party of THE people. November is gonna be beaUtiful. Get ready.
You used the wrong hashtag. The proper hashtags are #GOPTaxBillScam and #TaxScamBill. You're welcome.
Mitch O’Connell is a disgrace
great day for the rich! You will all be drowned out in a blue wave soon.
You proud of this?
Lies

Americans still hate the new GOP tax law — and Republicans should be nervous https://read.bi/2J1YkkD  
Fascist propaganda American style
@SenToomey your constituents want to say goodbye to you and #taxscam and your bosom buddy Grizzly  DeVos
Give it up. Populace has moved on.
Say goodbye to marijuana prohibition.




Walking off with your bags of money.
