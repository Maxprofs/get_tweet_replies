Wages are not increasing at the rate they were under the Obama administration. The middle class is still waiting for their $4000.  #GOPTaxScam
Agnes, here is a non political interpretation of wages under Obama/Trump.  This group reporting only cares about the bottom line, no spin involved for either party.  They’re allegiance is to investors.
No bias there either.

Ok. Let’s go to the govt for the actual results.  While you’re perusing the records keep in mind that a great number of jobs created during O’s admin were part time.  https://www.bls.gov/news.release/eci.nr0.htm …  Have a great night.
I WENT to the gov. I do Economics for a living by the way.
BTW, I “do” economics as well.  I cleared 38% last year on my portfolio. Could have done better but was caring for a 3 yr old while his Mom was in hospital with a high risk pregnancy. Made 63% the yr before.  So I’m thinking that I understand economics.
Urban Planner w/ a Masters degree & know that the stock market does not statistically represent job wages (+\-), nor are tax cuts correlated to job increases or declines or predict future GDP (which is not doing what the GOP claims) could not care less about your finances.
Never said it did. I was making fun of you.   This argument you are trying to have does not pertain to your original statement. Please review and then try to refute my response.  Try very hard not to get off task.  You may have to stop “doing” economics to manage that.

Billionaires & corporations are making out like bandits under the #GOPTaxScam. Since passage of the bill, we've seen $260 BILLION in stock buybacks, and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says by…





















Thanks for the huge deficit !
100 % of rich people got a huge raise right GOP?!
505 companies have given raises or bonuses out of 30 million companies in the U.S.  Wages remain stagnant .
Short term for many in the nation but like republicans tell us we got our tax cuts nothing else matters fill the swamp with more fleecing white man that care very little about the nation
Under the old system we had no tax relief. Under the new system we’ve all been lied to - we get _temporary_ five year, tax relief. And the rich & corporations get permanent _Tax Cuts_ Somehow, I don’t see how this will increase jobs. We have a solution, #bluewave midterms. Vote!
Dems are back on the expiration of individuals at the end of 2025. Republicans need counter this argument.
This is BS it was a give away to the rich and now the country is going to hell.
A few bonuses do not make for higher wages. Last I read, companies giving bonuses were also laying off people. So, you're wrong. Or lying.
Hate to be the one to break it to y’all but this is a total crock. But, you already knew that didn’t you. Higher deficits, rich benefit-nontrickle down there & Corp tax cuts going to stock buy backs benefitting rich again.
Never forget, the tax cuts for the working and middle class are TEMPORARY and you start clawing back the money with RAISES by Year 8.  It’s not a cut, it’s a heist for your donors.
I wonder how much drug abuse has to do with democratic opposition?HMMM?

YOU LIE!
Such a cop out
Trump attacked the people that did 911 and Beheaded American people. Such a betrayal to GOOD
That tax bill, that scam, is as big a ripoff of the public as has occurred in many many years.
Did also know that the $7/week increase in takehome pay for many workers is chicken feed next the millions of USD extended to the highest income cohorts?  It’s responsible for the biggest debt in US history too?  #ThingsBluntWontTellYou
Lies 
Truth 
Hmmm, nope
And this. New report from @jctgov detailing the pass-through deduction on business income from the Republican tax bill. SURPRISE: it helps the rich! (h/t @davidckamin & @Brendan_Duke)
http://jct.gov/publications.h …
All lies. When will you be discussing an office at the Whitehouse for Putin?
Did you know as a middle class, I no longer to write off that I work at home?
Did you know as a middle class that my taxes will be higher next year and the year after that and so forth?
Did you know how #GOPcomplicit to treason you all are?
Lies!  Pigs at the trough. 
Did you know
 Middle class tax cut is TEMPORARY                                      corporate tax cut is PERMANENT    greedy lobbyists helped craft the #GOPTaxScam
Liberal don't know Trump!  We didn't want another lying politician in office. We want a business man to punch back. To fight for . To clean up the corruption in our Goverment since the Clintons was in Office. Mueller is doing his Job! John & Tony Podesta
The Democrats are lying to everyone! Mueller is doing his job! We Trump Supporters knows what's going on. The Democrats want people like you to think he is on the Liberal side. He is not on anybody side. He is draining the Swamp!@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @POTUS
Sure, that is why he is enthusiastic about sending ever greater portions of the economy to the 1% and his corporate allies.
Do you know who this is? This is Obama brother. He voted for Trump.
Rhetorical and agreed...
 funny! Why is it the 1% hardly pay any tax all? Middle class is expected to pay off the deficit you have created.
Did you know that it’s throwing $2T in deficits?
Liar
Did you know you saddled our kids with 1.5 trillion dollars of debt?  And now want to cut Medicare, social security (both of which we've paid for), medicaid and welfare to pay for it?  And gut our educational systems which you're doing a great job of.  And the list goes on.
How exactly does lowering taxes on corporations & the wealthy mean higher wages for the middle class? Just saying it doesn’t make it true. Trickle down? BS
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP remove all complicit lying corrupt dark $$$ NRA treason weasels NO CONFIRMATIONS illegitimate potus #GOPTaxScam #NoPompeo
If you actually focused the cuts on working people, you'd have a leg to stand on.  The people are done buying the bullshit you've been selling.
Did you know you all are complicit in trump's corruption and chaos?

Did you know we can see you protecting trump and putin over the United States?

Did you know you are all awful?
Bravo well said!
Nice  do my doctrination for me so when you don't convert to Sharia law.. Its good bye.

The tax cut is a scam! The Great Republican Tax Cut Backfire - HuffPosthttps://apple.news/AdWbOPOw-TR6TgZtpA8cnWQ
How about what you DID NOT mention?
Prove it? Categorically prove it because so far that’s not what’s happening
Confirm Pompeo or look for a new job. Our President wants to Make Amarica Great Again and Republicans need to help him do that or you are fired next election.
Raising the national minimum wage will increase wages and it won't increase the deficit and debt the way you Republicans have.
I prospered under the old Tax code and I stem to loose more in the new tax code but my companies will prosper how do I get them to invest back in me instead of overworking me? You still need to answer that question!
HR 1 #TaxCutsJobsAct was a pinprick to the economy but it produced a burst of good news! #FAIRtax cures the ills with #TrueTaxReform to #MTFA.@realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence @larry_kudlow @MariaBartoromo

Pompeo 
1) Lied about fighting in Gulf War
2) Didn’t disclose interest in Chinese Company
3) Lets his religious views impact US foreign policy…
Happy Belated Earth Day, may you breath easier as well as your children and grandchildren.

And what about General Electric who has not paid taxes on profits in 5 years? What about Donald Trump during his campaign saying don't be mad at me it's the tax loopholes I haven't paid taxes in 12 years.
That is a lie and you know it! Walmart alone tax cuts after they gave all their employees a lousy 300 to $1,000 bonus that equaled only 20% of their tax break they pocketed the other 80%.
Wage growth is not significantly affected by Trump-GOP #TaxReform. Most of the tax-cut money has gone to corporations, who in turn are spending it on shareholders and consolidation. Recent wage growth, with its ups and downs, is about average for the last 4 years
just b/c you keep repeating something doesn't make it true
BS.  Most Americans know you passed the scam because the rich paid you to do it. We are wondering why the GOP/NRA is not busy impeaching the WH monster and not investigating the cabinet swamp monsters. Blue Wave.
#GOPTaxScam
Yeah!
Confirm Pompeo.
He is a confirmed public enemy.
How about immigration reform???
Nope - most of the tax reduction gift you gave to corporations will be used for stock buy backs and to boost profits.    Sure some folks got a $1000 bonus but very few have seen wage increases.    This tax reform approach was very unpopular and was truly a bad idea
reality check.  your tax scam ain’t even trickling down.  overwhelming majority of working americans have seen nothing.  gop is dead.
You forgot burdening our children from this orgy of spending and debt.
@realDonaldTrump

Hope you’ve learned hot to cooperate with President Trump after the repeal n replace FIASCO showed your true colors being in the pocket of lobbyists and lying to the American people that Obama care would be replaced and WE WANT THE WALL!!!
Build the wall and stand together to support our great President.
No s*** you're confident you're so confident that you're claiming it can travel backwards in time and make people's lives better. Trying to take credit for tax reform having put money in people's pockets when it hasn't even gone an entire fiscal year yet.


You forgot to add to the reformed system:
- struggles daily because of skyrocketing costs of #Trumpcare.
- higher prices for goods & services due to .@realDonaldTrump's #Tradewar
- can't buy homes or refinance due to higher #InterestRates 
#voteGOPout #resist #healthcare
#ObsequiousDolt #olPissyenomics (trickle down) brought to by #olPissyTrump  (@realDonaldTrump) were like taking the Ferrari engine installed by @BarackObama and replacing it with a moped engine. Sure it still cruised a bit from Obama's momentum but sputter dribble dribble...
And massive profits for corporations that own you lackeys at the expense of the people. People will pay back Nov. 6!
If you call $120 a year higher wages, I guess the'r right about higher wages.  Health insurance takes care of that.  What happened to health ins.?   Just forget it I suppose, thinking we will too.
My $4 a month increase doesn't  go nearly as far as I'd hoped.
$21TRILLION IN DEBT!!!  And still, the important work of the people goes undone.
1.7% for the 1st quarter GDP. 

Nice job #GOPTaxScam
WHEN will you ACTUALLY DO THAT?
What about the wall and halting immigration. Cutting off sanctuary cities/states, cut the $$$ to them. While you are at it cut your spending. Opioids are a huge waste of our money! Better spent on protecting U. S. A. Citizens
 lets stick the facts.
ICYMI: House Speaker Paul Ryan says that even after the GOP tax cuts "tax revenues are still rising." That's misleading. The CBO projects the tax cuts will increase the total projected deficit over 2018-2028 by $1.9 trillion.  http://ow.ly/hLG230jBNNY 
Bull crap!!! Complete and utter bull crap.

#GOPTaxScam #TaxScamBill
Did you know?....
Republicians sold the people browsing history for donor dollars.  We should be paid for our data IF we wish to sell it!
Republicans are a scam. They work for donors not the people who elected them.
How can I get one of those multi million dollar grants from HUD that @seanhannity got to buy some real estate properties?
Sorry @SenateGOP; your tax cut package is truly underwhelming.  Running on this alone will not save you from the blue wave this fall.
Guess what?  Wages remain stagnant.  Tax cuts work for Corporations, not the vast majority of #AmericanCitizens who voted you into office.  Oh yeah - there's also that little, meaningless really, $2.3 Trillion increase in the National Deficit it caused.
Yeah, ya'll are done now.
No it won’t. This formula has been a proven failure since it was first touted more than 30 years ago.
BEWARE More reason to vote for #Democrats, These fool are all In bed with the Russiansl    "Sens. Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, and Lindsey Graham are among those who benefited from Russia-linked donations".  https://www.themaven.net/theintellectualist/news/report-russian-oligarch-money-flows-freely-into-the-upper-reaches-of-the-gop-9uQEBlPCZEeVv3KCfTz7vg/ …
Republican candidates all over are parroting the president, spouting his catchphrases and donning his hats as they try to show loyalty https://nyti.ms/2F7RCXL 
I can’t wait until the beautiful #BlueWaveComing2018
Did you know?

Under the old system:
 Wages were stagnant because Greedy Power-Hungry Multi-Billionaires pocketed record-breaking increases in their profit margins.

The "reformed" system:
They'll still be greedy and power-hungry, and now they'll give back even less.
No I just know I work. I just know I been sick.
Ok, but you're wrong
Senate tax bill: "Households earning between $75,000 and $100,000 will see, on average, no tax cut. And households earning less than $75,000 per year will see, on average, a tax increase." (VOX)
So REPUBLICANS, why is it such a SECRET that the JOBS being created NOW are mostly PART TIME without benefits? Why are REPUBLICANS selling AMERICANS a bill of goods for their PIG IN A POKE? Tell the TRUTH & SHAME THE DEVIL OINK!
#CorkerKickback would know 4 MILLION $$USD$$ is only a 'spec of sand' - #cnn #cnni #FakeNewsCNN #FakeNewsMedia
How many hearings did #CSPAN record with #TaxScamBill 2017 rammed through #GOP RULES?
If you’re so confident, why do the tax cuts expire? And what are your thoughts on their impact on our national debt? You know, the one you “fiscal conservatives” always whine and freak out about.
Wages are still stagnant under your tax plan!
You are confident?    They rest of us are not so confident.   The #GOPTaxScam is a massive tax cut for the rich.   The rest of us face inflation, rising interest rates, and threats to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.    The GOP is count of touch with regular people.
Whoever you are that writes these lies. How do you look at your children knowing that you lie for a party that cares for nothing other than themselves and the billionaires and corporations that pay their bills? Look in the mirror and ask yourself, is it worth it?
Did you know?

Companies, owners do not pay employees higher salaries because they have more money from tax cuts. They pay only as much as they have to to get the work done the way they want it - if there is a person willing to do it for cheaper they will hire that person
My wages have not change so more lies from the republicans these tax cuts are for the RICH and stop LIEING
Please unite and support our President. VOTE YES! for Mike Pompeo!
