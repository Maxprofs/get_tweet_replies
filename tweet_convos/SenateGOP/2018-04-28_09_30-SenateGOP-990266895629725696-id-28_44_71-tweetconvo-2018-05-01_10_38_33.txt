Political Theater by the Corrupt Republican Regime to distract from their destruction of America!

The worst drug and most deadly is the @GOP attacking our country and democracy
Dr. Jackson's Night Night Pills.
Privilege College & high school children. Terrorist admitted it is using Libs & Left-Wing!   They have brainwash you to use Hitler's agenda. You're their Nazis. Look what happens when you don't convert to Sharia law. Genocide! This is not from God! SL is the 666.

You want to get things done.  Then #FireMcConnell for obstruction.  Get off you duffs.

Take your unused Opioids to a safe disposal site or Rush Limbaugh. 
Need to put measures in place so the meds being taken at disposal site doesn't end up being sold back into community. Pharmacists are at times involved.
Just ask Rush Limbaugh what drugs you shouldn’t have!  He may not want to give up his supply!!!!!!

Opioids have many names. Check your medicine cabinet for unused Vicodin, OxyContin, Percocet, Opana, Kadian, or Avinza and take them to a #TakeBackDay safe disposal site. Visit https://takebackday.dea.gov/  to find a disposal site near you. https://cards.twitter.com/cards/8jgjb/5n20u …
Take back tax cuts for pharmaceutical companies who manufacture opioids.
One of these appear to be a gop/wh staple, any guesses.
Xanax is another that is written like candy. I agree Legalize Regular grade Marijuana.
Just because a medicine cabinet has an "unused" bottle of pills in it, it doesn't mean they won't be used at a later time. Not everyone takes pain medication on a daily basis.
