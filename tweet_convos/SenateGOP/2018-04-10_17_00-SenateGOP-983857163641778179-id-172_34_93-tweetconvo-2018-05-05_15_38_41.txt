Please stand up and insist upon a vote to protect Mueller’s investigation,
Democracy and the rule of law.

Let's talk reality. Losing the "miscellaneous" deduction will mean increased taxes on many citizens, including professional LEOs. Are you not embarrassed that the Republican Party has become the epitome of the con?

Glad to see Republicans have to make a decision about loyalty to Trump. If Trump fires Mueller will Republicans attack Trump and lose Trump voters or will they remain silent and lose even more credibility? It’s a lose, lose for Republicans and a result of their lack of integrity
DO NOT LET @realDonaldTrump FIRE MUELLER.  It’s clear he’s involved in something criminal and the investigation must continue. If you allow it to happen you’ll have lost all trust, integrity, and credibility.
And your tax amount due will be the same, if not higher. Thanks for nothing, @SenateGOP. Sincerely, the American people NOT in the top 2% of wealth that will be voting you out in Nov, 2018
And costing the Middle Class of America more money not less. Unhappy w/ so called “tax reform” outcome now that our accountant has explained next yr and future yr’s impact to Middle Class incomes & expenses. Not good...expect better! 
Let’s talk Gaslighting, Obfuscation.

How “simplicity” means that a good number of those who can no longer itemize will see a larger tax bill. 

Capping my SALT (state/local) deduction and killing exemptions will cost me nearly $5K this year. 

#taxreform is a scam on the middle.

With corresponding debt to our grandchildren. Hypocrites for votes. Shameful.
And all that extra taxpayer money you get to keep.

I suggest Republicans talk to Trump. If he touches Rosenstein & interferes any more with the investigation, you'll see a Democratic voting storm in November "the likes you've never seen before."
Always trying to look on the bright side of an exploding national debt created by giving enormous cuts to the top 1% & corporations. As you seek to cut taxes further, you take from those who need services & give to those already thriving. You create hardship not simplicity.
Should GOP STUPID BUTTON.
Why is this happening if Tax Cuts are so good for us?

#StormyDaniels




Let's talk incompetence. Trump is a malignant narcissist and is trying to goad Russia into war to distract from his legal problems.

#25thAmendment  #25thAmendmentNow
Let’s talk rubbish. Everyone with a brain knows this benefits you and the 1%.
Support @LindseyGrahamSC and move to protect Mueller this morning @SenMajLdr
BS give away to the rich corps.
NON-STOP PROPAGANDA & LIES! Don't believe a word of it. Their CONSTANT plugging, mentioning, cheer-leading should tell you how much of a Middle Class FAILURE this SCAM truly is. "Me thinks thou doth protest too much". Don't fall for their "say it enough times they'll believe it".
Streamlining. Simplicity. Better than double-taxation??  Prefer not to be double-taxed.
Yep, and the number of those getting personal exemptions goes to zero.
Republicans are invertebrates. They are scared of Dump Trump.
.@SenateGOP is draining US.  Putting our future at risk.  And for what?   Do the math.  #MAGA
Wow! Using the Staples Easy Button...oh dear. THATS not how I want my taxes handled...
I payed three thousand more this year than last. Thanks a lot, Republicans.
Guys you need to clean up this Mieller thing. Congress can’t make it all year with this Omnibus crap of a budget and the Dems destroying our country. There’s a civil war brewing and citizens are FED UP!
Seriously!

@SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP if you don't act to crush this #MuellerInvestigation which is nothing but a political #WitchHunt, then ur nothing but a bunch of political #eunuchs like #JeffSessions at @TheJusticeDept!

Are u a #politicaleunuch?
Corrupt Republican Regime Propaganda and Lies.
You have to produce more to lead the Senate.  Border Control is necessary and anything you can do to cut funding bill!
Sad day in America when elected officials lose touch with the needs of their constituents. The very PEOPLE who put you in office. #RepublicansAreTheDevil #TermLimitsForCongress #EliminateTheGOP
Well, golly goshies, you keep telling us how swell it is, I'm sure there must be absolutely nothing fishy about it.
REPRESENT. US.
SUPPORT. OUR. @POTUS

NO MORE RHINO BULLSCHIFF.
NO EXCUSES.
WE ARE TAKING OUR COUNTRY BACK...
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU. 
#MAGA 

@GOP @GOPChairwoman  @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
You’re bragging about eliminating ways for the American people to receive more of their hard earned money back into their pockets??? WOW! Teachers lose capability to right off more expenses, police & other first responders can’t right off uniforms or firearms. #MidtermsAreComing
You want simplicity?  This tax bill, is NOTHING.  If you are poor, living paycheck to paycheck, you are still poor, living paycheck to paycheck.  This tax bill will not fund your retirement, buy your house, pay for your kids collage, etc,  Simple
ROSENSTEIN A REPUBLICAN...
A REPUBLICAN...





Lets talk fraud corruption deflecting obstruction unhinged unfit  ignorance and just unqualified.
Less deductions is good for who?
Yeah, it was so hard to for those taxes.  Keeping track of charitable deductions and all.
Senate Repubs keep blowing about taxes- they are nothing more than a one trick pony!
#FakeNews #Propaganda  #lies
"Let's talk simplicity"... #MissPiggy @SenateMajLdr #FlakyFlake @JeffFlake #BenedictMcCain @SenJohnMcCain are particularly good at being simplistic...

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Senate Repubs, why do you think this is of interest to anyone? There is so much corruption in the WH- you need to address that!
GOP = Money wh0res!
Streamlining doesn't make it better. Don't equate the two.
THE TAX CUT SCAM ONLY WORKS FOR THE RICH & CORPS. REPUBLICANS ARE LYING TO US. In NOVEMBER, LETS SHOW THE CORRUPT REPUBLICANS THE ERRORS OF THEIR WAYS
300 billion dollar deficit for March!
Let's talk obstruction of justice!
Constitutional crisis quickly approaching...Senate Republicans “talking simplicity” about tax cuts...patting themselves on the back. Typical.
Let's talk civil rights and just being God Damned right for once.  Yesterday the Gestapo raided @POTUS's Attorney's house, office and hotel room.  When is Mitch @SenateMajLdr McConnell going to act like a man and stop Meuller?  Republicans?  Not a single 1 of you are Republicans!
It doesn't fit on a note card! What happened to the forms Trump and Ryan were holding up? Oh ya thanks for ballooning the debt!
Seriously guys, stop trying to distract people with this stupid bill and pay attention to all the corruption and ruining of our country that is going on. Country over party.
#GOPTaxScam gave 88% of the new tax breaks to the top 1%
Yeah ok. My taxes go up
Y've GOT to be kidding! There's little you can do to stop the #ShitStorm from continuing to circle the drain! And, your efforts at distraction are just sinking the GOP further in the fecal morass. Vision!? How about this!? #FAIL
How about moving on the agenda you were elected for.  You are doing the stuff needed to lose the majority in NOV. Mr Mitch wake up and do what you were elected to do. Otherwise go away
Trump’s Tax Cuts Didn’t Benefit American Workers, Just Made Rich Companies Richer - Newsweekhttps://apple.news/A-WaVDaTzSvqqtbpAe6NRdg Nope. Just more GOP bullshit!

Postcards?
Yet Senate republicans leave the president without supporting or defending him all just fun and games to republicans
Simplicity is not as important as losing our personal exemptions and some deductions. This is a scam against the middle class while giving billions to the rich and corporations.

Does one single Republican have any idea the crisis our country is in.  You talk Simplicity. How about something complicated,   What are you going to do about Trump.  I can’t hear you when you talk about anything else. You sit on your ass and let him destroy democracy.
@GOP is #complicit to #RussiatRumpTreason
why are you all ignoring what's going on with Trump????? #COMPLICIT
YOU see no indication that Trump is going to fire Mueller? Are you blind as well as deaf?
Angry over reports in December of subpoenas related to his business dealings, President Trump told advisers that Robert Mueller's investigation had to be shut down
https://nyti.ms/2GLpiQC 
Simplicity is no substitute for fairness - but thanks for trying to buy off America with just a small share of a big heist! Liars, hypocrites and thieves - all of you!!
This is why trump donated his paychecks

We are heading for a constitutional crises and our government is a s show and this is your response? Unbelievable!!
Speaking of simplicity, amazing how the gop has changed their views since Bill Clinton and one of their own Tricky Dicky Nixon!  So the rule of law only applies when it benefits Ryan and McConnell. Complete d-bags if you sanction firing either asst ag or Mr M
#RepublicanShitShow
Yes, let’s do talk simplicity. The @GOP tax cuts went overwhelmingly to businesses and the wealthy. Business used their cuts for stock buy-backs, *not* to trickle down to workers in the form of higher wages. And all ordinary people get is a record hig deficit. Great job, GOP.
