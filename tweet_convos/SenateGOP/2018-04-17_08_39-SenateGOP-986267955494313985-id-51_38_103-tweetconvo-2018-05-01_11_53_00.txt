Dear Senate Republicans, if you want more changes like this one, please remember to support Donald Trump.
There you go--benefits for WHO? Oh, yes, businesses.

And the average taxpayer gets screwed again.
Hey Republicans arent you glad Donald J Trump is our President because he managed to do what you guys only fought about for 35 years. HELP OUR PRESIDENT OR DONT RUN FOR RE ELECTION
If I happen to be one of theones who receive a $100 tax cut this year, I want Rep. to know without doubt that enduring the current corrupt administration is not worth it!!
Thank you
such a #GOPTaxScam for people of our country. But hey- Apple and other big giant companies are thrilled. Real Americans? not so much. we've been sold a bill of goods, folks.
Where are the most recent accounts of the tax cuts? Everything is back from late 2017/early 2018
Soooooooooooooooooooo sick of your BS.
Yeah, while the working poor, the elderly, the sick, the disabled and the children get screwed!
#FakeNews

@senateGOP @dscc SUN COUNTRY gone! Apollo announced in February that it plans to cut 350 jobs from the airline's ground service operations at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in an effort to be more efficient.
Historic because it will be in history books as the worst breach of our debt in the history of America.

You stole 1.5 trillion dollars and gave it to the top 1% of Americans. ONLY 2% of americans, including those above - have seen any bonus or raises whatsoever.


Yep you hit the nail in the head, benefits for the big. Oh and side note, for the small.

Benefitting the shareholders and owners while driving the workers further down the food chain.
This  GOP is just as bad as the DEMS. These people are not working in our best interest.
YEA well what about repealing not funding the Health care act that has millions of WE the people paying HUGH monthly payments for little coverage all DUE TO OUR own Govt telling US we have to buy it & has removed the free market!!
Historic

I do not understand the deep state hatred for this great President.  Can anyone explain it?
