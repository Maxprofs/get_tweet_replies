@GOP = Snake Oil Salesmen
Here are the hoops you have to jump through to get weed in Illinois. But at least it's available unlike Wis. http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/medical-cannabis/medical-cannabis-registry-application …
WHY HAVE THE PILL COUNTS OF PATIENTS DISAPPEARED? it would terminate those out there selling their scripts. IT IS THE CLINICS /DR.  RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THIS.  IT'S NOT BEING DONE IN MOST PAIN CLINICS
If we had adequate healthcare, we wouldn't need opioid painkillers to function. It's easier to buy opioids than it is to get real treatment. Thanks, @GOP
Please site your source because that number is a hell of a lot less. Close the borders build the wall you will cut off 80% of the nation's illegal drug supply
Its that simple
Please cite your source.
I ask you first. They made a statement I asked for proof. That's how it works, unless you are a liberal, then you go in the closet and cry.
Protect us by building the wall. So disappointed in gop senators in this area.  Where is the funding?
How about not prescribing them to kids? How about stopping your Pharmafriends from making the $$$$$$ from hooking people on drugs?
And blame only immigrants for the drug.problem. Ignore over-prescribing doctors and corporations who literally act like pushers.

All of you need 2 focus NOW on our messed up & unacceptable Immigration laws. write laws 2 severely limit when & how people come here &what happens when they do. All should be held in centers,no anchor babies,closed borders,only select peo get in,most sent 2 other or own country!
80% of Americans are using heroin because of LOBBYIST AND  IMPROPER GOVT REGULATIONS on pharmacuiticals.
Some of those opioids are coming through the mail from other countries. Maybe parents should have spank their children's ass when they needed it instead of coddling them! Damn laws got too lenient. If you Don't pay for education, you'll pay for their incarceration.
Is this the best you can do about this epidemic? How about chemical dependency treatment? Quality healthcare with quality pain management? #bluewave2018
Trump administration and Republicans are all talk no action. I hear they still have not submitted a plan on how to deal with the opiod problem. AND fund it properly. All BS.
Don’t let your Doctor prescribe unnecessary pain meds in exchange for ‘gifts’ from Big Pharma.
& many that are prescribed opioids could be using medical marijuana for many of the conditions for which those pills are given, & I DARE YOU TO SHOW ME 1 PERSON WHO HAS OVERDOSED & DIED ON MARIJUANA!!!  #legalizeMarijuana

Fund the border wall and Build the Wall! Every overdose is on the heads of the politicians that refuse to secure our border and need to be voted out of office.
We need to invent a pain killer drug that is not addictive.
Perhaps, there should be a patient & physician registry for #opioid use & prescriptions NOT medical #marijuana.

Thank you, to Senators, who have cosponsored S1689 #Marijuana Justice Act https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1689 …
