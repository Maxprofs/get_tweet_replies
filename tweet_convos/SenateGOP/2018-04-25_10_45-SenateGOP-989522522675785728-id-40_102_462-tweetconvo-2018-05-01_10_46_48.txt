All of you need 2 focus NOW on our messed up & unacceptable Immigration laws. write laws 2 severely limit when & how people come here &what happens when they do. All should be held in centers,no anchor babies,closed borders,only select peo get in,most sent 2 other or own country!
#Most of you will be voted out of office when deficit balloons into trillions of dollars & there won’t be money pay for our infrastructure repairs unless you sell the American Soul to Wall Street (private partnership) & saddle small communities w/huge debts for their kids to pay!
Its not a Tax Reform its a Tax Scam!
Im not sure why anybody that is in the low/mid class would vote for Republican! Just look at their policies, they only do what Rich people pay them to do like the Koch Brother, Mercers, Devos families etc. How many of the GOP Members have sold out the U.S. to  Putin/Russia!

I had to pay this year,  did not get the child tax credit.  Can you explain to me the difference between Mr. Cranston and me.  This is some BS.
Over 92% of Americans work for small business.  I am grateful for Tim Scott standing up and fighting for small businesses so we can compete not only locally, but also in the international markets, & grow our economy. When the time is right, Tim Scott has my vote for POTUS.
She will the discussions for Impeachment or 25th Amendment start....after indictments?
That is “when” will discussions for Impeachment etc
Go smoke another doobie.
Well, not a Trumper..but not a DemocratSlaveryParty Apparatchik either.  You?
An Independent thinker! I know Comrade Trumpskis got America on the fast road to Hell
Only morally bankrupt cons can call giving millionaires tax breaks on private yachts and jets and gifting Trump with additional tax breaks on his golf courses.  And that passes as reform in your books?  WOW!
Thank you for being fair.

Why is your voting record against poor families?
Glad you can discuss. Most Americans haven’t realized a dime from this #GOPTaxScam
We know it for what it is... tax cuts for the rich & corporations! Working middle class gets a few $, but other benefits for healthcare, deductions were cut back. @SenatorTimScott voters are not stupid and re you and your party we will #VoteThemOut
Still telling bold faced lies about the tax reform scam that has sent the deficit sky rocketing, eh Tim?
Tim---look at the cash companies are sitting on. Not doing a thing and thanks to the tax cuts they will have more. Markets are down since the cut not up. Makes zero  sense
#GOPTaxScam

Must have all been lies then since the tax cut only benefitted corporations and shareholders. the 99% got screwed, as they always do with morons like you in congress.
Seems like if it was so great, you wouldn’t STILL be having to talk about it trying to get people to think it’s great. They’d be doing it for you...and all I hear is crickets.
Any comment from you on Mulvaney?
Scott 2024!!
Senator Scott, I can see you are sweating to deceive Americans. We are the ones getting the pay checks and we can tell you that we are not getting any benefits. We can also tell u that corporations are getting huge stock buybacks. We also know that u & ur deceived us.
LessonThem..prevaricate much?
Estimate for 2018 shows my SC tax is increasing by a lot, and federal also increasing. So, yeah, thanks?
Wow. Look everyone. Congressmen are actually in DC today.
Good job Senator.
We are not seeing any benefits. But then we aren't rich bankers, CEOs, government contractors, wealthy lobbyists.
#GOPTaxScam
Repealing Dodd Frank act I hope.  It absolutely destroyed my small growing tech. Co. In 2011 the same time my CFO embezzled $1.2M.. at least I'm still alive somehow.
