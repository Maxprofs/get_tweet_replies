My story is I got zip.  Trumps friends took it all.



How many liberal like Kyle Griffin?
Reporter at #MSNBC puts #FakeNews headline on #nytimes story. The 3rd paragraph from the bottom state's this. " I have food stamps but none of the stores are taken them, until they reestablish service.
NYT: Trump admin denied request to let hurricane victims who use food stamps redeem them at fast-food restaurants. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/us/puerto-rico-aid-fema-maria.html …
Hey, @GOP! My name is @WellsFargo. I'm a bank. I agreed to pay $1 BILLION in fines for mtge and car loan FRAUD today! But thanks to a bigger FRAUD, the #GOPTaxScam, the idiot VOTERS will pay for it, cause in the last 2 quarters, I got $6 BILLION from the #GOPTaxScam! TX, SUCKERS!
I didn't get a raise or bonus. IT IS CRUMBS!



The story is that you Trumpublican protest too much. You daily show your dishonesty by lying about your tax scam. Keep it up because your scam is taking you down on Nov. 6!

Republicans took money from working class and gave it to the very rich
I'm middle class and while my taxes did go down, I'll eventually lose my Social Security over it because of the defecit..... THANKS @SenateGOP

Hey! How about that #StolenValor #VoteNoPompeo #Maga
It seems apparent from reliable sources that Mike Pompeo did NOT serve in the first Gulf War, but nearly half of his public bios--including his Wikipedia page--and contemporary write-ups claim he did. Is this something he's been content to leave uncorrected?…
#GOPTaxScam #TaxCutsForTheRich
Every morning that I get up and Donald Trump is still the president I get high. That's my story.
Everyday you lie again.
Okay here is my story & it 99% of the rest of Americans as well. 
Example: Tax Reform gives me now $0.25 more tax savings BUT the Tootsie Roll that used to cost me $1.50 now cost me $2.50. Point is who wins?The 1% Millionaires, Billionaires and Big Corporations!
Wake up America!!
lets see now I pay $960.00 per month for BCBS health insurance and that has increased from $350.00 @ month several years ago and now its an HMO that has been turned down by Dr.s  YOU think the tax savings will cover that for Millions of WE the people / US u know Americans ur Boss










Yay! I can now buy an extra large pizza  instead of a large one, thanks to the tax benefits. Great job helping us little people out!
So HARD to find anyone with a story GOP has to advertise LOL!! #GOPTaxScam
It seems almost daily that some Republican is spouting how great this tax reform is. IT’S ONLY GREAT FOR CORPORATIONS AND TOP 1%. GET OVER IT! Thanks for creating the biggest debt package in history!! Thanks for putting party over country! Thanks for the ongoing corruption! FOOLS
#propaganda
I've tried telling you my story 3 times on this website. Everytime I tell my TRUE story about how my taxes have gone UP as has my Health Insurance, I press submit & get an ERROR message. I guess your website only accepts GOOD stories, not TRUE stories. ALL LIES & PROPAGANDA!
Hi, I'm still making about 20% less than 10 years ago and have 10 years more experiences.  I'm  female so make less than men in the industry.  Funny how male job descriptions justify this. You have done nothing to improve the lives of me and my family.
NON-STOP PROPAGANDA & LIES! Don't believe a word of it. Their CONSTANT plugging, mentioning, cheer-leading should tell you how much of a Middle Class FAILURE this SCAM truly is. HERE is the TRUTH! This SCAM will KILL the Middle Class!
This millionaire revealed his tax return to show just how much the GOP tax law favors the rich 
Deficit ballooning... You own it now.  Bankrupting America  - This is treason!  #TaxScamBill
That xtra $20 a week was a joke. You are a disgrace to America.
Here's a story you should know.  You're a bunch of lying cowards.
The job of Congress is to be a check on a corrupt and incompetent president.  Why is the GOP ignoring that responsibility?  It is the MOST IMPORTANT job they have! You can pass your agenda just as easily with a President Pence.  History will not remember you well.
I see nothing. As a retiree only the threat of my social security and Medicare benefits being cut.
Taxes down!  Like spending for education 
Yeah. Those CEOs and donors are REAL happy, aren’t they?

No improvement in my life. You asses are not going to be able to dig out of this creation you have made.

Your tax CUTS suck and did NOTHING for me.  Maybe you should have directed this question to the extremely wealthy since they are the beneficiaries.  #Traitors
The tax scam is doing nothing for the average American. Why must the corrupt @GOP keep touting this atrocious bill that only benefits the rich while you do nothing about the lying #CRIMINALPresident?
My story is that the #GOP is really trying to sell the tax reform and no one is buying it.  Why did @SenTomCotton state that @TysonFoods was putting $100m back into the economy?  Tyson’s press release didn’t say that.
The tax reform wins continue to stack up for Arkansas. Great to hear @TysonFoods will invest $100 million in bonuses for employees. https://twitter.com/arkbusiness/status/961590457179414528 …
This moderate R is making damn sure my contacts know what they lost in the #GOPTaxScam and what big business won at their expense.
We own a very small business and just gave our guys a raise because of the tax cuts. It's working for us.
stock buybacks abound - the little guy, not so much
Simple, here is my story relating to all working stiffs..the “Trickle Down” scam that Reagan also used..and with identical result.
You made the rich even richer. Congrats. #GOPTaxScam
OK - here is my story:

Didn't get an increase in my pay -- saw a decrease
state and local taxes going up
food prices up
Other commodities going up
utility going up

SO WHERE IS MY BENEFIT FROM YOUR BULLSHIT TAX SCAM FROM THE RICH......

PLEASE EXPLAIN.....
.@SenateGOP many middle class people will receive a moderate "tax break" just long enough for you to attempt to secure 2020, for corporations they're permanent. #GOPTaxScam
Why, it's a waste of time. You won't listen anyway. You only want to hear what you want to hear. Not what the people actually have to say.

FACT: the #GOPTaxScam delivers $1.3 trillion to corporate America. Also a FACT: the #TrumpBudget  cuts Medicare by $500 billion, Medicaid by $1.4 trillion and Social  Security disability by $72 billion. This is how they plan to pay for it —  by obliterating key investments.
Umm.. incorrect again.
#GOPTaxScam sucks
TRAITORS!
