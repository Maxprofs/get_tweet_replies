JUST IN: The U.S. economy added 103,000 jobs in March, falling way short of 185,000 estimate https://www.axios.com/us-job-growth-slowed-in-march-1523017821-abc5ad21-9115-4343-bf03-182ece32955e.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=1100 …
Thanks to Tax Reform our Health Insurance costs have tripled.  MUCH greater than any tax savings ............. so ............. keep your crumbs and get our $$$$ back.
you guys might want to start reading some of the replies to your posts.  And reign in putin jr. On his trade war. He will destroy the economy.
There are around 6 million companies in the United States employing around 114 million people. What are they doing if not in the 500 giving a bonus, pay raise, etc?
lies
Thanks to tax reform, millionaires got a whole lot richer and our debt just went way up!
Technically everyone is making more money. They just happen to also be in our society. If everyone gets an extra 2% of course their share is bigger because they started off bigger. 2% of 50k isn't the same as 2% of 500k. Don't begrudge them for being successful. #straighttalk
Yes I can do math. I get it and I don’t begrudge anyone’s success. What I have a problem with is a poorly written bill that strips away personal exemptions and some deductions while keeping and adding new ones for corporations and some rich. Not everyone is making more.
now... tell me how many companies have laid off workers, have increased health care costs, have closed their doors all together. What?! You don't want to share the horror of your tax plan.
You are the most loathsome Senate GOP in history. Liars, murderers and thieves.
I understand your a bit angry but to call an entire group of people, 95% of which you have never met and couldn't name off the top of your head, liars and thieves and murderers is a bit drastic. I suppose the left are pure and honest folk? #exaggerated #Rude

Thanks to the GOP Tax Scam, there has been 179 billion in share buybacks, no wage increases and higher taxes for the middle class
Lol
Monday is CBO score day. How will gop distract from this one?
I think most people haven't caught on to just how MASSIVE the federal debt projections will be in the CBO's fresh, long-term projections due MONDAY.

Buckle. UP.

And those same companies have announced lay-offs, closings & moving out of the country.

What is this about utility prices?
What difference is that going to make? I have to spend more money thanks to a trade war
Health Insurance Premiums will skyrocket ... massive NET LOSS of $$ Thousands.

Check and see how many of those companies had lay offs after such generosity
They get billions, we get pennies.  Go figure - when you have the same health care and retirement that the rest of us have, then you can talk.
For all of your BS propaganda on the # GOPTaxScam, the facts are that most of the benefits go to the rich!  13% of tax cut savings will go to employee benefits, 43% will go to investors in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.  Plus it adds TRILLIONS to the deficit!
Lies

@HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump 

BLAH BLAH BLAH BULLSHIT!!!
PROPAGANDA!!  Learn the TRUTH America!!!
And the stock market is tanking yet again!
Hallelujah! It is about time”THE AMERICAN PEOPLE” are finally getting some extra Crumbs as Stupid Pelosi has STOLEN from our hard earned tax dollars!The GREEDY EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN! SHE IS A LUNATIC, SHE IS HELPING REPUBLICANS WITH HER IGNORANT COMMENTS ON NAT’L TV “WIN”IN NOV.
I'm thinking you missed a round if your medication.

To bad trump keeps wrecking the market!  Ya great deal pay offs .... I bet trump has also invested when the market goes negative too. Cash in on way up, and also on the way Down.
Budget deficit for March is 300 billion dollars.  Republican fiscal policies???????
Trumpnomics is working keep on negotiating Mr. Trump!
You must be a slime ball too
Keep passing bills. You need indepent voters.

Thanks to you, @realDonaldTrump and his tariffs, whatever money you think people are getting back just goes right back out to higher priced goods. Also, our 401Ks have suffered and will continue to suffer as long as tariff talk continues. I can’t wait till the GOP loses power.
Meanwhile @POTUS is nothing but #Lies #Nepotism #Corruption and #Patronage while you sit by and say nothing. What? Family values don't count anymore? What the #deficit no longer a problem #hypocrites
Bullshit propaganda!
500 companies outbid millions across the country. That’s pathetic and Republicans are proud.
Will you make the middle class tax cuts permanent? What about immigration? Don't think for a minute that you are done or you will be in the mid-terms!
Watching our retirement accounts lose and our state taxes go up. Consumer prices are next to rise. Economists predict recession. #GOPTaxScam #TrumpTradeWar
Thanks to cambridge analytics and russia we are being led by corrupt spineless crooks
It’s the tax giveaway to the top 1%!
list them all..
When do Republicans start draining the swamp? Can’t wait for the blue wave!
Don't be fooled, that paltry sum amounts to nothing.  If you are poor, living paycheck to paycheck, you are still going to be poor and living paycheck to paycheck.
And the democrats are running on reapealing the tax cuts?????
Please provide an aggregate $ amount.
While @realDonaldTrump travels to West Virginia to sell the #GOPTaxScam, the results are clear: corporate executives & wealthy shareholders are feasting on the #GOPTaxScam, and middle-class workers are left behind:
List them.
There is not a thing you can say that will change the fact that the #GOPTaxScam is a massive tax cut for the rich and for corporations.    A few others got crumbs.  And now @SpeakerRyan wants our Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.    STOP LYING AND TELL THE TRUTH.
Now, if we could just get an increase on Social Security.
@realDonaldTrump is saving your behinds - time to support our president whole hard Ed Lynch and stop with the political games @SenateGOP
Democrats NEVER tried to reach out to Republicans when obamacare was passed. Democrats focused on their agenda ONLY & ignored the outcry from the right. 
Republican leadership should push thru immigration reform with the same urgency as tax reform & it will be just as successful.
Congress needs to do its job, support Trump or get lost!
Govern like you won
Get appointments done
Fund the wall
You forgot to mention: they shrink their staff through attrition, most positions don't qualify for 401k, what McDonald's worker has a 401k? - pay "raises' are miniscule, bonuses are 1x payments and the vast majority are only for employees with 20+ years of service... 

The ONLY people getting raises are the Corporate Offercers...STOP lying so much...
Liars! Do nothings. Traitors.
Why do I never hear you addressing this?
Here are all the store closures we know are coming in 2018

Stock markets
#Propaganda
#GOPTaxScam
And closures and layoffs
And $21 trillion in national debt! Enjoy the sugar high everyone, the blue wave is still going to blow your brains out!
#GOPTaxScam is wrong.

Social Security is NOT an entitlement.
You paid into it your entire working life with a promise about what would be waiting for you.
Anything changing that isn't reform, it's stealing.…
You know we still have an Infrastructure rating of D+, right?  It takes a major payout to the wealthy for 500 companies (out of 30 million) to increase wages this once? We all benefit w/better infrastructure.  .0000167% of businesses benefit here.
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/companies-have-doubled-purchases-of-their-own-stock-since-trump-signed-tax-bill.html … Ho, Hum.
It’s all a tiny fraction of the overall “benefit”. #TrickleDownBullshit
Liar, Liar Pants on Fire. 80% of Fortune 500 Companies are iniating Stock Buy Back Plans instead of increasing wages or creating jobs. Those that gave out Bonuses cut jobs to offset them.
still minuscule compared to money going into stock buybacks. Stop pretending you wanted to help common folks.
Stop lying to your constituents.  The majority of benefits are going to CEO's, not the people who do the work that makes the company function.  Companies giving bonuses to everyday workers are also laying off other people to pay for it, while the higher ups pocket the money.
Rofl... It ain't working everywhere. George had better results cutting checks. At least then he knew the people would get the money.
And this.
Social Security is NOT an entitlement.
You paid into it your entire working life with a promise about what would be waiting for you.
Anything changing that isn't reform, it's stealing.…
Blah blah blah...

And a skyrocketing national debt!!  Yippee!!
And middle class families are paying more for everything because of Trump tariffs. Sugar coat it all you want. We are loosing because of GOPTAXSCAM and you know it.
And this
Social Security is NOT an entitlement.
You paid into it your entire working life with a promise about what would be waiting for you.
Anything changing that isn't reform, it's stealing.…
Too bad @POTUS has already erased anything my 401K might have made because he is batshit crazy with his tariffs and fighting with Bezos!  What the HELL are you doing to fix THAT?! @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @JohnCornyn
Record deficit, record debt, record trade deficit. Republicans: Party of fraud & treason, no honor, no shame, no integrity. Liars.
How’s that going for Public Education?
Thank you President Trump !
YOU LIE. HOW IS OUR DEFICIT?
You suppose  business men 5 bankruptcy
