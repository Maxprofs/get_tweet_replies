My story. How about I'm a veteran, I was a journeyman laborer in the union until I had a accident which left me unable to work. Took 7 years of fighting to get my disability then Obama and his healthcare took 100 of that a month to pay for it. Thank God for my pension.

Billionaires & corporations are making out like bandits under the #GOPTaxScam. Since passage of the bill, we've seen $260 BILLION in stock buybacks, and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says by…
Here are 169,070 job layoffs since January 1, 2018, I know this is not all of them but the list keeps growing:
more...
We're using the extra $5 a pay to offset the fact that gas rose from $2.19 to $3.25 this past year.
STOP THE LIES!!!!!
#ByeByeGop2018 #BlueWaveIsComing

Thanks for giving me & my company 83% of the tax cuts.  We can throw our current employees a one time bonus & maybe nobody will notice I’ve gotten even richer.  Raising the deficit $1.5 trillion is ok, I don’t have kids.  Cutting Social Security next is a great GOP plan.  

What are all you guys afraid if? Does world Peace scare you ?
Without my pension I'd starve. What benefit did I get this year? Well after paying  H& R blck $63 I got a refund of $103 so a total of $40 . More than I would get if Hilary would have won. So glad people like her get rich being criminals while we the people suffer
I just purchased a 2018 Baracuda. I am signing the deed for a 6 bedroom,7 bath home in the beach. Renewed my passport cux in June I am going to Europe for 3 months.     righteo!

Special Trump tax provision gives $17 billion break to millionaires, gov't report finds

I don't see any benefits being a senior citizen in fact it costs  me more with all the benefits going to you wealthy people
Why don't you tells us your story. This 2 tiered justice system is bullshit!!! We want the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth! Gag orders that prevent the truth in my opinion are illegal. Redacting documents to protect people, illegal.
Projections from the Congressional Budget office project the deficit to balloon to $1 Trillion by 2020 and adding another $12.4 Trillion to our $21 Trillion national debt over the next 10 years! This will lead to higher interest rates and possible dollar's collapse. Insane!
Tax cuts unjustified when the economy is doing fine. GOP did this just to score political points and give Trump a badly needed win. The measly increase in average workers pay will be offset by the increase in basic living expenses like food & gas, which is already occurring!
Did you know that Trickle Down Economics created the present disparity in wealth distribution within our society? A growing mass of humanity that will soon discover that they will never realize any benefits and be left with only debt.
Liars.  NOTHING ABOUT MASS MURDER AT WAFFLE HOUSE?  NRA told@you to be quiet?
As a reasonable person it’s a fact too much government intervention is bad look at Sweden Germany and Australia even the UK they are ridiculous no one seems to answer ur question I thought I’d like to say thank you
Next to nothing for me...a civil service retiree. Oh yeah and then there's the fact that you and your lunatic President want to cut my pension.
GOP Billionaire's First Tax Scam Great for the Greedy Richman Only!k
You should just rename your party now.  Trump has destroyed the GOP....it's over.  It's something else now and everything good about Republicans was buried with Barbara Bush.   You may as well just call yourself the American Nazi Party.  #RIPGOP
My grandchildren are crying due to the debt you just put on them. shameful
As an Australian, you republicans in the House and Senate can not claim and of the Credit for a Bill that was started by @POTUS and he has had to fight both parties to get America moving, People should vote out all non trump supporters at the next election, is smarter then you.

What Benefit?  Fake News very Bigly.  Sad
I am seeing zero benefits.
What IS the REPUBLICAN party and the Whitehouse doing about CYBER SECURITY????
It’s not really helping us seniors much being on Social Security! We are now paying a lot more for Medicare!!!

Most people blame their failures in life on the rich  I don't. Nor did I benefit from the tax cut. However if i were not retired i would. Keep up the good work
Ask your wealthy friends!
How the Congressional GOP plans to kill the poor & afflicted & rob from the middleclass to feed the greed of their oligarch owners like the Koch Bros. A "tax reform" bill in name only, designed as vicious class war & to throw millions off healthcare.
Healthcare Premiums are on the rise, seemingly w/no cap in sight; employers are still cutting hourse while using the #UnearnedWindfall authorized the the Official #LootingOfAmerica this #FailedCongress conspired w/the #FauxPOTUS to inflice on America to make stock buy backs...
Crumbs and peanuts.  We got crumbs and peanuts.  Most Americans know you passed the scam because the rich paid you to do it. We are wondering why the GOP/NRA is not busy impeaching the WH monster and not investigating the cabinet swamp monsters. Blue Wave.
Benefits????
Here a factual story, officially from the US Congess: About 44 percent of the tax benefit from the deduction will go to those with an income of $1 million or more in 2018, and 52.4 percent of the benefit will go to those with income in that range in 2024.

NONE IM NOT RICH...
Tax cuts? Like paying your bills is a luxury. Hopefully we'll be able to convert it to Rubles, since no one seems to be doing anything about Russia.
#GOPTaxBillScam  is driving our country into deficit faster.  Only your donors benefit.  You are destroying the water, air, and future of out country.  #PartyOverCountry  Total lack of leadership or morals. #ResignMcConnell
Great plan that results in this..
I owe $14,000 more in federal debt.

the effects of the tax reform bill Is helping to reduce the stress from a tight budget which Is also benefiting for your health.
Thanks to the tax cuts and spending plans Congress has passed under President Donald Trump, the U.S. government’s debt 1 is now projected to reach 96.2 percent of gross domestic product by 2028.

The story is that it was a SCAM.
The good news: The tax scam will take the GOP out on 11/6. Bye.
What do you have to say about this?
I’m not seeing any benefit. The air and water are getting dirtier. It’s a complete scam on the backs of the middle class and Epic in the level of ineptitude and failure. #BlueWave2018 #isthisit?


The number of homeowners who will benefit from the mortgage tax break is expected to plummet this year by more than half, according to a congressional report. via @CNBC https://nbcnews.to/2Fb42hP 
It's simple more money in my pocket
Spoken like an uninformed loyalist. You have no facts, let alone a personal anecdote.
