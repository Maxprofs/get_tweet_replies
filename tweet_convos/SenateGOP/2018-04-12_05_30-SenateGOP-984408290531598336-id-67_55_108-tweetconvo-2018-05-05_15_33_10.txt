Another anecdote, .@SenateGOP   But here's the bigger picture. Save US. Do the math! Govern.  #MAGA
And, if this is true, then how many of these "foreigners" are the people who hold the Trump family debt?  INVESTIGATE.  Save US.
Wait didn’t Ohio’s minimum wage just increase due to voted automatic cost of living increases?
“Minimum wage workers are receiving a raise because of inflation. In 2006, Ohio voters approved a Constitutional Amendment stating that the minimum wage would increase annually on Jan. 1 based on the rate of inflation.“
This minimum wage increase drives wage increases across the board to keep employees wages competitive.
Tax cuts for the average American are small, and many will pay more tax next April unless they adjust their W4. Tax cuts for corporations have spurred consolidation rather than hiring and investment. Long-term effect will be more concentration of wealth rather than growth for all
Stop living in GOP/NRA/Putin Puppet fantasy world.  You should get the bill passed to preserve Mueller's job.  1.5 yrs is not enough time for the investigation.   Republikkans gleefully investigated HRC for over 30 years & questioned over 10 hours. #GOPTaxScam #TrumpCrimeFamily
You are frickin’ kidding me!  You people are not worth the space it took to write that.
My pay did not increase. My health insurance has went up $10 /week. So you can respectfully Fuck the Hell off with your Goptaxscam selves.
#GOPTaxBillScam 14% tax cut to corporations, Velvet Ice Cream included, a measly $1/hr raise for working American families.
Keep lying and bragging about the tax injusted you voted for, @GOP.
I love ice cream!  Let’s keep the good news coming by urging @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen to release the H2b visas that have already been approved!  You will be saving American jobs! #saveourseason

Your so-called tax relief, coupled with your out-of-control spending bill, is causing inflation that will more than gobble up any meager pay increases. A total screw-up.
Some small ice cream maker in Ohio. Wowee!
I'm in office in Houston call the Godly intelligence agency and get the information you need why are you all the shutdown
The ice cream is melted!
I didn't know that the top 1% rich scoop out ice cream. They are the only ones who got richer due to the @GOP tax scam
Really? 125 full time workers got less than $45 a week & you are slap along yourselves on the back. GFY
Sheesh, at least Marie Antoinette thought people should get cake

I guess the crumbs Pelosi refers to have grown into loaves of bread.
Great joke. Irony.
Why don't you distance yourself for the GOP  run comeylying site (URL) and state on the record that you believe Comey is telling the truth. #TrumpCrimeFamily  #GOPTaxScam

Garbage. https://bit.ly/2qqR3Ux  #BlueWave2018

Whoa boy - Phil Mudd weighs in on Hannity's show last night: 

"You got that dirt bag telling me that one of the most…
Thank you President Trump!!!!!
Local  tax  go up 50 cent for dollars  can't buy  ice cream  jobless
Dem wepubwicans need ice cweem, dem scared of mean old Twumpy wumpy!!!!!!!!
Your headed for a Constitutional crisis but keep tweeting lies about the tax cuts.
OMG, how desperate are you TRUMPUBLICANS to resort to this? Time to wake up. We know it was a TAX SCAM. How about speaking out about a disastrous president you keep trying to prop up? The GOP is going down. Why not at least try and save yourselves?
$10/hr doesn't support a family. Managers make $13-14/hr, a bit better, but only if you're single.
That scoop of ice cream cost 1 trillion dollars we don't have to spend.

And how many have closed their doors!?
It’s probably thanks to “finally paying a living wage”
Do you really think we’re stupid?   The #GOPTaxScam is a massive giveaway to the rich.   And as @SpeakerRyan said on TV this morning, the GOP is fully committed to taking our Medicare, Medicaid,and Social Security as their first opportunity.  Just admit what you’re doing.
#CorkerKickback Tax loop holes for self employed, property investors cuts revenue from US gives it back to the wealthiest.  
#MarchForOurLives Children will have to pay GOP cash advances  
BUDGET OFFICE 3 days ago 1TRILLION DEBT that grows yearly 2028 $33 TRILLION
You’re gasping here. Americans know you’re bankrupting the country with your #GOPTaxBillScam
Nah. The really good news is so many deceitful republican office holders  see the writing on the wall and how you all made yourselves unelectable in the next elections. #bluewave #Fired
Ask Toys Rus
Lying gop gave tax cuts to donors and only hope businesses pass iron.   Very little do.  Fake tax scam adds 1 trillion to debt so gop now runs and hides!  GOP gone in November!
$21 TRILLION in debt. And yet, we are happy about ice cream? Complete lack of vision for our country, so let’s double down. This is conservative politics gone mad. Then again, liberal politics is equally maddening. Statesmanship is the key.
But not for the hundreds of workers at Carpetright who is shutting down 92 outlets. You clowns are a waste.

Do you idiots think this detracts from the impending tariff war, potential war in Syria or the fact that the gop is rubber stamping everyone to continue to raid the middleclass.
Which employees? This must make the 107th company to increase the wages of its employees. Only 10 million companies to go. Yay!
#TaxScamBill 
You all should be ashamed of what you did.
Big, Beautiful, Blue Wave will be coming your way soon to wipe out your very corrupted party...and YOU ALL DESERVE IT!
#GOPCriminalEnterprise
Good News Mass amounts of Republicans are retiring.....No more morals, no backbone, just running away from the life time they have built....Here is why...What you all knew before that vote, and voted Trump anyhow....
And getting lifetime pay and benefits that we have to pay for!
Did you know that many companies increase wages, many times regardless of tax changes? Some people refer to this as "capitalism"
How many employers/corporations have instead taken their #UnearnedWindfall to buy back stocks, increase dividends & ignore workers?  Unless/until you speak openly to THIS issue, your pandering for approval remains pitifully sad...
#WeThePeople are coming for you in November...
#Crumbs
It’s worse than “Let them eat cake.”
How is the orgy of spending and debt going?  The Rep legacy.
I thought Trump liked two scoops?
Nah, he eats the entire tub.
