My father @SenJohnMcCain is in stable condition - he continues to inspire me everyday with his intense grit and determination. Thank you to the doctors at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and to everyone who is praying for him.
I hope he got that surgery at a VA hospital because it's free for vets....I hope he did spend tax payers money on a specialist...
How about the majority of hard-working Americans who got NOTHING from the GOP Tax Scam?

Are your hearts with them as well?
He’s a disgrace.
Put politics aside for one minute.  A Christian should always pray for the sick and weary.  Praying for comfort, strength & healing for @SenJohnMcCain, In Jesus’ name. Amen 
Your GOP President mocks and disparages him whenever he gets the opportunity....Who are we to believe?
Seriously? Meh...
Oh how nice of you to support him now how come you didn't support him when Trump was attacking him saying he didn't like guys that were captured?
Meghan I am sorry for many of the remarks that people direct towards you. I disagree with your father politically but I am praying for his health and recovery from this and cancer. My younger sister is suffering from the same cancer and it is devastating. May God Bless & heal  BB

Is James @Comey a patriot or criminal?
At what point does the guy just admit he isn't physically capable of doing the job and hangs it up?
