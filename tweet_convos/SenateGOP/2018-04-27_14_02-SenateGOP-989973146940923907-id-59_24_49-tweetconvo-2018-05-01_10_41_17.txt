Time to man up & make law to close asylum loopholes. #Caravan advertised their invasion like it was a party. Economic migrants transported in buses, fed, sheltered & given legal counseling throughout Mexico yet they won't apply for asylum there. #BuildTheWall #NoAsylum
I noticed that the measure to protect the special council passed out of committee...so @SenateMajLdr when is the floor vote? #ProtectMueller
I'll give you a review.  Tax cuts for the rich and a huge DEFICIT for the poor.

All we need is 51 votes to approve our Judges.
