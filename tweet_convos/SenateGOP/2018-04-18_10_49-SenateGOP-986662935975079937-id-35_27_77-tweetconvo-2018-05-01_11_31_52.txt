.@NFIB_OH member GKM Auto Parts was forced to drop coverage under Obamacare. Owner Kelly Moore: “Because of the cost savings from tax reform, we are reinstating this important benefit for our employees.” https://on.nfib.com/2vuBPmz  #TaxDay 
Thank you for tax reform!  Please start on welfare reform next.
How many Fortune 500's have passed savings on to employees and how many have used it to buy back stock and pay investor dividends? Thanks to #GOPTaxScam
That's not quite the whole story.  Let's be fair.
A lot of companies are using the $ they save from the #TaxScam to invest in new automation, increasing productivity, while reducing costs by eliminating...
Oh, wait.
So the tax payers are paying for GKM Auto Parts Insurance.   If we’re going to pay for other people’s insurance anyway, why not Medicare for everyone.    #GOPTaxScam
Only a Liberal would dare to assume another person’s hard earned money should have been given to them instead.
I’m a lifelong Republican who does not like a tax bill that puts the country trillions in debt to give massive tax cuts to the rich and then declare their next step it to gut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to pay for those tax cuts.  My money is hard earned too.
Exactly what kind of coverage is being offered?

I have a very hard time believing it is good.

Simply a false meme.
Great.  Now FUND THE BORDER WALL!!!!!
It's more complicated then this, and this so-called benefit will disappear when you least expect it.


Republicans had a bad #TaxDay
Americans just aren’t buying what they’re selling. #GOPTaxScam 
Yeah right.  More GOP fake news. I'm sure there's a catch to this. Probably paid for with middle class tax money while rich got a windfall.  #VoteThemOut
Garbage & lies! #GOPTaxScam just saddles us with trillions in debt to pay for massive tax cuts for billionaires.  98% of workers get nothing. Brought to you by the party of wife beaters, traitors, school shooters & pedophiles. #RIPGOP
Huh? a bunch of crap like the GOP
If the senate wants trust get some backbone and regain the Republican Party that once was! A bunch of Trump drones not willing to do what is right for the people and more concerned about their political future!
How? Coverage has gone up in a year. 
And you want to repeal Obamacare and put nothing in its place
When you realize you've really pissed off a lot of people, and you want to back out but don't want to look weak.
...
#TaxScam to the rescue.
STALE Tax propaganda.
It doesn't say what type of coverage they have. I'd be interested to know the details.

Businesses have to offer better benefits to keep employees due to worker shortages. That’s the true. ACA meant cheaper premiums too. Under Republicans, they’re much higher. #GOPTaxScam
Gee, thanks. Everyone hates you.
