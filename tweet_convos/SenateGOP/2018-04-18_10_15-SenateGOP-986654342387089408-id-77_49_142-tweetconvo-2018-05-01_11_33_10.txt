Bullshit
Out of the $2 trillion that Conservative Republicans are stealing from America’s future, only $300-$400 billion will be spent to enrich Americans. Where is the other $1600-$1700 billion going to? This is a gigantic grand theft that Conservatives keep trying to justify!
1/Funny... this tweet conveniently omits the other thing Kroger’s board of directors approved for the use of their newfound“tax cut” wealth...an 1 billion dollar incremental stock buyback...Now, I’m certainly not a mathematician, complicated by a lack of $ values provided here...
2/But my handy little calculator assures me that even all 11,000 of these new employees are given 35/week, all 52 weeks a year, @20.00/hour, the grand total = a 400,400,000 mil investment (& it’s almost unimaginable to think my wage & hour predictions<the real figures)leaving...
3/ $999,599,600,000 they’d need to “invest” increasing employee education & enhancing 401Ks. And “increasing an employee discount program” literally no corporation is going to discount prices to the point of loss. At best, they’ll lower them to break even. And the insidious thing
4/is that the steeper the “discounts” offered to employees, the greater the increase to both the likelihood and $ figure of employee wages which end up merely returned to the company - employment income they pay taxes on. Btw, discount’ll be applied pre-sales tax; to a subtotal.
5/ I might’ve always been more successful in history and English classes, but I know enough to know when #somethingisrotteninthestateofMath
NOT THE ONE I WORK  FOR, THEY BELIEVE IN BUYING EXPENSIVE VEHICLES FOR A STATUS SYMBOL AND NOT FIXING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
hey thanks to a poll recently we know over 60% of Americans not happy with tax scam bill
Keep the Democrats out if you want a successful America!!
But Not paying a LIVING WAGE
Don't buy what the GOP is trying to sell you.  Know the facts.  Facts matter.
GTFOH I WANT THE SAME TAX CUT YOU ALL GAVE YOUR BUDDIES AND LOBBYIST.... HOW ABOUT THAT...DAMNCROOKS
Why are you not talking about the corporations who lied to Americans.  Corporations that bought their stock back instead of distributing the wealth to their employees.   GOP screwed working Americans.  Took away deductions to pay for tax cut to wealthy.  #impeachGOP
Please. From 5/16/16 paper: "Kroger officials say it's all part of a long-range plan to keep increasing the investment in their stores."  No tax cut then and @BarackObama was POTUS.
Bullshit
Again stop trying to hype this as a win for the average American, most of the money this brings in funnels up with most of us getting crumbs
What a load of crap.  Lying about what this is doing does not make it so.
Great news for Kroger employees! Now what are you doing to help me as a retiree recoup what @realDonaldTrump has done to my 401K with his frivolous tweets?

Under Trump, US jobs are moving overseas even faster than before https://qz.com/1144201  via @qz
GOP tax message hits a snag
All those jobs are paying LESS than what is needed to have a FAMILY HUGE LOSS YESTERDAY FROM WHAT I GOT LAST YEAR!!!!!
GOP tax cuts have gotten less popular with voters, new NBC/WSJ poll says
The Trump Tax Cuts’ Unpopularity Is a Crisis for The GOP http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/the-trump-tax-cuts-unpopularity-is-a-crisis-for-the-gop.html?utm_source=tw&utm_medium=s3&utm_campaign=sharebutton-t … via @intelligencer
Majority of Americans don’t see Trump tax cuts in paychecks



If the senate wants trust get some backbone and regain the Republican Party that once was! A bunch of Trump drones not willing to do what is right for the people and more concerned about their political future!
LIES
Republicans had a bad #TaxDay
Americans just aren’t buying what they’re selling. #GOPTaxScam 

This is the latest wave of Kroger hiring 22,000 employees in the past 2 years. The new tax plan does not seem to be the stimulus for the move so while you're at it, you might as well take credit for the employees they hired last year as well.
Liars! Stores are closing and going bankrupt "Toys R Us", Upping monies avaliable thru loan shark banks does not help, Wow uping 401K participation while wages stagnate and prices go up does not help. Expanding what to who?
Keep trying but smart people know you tax bill was a SCAM & added $1.5 trillion to the deficit. Check the polls. GOP is going to sink on 11/6/18. These lies aren't helping.

What tax cuts
America is back !!! Thank you
Those are middle class jobs!
Bs
WTF are you talking about? These are all employee benefits to keep them from leaving. Call BS once again on your taxscam add to deficit help the 1% tax cut bill. Vote GOP out 2018 2020 2022 once ppl file their 2018 taxes and realize how much you've screwed them. @DavidJollyFL
 Cherry-picking. #ToysRUs closed ALL stores. 30,000 jobs LOST. And Mattel & Hasbro are left w a black hole for their products! 
Kroger has always been a socially conscious company treating it's employees well. Long before your Gop tax scam. How about the other 29 million companies in the US. How about the 300 billion dollar budget deficit ?????
Planned Parenthood is dishing out $30 million on the midterm elections.

If they have that kind of spare cash, why the hell are we the taxpayers subsidizing them?

Taking federal funding & using it towards funding elections should be highly illegal.
One of the reasons I bought stock a couple of days ago.

These are things Kroger had already planned to do. Worker shortages do that. #GOPTaxScam
I can't believe these idiots still think repeating their #TaxCutsandJobsAct scam over and over will make us believe it wasn't actually a hand out to the rich the rest of us will be paying for forever. Those rats are leaving their sinking ship daily.
Who is going to down the debt?
Yes, Kroger my personal grocery store! Often rated worst place to work in America! May now make number two on that list, but will always be number two in the eyes of America!


How much money did big corporations save? How many companies did our #potus make “filthy rich”? How much money will he removed from schools, roads, public works, and social security? We have millions of Americans but you are talking about less than 1% of jobs with 11k. #nothanks


Here's news!! Your president is a con man and you have been conned
Impeachment. What is the delay? What MORE do you need?
Everything's good but the increased education spending we need to get the government out of that that's why things are going out of control with cost

Biggest news...GOP is only interested in the rich and approves of a President who lies and lack ethics. Don't worry America will fix this. #VoteThemOut
#BlueWave2018
But....what about the 13,000,000 who will lose their healthcare, the  $1.5 TRILLION added to the deficit?WHo will pay for that? Mexico?
How are 13mm losing their healthcare?

Kroger is noted for paying their employees practically nothing.    They make Walmart look generous.
If anyone believes that a business hires anyone except as a last resort they are crazy - payroll expense is never added to unless it's necessary to do business - no one hires people because they have more money sitting around
...and even better?  #WeThePeople are continuing to gather #BlueWave momentum with which we intend to take #CorrectiveMeasure to repair this #FailedCongress' treacherous actions this past year!  Dust off your resumes, gang, we're taking you down in the November polls...
