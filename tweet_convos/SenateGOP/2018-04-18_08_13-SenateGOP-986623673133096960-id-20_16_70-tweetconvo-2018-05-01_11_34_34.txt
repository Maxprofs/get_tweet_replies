You wake up early every day to comb your hair and pick out the brightest shirt/tie combo with your strongest pinstripe suit thinking this is going to be the year.. then this happens.

The @GOP #complicity is an outrage...

@GOP White House #BrawndosGotWhatPlantsCrave
Keep crying
Keep embarrassing our country
What's funny and sad thing is the fact that u think Clinton wouldn't have been embarrassing to America...
No, I did. And that is exactly why I didn't vote for either one of them. 2016 was an embarrassment, but at least I din't choose party over country.
If you think this is an outrage, I can't imagine what you think about Trump and those who continually support him.


From Iran to Russia to his Islamophobic remarks, Mike Pompeo was tied up in knots during his confirmation hearings to be secretary of state https://thebea.st/2qGbpbO 

Corker: Any GOP senator who doesn't have concerns about Trump is either comatose or blind http://hill.cm/GZx1Vlo  
I'm not pulling for you. You passed a #TaxScamBill and you continue to support and enable @realDonaldTrump 

You are #Traitors
Why don’t you worry about Russian sanctions, blackout in PR or your total inability to govern
Ha, your party pulls for Putin. #GOLiarsAndCrooks

how many #GOP owe the #RUSSIANS? Mitch McConnell's super PAC took $1M  in 2017 from #Russian born billionaire who made a large portion of his money under Putin in Russia. He's taken $2.5 million in total from the same Russian. #DitchMitch #ProtectMueller
This is so funny you guys.
#AmericanCitizens feel much the same having watched this #FailedCongress repeatedly choose to elevate Corporations above the #Voters time and time and time again...
#ChampagneProblems, guys.
