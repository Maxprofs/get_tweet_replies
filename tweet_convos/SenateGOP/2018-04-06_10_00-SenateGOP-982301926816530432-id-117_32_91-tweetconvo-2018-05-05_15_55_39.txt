Here's another trend... besides facsim: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/07/number-republicans-quitting-congress-hits-44-year-high-amid/ … #GoodbyeGOP #BlueWave2018
LOCK HIM UP!
LOCK HIM UP!
LOCK HIM UP!



And when it doesn't happen REPUBLICANS BE LIKE.....
We'll see....
I have not seen or experienced an increase in wage growth. Just an increase in prices and decrease in my stock portfolio thanks to @realDonaldTrump

We see how GOP members are spending taxpayers’ money!
Really?! More GOP PROPAGANDA!!!!! Listen up Americans! Don't fall for these LIES! The tax cut SCAM is all the GOP has. So they are pushing their NON-STOP PROPAGANDA hoping Americans eventually will believe it!  DON"T FALL FOR IT! This SCAM is disastrous for the Middle Class!!

BEST DEAL WITH IT
Just don’t sit back now!  Strong Border Control and completely fund the wall without strings!  Get rid of loopholes and catch and release!
Don’t rest on your laurels!  Work twice as hard and get Strong Border Control and put filibusters to one hour only and nuclear option!  Tell Graham and Flake to give President Trump a fully funded wall with no strings to protect this Country and the people who voted for you!
Lies from liars
The trend is actually rich, old, white, congressmen and their friends are getting richer. FYI.

There won’t be a trend in wages if you allow Trump to tank the stock market with a Trade War. If wages increase its because the work force pool is decreasing. Be honest. Educate the public. Stop misleading us.

LOCK HIM UP!
LOCK HIM UP!
LOCK HIM UP!
Yes the 2020 economic crash
Sorry losers. Your tax scam is coming to light and the blue wave is coming. Maybe be more USA friendly and stop pacifying Russia
There's a better trend underway. The trend to oust Trumpublicans who remain silent while your leader trashes the USA. Not to mention the tax scam you perpetrated on the people. 11/6 and bye.
The Tax Reform bill is a continuation of the crushing of the middle class.
SHAME on the Republicans!
Expect the beginning of a depression if @POTUS is allowed to wage war with China over tariffs and relaxing the banking regulations.#crook
You need to do whatever it takes to get @POTUS appointments approved. It’s a joke Ambassadors are waiting.
Seriously?  Maybe when he appoints people worthwhile rather than synchophantic, unqualified stooges


We the share holders are giving these big beautiful companies money to increase wages and get low interest for buyimg their bonds. You are sure socking it to the older generation that have paid for these beautiful young people to produce revenue for the gov. and the corporations.
Somehow share holders and bondowners are not getting an equitable piece of the   American dream. What a raquet. One can only hope there is a God and these devious bandits will go to Hell sooner rather than later. Amen.
Wage growth???? Look at the stock market. Wake up and do something.
This is fake news.
Wage growth regardless of reason always creates inflation. I'm not complaining, just remembering what we have always seen before. Low unemployment starts workers on a job-hopping spree, causes increased wholesale & retail prices to maintain profit margins + competition f/workers.
Job numbers well below expected. Job gains for January and February were revised down also, and that's after giving the rich billions in tax cuts we didn't have. Now the US is broke and has to borrow from foreign interests. Only your gullible followers will think it's all good.
"...and when it doesn't, well, we're not here to talk about the past." - @SenateGOP
So sad GOP and trump think hardworking Americans are stupid
GOP is crazy if they think tax cuts helped everyone. Did nothing for senior citizens, but many don’t know because they do complete their taxes themselves. Next year, they will find out it all went to wealthy and corporations who pay ZERO in federal income taxes.
Either you don't understand how things work, or you are lying to your constituents.
They know.  They are lying hypocrites.
I know they do, but they need to be called on it as often as possible.  There are people who actually believe the crap they are trying to sell them.
Thx Mr President. All the 30yr politicians have no idea what's going on w our economy?
Is this trend including the falling stock market?
We don’t give AF about that!
SECURE OUR BORDERS!!!!!!!!!
JUST REPORTED!: Job growth LOWEST in 6 months! Stock Market DOWN! Unemployment stagnate! 5 major retailers have closed 419 major stores nation wide putting THOUSANDS out of work! Bank of America has HIKED their fees! Shall I continue?  It is ALL bullshit and LIES from the GOP!

That’s great news, but to be clear that trend is mostly because 18 states voted in last years elections to increase thier minimum wage.
_and those unemployment and jobs trends, according to the Bureau of Labor:
Trends were Obamas ... Just keeping it real.

In other words, keep the faith because you have not done Jack for me yet.
My 80 year old mother lives on a fixed income and her taxes went up by $500.00. Thanks GOP! #impeach45 #ImpeachTrumpPence #impeachment #ImpeachmentIsComing
I expect the market to crash
How long till this trickel down reaches the teachers?
• Beijing  is trying to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the American political system. Our correspondent there explains why China is confident it would win a trade war...........      I don’t think a trade war will help American workers. 
What trend.? We working scum only get the small tax break for a few years. Corporations get ENORMOUS PERMANENT CUTS! And they are using most of it to buy back stock, pay stock holders, and bank the rest,
Believe it when I see it.
The ONLY trend you need be concerned over is the one leading #WeThePeople to the November polls...
...expect there to be some “pain” due to tRump’s trade war with China #TrumpTradeWar #MoronInChief #GOPComplicit



Fakes and frauds still pushing garbage when they paid donors and rich!  GOP gone in November!
Trump is a fraud.
I am glad I have been smart enough not to have held my breath on this or any other @realDonaldTrump empty promise; full of hot air, just like he is and has always been.  Not to mention 'incompetent'!
Unless your Elderly, Disabled,or a VET..we DON'T matter to ANYONE..especially to this ADMINISTRATION..if we did they wouldn't try to kill us
man you guys a out of touch.
Not for farmers or manufactures of farm equip who live in red states. Or universities in those states. #soybeans #TradeWar @FarmBureau @JohnDeere
Right. So when the Dems kick the Republicans out, and finally raise minimum wage, I will expect that to be the start of a trend. A very good one. #Resist #BlueWave
Not with the coming Trump Recession.
You better all do what Democrats are doing. Work like a wolf pact.
Reality is not good for @GOP .   This....
Job growth slowed in March. What does that mean for the economy? @DanielBush reports. https://to.pbs.org/2qcysuy 
Unless you are a farmer...
When are you going to address the job #'s hypocrites? You gave our tax paying dollars to the rich and corporate America, gave poor and middle-class pennies. Remember @PRyan  a 1.50 extra enough to pay costco membership fees, crazy.
The #GOPTaxScam has NOTHING to do with wage growth, if it actually exists.  

You passed a bill that adds to the deficit and primarily helps the rich & corporations.
get rid of the rhinos
Where's the wall?
You’ve been saying that since 1980!
