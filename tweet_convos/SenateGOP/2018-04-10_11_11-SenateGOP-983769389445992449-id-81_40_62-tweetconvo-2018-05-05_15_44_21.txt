Cory Gardner is Bon paid for by the Koch brothers. He's the next poster boy they're going to try and put up to run for president. This is not an individual you can trust
We now know the Koch Brothers are Democrat supporters
What zone are you watching? Wisconsin knows for a fact who’s in the Koch brother’s pocket...
#GOPTaxScam  @SenMajLdr whining about stalls on appointments; left SCOTUS seat EMPTY refusing to act on a moderate nominee. 
Their is no such thing as a moderate! They are Democrats trying to fool people into thinking they are better than Republicans and Democrats. They will vote with Democrats! Democrats are the babies that have to have their way,  disregard the Constitution and break laws for power!
Calm down. What we need are calm, reasonable people. Garland was known as a Centrist; such people exist. People who can see merit in more than one point of view. Life is gray. SCOTUS is supposed to be nonpartisan anyway.
Falsely accusing me of not being calm tells me you want to control the narrative! Nice try!
Usually calm indicates rational self-control. God’s Peace be with you. ~ yes, I’m a Christian.
@realDonaldTrump is doing a great job. Deep state needs to go away.

This sounds like political propaganda to help RandPaul divide the Republican party.

The GOP complain now but where were they when they were obstructing everything that Obama tried to do and they are trying to take credit for what Obama's time has done for our country now
GOP = Money wh0res!
@HouseGOP 
@CNN 
@FoxNews
Start throwing Democrats in jail for their crimes
#TaxScam
@realDonaldTrump has fought for us & it’s time we fight for him. Call the DOJ & demand Sessions & Rosenstein resign. The @GOP won’t help him & it’s up to us!
Trump assigne both Sessions & Rosenstein...
So what?
Ditch Mitch

It helps if you know the law.  Attorney -client privilege does not apply in cases of criminal fraud.  It never has.  Since the 1700's.
except when Hillarys aid is being investigated and is granted attorney -client privilege and allowed to sit in the interrogation regarding the very crime she's being investigated regarding!  
Vote GOP into a corner...
1. Grow some balls.
2. Repeal the filibuster.
3. Get shit done.
PROTECT MUELLER.  Support this process.
Repeal the Windfall Act
Let’s talk about WHY won’t the Senate and @HouseGOP won’t pass bi-partisan legislation to protect Robt. Mueller and Rod Rosenstein? WHAT are you afraid of? The truth?
In about 24 hrs the gop will have turned a blind eye to the rape of the constitution and the  rule of law, telling the American people where they can go. When Trump removes Asst Ag or special counsel the criminally negligent gop needs to step up!
There are no comments of support for Trump because they are quietly watching him sink.
Liars
Your all an embarrassment to this nation! The Republican party has let this country down. Treasonous Trump should have been Impeached months ago. Pence along with him. Pence just sat there and listened to Trump's paranoid rants instead of focusing on Syria!!!!!!!!!!! F You all!!!
All good. Now speak to your members who are anti-Trump and tell them that WE the American people elected him and want to see FULL support UNITED behind him!
@SenateMajLdr  and every single @SenateGOP  owe us an answer to the hypothetical question. This was a cop out and McConnell should be ashamed.
All these snowflakes post there garbage will all soon be yellow snow.
This would be a good time for POTUS to resign before he begins facing criminal charges
I believe that the horse is out of the barn now and regardless of resignation or impeachment, Trump will end up with serious charges.
McConnell is SLOW WALKING ALL THINGS TRUMP  GOP time to tell him to RESIGN.

You wish!
Someone should have asked @SenateMajLdr and the @SenateGOP when they start doing their job.
Leadership? Ha! It’s More like #GOP pillage and plunder America! #GreedyOldPricks

GOP leadership is an oxymoron...
IMPEACH!!
Cowardly and complicit...get your moving boxes ready.
WHERE’S MY WALL!!!!!
Mueller didn’t raid Cohen’s office. Judges approved that raid for another prosecutor. Stop listening to #LiarTrump and right wing propaganda, and get the facts.
Remember when Obama using the acronym "ISIL" caused conspiratorial lunacy. What about McConnell?
Screw McConnell. ..Barroso and company
@SenCoryGardnerWhen was your town halls in No Colorado? Denver?
Quit briefing and do something about the liars in charge....disgusting....you are all to blame!
Look at these people pretend to care about foreigners, but at the same time not want asylum refugees fearing death to come here. How convenient.

Devastating video of a Syrian Soldier saying goodbye to his family.
He was filmed by the "rebels" before they beheaded him.
US, UK, Saudi and France might strike Syria within…
They never sound like they know what is going on.
What are they briefing the press on? How they're distracting everyone from the President's crimes?
#TrumpCrimeFamily
are these complicit tools going to #ProtectMueller
All thanks to @POTUS @realDonaldTrump AND the MAJORITY of AMERICANS WHO TURNED OUT IN 2016 TO VOTE FOR POTUS! Keep your hands off our First and Second Amendments, END the FILIBUSTER, ENACT TERM LIMITS and OFFICE LIMITS! END K Street & Soros corruption of Capitol Hill! NO DACA!
Just get it done already and stop dragging your feet!

Leadership? Good one
No thanks. All talk. Support President Trump and do your jobs or we’ll find people who will.
Keep telling them that. Their blind support for Trump is what's going to power the Blue Wave in November.
About what, how they’re working as hard as they can behind the scenes to undermine our President? I’m staying home this Nov. Fuq ‘em, fuq ‘em all.
2.5 Million Dollars  From Putin? #followthemoney
That’s bullshit!
That’s true.

Where are the Republicans? #ProtectMueller
