Barbara Bush to focus on comfort care, will not seek additional medical treatment for ‘failing health,’ family spokesman says https://fxn.ws/2HpBNkh

DON'T DO IT! Did she consult w you before having a baby? NO

Tell her to take 3 months off! NO babies on the Floor!

This is just WRONG!
She hopes not to live to be incarcerated
Um I'm a hard core progressive, my  dad calls me "pinko" (as a joke), and I cannot think of one thing Barbara Bush has done to even suggest she should be imprisoned.
God Bless you, Ma’am!
Thoughts and prayers for the Republican Party she can surely no longer recognize.
She always acted with class & strength. Prayers are for you Madam First Lady Barbara Bush & President George Herbert Walker Bush 
And may your thoughts & prayers do as much for her as they do for the victims of any of the numerous mass shootings you approach this way.
Hoping she gets a miracle, wonderful lady. As for you GOP, I thought “thoughts and prayers” were your corrective action reserved for mass shooting victims.?
@FoxNews prayers for a wonderful first lady.
Such a good hearted wife, mother, and grandmother who was the best First Lady along with Laura Bush.

Our thoughts and prayers are with you! You were a great women to look up to. Thank you!
So sad.
Amazing woman!
God bless Mrs. Bush!
The classless LEADER of your party is too occupied with name calling and his latest poll to send blessings to Barbara Bush.  What have you done???  #UnfitToBePresident
I’m so saddened by this news. She’s a fine woman.
God Bless you Mrs. Bush. America loves you.
A grand lady. Safe journey home.
Look up prayer of release if any of my Republicans attend funerals.  FYI
Great lady the kind you would want your daughter to be like!  May God Bless her in this her latest illness!
She has always been a classy lady

God's blessings on the Bush family and Barbara.

Surprised this didn't get shared more at the time. Maybe because back then so many thought he would inevitably lose and disappear. Barbara Bush unfiltered on Trump. "I don't know how women can vote" for him, she says. 
Prayers for First Lady and family. 
God bless her
Wondering if Donald Trump is going to send out a another crude tweet?
An Iconic #FirstLady who has inspired countless lives. #BarbaraBush
