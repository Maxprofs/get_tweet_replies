We're retired so it's not working for us. Republicans just want to kill us off with cuts in SS and Medicare.
Ure right and that pisses me off. Most of them couldn't do REAL work
Yet again your spreading NOTHING but LIES...Shame on YOU and @realDonaldTrump @VP and @SpeakerRyan just Shameful...
You’re joking, right?
Lol fake news
Why do you need to Tweet the praises of your Trumpublican tax scam daily? We know it was a scam. 11/6.

I got $15.00 a week!!!
The gross US debt is $20.2 trillion, up from $9.0 trillion a decade ago. That's 105 % of GDP, up from 46% when Bill Clinton left office. To service said debt costs $276.2 billion this fiscal year. The @gop #taxscam will increase debt additional 1.7 trillion in lost revenue.
Sure - Bigger Donations to @HouseDemocrats and @SenateDems to kick you out of Office for blindly turning away from @realDonaldTrump crimes and abuse of power. Special Thanks to #TheWisconsinWanker @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr for not protecting the Sanctity of the Presidency.
It isn't! I'm not in the 1%
You must be kidding. You're asking about something that's voted on and done. Why aren't you more concerned about a President who lies and attacks companies and takes his orders from Fox and you've don't nothing on immigration or gun control. Let's not pretend you care.
IMPEACH
Better than before. Lets fix immigration now and get rid of the root of many problems around funding
It’s not working when the EPA chief is giving out 56,000 and 28,000 pay raises. The American Taxpayers would like that kind of raise too.
I live in western pa no good stories here tax good for rich and corporations can’t wait for midterm elections to vote as many as possible out ...drain the swamp
How can it work the cabinet keeps  giving outlandish pay raises to their staffs ask Mulvaney and Pruitt  ...drain the swamp give average joe America a break
I call BS!
For myself I haven’t seen any raise nor bonus nothing. I have no clue on what you guys are trying to sell me. So is the Shrinking middle class, I will definitely be voting blue!
You guys need to do even better! 
Reduce spending, shrink social services and give it back to the working class.
being on disabitly  i dont get shit becuse congress dont care about people on social security or disabitly ..
Not many in the middle class or poor are seeing but cuts what they do see is the prices are going up across the board at about 14%
My son received a bonus from Lab Corp.
How much have you seen???

It’s not. The nonprofit sector is going to see layoffs. #GOPTaxBillScam
'i'll tell you, if you tell me how the RICH receive a huge tax break...
Bigger and bigger government. $21TRILLION in debt.  Trade war about to drive prices even higher on even the most basic of necessities. Things are looking up. So much so we need to militarize our Southern border. Interesting vision from so-called Conservatives.
It's not working, where the heck is the extra money and who did it go to?
My story- extra $40 going to ACLU Planned Parenthood and Democratic candidates.
#SCAM
More GOP PROPSAGANDA and LIES!  Beware America! The ENTIRE admin are LIARS! Do your own research and discover the TRUTH!!!!!!
#GOPTAXSCAM
Lies
Call it what it is...

#TrumpTaxScam
I submitted my story of not getting any appreciable raise and maintaining that this whole thing is a massive scam and y’all only win since sweeping the election, so you are doing everything you can to gaslight us into believing it’s anything but a massive “fuck you” to the poor
LIARS.  Regain your souls, come back to our shared American Democracy.  We NEED honest conservatives.
Who cares.. it's been months since it was passed. Day after day who ever manages this account post the same crap about the tax cut just in different ways. Move on - find something else to talk about so you don't have to show you haven't done squat in months upon months.
I WANT to know when an ethics committee is to be convened on @KamalaHarris disgusting behavior on the Ellen show.
My story?  Paycheck has NOT increased, health insurance premiums have.  Stores are closing.  Prices are going up & this #FailedCongress is bragging about it while ignoring the "elephant in the room."
It isn't doing anything for 98% of America citizens! But the big corps are Cashing In!  it gave @amazon $78 million in windfall, thanks to @POTUS and his lying @GOP cronies... That's how it's doing!
Health Insurance premiums paid by individuals should be deductible to the same extent as premiums paid by corporations on behalf of their employees!  @realDonaldTrump @DavidSchweikert @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain
what, no takers?  I guess Mercer and the Koch bros don't do twitter...
My taxes went up.
It’s not working.
I’m underwater.
#GOPTaxScam
Ask the President to order Sessions and Rosenstein to turn over the documents. ....
Wage growth (blue line) has continued in same range for years. Since 2016, price inflation (red) has picked up some. So real wage growth has slowed (blue-red).

Wage growth should pick up. We are in longest streak of job creation on record, new jobs every month since late '10.
Just mostly but promises & PR for workers so far.



Zero, zilch, none yah, nada, no difference, negative, , 
No, real wages have actually declined
Sorry can't. I'm in La & Trump's #TradeWar going to take away my #TaxReform. Are y'all gonna help your constituents or continue sucking up to Trump?
LA's top export partner is China w/ $7.9 Billion & its second highest export good is agricultural is $15.8B. Soybeans comprises >$12B. Will our GOP Reps defend us? @BillCassidy @SenJohnKennedy @SteveScalise @RepClayHiggins @RepAbraham @RepMikeJohnson …
