Notice the trend..Trump does something really damaging to the country & GOP agenda so they grasp desperately for the one thing they can appease their Lobbyists & wealthy money train constituents to do damage control & the memo goes out to upsell the Tax Act to distract them..Lol
Did you know you used to be the party of fiscal conservatism and not greed, racism, sexism, and general hate?
What have tax cuts done for healthcare, costs of medications, elevated insurance premiums and deductibles for the American people? —Made companies, corporations, and insurance companies wealthier...not the rest of us.

Good God are we going to have to see your lies until November?
It would be interesting to ask Americans what they are doing with their tax cut  “bonuses” after they are taxed... and how many are put toward insurance coverage, medical bills and costs?

When are the Republicans going to do what they promised to get elected.....like repeal and BURY Obama care?  Too many elite Republicans think they own us....and forget they REPRESENT US....not the political class.  DRAIN THE SWAMP &BUILD THE DAMN WALL ALREADY!
I don't think Capitol Hill counts as a distressed community.
Really?  Still on #TaxCutsAndJobsAct ?

How about doing your job and start reigning in @realDonaldTrump ....

Or should I call him ‘Dear Leader Trump’?
Budget deficit for February was over 200 billion dollars and March deficit 300 billion dollars.  Republican fiscal policies?
#TaxCutsAndJobsAct produces:
    Minimum wage jobs
    Contract jobs
    Jobs without a future

Did you know #WeThePeople will be taking corrective measures to repair this #FailedCongress' ongoing damages come November?
Tax scam alert!!!  . How about doing your jobs and impeaching the imbecile that’s ruining our country?
And it was really necessary to have that boondoggle in order to help distressed communities? Wouldn't a solid infrastructure plan be more useful?
we all call your tax plan what it is....it's the #GOPTaxScam
If the @GOP had any sense it would have allowed less of a cut for the top and focused on #American PEOPLE and reduced #taxes for them, instead of disproportionately cutting the taxes of the biggest companies in the #USA.
*At the expense of #American Public Programs; our children's #Education, our #health and our #environment.

A #Shameful display of the abuse of power of the top tiers of the #UnitedStates #Governemnt.
I will say I am thankful someone put somehting into the otherwise #devastating bill.

Even thought it pushed back #CHIP (children's health insurance plan) & DACA (deferred action for childhood arrivals), instead of dealing with the big issues- you all gave yourselves a tax break.
Tax cut also cut:
#CNCS, #CBC, #LSC, #IMLS, #NRC, #ARC, #NEA, #NEH, #USTDA, #ADF, #DRA, #OPIC, #IAF, #USIP, #DC, #NBRC, #WWICS, #CSB (CHEMICAL SAFETY BOARD), #SECR, #AHTFCMF, #WC, Water programs, Food education! Loan programs, #NOAA!, #EDA, #MBDA, Flood Mapping, and so many more.
Full list of #PublicPrograms CUT for top business #TaxCuts [extra $ CO. didn't NEED], these programs on the other hand were the backbone to what has made #America a good, safe place to live- contributed to childrens wellness & EDU.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is really the ROB EVERYONE TO GIVE THE RICHEST EVEN MORE Act. You all should be ashamed, and you're all going to be voted out of office this fall. Forever. Remember the Whigs? You're the next political party to disappear completely. Buh-bye!
Did you know it exploded the national debt to $21 trillion? Because ignoring climate change and the Sixth Extinction and letting kids get butchered in their classrooms wasn't enough harm to America's young people for the GOP. See you in November!
The GOP is turning the entire goddamned country into a distressed community.

lol.  we have jobs.  they aren't decent paying jobs.
GOP - "Did you know the #TaxCutsandJobsAct included a plan to encourage growth in distressed communities? "

Translation - Did you know you all got fucked by the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct? Your great great grandkids will be paying for the windfall we gave our donors.
Where's phase 2 already ?????
Make individual tax cuts permanent NOW 
No vacation until it's complete
