Yes but your bill is garbage. Companies that support the GOP do these PR stunts to make us believe that the tax cuts and jobs act is helping Americans when the lowest percentages in the bracket haven’t changed. Stop hiding behind “oh it makes taxes easier to file” #GOPTaxScam
Pull your head out of the sand!! It's helped thousands of Americans including myself
You have got to be kidding. #vacuum #onetrickpony #trump #idiots #thebase #complicit #hypocrisy @gop #fear #makerussiagreatagain #sanctions I tweet bc you dont answer my calls. VM full constantly. Why? Positive comments? Nah. #DerelictionOfDuty

Soooo just filed my taxes - I made $1,372.00 in 2017 (NOT a typo - lived of $$ from 2015 contract work) 
I repeat made $1,372.00 & HAD TO PAY $99.00 in fed taxes. 
Really hope the 1% is enjoying all the money in their pockets …
The benefits to the few that do not need it #TaxScam2017
This administration would make my father change political parties and he was a life long republican, our admin used the GOP to get elected and are behaving as bullies & profiteers without empathy for those who are not within your economic class. The only god you worship is gold
trillions in debt to pay for massive tax cuts for billionaires #GOPTaxScams
Liars!
How many more republicans like Paul Ryan going to jump ship in lieu of receiving the flashback soon to come?
Thank you
There are no benefits unless you are already rich,   #GOPTaxScam   #WEARENOTSTUPID
Oh please....if this is your proudest moment in this year's session it's not saying much. You passed a tax scam that benefits the rich.  Don't worry we'll take care of you. #VoteThemOut2018
What are you doing about the cost of living increase for social security reciepiants. You've helped our soldiers, you've helped our working class but our elderly are falling farther and farther behind ignored by obama. They deserve better.

Forbes...

Tax-cut riches have gone to execs and investors over workers by nearly three-to-one margin https://cnb.cx/2H9b3kQ 
More BS from the Senate...How about stopping Trump and his Neocon friends starting wars and reignited the Cold War!
Jobs, jobs and more jobs!!  It's the economy stupid!!
You guys robbed us. Don’t think we didn’t notice.
Trump is the GOP #TRUMPLIES
