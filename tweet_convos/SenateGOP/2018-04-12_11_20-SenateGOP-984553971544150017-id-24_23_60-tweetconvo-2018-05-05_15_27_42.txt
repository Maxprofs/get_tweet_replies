@KenCalvert  Do you still agree with Trump that "Trade wars are good and easy to win." Ken?
Except, coupled with spending, we get a record deficit.

Long term cuts to programs that benefit those who aren’t among the wealthy. 
@GOP didn’t even try to disguise this scam on the majority of Americans.
Thank you for stripping 13 million Americans of health insurance. @KenCalvert @TeamCalvert

Why are so many retail giants closing?
Who is real Donald Trump? Isn't he a mafia????? Such a nasty man is now became president by Russians & you are tweeting about him? LOCK HIM UP!

Since you gave them an enormous tax cut and the freedom to screw up the environment as much as they want, of course their outlook is good.   Notice the article said their OUTLOOK,  not what’s happening now
