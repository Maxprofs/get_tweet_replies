YES VOTE OUT GOP BRING IN THE DEMOCRATS!!!
I do share TRUMP's campaign views raising taxes to 35% on those who make $250,000 plus  & 35% Tarriff on FOREIGN MFG Goods from Mexico, Germany, India, China, Africa, Australia, Vietnam, etc.  and CA Gov. Brown's 10 BILLION $Train "to NO WHERE" TAXES.
It’s not popular for good reason.
Stop trying to sell us on a scam tax cut etc. We don't care or believe u. #TaxScamBill  #VoteThemOut
Don't buy what the GOP is trying to sell you.  Know the facts.  Facts matter.
And be prepared for increased health care costs and paying off a $1.5 trillion addition to the deficit from your TAX SCAM. So glad the GOP ship will be sunk on 11/6! The party's over.
Damn you, Rino Republicans for not standing supporting President Trump.
It's not what you've done. It's more what you haven't done.
 
We will not forget.

If you mean out with the GOP and in with the Blue Tsunami i am all for it ... I deregistered as a Republican and became an Independent because of the s-holes and fascists that now run the GOP.
Out with the old republicans and in with the new progressive democrats!

Yes and the wealthy will be the benefactors

I will NEVER forget that the @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP voted to take my hard earned money and give it to their super RICH buddies. Now our country is in unbelievable debt because of this INSANE bill.
Two words. BULL SHIT. That and lying is all the @GOP has become
Go to hell you are a corrupt Russian paid party and you all will be held accountable for betraying this country

My 82 year old friend did save some in her taxes this year, but was told she would be paying MORE next year.. she didn’t understand that, but just shrugged. Thanks for NOT MUCH tax reform. Enjoy your Millions of savings.
"Next year, the tax filing procedure will be different than it is this year" is some seriously inspired messaging.
It wasn’t so burdensome to the poor because the rich had to pay their fair share.     Now you gave them massive tax cuts.
Yes, and we get to enjoy the orgy of debt (for a while)
2018 is another year where #maga #gop girls have to accept and comply to men like #trump, #robporter and #roymoore.

Hands-on and hard-hitting #gop #maga men demand compliance and silence.

Women who talk about abuse, are so burdensome.
no amount of lies will make the #GOPTaxScam good for the middle class
More lies from a corrupt and unethical #GOP . How did the Republican Party let itself get hijacked by a mob boss.  Pretty damn sad .
yes and +55% of us aren't happy about your Tax Scam Bill read the polls

@GOP Cure Alls 1. Tax Cut Mania = Proven Failure Yet #GOP Persist 2. Privatization Lets Privatize Everything Another Failure 3. Lets Give Corporations Banks Banker Barons Big Oil Big Pharma & Top 10% 95% Of All Tax Relief = Azz Backwards Polices [What A Con Job] @FoxBusiness @WSJ
Let’s see how everybody fares NEXT YEAR ... don’t put the cart ahead of the horse
Not good news at all...
I liked the old system in which I didn’t pay as much.
Yay!!
2016 is the last time I lived in a country that wasn't going insane.
#GOP 'reformed' nothing. They just enabled a big tax break for the rich.
Resign.
