The @SenateDems are fighting it more than the R’s ask @MarshaBlackburn the #OpioidQueen of the #opioidcrisis  She took money from big pharma lobbyists and helped co-sponsor a bill that kept @DEAHQ from doing their job. She won’t be in the Senate next year. #ByeByeBlackburn
If you click on the link, literally everything there has bipartisan support/sponsorship. It's great y'all are working together. Why be divisive and imply it's just the Republicans?
@POTUS @AnnCoulter @jeffsessions Please don’t stop my supply of heroin coming across the southern border. I also think the sex slaves are important. Those sex slaves serve an important function.
really ?? how are you going to fund it ??
Best way to do this is put up a wall. Please get the senate to fund the wall
A big BS
Sure they are !!!!!
LOBBY MONEY =
OPIOID CRISIS

Yep, a lot of them are on some kind of opioid ... They in some kind of la la land ....

Does that mean you're shutting down the drug companies that sell this by the ton?  Otherwise we call bulls**t.
Republicans not funding the programs they claim to care about..  GOP all talk on the opiod crisis .
hahahahahahahhahahahaand your guy in the WH wants the Candyman to be the director of VA only because he is such a patsy (we all recognize verbiage used in health report all Trumpisms) DJT wasnt him so he will go along with privated VA away to help himself and rich friends get $$$
Just remember that it was the pill popping, junkie, baby boomers who started it. And Big Pharma that perpetuated it.
You are only fighting for your money.
Then don't put the "Candy Man" in charge of the Veterans Administration.
If what you come up is as bad and ill-thought out as SESTA/FOSTA, we might as well all start smoking crack. Really, could you please stop trying to do things until we vote out a significant number of you in November? It's really embarrassing.
No they are not...they are in the pocket of Big Pharma, and big Pharma is who created the opioid crisis. #PharmaceuticalDrugCompaniesShouldBeHeldAccountable
Universal Healthcare is the ONLY OPTION!!!
Sure, all addicted to Opioids will just turn in their prescriptions on the 28th. Great plan! GOP= Crooks, Liars, and Out of Touch!
Sure they are! The GOP Senate is fighting the crisis by making sure you die more quickly & easily by deregulating Big Pharma & making sure the Sackler family's OxyContin profits are protected from civil liability! They fight for you by making sure you become disenfranchised.
When are you going to clean up @POTUS  pick for Sec'y of Veteran's Affair, Ronny Jackson alcohol and  drug problem?

WHILE YOU ARE FIGHTING THE OPIOD CRISIS, GET RID OF SOBER LIVING AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF ADDICTS FROM THEIR HOME TO ANOTHER STATE WHERE CRIME AND DRUG FLOW INCREASES...ADDICTS ARE A COMMODITY FOR NIMH-ADDICTS ARE STILL ADDICTS-NOT TAUGHT HOW TO COPE WITH LIFE EXPERIENCES
Fighting to make sure it continues unabated? Sounds about right.
Through thoughts and prayers.
Traitors every last one of you.  The shame you have brought on your family will never fade
Fucking liars. You have cut funding and placed inept corrupt people in charge of this crisis. You will not be forgiven, nor will it be forgotten.  There is a special place in Hell for the @GOP

A Federal judge has ordered the Trump Administration to continue signing people up for DACA. Do you believe the judge made the right choice? Vote and retweet. #MAGA #DACA #BuildTheWall #AmericaFirst #Resist #Resistance
So if illegals are acceptable, why should ordinary citizens follow any laws? Seems a legit question, because justice is clearly favoring 1 group over others,  and at others expense.
What do you mean by "fighting" ?
Has @KellyannePolls got that all wrapped up now?
More horsesh*t from the Regressives.
by having Dr Candyman, hand them out in the aisles of AF1..
