#TaxDay #TaxReform = jobs =higher wages = economic growth #taxcutsforamerica = more money in your pocket because it's not the government's money
Does that include the cuts to #Medicaid and #SNAP??
#RepublicansForIncreasingNationalDebt
Every little bit helps. Now if you people can work together with @realDonaldTrump our @POTUS the people will in like kind support you. Thank you! 
#NoMoreDemocrats please.
Please make it permanent. Many will not see any trickle down working for greedy leftist employers
My family of 2 went up $1,000 for 2017 with same income & deductions of the previous year. Show the public all the brackets if you have the fortitude to do so.
Do you understand how economists, and intelligent people in general, talk about these kind of numbers? You can say average, which is distorted by the rich, or median, which reflect the impact on the middle family. “Typical” is meaningless, a marketing word. 

#Taxreform is a scam
#taxScam
New from @SenateDems  Under #TrumpTax in 2018 alone, major corporations have authorized more than $250 BILLION in stock buybacks benefitting wealthy shareholders & executives – instead of raising wages for American workers. https://twitter.com/senatedems/status/985907323750117376 …
Oh gee. $2000 is nothing for the poor when the corrupt and evil @GOP give trillions of dollars to the rich. Why don't you do something for America for once and rid us of the #CRIMINALPresident.

I just saw this.   It tells it all
That’s just a plain straight out lie.     There are too many families who will have large tax increases.   83% of all tax reduction is going to the rich,   You gave 1.3 trillion dollars to the rich.   #GOPTaxScam   #WEARENOTSTUPID
http://www.newsweek.com/republican-tax-cuts-trump-wage-increases-879800 … @gop is full of chit!!!  Zero credibility
Thank you

What about Goldman Sachs? How much do they get?
Stand by. Health insurance rates will deplete that fast thanks to the GOP TAX SCAM.
Why don't  you bump this ad up against what the typical multi-millionaire or billionaire will see in cuts?  Are you afraid that your constituents will realize that the top 1% get over 80% of the benefits from the #taxscam?
Ahh-hmmmm You might want to have a legal tax attorney check your facts before tweeting.  False advertising?
I don’t have kids, and can’t write off a private jet, so nope, didn’t help me.

#CRUMBS is what I got
Same propaganda different day. Your tax scam to benefit the rich is well know. Don't bother trying to sell it any other way. #VoteThemOut
You mean the "average" family gets $2000. 

Which means for every 99 families that get $1, each of your wealthy campaign donors gets $199,999
Problem with that GOP, your typical family earns about million dollars a year, the Russians have attacked us, the president that you support will not be for sanctions you passed, and you want to sell this tax cut BS. Do your job. Protect the United States
My taxes went up $27,000. THANKS A LOT.
Liars!

Yeah, yeah, whatever. Our government is being destroyed by criminals, but let us not address that. Let's just keep talking about this, indefinitely. Excellent strategy. It should really pay off at mid-terms and in 2020. All indictments aside, of course.
Can you tell me what the "typical" family makes in a year?  And what makes them "typical"?  Is it the national average or national median?  I'd love to see solid numbers instead of over-simplification that omits actual data.
Nope. Lies.
Which I'm donating to the DNC.
What will the typical millionaire see?  And when will the "typical family" receive a cushy taxpayer funded retirement and medical like you all receive?  #SADButTrump #PaulRyan
And pay more on their mortgage due to higher interest rates, and pay more for everything else due to higher inflation, and pay more on anything made of metal due to tariffs, and watch the country's debt balloon out of control due to this #unnecessarystimulus
No reputable economists support this statement: "a typical family of four will see a tax cut of more than $2,000."

Stop BSing everyone.
That is absolutely nothing!
Yeah, while a typical fortune 100 company will see a tax cut in the multiple $1,000,000's. Nice distribution there.
no one likes it you guys
