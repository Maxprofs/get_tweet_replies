Did you know? 2017 is the last year before U take away all of my deductions & DO NOT replace them w/standard deduction so I will pay MORE in 2018 with your modernization. Also @POTUS can blow up folks' 401k in a tantrum w/o caring. Middle class/fixed income is screwed by you!
Since #GOPTaxScam 
Toys R Us closes 180 stores
Sears closes 63 stores
Kmart closes 45 stores
Macy's closes 68 stores
Sam's Club closes 63 stores
BofA dings low income accounts
Kimberly Clark fires 5000+
Carrier jobs still move to Mexico 
Paul Ryan gets 500K
COAL'S NOT COMING BACK
Pardon me, but more jobs? Most of the companies that benefited from those "cuts" just bought their shares back. Some *still* laid people off.  #BlueWaveComing2018
except for the 40 million in CA who will see our fed taxes skyrocket!
Millionaires love the #GOPTaxScam
Wow... your have the nerve to brag like that when most small businesses said it doesn’t help them, higher inflation and new tariffs imposed by #pathetic45 will mean the middle class gets creamed.   The net effect is an overall net LOSS for Americans.
Just wait until the plebes realize they don't get any tax refund next year because they didn't change withholdings and lost a lot of deductions. Of course, a lot of the GOP will be laughing at their golf courses since they'll be retired or voted out.
Out With the Old corrupt, lying, treasonous GOP and In With the New who are willing to serve everyday American's best interests.
Did anyone receive a pay increase? I must have missed mine.
Lies!!
#StopSpending http://www.usdebtclock.org 
Stop the daily lie about your tax scam. Focus on a POTUS who shames the USA daily. What does it say about the Republicans that you remain silent as this POTUS drags the country down? Spinelessness!


Did you know that very few companies changed their hiring practices because of this tax cut? You had the chance to really tax companies that hide their assets in off shore havens, but you choose some odd ball, one time only, giveaway. Good job.
Do you know that you've given Billionaires a windfall in tax cuts, while the middle class gets crumbs? Do you realize that you've saddled our children & grandchildren with a $ Trillion budget deficit? Of course you do, You're the GOP, Greedy Old-boy-club Politicians!!
Or not? https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tax-cuts-were-supposed-to-juice-the-economy-but-banks-arent-seeing-it-2018-04-13 … #BlueWaveComing2018 #RIPGOP #GOPTaxScam
@SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @GOP @HouseGOP crush this #MuellerWitchHunt, if not, ur nothing but a bunch of #politicaleunuchs like those at @TheJusticeDept & boarded the #ShipofFools w @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer & @TheDemocrats? @donnabrazile has play dough!
Good, own this mess. A society is only as sophisticated as it’s tax system. You just obliterated ours you incompetent lunatics. November is gonna be a blast.
The Koch brothers, thanks to the "middle-class tax breaks" save $44 every SECOND. #taxes #TaxCutsandJobsAct
BS
Don't forget the trillions in debt.  #RepublicanDebtLegacy
Largest deficit in history & 80% of those it will benefit are foreigners, per CBO. Party of fiscal responsibility, my ass 

#AlternativeFacts #GOPTaxScam

Zero tax reform, just temporary cuts and massive permanent debt for our kids. #VoteBlue
This is such a weird messaging campaign.
Sounds good. But what happens when the tax breaks go away? I'd like to hear more about that...
Let me correct your lie.

2018 will be a huge tax reduction for the rich.   #GOPTaxScam
Why do you insist on ONLY talking about this? It’s been 5 months, you won its over, tweet about through his incompetence and hypocrisy, trump has set us on the precipice of ww3
Don't be fooled.   That paltry sum amounts to nothing. If you are poor, living paycheck to paycheck,  you are still going to be poor living paycheck to pathetically bigger paycheck.
Tax cuts for the average American are small, and many will pay more tax April 2019 unless they adjust their W4. Tax cuts for corporations have spurred consolidation rather than hiring and investment. Long-term effect will be more concentration of wealth, not better jobs and wages
What I do know is many of you on GOP, bow down to the Democrats. We need term limits to stop corruption. That may be we can get representatives with balls to support us & @realDonaldTrump
There is no tax reform in your tax cuts for billionaires and wealthy corporations. There was an article in post about all these corporations having TOO much money. Any hardworking Americans have too much money
And the national debt balloon into the trillions..
Deficit spending in a bull market.
Did you know that the first illegitimate POTUS @realDonaldTrump NEVER paid federal taxes at all on top of the fact that he NEVER released any of his tax returns?
BS. Go sell your snake oil somewhere else. This vet and registered republican is voting blue all the way to clean up your crap.
Lie. My paycheck is not larger
Did you know what a #GOPTaxBillScam this is? Funnels cash to the rich (who, BTW, don't need it), throws a bone to the rest of us, (which, BTW, only for a few years). Increases the deficit, and you morons want to pillage SS and Medicare THAT WE PAID INTO. #GOPCorruption
I didn’t know this because it’s not true

@SenateDems @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @CarnegieEndow @RockefellerFdn President Donald J. Trump is "not My President".
1500 workers loosing GM jobs https://amp.freep.com/amp/515260002 
Do you think Americans care about tax code. We care more about the man in the WH who uses his position for personal issues and vendettas. You've allowed your party to lose the respect of the American people. Shameful.
Your party is going down in flames and this is the best you have.
Giant deficits. Rising interest rates. Rising inflation.
I RECEIVED MORE LAST YEAR ! ....
We’ll see on 4/15/19. Signed Middle Class.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President!
For someone who claims to be “really interested in politics”, you seem to only be interested in Retweeting the GOP propaganda. Weird since you’re a Canadian, isn’t there a single political issue from your own country u have an opinion on?
Did you know Trump is dangling pardons?
WOW! Stormy Daniels to be in the NYC court Monday at 2pm with Cohen @MichaelAvenatti announces! @GOP @DNC @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @marcorubio @SenRubioPress @RepRutherfordFL @SenBillNelson
I call bullshit. The "modernized tax code" provides bigger paychecks to the upper 20% of the wealthiest, the remainder of us are left out.
November 6, 2018.
Wait you do your taxes in Jan of 2019. Your returns will be smaller


The only thing that can screw November up, for the GOP, is low voter turnout.
It is OURS to lose.
NOT AMERICA FIRST!
Did you know last year's "big win" is STILL last year's news and one of the biggest reasons #WeThePeople are coming for your jobs when the polls open in November?  I bet you don't...
#BlueWave2018 #VoteThemOut2018 #RepublicanSHAME #FiscalTreason
#Bullshiggity 2018 is they paradigm of 1 trillion to 12 trillion debt! You screwed U.S.
Less tax breaks
Mine were about the same.
We Know #unhingedtrump is the GOP
