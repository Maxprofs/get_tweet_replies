Orin in the shredder!
@ForeverLogical  Orrin Hatch's retirement.

Well, whoever is running Hatch’s social media is fun, at least.
#GOPTaxScam is designed to payback wealthy campaign donors
Right. A rich, white, guy FLAUNTING he is getting richer at the expense of the rest of us. YOU ARE THE ELITE that you keep railing against- WE GET IT!! BRILLIANT TWEET, GOP! #CorruptGOP #GOPTaxScam #GOPComplicit Jesus Christ-Does SeanHannity write this for you?
Donald Trump being found guilty of corruption, collusion, obstruction and decimating the greatest country in the world.
Seeing Trump’s tax returns!
IMPEACHING TRUMP AND COMPLICIT REPUBLICANS!
Him shredding it in 2020 when all the middle class get screwed
Clearly far right ideological love is very different than most normal human's view. How about a little kid with chronic medical problems receiving care to alleviate their suffering as opposed to an old Senator operating a shredder
I love healthcare more. I love quality public education more. I love breathing clean air and drinking clean water more. #BlueWaveComing2018 #GOPTaxScamBill
I'm so ashamed and disappointed
45's impeachment would be right up there!
He's going to be the president that gets away with everything ...its been going on for 15mths. Disgusting
2018 mid term elections
The GOP and your LEADER TRUMP shredding the US Constitution has been abominable. Your daily lies about an outright TAX SCAM is nauseating but happily will take your party down on 11/6 when we MAGA. We prefer you do your jobs & deal with an unfit POTUS.
Fake conservatives
Silly at best
.@HouseGOP @SenatorCollins @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Goodness what any easy question. Surprised you could make it so simple. What I love more, much more, is the possibility of a BLUE WAVE.

Let's now shred the whole damn democratic criminal manipulators and controlling SOB'S out of our white house.

The rest of us waited over 8 years for Obama’s records to be unsealed. Still waiting. So don’t hold your breath
A senile old man that should have been retired a long ago by the electorate!
I can, watching you SOB's lose your re-election or election.
Hope his finger gets caught in the shredder and he yells out "DEFICIT". That would be poetic justice. @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
You old fart, Undo the Tax Code you did because we want that deficit decreased and we want it out of all pensions on Capital Hill!
Senator Hatch leaving the Senate comes to mind.

How long are you going to tout that tax scam?  It’s really getting old. Ugh. Pigs at the trough!  Oink. Oink.
Pathetic.
Is that the same machine @realDonaldTrump used on the Constitution?
Pretty much anything. You lot losing your jobs next time you’re up for re-election is s good thing to look forward to.
I love voting out the corrupt the corrupt GOP more. #BlueWave2018
Love ya Orrin
Ok. I love teachers deducting classrooms supplies...oh, wait. They can't anymore.
Maybe @senorrinhatch spreading @senorrinhatch ‘s face.
Shreading
I think they have the same machine where I vote!
Common sense gun laws.
Yeah, shred that old progressive tax code for a new old tax code from the 1890s back when old white guy was born.
Yes, all the spineless @GOP retiring and quitting before they get their asses kicked in November. Time to get rid of the republican scum and take back our country and democracy
Starving our government into unimaginable debt for future generations to pay, while funding the selfishness of #GreedyOldPricks. Republicans are ruining America. #CrookedGOP #GOPTaxscam
I like the old one with better deductability of mortgage interest and SALT. But oh well. Someone has to pay off the wealthy Republican donors.
Literally anything else.
Bet he will save a fortune next tax season!
Pathetic. New tax code is even worse. Traitorous douchebag.
You asked
He looks like he's having fun.  Maybe we should put shredders in adult daycare centers.
A video of rich white dude that is completely out of touch with reality posted by a group of rich white dudes completely out of touch with reality.

#GOPTaxScam #TaxScamBill
Could he put his hands in there?

A colonic
Number one: standing up for democracy even a little. #ProtectMueller #ProtectRosenstein

I'd love the GOP to dissolve due to their greed, lack of morals, and spinelessness.
Seriously?  The old tax code is like 7000 pages long. @senorrinhatch probably can’t even lift it by himself. $21TRILLION and counting. @NationalDebt
The refund I get this year because in 3 years I’ll pay more than I ever have.
Guess we add Hatch to the scammer list!
Well, it's not the current Republican orgy of debt and spending.
Thanks. I'll be 18 later this year and I'm glad that when I'm finally living free and paying taxes, I'll never have to deal with that old code.
Yup. You'll be dealing with the new one instead. The one everyone gets no refund unless you're rich.
I'd love Republicans to be honest about the tax scam but we don't always get what we want.
