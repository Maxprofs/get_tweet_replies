AND TRILLIONS IN DEBT!

It was not Tax Reform. It was tax cuts. You Reform Tax without adding to the deficit.
BS! The RICH are ok, though.
First, I’m grateful for the new tax laws. We’ve benefited significantly. Second, and I mean this with my whole being, I am so disappointed about politicking over the confirmation for Pompeo. I’ve supported my gov. always and it appears the legislative body has abandoned us. 
Every single appointment is a battle. I’m amazed we are functioning at the level we are. Please, GOP, come together and get these appt done. Let’s be a united front and move forward. We are sunk if you don’t.
Well, Y don’t I see it. U promised tax reform not just tax cuts.  Your throwing crumbs at us while U make millions. Sad your able t#2 fool so many with your con job. Go 2 jail! @foxnewspolitics @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @CNN @MSNBC
No one with a brain believes these lies.  Even you know it's a lie that's why you have bills to reform the #TaxScamBill .  All those who voted for a bill they didn't read should be voted out of office.  It's time for competency and leadership in the senate.  #ResignMcConnell
Gas  is on the rise.   Going to need ANYTHING THAT HELPS!
Republican Tax Scam = higher pay for corporate CEOs.
Truth = The #GOPTaxScam is a massive tax reduction for the super wealthy.   And now they want us to pay for it with our Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
That's funny my taxes were higher this year
... increases in your health insurance premiums, the loss of health insurance for millions, exacerbating income inequality, the shipping of jobs overseas, probable cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and major stock buybacks.  Plus middle class tax cuts are temporary.

The BIGGEST tax scam in history has stripped my hard earned money from my pocket and given it to the SUPER RICH.
Damn you, Rino Republicans for not standing supporting President Trump.
It's not what you've done. It's more what you haven't done.
 
We will not forget.
How many days are you going to talk about tax reform. There are a lot more pressing issues to deal with. #GOPTaxScam  Ineffective and lacking ethics. #VoteThemOut
not what the polls are saying negative feeling for your tax scam bill is over 55% so all your cute little tweets don't mean anything
See #Deficit See #HealthcareCosts
Oh, did you all find time to focus on something other than protecting the deep state fascists who want to cancel the last election? Thanks for absolutely NOTHING.
Don't forget the $1.5 trillion price tag in deficit spending for the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct !
It will be repealed.
The REALLY scary thing about this tweet is that the GOP does NOT know the difference between tax CUTS, which is what they did & tax REFORM, which would benefit everyone, not just themselves & corporations. #GOPTaxScam
NON-STOP PROPAGANDA & LIES! Don't believe a word of it. Their CONSTANT plugging, mentioning, cheer-leading should tell you how much of a Middle Class FAILURE this SCAM truly is. HERE is the TRUTH! This SCAM will KILL the Middle Class!
This millionaire revealed his tax return to show just how much the GOP tax law favors the rich 
DEFICIT DEFICIT DEFICIT DEFICIT. Need I say more. DEFICIT.  FOOLS
#GOPTaxScam
All for the top 1%. Nice job GOP!
Whoops. You mistyped.

#GOPTaxScam

Fixed it!!?
FAKE NEWS!
LOL
We expect McConnell to resign immediately if Trump fires Rosenstein
Pompeo is opposed to the First Amendment and is Islamophobic.
Why are so many corporate workers needing Medicaid then?  Many of these workers have to work more than 1 low-paying job to make ends meet—including healthcare needs—They deserve better!  #TaxReform #Corporations #Medicaid

You ARE KIDDING! The article is from the local paper @dailysentinel in Texas with only 7,500 household subscribers!

How is the massive deficit created bye it gonna play out? Borrow more money from china. So conservative
PLEASE STOP. This obsession w telling us every moment of the day how great this actual horrid bill is simply shows u are not confident. If u have followed the comments for the past 5 months, it almost all negative. You made your bed, now lie it.
Retired and still working b/c electric bill went up, take home pay down (also GM laying off 1500 from lourdestown Ohio plant b/c production of hi demand vehicles moved to Mexico)....winning in Ohio
Only 1/4 of Americans have received higher wages, bonuses. All of the rich people and corporations have received higher wages, bonuses.
Uh, no, no it isn't, but it is leading to greater debt.  Good Job GOP!!!!
Its not reform if it raises deficit and your BS raises deficit. @SpeakerRyan rolled over and gave up. Hypocrisy @ its finest
Here is the problem. The American people know that this is a #GOPTaxScam
It wasn't "tax reform." #GOPTaxScam was the biggest transfer of wealth from  the middle class to the rich in US history.


It seems almost daily that some Republican is spouting how great this tax reform is. IT’S ONLY GREAT FOR CORPORATIONS AND TOP 1%. GET OVER IT! Thanks for creating the biggest debt package in history!! Thanks for putting party over country! Thanks for the ongoing corruption! FOOLS
Only 3 million out of 150 mil working Americans got a bonus or a raise.  #ThanksTaxScam
Republicans have caused  300 billion dollar BUDGET deficit for March alone. SHAMEFUL.






This is all you got?  Only thing for you to tweet about ? Who really benefited?
should be called the #stockbuybackbillscam @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @AP @Reuters
A REPUBLI-CON!
Many states many states about 5% of people mostly richer people get over 60% of the benefits. come on!!! Be honest!!
FACT: the #GOPTaxScam delivers $1.3 trillion to corporate America. Also a FACT: the #TrumpBudget  cuts Medicare by $500 billion, Medicaid by $1.4 trillion and Social  Security disability by $72 billion. This is how they plan to pay for it —  by obliterating key investments.

You forgot to add the additional $1,000,000,000,000.00 of national debt added each year that Trump is in Office and the GOP remains complicit!
More #GOPLies
"Maybe if we say it a few MORE times, they'll believe it."
You complicit SOBs are going down. And most of America can’t wait to see y’all go away.  Far far away
Still doesn't address #CBT where Americans living/working overseas subject to 2x tax, #FATCA that treats citizens like criminals for living/working os and the new goodies that will see more os American citizens face financial ruin - not rich fat cats just ordinary people.
PUTIN AND THE RUSSIA GOVERNMERT WILL BE VOTING FOR TRUMP AND COMPLICIT REPUBLICAN'S,  WHO WILL AMERICA VOTE FOR?
you WISH this was true, you KNOW it's  not  true... The Voters know it's not true too!! #flipCongress2018
Where ????????
Cut Spending
ht Gary Larson
What tax reform ?
