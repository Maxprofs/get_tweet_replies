Your lies are not working.   The #GOPTaxScam is still a massive tax reduction for the filthy rich.  Your tweets can’t change that.

How does this compare to big business tax cuts? Nice to have 50 extra bucks a month, but that doesn't change much in our lives. Universal health care would help tons!
Republicans and Rand Paul are cowards by voting yes on Pompeo.
What IS the REPUBLICAN party and the Whitehouse doing about CYBER SECURITY????
Senators, I was wrong in my approach to doing something about Dems holding up staff picks. I tweeted earlier remove them from office for failing to perform their duties-that would made me a hypocrite. However, what recourse do we have when 337 staff picks of Pres is held up in
Hopes the midterm will enable them to ignore his picks? We have to address this as you guys won’t respond in kind & do it to them as you’re to decent. There must be recourse on the books that address it. If not there needs to be because it’s wrong and something needs done
And double the double speak.  Your tax fraud is more corporate welfare and yet another screwing of the middle class as their benefits end while corporations don't.  It's just one lie after another with cons and their talking out of the side of their collective mouths.

Billionaires & corporations are making out like bandits under the #GOPTaxScam. Since passage of the bill, we've seen $260 BILLION in stock buybacks, and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says by…



You're old and broken.  And your president lied to the FBI. I do believe thats an impeachable offense! #PeeTape  #RussiaGate  #ImpeachTrumpNow
Yea, right. THE #GOPTaxScam IS SO GOOD! 



And.......then there's all the deductions you took out. And that individual tax cuts aren't permanent.

But with less deductions so we end up paying more in April 2019 #GOPTaxScam
Tell the whole story, not the parts you edited out to make suckers of the public again..

It will be repealed


No marketing. Nice little celebration in the back yard. Don’t want to promote this too loudly. We like being in the minority in the Senate so we don’t have to govern.
And...





Republican politicians own it and will receive their just rewards at the poll.

Your tax scam is an epic fail.  Most of us are not seeing substantial benefits, and yet your very rich donors are.  Hmmm, why is that?
How much are these propaganda messages costing taxpayers to produce and publish? As a taxpayer, I demand an answer.
This administration & the treasury is for sale to lobbyists, the Kochs & corporate donors.

Lower rates for who? Only 13% of tax cuts are going to employees. Corporations are investing in buy backs and equipment, not workers, not the middle class:
Permanent tax cuts for the wealthy. Millions in cuts per year for @realDonaldTrump and family.
Budget deficit for March was 300 billion dollars!!! Republican fiscal policies?????? Vote them out.
Awesome!! Thank you!! Need line item veto for President Trump now.
Oh just wait until next year tax filing to 5 years. Middle Americans will not be happy.  @realDonaldTrump , @GOP, @SenateMajLdr, @SpeakerRyan thank you so much for screwing middle America.  Giving the top 1% and big corporations the tax cuts.
passing the #GOPtaxScam was the worst decision the GOP ever made #BlueWave2018
I think it might be a tie with continuing to prop up @realDonaldTrump 

Even though there is ample evidence that he is a traitor.
The majority of Americans disapprove of the #GOPTaxScam
At a cost to adding 1.9 trillion to the deficit and justifying cuts to Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare that US Citizens already played into.

Cut corporate welfare, Aid to countries that are hostile to our nation. Be creative don't hurt USA Citizens.
@TheDemocrats
Lol
Trump ease Russian sanctions. 
Why is he so afraid of Russia? 
What do they have on him?
Why wot Republicans stand up for what's right instead of kissing Mr. MAGAits ass?
Why hasn't Congress forced Trump to show his tax returns?
Now we can file under the new broken tax code,  thanks for nothing.
Disgusting!
Now stop spending!!!!
