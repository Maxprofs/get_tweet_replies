Dual citizen & accidental Americans won't benefit especially if disabled or unemployed as other gov try to help with benefits with zero from US, the US considers it fair game as "passive income" Friend in NL given 4k US tax bill on NL disability paid to her son.
Sorry, I believe https://twitter.com/ksmainstream/status/986392284856975360 … is much closer to the truth of the matter.
WATCH: Video is both Stupid & Misleading.  The "new" tax policy actually ADDS an entirely new, as in additional, VOLUME to the existing 20 volumes of federal tax law. It is longer & more complex than the existing tax code with a total of 18,000 pages; + 56,000 more pages of regs. …
The new tax code is much bigger and not one of the republicans by their own admission read it so they have no idea what is in it. #pathetic.
Repeal the Repub #TaxCutPonziScheme before it widens wealth gap, shrinks Working Class, creates larger poverty pool & kills Medicare, Medicaid & Social Security to pay for the $1.5Trillion debt another Repub @POTUS has created again. DEM POTUS's lower debts.
Please stop scamming and robbing us. We need you to start having human empathy.
It’s good if you’re rich,   If you’re not rich, watch out.   You’re about to be ambushed.   #GOPTaxScam    #WEARENOTSTUPID
Surprised any of you know how to even use the machine.
Republicans own it! The polls will indicate the acceptance!
NOT MORALLY FIT!

Only good for wealthy.
No matter how upset I may be about the mechanisms of your purported 'tax cut', I love the video.  It's so sad that you didn't struggle nearly as hard to create something good as the does average American worker on a daily basis.  If you had, then I'd be cheering along with him.
I've always wanted the Tax Code to be streamlined/simplified, loopholes to be removed/minimized.  But what you did, instead, was to spend the bulk of your efforts at making sure that business received the biggest benefit, instead of being fair to all.  It's shameful.
Bahaha. For millionaires, maybe. The rest of us get sandpaper and vaseline.
Domesday warning coming from the lying racist fascist republican nazis!
Had to trot out one of the Top LIARS Hatch to make this LIE!!! Bill signed December of LAST YEAR The $0.00 MONEY BACK IS GOP GIFT TO AMERICAN FAMILIES!!!
More propaganda and lies about the tax code The new code does not eliminate all the tax rules.  Everyone will see that you are misleading Americans when the new publlicssions are released.
And today is the day that TRUMPUBLICAN party owners reap huge benefits at the people's expense...the 1% & corporations. We, the people, have been scammed. The solution:
Nov is bye bye Republicans  and your tax joke.
This is the last year we need to listen to Hatch and pay for his health care.  That's a better thing.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY EXTRA $200 A YEAR! THATS ALL THAT THE WALLSTREET CEO’S GOT TOO, RIGHT? CUZ, U KNOW, FAIRNESS? WHATS THAT? THEY GOT ALL THE TAX BREAKS ON TOP OF THEIR INCREASED SALARY? K COOL, SEE U IN NOVEMBER
So glad to help out the rich, while risking Social Security and Medicare to make up for it.
Only good for the obscenely rich. You’re bad for America. @gop @SenateGOP
#GOPTaxScam sucks
For who? You and your rich buddies? #TaxScam
The #GOPTaxScam is a bailout for America’s millionaires & billionaires enacted proactively so they can profit from the economic devastation they’re sowing. People are going to die from Republicans’ greed.
It's a great thing if you're a billionaire, or a $21 trillion national debt. Thanks for looting the United States!
To those of you with mortgages over 750k, well to damned bad! Red states have only cheap houses.
Except for exploding the deficit and screwing over future generations...sure?
GOP is in Charge. They own this #BlueWaveComing2018
