But when people die from guns you won’t do anything? No buy-back program, no new laws, just thoughts and prayers for victims of gun violence. Why can’t we just send thoughts and prayers to opioid victims?
So trying to repeal the ACA that helps treat the opioid crisis makes sense though right.. Just asking!? The gop is such bs now omg!?

Why couldn't it have been 45.

Senate republicans are nicking trump progress.

How bout chu advance the backlog of house bills.

Your time is up...get on the trump train.
Does this apply to the Liar in Chief's Doctor?
Can we find a similar disposal place for guns and some stats on how many gun deaths there are?  Would the @nra and that vile spokesperson approve?
Legalize marijuana at a minimum for medical use and states that legalize can take the market off the streets as into the community.  #LegalPot
@senatedems @realdonaldtrump Censure Senator Tester ... testing the resolve of the US citizens putting up with lies
Good advice, but since we're looking up statistics, maybe check out how many gun deaths occur every day in the United States and, just for clarity, check how many happen in the rest of the developed world.
MAKE HEALTHCARE AND TREATMENT ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE!
You post problems but your actions continually are the opposite of a solution.
You senators are not doing squat about it sad
Then why did you cut funding to fighting addiction?
#VoteThemOut2018
How many die from lack of medical care because they are poor or because they can’t get the proper nutrition?

And the republican president wants to put a "candy man" in charge of the VA. The @GOP is doing such a great job of selecting and vetting candidates.
Dump them in the well of the swamp, Aka congress
You are penalizing those with chronic pain who take pain medication as prescribed & DO NOT OVERUSE OR ABUSE! Why are WE treated like criminals? You need to revise your attitude towards those of us with chronic pain issues. Let Dr & patient decide what is best not the Govt.


Because you take bribes from Big Pharma & fund tax cuts for the wealthy, instead of #HealthForAll
There is approx 3000 abortions per day in the USA . You  in congress have your priorities in the wrong medical dept.
46 people die of 320,000,000 people die of overdoses. Thats .00000014% of the population. OMG
President Trump is doing his job !!

GOP NEEDS TO DO THEIR JOB !!

#MAGA
In your useless scientific opinions, what are the people who require some of these medications for constant pain supposed to do!  When did you get you medical licenses???!!!
.@GOP @RNC @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump @VP are #UnfitForOffice
Maybe the ‘Candy Man’ will take care of them. #EndTheGOP
#LegalizeIt  Cannabis

#TakeBackDay
And yet the Republican Russian Party wants to strip the very care that is needed to break away from it.
