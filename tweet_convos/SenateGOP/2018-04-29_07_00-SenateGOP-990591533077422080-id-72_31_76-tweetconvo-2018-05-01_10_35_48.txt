Dictator Donald Tyrant Trump and the basket of deplorable Banana Republican cheats must stop lying to the people. The tax cuts are for the rich, not the middle-class. Can you say DEFICIT.
Do you really think you can change a fraudulent tax bill by posting false information?
When are y'all going to work on Immigration Reform?? Poor system is NOT working! Want to see action if Dems against - answer in election
Here is everyone’s story!
Since Reagan, 401K type plans, designed 2 supplement pensions & SS now rule
Defined Benefit Plans, now rare; are defunct, under funded or bankruptcy fodder
Stock buybacks/Wages, 30 tu 1; 45% of pass through TAX CUTS 2 millionaires &
Workers get scraps
M/W NEXT GENERATION WILL PAY
Economic growth is down again. Latest report came out Friday. The big tax cuts from the Trump-GOP #TaxReform stimulated stock buybacks and lined the pockets of the wealthy, who use it to buy more property, resources and political control. Growth in #jobs and wages lags behind
So you are still trying to convince the American people that this isn't a #GOPTaxScam 

Too bad for you that the American people know it is a #TaxScamBill
GOD ALMIGHTY! Would you STOP w/ the NON-STOP PROPAGANDA & LIES! Don't believe a word of it. Your CONSTANT plugging & cheer-leading should tell how much of a Middle Class FAILURE this SCAM truly is. HERE is the TRUTH! This SCAM will KILL the Middle Class!
This millionaire revealed his tax return to show just how much the GOP tax law favors the rich 
Oh it’s working, Trump and friends just made $17 billion-way to go, idiots
Only Millionaires and above. Everything else is propaganda
#GOPTaxScam
You have committed crimes in the name of a treasonous leader. Your crimes have been seen by tens of MILLIONS of people. With all of the confusion running around, division, this one fact is CRYSTAL CLEAR! You've committed FELONIES protecting the  treasonous traitor in office.
You tweet this over and over again and it is still not true. The #GOPTaxScam is a tax break for the wealthiest Republicans! Now you want to fund it by stealing from Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. Shame on you. The midterms are coming. #BlueWave2018
It won’t be next year when families files 2018 taxes and can no longer deduct $4050 per family member. In 2017, it was deductible of $12700 plus $4050/person so married couple plus one child would have been $12150 personal exemption plus $12700 or $24850.
Working for who? Certainly not the middle class and poor. The small gains average workers get from this scam are being offset by higher grocery/gas prices. Wait until inflation takes off because of the ballooning deficit!
It's happening for us, $2500 dollars more in raises. Love it! Can't wait for more! Trump Rocks
How many did a stock buy-back and are cutting jobs?
You see! You are ALL LIARS!  Nothing but LIES & PROPAGANDA! This Tax Cut SCAM is nothing more then helping out your rich cronies (and yourselves) make MORE money, all at the expense of the deficit & Middle Class! YOU SOLD OUT AMERICA! Time to vote you OUT!

It's time to act on these unactknoledged special access programs. They work outside the Constitution and are breaking many, many laws. Take our military and invade these places and seaze all projects. Bring these people to justice and peace to our planet!
US Citizen, I don't know if this is intentional but your tweets are locked and cannot be retweeted.
PLEASE STOP WITH YOUR LIES! Don't any of you read your tweets, and with knowing what is ACTUALLY occurring, and what you are trying to CONVINCE US is occurring, look at them and see how stupid they are????
Commentary from a post truth view of the world.
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS Better expand your messaging for the midterm elections. This single message isn’t going to get it done.
You need to really push to get the Republican message out. Liberals are all excited to vote Trump out by voting Democrats in so they can try to impeach the President. Republicans need to get together, start doing the work of the people, and pass the money for the wall and DACA!
#MAGA

Please stop trying to sell me on this piece of crap tax reform that has already been approved. Seems like this must be the only thing you can hang on to as an "accomplishment" for 2018.  Hey- why not fire a priest. Oh wait.. another accomplishment in the bag...
LOL  Still having trouble getting those stories.
Can we pass legislation that states all those against tax cuts forfeit theirs to be split among those who favor it?
#KochBrothers and other rich campaign donors are getting huge payback
YOU LIE
Really!  I call B S!
I see an investigation coming at some of you and you know why
Tax “reform” and the impact to the budget deficit is not conservative. I want lower tax the right way via smaller government. It’s insane you’ve let your fandom for Trump cause you to stray so far from core republican principles. I won’t be supporting the GOP until Trump is gone.
Why do you continue this propaganda when we all know it is not true? Corporations got massive tax cuts but are not using them on product development and new jobs as promised.  Until they do, this law is a huge failure.  Just more $ for the rich.  Sad!
500 companies? Out of how many millions of companies? 

Oh, the Fortune 500? 

Only tge ruch benefit from the tax/shyster plan.
Yeah that extra $9 a week makes a huuuuuge difference in Fairfield County CT.
I would not enumerate the Kochs and Mercers, as well as big corporations as “millions”.  They may have saved millions on their taxes, but only a few will truly benefit from the #TrumpTaxScam.

Lies lies lies.  We are so done with ya’ll
Fake. But thanks so much for giving that BLUE WAVE an extra push by robbing the poor t give t th ultra rich!
House Republicans, understand this, NO WALL in '18, NO WIN in '18! If the Army Corps of Engineers can build our dams, they can build our wall! Live it or lose!
#TaxReform for the super rich. The Greed Over People (GOP) party will pay  dearly, as the income disparity widens and corruption is uncovered.  The Blue Tsunami  is coming.
#TaxCutsAndJobsAct is weaponized, #trumprussia #hybridwar and will kill hundreds of thousands of our needy citizens, children, disabled, sick and elderly people instead of soldiers as in traditional warfare. History will call this evil legislation a weapon of mass destruction
For all of your BS propaganda on the # GOPTaxScam, the facts are that most of the benefits go to the rich!  13% of tax cut savings will go to employee benefits, 43% will go to investors in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.  Plus it adds TRILLIONS to the deficit!

...hours being cut, no bonuses, locations closing, stock buy backs...
500 companies?  Out of how many across the nation?  Millions?
Yeah, your #TaxSCAM is what's triggered the #BlueWaveComing2018 - congratulations, #FailedCongress.  You're why we're coming in November...
Can’t write off working from home (I’m a nurse case manager). Can’t write off church contributions, can’t write off nursing license, can’t write off donations, can’t write off mileage. Taking more out of my checks. TAX REFORM IS FOR THE WEALTHY!!
Guess while those 500 companies reap those benefits the American people suffer from tainted lettuce, vehicle recall because someone is cutting corners in it's the workers and families that's been shortchanged of these benefits.
Scam to take care of the corporations and the rich...hey Paulie, why was the chaplain fired you POS ?


#stockbuybacks
So how many coal miners or steelworkers in the USA can say they are working and getting the benefits they deserved? Oh it's those big corporations receiving the benefits while  small companies and workers lose.
@tedlieu
Savings to rich & corporations? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Savings to poor & middle class?
$
Increased deficit?
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Housing the poor? For single moms and the elderly? LETS RAISE RENT ON THEM! 
You misspelled "dozens of corporations"
Budget deficit for March was 300 billion dollars.  Rich people and corporations doing very well.
Your base is not economically anxious - they have anxiety about their status as a MINORITY in the US - as are you. 
Enjoy your power while it lasts - the #BlueTsunami will take you down and call you to account for aiding and abetting a TRAITOR!
Right!  Not that Americans shouldn't believe you...but put up the list of companies!  Otherwise, stop spreading lies!  
I get $30-$50 more in my pay check a week.
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES YOU SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED THAT IT'S ONLY 500
This would be impressive if you were talking about a single county in a single state, not the entire US
