If your tax cuts are working so well, why is the US deficit increasing so rapidly?
Our gov't feels like it's falling apart because we now have a president who thinks he's above the law and the Legislative Branch of our gov't is missing in action! My 401K has tanked along with many others and all you can do is tweet some info that you clearly spun for us? SCARY!
The @USCBO report projects a 1-year spike followed by a sharp drop in GDP growth, with the average being only 1.9% over the next 10 years! Well below the 3% promised by Trump-GOP, and even below the average of the last 5 years. Tax cuts for the wealthy do not grow #jobs or wages
Know anything about any raids today?
You missed a few headlines today. The GOP tax plan means short-term gains for the economy, but federal debt is primed to explode, CBO analysis says
In other news, even though I’m having a heart attack, my eyes work fine.
WHAT ABOUT THE 1.9 TRILLION TRILLON TRILLON $$$$ INCREASE TO THE NATIONAL DEBT???????come on
Just gonna leave this here...
Not gonna mention how you just blew up the deficit huh?
How dare you not protecting Muller & talking about budget??? You have no idea where you will stand in Nov. we won't forget it, America won't forget it, you chose a traitor over our country. YUU All ARE TRAITORS TOO.
And the deficit grows and grows and grows unchecked by the corrupt @GOP
NON-STOP PROPAGANDA!  This Tax Cut SCAM is all the GOP has really accomplished! It IS a disaster for the Middle Class! ONLY the RICH are TRULY benefitting.  But, if they just keep praising it over & over & over, eventually people will start to believe the LIE & PROPAGANDA! DON'T!
#GOPTaxScam is ruining our country only the ultra wealthy got meaningful tax breaks! 88% of tax breaks went to the top 1%!
How do you expect an increase in consumer spending when OUR taxes are higher because you stole our deductions to give bigger tax cuts to the rich & corps & WE are paying your taxes because your too cheap to pay your own!
Sooo...I just checked and noticed our budget is 800 billionish, and I recall trump stating we were going to push 700 billion into the military this year....did I mishear him, is he talking out of his ass, or are all of you fucking litterally insane?
Can I give  you my answer in Nov ? #2018

Your #TaxHeist bill blows up the deficit to help the rich and corporations while hurting the working middle class. #VoteThemOut #TaxScam @SenatorCollins @HouseGOP
stop lying
@thedemocrats would pummel @gop in November simply on an impeachment platform.
And another one.  Yellen and other economists say tax cuts are blowing up the budget
Why aren't the GOP/NRsy impeaching the WH monster and not investigating the cabinet swamp monsters. Blue Wave.
Way to gloss over the ONE TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT NEXT FISCAL YEAR. God, you people lie even when you’re telling the truth.
“ I’m a Republican, read this to me please “
Pathetic GOP. Look what sort of buffoonery you support? https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-if-farmers-get-hit-theyll-understand … #GOPComplicit #TradeWars
You fixed the figures before releasing them to the public. Republicans work for a dictatorship run by Trump.
Peddling more bull manure. It’s almost like ya stepped in it, dragging it around and you can’t smell it anymore. But we can. November a Blue wave will wash it all clean
#GOPTaxScam
Trillion dollar deficit morons
Help us huge campaigns help us clean up America now
Work with us call us now call us now
Showing 2trillion more debt added.
"...short term growth..."
"...long term increased deficit..."

Yeah - #WeThePeople know, and come November we'll be taking corrective measures.  If I were you, I'd dust off my resume...

#FailedCongress #LootingOfAmerica #NeverAgain #VoteThemOut
#LockThemAllUp
What it showed is that #America 's #MAGA 's children and grandchildren debt has moved up in time thanks to @POTUS @GOP #TaxCutPonziScheme Every Repub POTUS since Reagan have left Office w/bigger debt. Conservatives my ass. Every Dem left w/smaller debt from where it started.
Mmm - something is missing in this...Actually a trillion somethings are missing #ProtectMueller
Really? For how long?
If GOP were to bring about action to fund the wall, cut back on spending such as aid to China, Soros orgs& other spending abominations, crush gov insurance for good BEFORE 2018 elections, you’d do a lot to get votes for GOP candidates countrywide.
And the debt, fatheads?
You're leaving out something
You might want to address the leadership role that #MichaelCohen has at the #rnc
Get to work on appointees and Border Control Bill!
Your “dear leader” is going down in flames!
