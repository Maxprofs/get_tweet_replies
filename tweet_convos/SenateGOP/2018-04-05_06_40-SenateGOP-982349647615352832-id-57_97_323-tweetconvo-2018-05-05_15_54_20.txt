REPUBLICANS I LOVE THIS GUYS
Congratulations on your signature legislation! It will be bearing fruits for decades!
Monday is CBO score day. How will gop distract from this one?
I think most people haven't caught on to just how MASSIVE the federal debt projections will be in the CBO's fresh, long-term projections due MONDAY.

Buckle. UP.

Soon many of the members of the GOP will leave office... they must be followed and held responsible to the fullest extent of the law
More lies from the gop
only way we will be able to http://heal.is  to make the laws stand for what and the way they are written.not because someone wants to change or deviate from the laws because it dont suit there negative agenda
we all would like unity, but you can not have unity, when in all reality.even the ones that are making the laws.are breaking the laws.and allowing the destruction of American history and trying to destroy another's culture and history.
and going back to biblical principles, would be a great start.and even then, you will not be united, because of all the liberalism that has filtered into our societies.a cancer to America
Ure full of shit

The "path," Mr. Scott is ending single-parenthood. Right?
FIRE Scott Pruitt!  The "in your face" corruption of this admin must end.  Republican "leaders" must move away from the trough.  The Trump & cabinet smash and grab of this country's wealth must end now.   Pruitt must go, or you do!

Don’t act like this is for middle-class America. If you’re going to give a tax break that favors the wealthy and corporations at least embrace it. I’m tired of the smoke and mirrors.
Will you get a photo op & attend meeting w/Putin?  Your biggest donors want that, and you could use more tutoring for moving the country along to fascism faster than you've done so far.  On behalf of average SC voters of course.  #GOPTraitors #PutinAmericaFirst
Trump: I love you Senator Tim.

Are you ok with your boss sending troops to the border to stop the invading army from Mexico? No thoughts on the coming trade war and how that will impact SC citizens? How about the debt getting worse? Anything? #Complicit

Looking forward to reading this and also hearing you & @TGowdySC speak tomorrow night in Cola.
