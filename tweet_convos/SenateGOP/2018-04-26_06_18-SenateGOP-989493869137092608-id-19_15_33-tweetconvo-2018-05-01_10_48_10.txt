The opioid crisis is ravaging our country. After 7 bipartisan hearings, the Senate health committee this week unanimously passed the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018 to take the next step in helping states fight the opioid crisis. #HELPFightsOpioids 
Nice idea Senator.. .

BTW: Your constituents have been damaged by the 115th Congress in too many areas to mention here.

Throw your constituents a bone:  Save Net Neutrality!

I’m not buying your push.
And Jackson reportedly provided “a large supply” of Percocet, a prescription opioid, to a White House military office staff member, throwing his own medical staff “into a panic” when the medical unit could not account for the missing drugs
Blankenship, a Republican loyalist of President Donald Trump, is running an America First-style campaign and calls himself an “American competitionist,” but he admires China’s state-controlled economy and has expressed interest in gaining Chinese citizenship.
Great that the POTUS nominated a drug addict for the VA in the same week!

Billions of taxpayer dollars can be better spent in protecting our borders! That would keep these drugs out and resolve 99.9% of the problem. But politicians want an “issue” to use to grab taxpayer $ to line their pockets. Secure our borders instead...that IS your job!!! 
How about Republicans putting adequate funding into the program!. Put your money where your mouth is.
How many more will die because all you do is talk and offer half measures?

Y'all profited, our friends and families DIED!  Simple as that!  #MAGA #DrainTheSewer (YOU!) #LockYOUUp #WeThePeople #GreatAwakening
You're kidding right? We've got an Admiral who is accused of handing out pills while patients with chronic pain are being threatened with you taking away their healthcare and are treated like criminals in order to justify their prescriptions.
The problem will continue as long as we make it okay to be a drug addict.  Make it a crime.  Arrest them.  Then problem will resolve.
Don't just arrest the drug dealers.  Arrest the users.  They're breaking the law too.
