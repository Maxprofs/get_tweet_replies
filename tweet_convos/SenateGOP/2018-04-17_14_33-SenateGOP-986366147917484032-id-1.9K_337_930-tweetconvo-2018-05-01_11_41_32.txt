McConnell on special counsel protection bill: "I'm the one who decides what we take to the floor. That's my responsibility as the Majority Leader and we will not be having this on the floor of the Senate."

You're compromised and your wife shouldn't be working for Trump #Conflict
Elaine Chao might be doing a good job...Idk, but McConnell must go....yesterday.
Transportation Secretary 
H'mmm very interesting. I see why he's all in with Trump on coal. He has a personal interest. More reason to dislike him.
As things get more serious, and they will... I hope you choose the right side. The correct side, not the side of Trump. If you don’t, we will know you have been compromised! Good luck to you & the GOP/RNC. You’ll probably need it! #BlueWave2018 #TheResistance
It's obvious McConnell is compromised.  Not only from oligarchs like the Koch Brothers, but also dirty money from Russia and people tied to Russia. That's why he has been fighting the Russian investigation since the summer of 2016 AND doing NOTHING to protect our 2018 elections.
It makes me ill that our politicians are so corrupt!!!
Not all of our politicians are corrupt. Just sociopaths attracted to power -people like Mitch McConnell.
Have you lost your mind?
He never had one to begin with!

Retail store closures are happening at a record pace in the wake of #GOPTaxScam. Rich get richer, jobs & wage growth not happening. GOP is a fraud unit in the service of Russian kleptocracy.
Popular retail chains are closing because Wall Street private equity firms overloaded them with debt and are cashing out. McConnell's solution? Reward Wall Street even more.
You're working for the donors.  We see you.
Old Mitch knows the exchange rate for rubles.
Leader? You’re no leader. Not even ALLOWING a vote on the bill to protect mueller. Disgraceful. Why? I haven’t heard ONE good reason, cuz there is NONE! You won’t be in that position long. & if he’s fired, the COUNTRY is blaming YOU for not taking measures to prevent this crisis!
The country and HISTORY won’t forget.
What money? I don't make over a million $, so I didn't get any money. My utility bills, groceries and has have gone up, not my pay.
Me either!
So, it's already established knowledge that Trump is bought and paid for by Putin (per Ryan's acknowledgement back in 2016). What was your price tag for selling out Americans?
He married Elaine Chao
Oh yeah, shipping breaks & logistics kickbacks. Forgot that.
Don’t forget the drug smuggling.
What an oxymoron “Leader McConnell” is.
I think you meant to say “OxyMORON?!
You are a walking advertisement for term limits in the Senate. Please just retire and be old on your own time. #countryoverparty #partisanhack
Even as the #economy is starting to thrive, Democrats want to repeal these historic tax cuts and claw back your money from #TaxReform. But make no mistake, Republicans will continue to stand and fight for the…
If your BS was taxed we could completely eliminate income tax.
Tax scam raises the debt faster and faster

We know that's why we are voting you all out at #Midterms
more lies
Also you can have my 12$ a pay period to give toward healthcare or education.
why wont you protect Mueller?
Maybe because he has something to hide, eh, @SenateMajLdr? 
Who do you think you are kidding?  Tax reform is a sham!  You guys will reap the YUGE benefits.

Claw your face.
If you truly fight for the American people - protect the Mueller investigation!
Like how you fight for #disabledveterans in Kentucky that are being ravaged by #opioids by the @DeptVetAffairs?  #MedicalCannabis has proven to help struggling veterans.

Liar
How does it feel to be so despised @SenateMajLdr?
You're a crook who stole a SCOTUS seat that was rightfully 44's to appoint & you're proud of it. Your tax scam robs from average Americans to reward your donors. You stand with traitors, aiding & abetting by refusing to protect the Mueller investigation. Your mistake: we see you.
He’s part of the cover up for Russia
McConnell....Lying....Again!!!!
I call BS.  Some people may be getting a little more but not as much as the cost of living has risen.  A handful of companies have given bonuses but the majority of Fortune 500 companies are doing stock buy backs which benefits Wall Street and their investors. Do your homework.
You’re a criminal
You’re a piece of garbage. Why won’t you protect Mueller? What do you have to hide, Mitch????
When have you ever fought for us? #45 , you and @SpeakerRyan are pure liars.
If by “people” you mean dividends and buybacks  https://twitter.com/kim/status/943302733485948928?s=21 … #GOPTaxScam #BlueWaveComing2018

#MuellerInvistigation #TrumpCrimeFamily #GOPartyOverCountry #BlueTsunami2018
You can take my few bucks a day in exchange for you to #ProtectMueller. Not that I expect you to take me up on the offer, #TreasonTurtle Mitch.
GOP stands for the wealthy . GOP policies punish most Americans .
@FBI please open an investigation into this man, as his desire not to protect the special counsel smells horribly of both conspiring to obstruct justice and his potential complicity in the ongoing Russian efforts to attack our democracy

On @TeamCavuto, McConnell shuts the door on the bipartisan bill to protect Mueller: “I’m the one who decides what we take to the floor, that’s my responsibility as majority leader, we’ll not be having this on the floor of the Senate.”
You betcha! The tax cut for the upper echelon and corporations needs to go. Do you ever think about the poor in Kentucky?
Mitch McConnell the same man who held up the vote on Merrick Garland and would not endorse letting the American people about Russian interference in the 2016 election and now won't protect Mueller. #VoteThemOut2018
Omg shut up, you sound just like trump. Not a compliment
#ProtectMueller
I am a 25 year veteran high school teacher only seeing $20 extra per month in my pay check. That tax scam bill is a sham, ballooning our deficit, only to reward your wealthy donors. We need to see Trump's taxes that repubs have neglected to demand! Shameful!
I’m seeing an extra $280.00 a month. That’s $3,360.00 more “crumbs” in my pocket  a year...Thank you President Donald J. Trump !
Our 3rd world roads, highways, & bridges need fixing. Teachers need raises, class sizes reduced, & school supplies need funding! Go enjoy your extra $$ now at the expense of a fiscally healthy future, as we watch the deficit blow up!
 This is a joke just like the entire GOP You only support rich, white men I can't wait until the day the Senate and House are filled with only @SenateDems and @HouseDemocrats My hope is after the next 3 elections we will have a Congress of only Democrats #BlueWave2018
You & @SecElaineChao need to listen to #SmallBusinesstrucking &@OOIDA on the outrageous Tax you allowed to happen with the #ELDMandate ! As it so far has eaten up any gains most would have received ! And especially live animal transportation ! But when inflation hits the fan ?
#meetrealtruckers #eldorme #TheMajority in the trucking industry can't be wrong! #ELDMandate is hurting economy and will continue to affect Americans as cost of goods continue to rise!
Yes. We want to take OUR money back from YOU and the KOCH'S and CORPORATIONS and use it to fund schools, roads, and the safety net.

The President is insane and you don’t care Mitch.
You are not going be able to escape the carnage that he absolutely will bring down.
Mitch, simplifying your tax scam for you. 2018 wkg class get $1.50 in their paycheck 2019 pay$1.60 in taxes no gain for wkng class just blowing smoke & lying. On the other hand the 1% gets $10 this year & next year they get another $10 so why shouldn’t your tax scam be repealed?
#MuellerInvestigation should be protected from the maniacal potus you serve
One of the three-heads in the ongoing #GOPCorruption
.@SenateMajLdr , put a vote out on floor to protect Mueller, or are you conspiring with Russia, too?

How many jobs were created this quarter vs previous quarters? Say going back the last 12 quarters.... just curious.

1/ "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined Wells Fargo $185 million for the astounding abuse of opening more than two million unauthorized deposit and credit card accounts."
2/"Then, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell employed a rarely used procedure to force a rushed vote on a bill to defang the CFPB.
Ok, now here’s a quiz. Can you guess which member of Congress & his wife holds more Wells Fargo stock than any other?"
See ya in NOVEMBER Mitch.

The GOP Tax Cuts Are Such a Blatant Scam That They Might Change the Whole Conversation via @thenation
Already, Mitch, price increases for health insurance and at the gas pump have wiped out 80% of the tax break my family and I got.

My guess is that YOUR tax break was a lot more.

Don't leave us guessing, Mitch. Tell us how much YOU got away with in the #TaxScam.
No. The #TrumpTaxScam or #GOPTaxScam only benefits the wealthy. Even Corker admitted it was a mistake to pass this #TrumpedUpTrickleDown crap.

You look pastie white. Ask The  One for some tanning advice.
The economy was thriving way before Donnie took office. I lost everything under your #TaxScamBill. I’ll anxiously await the #BlueWave2018 coming and hope we can reverse the #TaxScamBill.

McConnell you will be known for how CORRUPT you are in the history books. You shame your family AND the USA.
All along McConnell has been complicit in the cover up.  Strange, that. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …

Mitch is all the proof anyone needs that we need term limits on Congress. And by the way, You are a lying POS and a stain on Kentucky.
You're a pig Mitch McConnell you belong in prison right alongside Trump traitorous f****** pig
@SenateMajLdr
Yes repeal these non-historic farce on taxes. #TaxTheRich
When are you gonna fight because we would all like to see that anytime soon
You are not fighting for the American people, you are fighting for millionaires and billionaires who contribute to your campaigns.  Time for you to exit right, Mitch.  Kentucky deserves better.
Put the bill on the floor, Mitch. Protect Bob Mueller or resign. You're a disgrace to the nation.
Shame on you for putting party over country. #FireproofMueller #Mueller #Hypocrisy

Either these @HouseGOP/@SenateGOP

You’ll stand until midterms, when you’ll all crumble ... like dominoes falling flat, 1 by 1. Can’t wait!

Remember when the Russians hacked the RNC!  They must have some MAJOR Kompromat on McConnell! 
He too is being Black Mailed If he isn’t doing his JOB than he needs to GO! #VoteHimOut    
McConnell is COMPROMISED! 
He is being backmailed! Hence the reason why he wouldn’t let Obama Go public about the  Election Interference, House Russia Close Out Invest & now doesn’t want 2 protect Mueller! It’s obvious he is part of the coverup! Remember  hacked the RNC!

What are you so afraid of, Mitch?  Better yet, what does Russia have on you?  WE will find out.
You lie. And you use your office to obstruct justice. Your tax bill sucks big time. And you’re shielding the most corrupt administration we’ve ever come close to having. Plus side: you’re destroying your party.

Fk U! We need less crooks like you!! You #TaxReformBill was a #TaxScam 
YOU greed will end up costing our country dearly!! What about our #NationalDebt
A #BlueWaveIsComing2018 

You’ve given billions of dollars to the wealthy and stripped the poor and elderly of their healthcare. You are a true example of the @GOP and xtianity.
Please you are morally bankrupt.
Oh screw you Mitch. You all are now crying your crocodile tears over the deficit, taking aim at medicare, medicaid, and social security; local taxes go up as federal programs go bust. @GOP hates the poor and middle class.
Would you not like to do some good before you die, And it looks like you don`t have long. Don`t go to your grave being remembered as the man allways trying to scam the hard working families of this Country.
Retire you ole fool. No one cares about a friggin word you say. Go back to Kentucky - where y'all live pre civil rights.
If I know this, Mueller knows this. You are over.
Take a look in the mirror you TREASONOUS cash-bloated ogre!  Your era is ending.  Hope you can survive on the $71,000,000.00 you've stuffed away at the expense of hard-working Americans.
This is the best description I have heard thus far.  Thank you.
May you rot in hell you racist turtle necked bastard
Well that is a torrent of total BS.  Didn't you grab enough for the top 5% while screwing over the American public?
he's a nasssssssty little turtle.
Do your job and protect Mueller.
Why won’t you vote on the bill to protect Mueller? You know that the POTUS is daily trying to find ways to discredit the investigations. Last night, in Lucia vs. the United States, a former legal aide to Scalia drafted a challenge to executive firing/hiring power re: the SEC, but
seeks broader application from SCOTUS, enabling the president to fire any government official directly. If SCOTUS agrees, Trump could use that to fire Rosenstein and Mueller and anyone else who doesn’t agree with him. Further, Manafort’s lawyers have now filed a Supplemental
Brief to challenge Rosenstein and Mueller’s reach. It’s a good brief; if the court agrees, it would compromise the investigation. So, knowing that Trump is volatile, vindictive, demands personal loyalty without understanding how govt works, what is your response to my question?
First, the economy was thriving before you twits did what you did.  Yes, I am getting darn angry with what you all are doing and how you are behaving.  You complicit JA's need a wake up call or to be knocked down a peg or two.  But right now what has me fired up is this...1.
Your statement when a bipartisan bill to protect Mueller was asked for a vote, your response...“I’m the one who decides what we take to the floor, that’s my  responsibility as majority leader, we’ll not be having this on the floor  of the Senate.” Get a clue bucko!  I won't be  2
as diplomatic as Schumer was -- because you need a reality check.  We are talking about our country - are you even cognizant of what Trump is doing and how he is behaving? Or did you happen to drink that kool-aid I'm hearing about. What are you hiding?!?  Tell us now!!!
I'm sitting here fighting cancer, while you all are destroying our country and behaving like idiots, letting some idiot ruin our country while you all gleefully destroy anything remotely resembling our Country, our values and our citizens!  What is wrong with you guys!
#WeCallBS
WATCH: Big corporations have spent nearly $235 billion on stock buybacks. That helps executives and shareholders, not American workers -- even @FoxNewsSunday isn't denying that fact. 
Even as the investigation is growing, “leader” McConnell kills the bill that would protect Mueller. The “senator” is complicit.
you mean the #GOPTaxScam because all I'm seeing are lay offs and my grocery bill just went up.  I see clearly who you stand and fight for, and it's not the regular Joe but the Rich & the corporations.
The only thing the GOP stands for is corporate welfare. The “tax cut” is a complete and total scam only concerned about the wealthy. It’s time to #DitchMitch with a #BlueWave
Just stop. You and the Koch Brothers got what you wanted. You pulled a fast one on the American people & got your tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans & screwed everyone else. So just stop and shut the f*ck up.
Hi Mitch!! Would you like your treason with a side of borscht, or your borscht with a side of treason? Thanks!
And with that we come full circle from 2016, when McConnell refused bipartisanship for a warning about Russian tampering during the election. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …
But Mitch you devised a budget that obligated tax payers to spend $1.3 Trillion dollars we don’t have!
Can’t wait to vote you out.  You’re lining your pockets and those of your rich donors, not protecting the rule of law and putting a morally bankrupt party over country.
You’re so full of sh*t it’s amazing you believe it’s not totally obvious to everyone you sh*t on

Anyone can take off all checks and counter checks and and drive the Debt up and you have!   You are nothing but a puppet of Donald Trump and it is sickening!!  SAD

Protect Mueller 
Protect Medicare
Protect Social Security 
Protect healthcare
I remember when the @GOP opposed large deficits because they believed in fiscal responsibility.
Your @gop happy tweets cannot change reality and make your #GOPTaxScam good.  You’ve blown up the deficit to make the top earners wealthier, at the expense of everyone else.

#ReverseRobinHood
#RepealtheTrumpTax
#VoteThemAllOut
And Democrats will continue to stand and fight to take back the House and Senate this year and repeal your #TaxScam!
Make no mistake Mitch, while Trump is leading this 3 ring circus, we all know YOU were and are instrumental in allowing this FREAK SHOW to continue. We all know you are standing for Trump and Russia first. I hope they have something good on you to make it all worth it. #TRAITOR
Stop lying
Protect Mueller. Don’t be the coward you have been your entire political career.

Why won’t you let the Mueller bill go to the floor for a vote?
How about protecting democracy and the special counsel investigation you traitor! #partyovercountry #turtlethetraitor
You will go down in history as ruining American Democracy. You block debate, negotiation and compromise not allowing your fellow senators bring things up for debate. Gaming the system is not what the founding fathers wanted. Karma is a bitch, and she's riding the bluewave
We know it’s a scam. #GOPtaxscam
You are a sleazy politician. Can’t wait for you to lose in your next election.
Rosenstein? Does he not need protection either? 45 is the one on the witch hunt, trying to find any reason to fire the people controlling this investigation. DO SOMETHING!
So now you're actively assisting Trump in  obstructing justice? I wonder how a turtle looks in an orange jumpsuit?
Starting to thrive? The economy hasn’t seen this slowness of growth since the last @GOP POTUS was in the White House. Kudos for getting some people to believe you’ve actually done it instead of @BarackObama. Some people will believe anything.
We. Are. Not. Trump's. Stupid. Base.
They want to reduce the debt you and your party of thieves created.  Stealing from the Poor, giving to the rich and destroying the middle class.   Your time is limited, November will be here before you know it and your fellow rats are leaving the sinking ship #BlueWave2018
Yep cause by 2020 everyone but the wealthy will be paying more money in taxes and healthcare. You all are out in November! DISGUSTING LIARS!
I like your use of the term ‘historic’. Incredibly vague and purposely avoids the cuts being beneficial to the majority of people.  The 1% sure are American people.
You are a feckless, cowardly Vichy puppet and toady boy who puts party over country. May you forever sport the Trump tattoo.
On @TeamCavuto, McConnell shuts the door on the bipartisan bill to protect Mueller: “I’m the one who decides what we take to the floor, that’s my responsibility as majority leader, we’ll not be having this on the floor of the Senate.”
Hello....someone has to pay this $20 TRILLION DEBT!!
There is nothing historic about giving tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires except history repeating itself..... increased deficits, greater divide between top 1% and the rest of the population, record profits for corporations and no trickle down!
It's not just Democrats.
And you won't protect Mueller. Hence, you're facilitating a traitor, and the attack by Russia on our electoral system. In other words, you're the enemy.
Sure you can keep that morgage deduction if you want it. The only problem is for married, filing jointly, the interest must be more than $24,000 before you can deduct one cent.  Your followers won’t know until after midterms, but the rest do. Nice try!
Why are our politicians simply unable to speak plainly and truthfully?  The US economy has be recovering and "thriving" for years.  I guess politicians think Americans are super dumb and can be easily manipulated.
For the rich American people.
80% will go abroad according to CBO! Did your momma drop you on your head when you were younger? Idiot!
you and your budget killing tax giveaway for the rich are killing America. And I have a question.  You are not protecting Mueller, are you complicit? Is that the reason?  #ProtectMueller
You have a hand in all of this.  Your time is coming.
Mitch, I love ya' and my family has donated heavily for 70 years. 
Here's a piece of advice, don't use yourself as the spokesperson for tax cuts. 
Please.
You mean that the Republicans will continue to stand and fight for the rich.
You've misspelled "The GOP created historic debt/deficit to benefit our billionaire donors & now we plan to use it as an excuse to destroy Social Security & Medicare."
You are stealing from the American people...
Tax cut my ass...I pay in and next year we will pay more.
You and your rich friends made out like bandits on this deal!  The middle class is paying for your tax cuts!
Thank you ma'am! very well said! Middle class people will be the ones to pay for that trillion dollar deficit. All so billionaires can buy a new yacht or mansion. Man, f*** the GOP. Health ins. Premiums going up gas going up everything going up. Tax cuts my ass!GOP SUCKS!!!
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY NEUTERED BY 45 you SOB not allowing bipartisan legislation to the floor! 75% of American insist it is introduced and you ignore! Koch brothers owned and operated is all you are! Nothing for the People. Be sure to keep that out of your new constitution they want
What damn money are you talking about?
He may be getting a lot more money, but most of the middle class is getting (if they are lucky) $20 in a paycheck which is being eaten up by higher gas prices.. and more inflation to come.

"Chao joined the board of Wells in 2011- that’s when the Cons Fin Protection Bureau says Wells Fargo began to look the other way while its employees, desperate to keep up with unrealistic sales targets, opened up 2 million unauthorized accounts on behalf of unsuspecting customers

You oversaw the #GOPTaxScam   You are a treasonous turtle. Stop your bitchin’ and allow a vote on the legislation to block Mueller’s ouster.
Did you say stand in fight that's almost funny
You are a traitor.


After backing down on the sanctions & using backdoor channels to notify the Russians, Trump is back in favor with the Kremlin. New propaganda directives are in. Russian state TV hosts can't hold back their laughter…
Did you pay taxes on the $ Russia gave you? Or did you keep it in the family? You are a party over country, traitor. We know why you won’t protect Mueller...he has evidence on you too! Do you see your power slipping from your hands? Into handcuffs?
Until you bring to the senate floor the bipartisan legislation to #ProtectMueller Americans don't want to hear anything out of your mouth.
Hi Mitch, most Americans haven’t seen any changes. Say, why do you get a free gym membership, but you vote against measures which would broaden health insurance coverage for the rest of us? And JFC, put on a bathing suit! 
As recently as 2009, female senators couldn’t use the pool in the congressional gym because some of their male colleagues liked to swim naked. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/us/politics/collins-ernst-klobuchar-heitkamp.html …

Over 1000 replies to this thread and not a single one is in your favor, Mitch! SAD!!
We'll see you in Nov! 
GM is laying off 1500 Ohioans. I’m paying more in taxes and in healthcare for me and my family. Its time to retire, Mitch!
Historic temporary tax cuts, so really just a scam.

Thus is why Moscow Mitch won’t bring #mueller bill to the floor. @SenateMajLdr works for Putin. The entire @gop are Russian agents
Mitch McConnell's super PAC took $1 million in 2017 from Russian born billionaire who made a large portion of his money under Putin in Russia. He's taken $2.5 million in total from the same Russian. #DitchMitch …
