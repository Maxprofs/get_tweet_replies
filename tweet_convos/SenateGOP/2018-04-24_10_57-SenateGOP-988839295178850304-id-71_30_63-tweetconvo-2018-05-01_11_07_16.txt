Do you teach your children & grandchildren to lie & deceive people the same as you?

A massive wave is building: Democrat @SteveSternNY took New York's 10th Assembly District Tuesday night by double digits, winning a seat that has been in @GOP hands for over three decades. http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/384746-dems-flip-new-york-state-seat-that-republicans-have-held-for-three-decades#.WuBRpdL8CAs.twitter … #RedToBlue #DemWave
GOP Leadership is an oxymoron.  This group should all resign.
When are you confirming the new VA Secretary? We need extensive REFORM in the VA.  Your are killing these people with your delays. Get off your ASS and vote now!
You mean the guy who mispelled his own name on Trumps health report, the one who can't read a scale, drank on the job and over prescibed medications? Perfect pick only the best people.
unsubstantiated allegations. isn't it interesting he has been physician to multiple presidents and all of a sudden he's a problem.
Unsubstantiated because Fox didnt report it?
No dear. I don’t watch tv and I don’t take anyone’s word for it. I go to the source ie the ppl who are objecting and research from there. Seems only been a problem since nominated. You’d think if he was that incompetent he would have been dismissed by all previous presidents.
Leaders? Oh, really? The ones who remain silent while watching a POTUS trash the country? So glad the GOP is going down.
Start supporting Trump. Get the wall built. Stop ILLEGALS from voting
Otherwise known as “unabashed lies to the camera”
notice they are all creepy old white men.....
corruption city!
On what the nothing they got done and the nothing they plan on doing and the reason why the Republicans can’t get on the same page? We’ve heard it before!
@POTUS called N Korea’s leader ‘honourable’.
One more session of the @GOP liars club and bullshit singing
Lies of wealthy white man
THANK YOU CHRIS COONS, A GOOD PATRIOTE & WE THANK YOU PROFUSELY!

Billionaires & corporations are making out like bandits under the #GOPTaxScam. Since passage of the bill, we've seen $260 BILLION in stock buybacks, and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says by…
There’s no leadership in the Senate. That’s what is missing. Need new leadership. Currently leader is to set in his way.
THE "DO NOTHING" REPUBLICAN SENATE WALKING AROUND IN CIRCLES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why would we want to listen to BS
Senate Republicans and McConnell can all go to hell! And I am Republican!

DEMOCRATS ARE INEPT, USELESS & KNOW NOTHING!. NEVER VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT PEOPLE NEVER.
There are some advantages to have Pompeo served the intelligence community but that doesn’t translate into a perfect or mist obvious fit for ussos the concern is over upholding diplomacy above all to international situations everyone is entitled to their opinion
There’s an exciting,  inspiring bunch.  Get off your ass*s and get Trump’s nominees confirmed and the wall built, you useless slugs.
If we could only trust them
HARD PASS
Just go away and press your briefs.
Brief us on how you shaped America and got 7 Conservative judges for the 9th Circuit court of Appeals. That is a Legacy!
Leadership team, now that’s a frigging laugh....Mitchie you are a complete POS
The bigotry of racism clowns 
Don't blame the minority for your destruction of your party. They just call out your lies and corruption. Remember, you're the majority in all 3 branches of government. Keep burying yourselves with more lies and corruption...and you'll get pulled out on the carpet....
Pray for Senator McCain 
"Leadership" might be abit too optimistic
Did I just hear @SenateMajLdr say "let's see if they're serious about passing the bills"?
Are these the same bills that he buried for a full year as they tried to subvert the #POTUS agenda?
The POTUS had a great year. You took a free ride and did nothing. We haven't forgotten.
Where are the leaders?????

Actually, no thank you. #whatleadershipteam?
Oh my bad, were you talking about the guy who misspelt his name on trumps health report, can't read a bathroom scale, drank on the job and over-prescribed medications? Only the best people!
Nah
 Republican cry obstruction. Rich.


Lying about Military service is an automatic Go fuk yourself. If you Eunuches had a shred of decency, character, morals, ethics or a backbone you'd know that.
You are not LEADERS.  You are treasonous aholes that continue to enable & support a traitor.  You passed the #GOPTaxScam which primarily benefits the reach.  You continue to take money from the #NRA.  

#ComplicitGOP
What a joke. @ChrisCoons showed was grace is.
Republican "leadership" is an oxymoron.  All the @GOP are cowards who are either quitting or have forsaken their principles to trump.  #VoteThemOut
On this B.S. ?
