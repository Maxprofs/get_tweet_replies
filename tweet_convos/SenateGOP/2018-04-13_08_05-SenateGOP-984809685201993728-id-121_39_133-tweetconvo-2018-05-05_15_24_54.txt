Why did Republicans vote to rob #SocialSecurity if things re so great? Are you trying to cover for your @SmashAndGrab tax bill?
And the CBO says: http://www.newsweek.com/republican-tax-plan-donald-trump-cbo-884129 … #WTF #TrumpTaxScam #RIPGOP
The Market is highly volatile due to Trump's eradicate  tweets.  As the deficit grows inflation will start to rise.  No one with even a rudimentary understanding on economics would believe this tweet.  #TaxScam
Stock market down again today thanks to the fucking corrupt @GOP
99% Republicans on the shit list - stealing from Social Security, MAGGOTS. #MAGA  hope you've made tons of dough on your own, cuz SS is being pillaged!
Heh, ok boo. #BlueWaveComing2018
Lying gop.   Bright for donors and big business that received the fake tax scam!  GOP gone in November (and all running for cover now).
The first kite says it all.
Republicans are maxing out the country's credit card trying to make those that have to pay the bill like them.
You obviously are ignoring your increase to the National Debt.
The stock market tanked again. Are you crazy?

Don't go feeling anything #FakeChristian conservatives. 
Lots going on in this scoop. Big RNC fundraiser Elliott Broidy kept an ex-Playboy model on a paid sexual-services retainer. She got pregnant. Trump lawyer Michael Cohen negotiated a $1.6m hush-money payout. She had an abortion. https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-negotiated-1-6-million-settlement-for-top-republican-fundraiser-1523638726 …
I will say one thing.   You guys live is la la land.  You have absolutely no idea what’s going on in the White House or you just don’t give a damn about our country.
@SenMajLdr @GOP @SenateGOP if you don't act to crush this #MuellerWitchHunt, then ur nothing but a bunch of #politicaleunuchs like those at @TheJusticeDept!
Are u #politicaleunuchs who have boarded the #ShipofFools?
Do the right thing @SenateGOP - stop 45 from firing Mueller. The truth will come out and you might want to be on the right side if it for once!!
How about Congress getting to work on the very real crisis in #Syria? No actions, no  plan, and a complete lack of leadership. You are supposed to be an equal branch of government. You were not elected to be spectators. Do you job or we will #VoteThemOut. Stop wasting time!
There are 30 million companies in the U.S.  only 20  of the S&P 500 gave bonuses or raises since Trump / GOP tax cuts. 100% of rich people got huge tax cuts. Don't be fooled. MIDDLE-CLASS screwed again.
Remove Trump and it will be the greatest gift to America.  Simply a stain on our great history . An infection that was introduced to America by the Republican Party.  Shameful!

Lies

Fraid NOT! Tripling the deficit is NOT a good forecast! THOUSANDS loosing their jobs because HUNDREDS of stores are closing, not so bright! Having to cut SS and Medicare because you tax cut SCAM is draining the country, nope not bright. You're ALL LIARS.  Its ALL PROPAGANDA! LIES
I bet it's a sinking feeling. You reap what you sow.
@GOP Glad ur happy about that as a Holocaust is taking place in Syria with Putin’s help and no one in the world cares enough to help. U sure have ur priorities in place.
And 70% of America worried about the Country. Who writes this shit for you?
But what you haven't "got" is that you continue to praise a scam on the people and remain silent as we see an unfit POTUS.
EVERYTHING TRUMP TOUCHES DIES

I will not vote for any republican that does not support my President.
Shame on you and your #GOPTaxBillScam . How about taking care of the American people, not the dirtbag in the WH and your donors? #GunControlNow #NetNeutrality #PuertoRico #Healthcare. We need this, not tax cuts for the rich.
Uh!  Not for the people on this list!  Gone Baby Going...........
Time for spring cleaning. Time to take out Congressional and Senate Republicans. @GOP @BlueVotr @BlueNationUntd @BoldBlueWave #cleanhouse
It seems you Republicans are hiding away and avoiding the terrible truth about your complictness with the Trump administration. You have stabbed the American,people in the back. I can't wait for all,of you to be replaced
In case you didn’t know, spring started last month.
Get rid of Mitch and maybe the rest of the Republican Party will get that feeling.
Is that the best u can do with a gutter mouth Pres ranting &  raving on Twitter this morning for the works to see. Enough of this behavior.

STOP LYING TO US!  Deficit is soaring because of you.  Businesses are closing!  CEOs are taking record salaries while worker pay stagnates, insurance rates soar, taxes deductions decrease for middle class. #GOPTaxBillScam #GOPComplicit Greed Over People party!
Ummmm. NOT.
1.5 Trillion in debt is not a good thing
#RepublicanShitShow
Hahahaha perfect. The kite skyrockets then takes a nose dive. Exactly like the forecast as the $1.3 TRILLION debt starts suffocating us. Happy Friday!

Tell your @POTUS  to go PEE on ya!
Support our president and next spring will be swell too.
Glad it's spring somewhere
NOT AMERICA FIRST!
“We are experiencing a dangerous time in our country,” Comey writes, “with a political environment where basic facts are disputed, fundamental truth is questioned, lying is normalized and unethical behavior is ignored, excused or rewarded.”
Been waiting to see those  beautiful  Cherry blossoms #US

You have failed America! By the lack of complacency! #impeachment needs to begin for a peaceful spring!

Firing Rod Rosenstein would be a brazen attack on the Mueller investigation, the rule of law, and our democratic insitutiions.  w/@NormEisen

.@SenateGOP Nothing is looking bright. This is because you stole 1.5 Trillion dollars and we got NOTHING. #republicans gave it all to the rich. No #healthcare no teachers no jobs. #Trumpdumpcare #Resistance #Emma4Change
Is that Friday feeling where the economy collapses like in the @GOP caused 2008 depression?
Thank you GOP. Now please enact a law to protect Mueller and the Republic and I'll be glad to enjoy the good economic times as you suggest.
We all know that Friday is when the shit really hits the fan with this administration....Ask @maddow how they choke down that “Friday Feeling”!  Let’s wait and see what the day brings, shall we?

Your kakistocracy is collapsing after its lamentable journey.  As the greatest Nation history has known, we have the opportunity to emerge from this nightmare stronger & more committed to ensuring a better life for all Americans, including those you have so tragically deceived. …
It’s officially spring and your President is off the chains and an embarrassment to this country!
That's because all of you have your heads in the sand when it comes to your boss.
Are you high?  We just read the reports about over 2/3 of tax breaks from your tax bill going overseas.  #ICallBS

If the forecast is that bright .... why did 233 politicians (all but 7 were Republicans) just vote to try to steal social security's surplus?  Oh, yes ..... we are watching.
Say no to drugs @GOP .
sell outs
#WeThePeople watched our public servants authorize the #LootingOfAmerica last year, despite our wishes otherwise.  America's economic forecast won't begin to look bright again until AFTER the #NovemberPolls open & we've taken corrective measures...
#FailedCongress #Liars

It was looking bright before.
It'll be a lot brighter in November
It's officially spring and #Trump's impeachment is nearing! I've got that #FridayFeeIing.
#ImpeachTrump
The kite trying to fly and taking a nosedive is quite an accurate representation of your #TaxScam message.
Exactly
It’s Official Republicans have NO Spine. #GOPCorruption
