Your Thoughts and Prayers seems to cover people who passed away naturally to people perishing in natural disasters to people shot killed by AR15's in schools, theathers and even waffle houses. T's & P's from you is just BS. @tedlieu @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid @DavidJollyFL @RWPUSA
Not the sentiments of your party leader. Odd

May the world learn he was a pervert who assaulted children. Hope he repents of all the disgusting sins he’s committed against humanity before he croaks.
God bless him.  A gentleman a statesman and a true conservative.

Jesus Name!
Don’t you find it ironic for all the presidents and First Ladies both sides?? Shows they’re all in the swamp together!!
