WHAT JOBS ARE YOU CREATING? We're still losing jobs overseas and to companies closing you LIARS.
We're wondering is why the GOP/NRA go on & on about the tax scam. Most Americans know you passed the scam because the rich paid you to do it. We are wondering why the GOP/NRA are not busy impeaching the WH monster and not investigating the cabinet swamp monsters. Blue Wave.
Trump concedes his new economic plan may produce 'a little pain
 #TaxCutsandJobsAct  #taxcutsforamerica  #TaxCuts
Tax cut gives Koch’s $1billion and Chump $100 million tax breaks while middle class Americans get $1200. Sounds fair to GOP !sick
I’m sure all your minimum wage followers will be right on that with that 1.50 tax bonus.
How do we help with the witch hunt so much else for the president to do
Enough!  Get off your few accomplishments and put your nose to the grindstone and get Border Control done!
These numbers reflect exactly what we feared: that corporations and the wealthy are getting massive tax cuts and reaping benefits from the Trump tax scam, while hardworking American families see almost no impact.
Protect the PROSPERITY and protect the nation and protect the president. END THE WITCH HUNT
Protect Americans prosperity and FIRE Mueller today. End the witch HUNT. Let's stay on course. Protect the PROSPERITY by protecting this president. YOU CAN END THIS WITCH HUNT WITH A SINGLE VOTE
If @realDonaldTrump fires or constrains Mueller, he must be impeached and removed from office.
How the Congressional GOP plans to kill the poor & afflicted & rob from the middleclass to feed the greed of their oligarch owners like the Koch Bros. A "tax reform" bill in name only, designed as vicious class war & to throw millions off healthcare.
#GOPTaxScam 88% of tax breaks going to the top 1% is bad for America
NO SECURED BORDER = NO SECURED VOTES   No difference between You & Democrats.   #ImmigrationReform  #SecureOurBorders  #Trump2020LandSlide

Trying to take away Social Security and Medicare is not a winning strategy for the @GOP. Pretty soon their base of support will limited to rednecks and racists between the ages of 35 and 50.

Wake up your brain w/@MorningstarInc Runs the Numbers, a popular wkly feature built around a few surprising facts & figures, e.g., Mstar Global Mkts Index was (just) negative in Q1 after a blistering 22% return…
My question is, why didn’t you encourage economic growth by placing a provision in the tax plan that required companies to make genuine investments in their workforce/infrastructure to qualify for cuts? Because that functionally would have done something to help most of us #scam
Obviously, people aren't seeing what you are. Way to go, GOP. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-healthcare-poll/exclusive-as-elections-near-many-older-educated-white-voters-shift-away-from-trumps-party-idUSKBN1HG1I6 … #BlueWaveComing2018
Budget deficit for March was 300 billion dollars.
There’s no such thing as underserved communities! There are poverty reservations caused by single parent families and apathy Government has for not changing those communities!
Old News.  Why aren't you addressing the issues that are occurring now ? How long do you think this one story will keep people from seeing what is now going on?
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP
Keep seeing this repeatedly, it’s good, but where’s all the other important topics?
Trump has single handedly sent the stock market tumbling over 2,000 points. Between his new Fed Chief raising rates and his idiot Treasury Secretary using the words “Trade War”, Trump is to blame for creating this monster! Market needs him to shut up! 
Can you people move on from this scam, it’s done and over, and start fixing the major problems with your administration?
You found a few tokens!! Big deal
Let’s look at what the American people got in this administration. I got zero tax cut. Iowan farmers get screwed. Medicaid persons are getting less healthcare. Social Security and Medicare are going to be cut after the election. ACA is being demolished. Why vote Republican?
Better lies than last time! But still lies
Why don’t you focus on the flimsy narrative you have set up to make a war with Russia seem legit. We all know it’s for money not for good #OutOfTouch people over profit
#SC #Senate Anti American You gave permant tax breaks to US Corp who leave
 Trump still makes products in China  He gets cheap foreign workers and tax cut? 
CEO does not deserve a tax cut. Tax Reform was for wealthiest 
Rich geting Opportunity Do the care American jobs?
Nothing to see here folks, move em along in November
Repubs: give this a rest.
.@SenateGOP #Republicans stole 1.5 Trillion tax dollars and gave it to #DonaldTrump and his billionaire friends. Gave us nothing and called it a jobs bill. Prison time for all of them. #trumpdumpcare #resistance #Emma4Change
Where’s the #minimumwage increase? The hardworking poor must continue to work multiple jobs to make ends meet for $7.25 an hour or slightly more. Your government mandated tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations excluded a government mandated raise for workers. #GOPTaxScam
7 months.
Tell McConnell that the #NuclearOption is needed for the GOP to accomplish the other 5 major bills that a majority party should have achieved by now. McConnell has been single-handedly putting the GOP majority at risk in the midterms!
Don’t worry, that nuclear option will get used a lot after November
Shame you didn't make the Opportunity Act mandatory when #DeepPocketDonors took advantage of their #UnearnedWindfall for stock buy backs rather than investing in company growth, expansion, increased hiring...
I'm sure that was an oversight on your part, right?
#LootingOfAmerica
And what about #FATCA?
#GOPTaxScam is wrong
At future generations’ expense.
Stormy Daniels says Trump told her 'you remind me of my daughter' after she spanked him with a magazine https://read.bi/2I3XBik  via @businessinsider

Very few US adults report receiving bonuses or raises from the Republican tax law
The Treasury may borrow nearly $1 trillion in 2018, and at least that much afterward — here's why it matters
More lies!  Fortunately, when the majority is flipped to BLUE...most corruption will be overturned!  

FACT: the #GOPTaxScam delivers $1.3 trillion to corporate America. Also a FACT: the #TrumpBudget  cuts Medicare by $500 billion, Medicaid by $1.4 trillion and Social  Security disability by $72 billion. This is how they plan to pay for it —  by obliterating key investments.
Republicans said their tax bill would go to workers. Instead, it’s going to Wall Street https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/22/17144870/stock-buybacks-republican-tax-cuts?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter … via @voxdotcom
GOP worries as few say they're seeing benefit from new tax law
"The GOP abandons fiscal responsibility"
The CBO reports the federal budget deficit will be at least $1,000,000,000,000 every year Trump is president. #GOPTaxScam
Baloney hahaha GOP NRA owned traitors taxscam
