thank you, senator peters. I appreciate your resistance to this administration.
Because it's worked so well so far?  Time to change things up and run it like a business.  Wake up.  Are you that ignorant?
Uh the woman isn't qualified to run this "business". It's like having Beyonc√© run a Microsoft.
Because it's worked so well so far?
The DOE should be abolished.  It's a states rights issue.  Wake up.
the school system needs a shake-up and now it's going to get it.
Great! Now fight for them by blocking the rest of tRump's cabinet or SupCrt picks.
schools do we teach kids not to bully not to lie not to cheat or steal  did I just describe  how the grow ups are acting

I'm getting frightened of what's happening. Keep up the hard work.
Thank you, sir.

Thank you!
@SenStabenow thanks for doing your job and voting unlike some of your fellow members
Thank you!
I wonder if those who voted yes for a totally unqualified person could explain why she deserved their yes vote.
Because she donated lits of money to their campaigns.
Exactly. No other qualifications whatsoever.
thank you for your effort. This is a sad day for America's children.
.@SenGaryPeters That is why we need to vote NO next time U are up for re-elections!Pay attention who won the last election.
@SenStabenow Thank you for standing up for education, and voting against an unqualified cabinet nominee.
Dude, u are fighting for teacher's unions. At least be honest abt it #DeVos
Thank you.
Thank you
Thank you, sir. I'm glad that you and Senator @SenStabenow care more about ethics and children than ppl buying votes.
Thanks. Proud of my senators.
Couldn't you have kidnapped one of the Republican senators until the vote was over? :(
thank you Senator
Thank you Senator!
Education is a state and local concern- should have nothing to do with the Dept of Education in DC @SenGaryPeters
Thank you and @SenStabenow for doing the right thing. Keep fighting. We need you two more than ever.
Thank you. I support your decision
Thank you senator, keep up the great work.
Your vote is disappointing. You failed Michigan and our country. Is is time for you to be a leader.
We thank you for your vote.   We must do our best to block unqualified people.  Donating money is not a qualifier.
Thank you Sen Peters
public education is the problem and you are part of the wrongdoings Petets
Thank You
thanks, count on my vote again
That's cool that you did, but now what will you do to ensure children continue to have quality education as we move forward?
Senator ...keep fighting...America needs you to articulate the risk to American democracy (aka freedom) with Jeff Sessions.
