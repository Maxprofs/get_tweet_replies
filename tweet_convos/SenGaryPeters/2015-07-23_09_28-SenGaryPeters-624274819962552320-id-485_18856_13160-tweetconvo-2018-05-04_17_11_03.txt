@NASA @NASAKepler this will comprised with water no others
@NASA @NASAKepler @Ramirez714 u should move here when Bern or Hill wins 
@CarolinaRParis @NASA @NASAKepler on my way. Then I can be president 
@Ramirez714 @NASA @NASAKepler lmao! There ya go
@CarolinaRParis @NASA @NASAKepler republican planet tho
@Ramirez714 @NASA @NASAKepler how about we leave u stay here with all the pollution your party supports 
@CarolinaRParis @NASA @NASAKepler maybe we shouldn't talk politics lol
@Ramirez714 @NASA @NASAKepler solar power all the way  ok deal!
@NASA @NASAKepler #askNASA if K-452B is six billion years old. How come they haven't made contact with us here on Earth yet?
@shipstimbers @NASA @NASAKepler theres no life there why would you assume that
@Carlos98218 @NASA @NASAKepler lots of possible reasons for no detected communication. No contact doesn't mean no life.
@shipstimbers @NASA @NASAKepler wow not sure if trolling or serious
@NASA Soubhana Allah
@VeraAngelaSmith @NASA @dnsklv @NASAKepler can you take me there also...
@NASA @NASAKepler I bet it hopes the humans stay where they are. (Rabies for planets)
"@Wolfie_Rankin: @NASA @NASAKepler I bet it hopes the humans stay where they are. (Rabies for planets)" Only evil people hate humanity.
@sir_mycroft @NASA @NASAKepler I'm not very keen on humanity.
"@Wolfie_Rankin: @sir_mycroft @NASA @NASAKepler I'm not very keen on humanity." It's the greatest thing ever.
@sir_mycroft @NASA @NASAKepler No other species has over populated so much that it has ruined a planet.
"@Wolfie_Rankin: @sir_mycroft @NASA @NASAKepler A) the planet is not ruined B) humans first with the ability to find others.  Humanity wins.

@NASA @NASAKepler I weren't say Cousin more like Uncle then a Cousin
@NASA @NASAKepler Este planeta esta mucho lejos de nuestra tierra.  No posibile podremos destruir...por los menos cuando hoy viviamos.
@NASA @NASAKepler 
Great, can we possibly live there....
@NASA @NASAKepler  what's all about this Kepler whether is it same like earth
@NASA @NASAKepler amazing work NASA
@NASA @NASAKepler Mebbe this is planet I've heard has been prepared for Ones not leaving 3rd dimension just yet.@KYOTA47153971 @zacharykreid
"@NASA: Earth’s cousin! @NASAKepler  I'd hate to be on that phone call:  "Hello there, how are you?" ...3000 years later... "Fine, you?"
@NASA @NASAKepler @mhammed_14
@NASA @NASAKepler , Best discovery
@NASA @NASAKepler @Kahhmezzy SHARE INTEREST WITH ME
@MickyIngram but...but you're weird
@Kahhmezzy I MEAN IT'S ONLY 6x1400 TRILLION MILES AWAY LET'S GO ON A TRIP
@MickyIngram log off
@kahhmezzy y log off?
@NASA @NASAKepler  Good one NASA, more Disneyland dishonesty. Don't tell anyone that the image on the right is total fantasy
@NASA @NASAKepler what is the name of that planet?
@NASA @NASAKepler I know one thing for sure that if you are US citizen living there you have to pay taxes :)
MT @NASA: Earth’s bigger, older cousin! @NASAKepler discovers distant planet near-Earth-size: http://go.nasa.gov/1fp668W 
@NASA @ImKoto @NASAKepler yea. Except u would weigh 400 pounds cause of the higher gravity!!lol
@NASA @NASAKepler we're not alone lol
@NASA @pasqualevidetta @NASAKepler so far deep in space to reach it. Luckily so we won't ruin it. Anyway awesome discovery.
@NASA @NASAKepler @CynthiaPilan @mariana_godoy @GalisteuReal @RobertaMiranda1 Nossas supeitas estava corretas...bora pra la
@NASA @NASAKepler @bra_logan
@NASA @NASAKepler if we go to this new planet, we'll just destroy it too
@NASA @Bugglepuffbooks @NASAKepler So the more humans you have on a planet the sadder it gets? @MykJam
@NASA @NASAKepler how about NASA discovering more Earths for Christians, Muslims, Homosexuals and Democrats respectively?
@nasa Congratulations on writing a great gov tweet! http://shiningsea.measuredvoice.com/nasa/status/624254765137010688 … (Ranked 10th for Jul 23.)
@NASA @NASAKepler I am great
@NASA @NASAKepler send me there
@NASA @NASAKepler send there
@NASA @NASAKepler send me
@NASA send me
@NASA @send me
@NASA @NASAKepler refuelling imaginative pursuit for whole Kepler’s team I hope…
@NASA @NASAKepler planet Reach?
@NASA @SaloGuardione @NASAKepler Ya nuestra especie halló otro planeta para vivir? será q aprendimos y no lo destruiremos como a la tierra?
@NASA @NASAKepler exelente
@NASA @NASAKepler now quickly giv the news of hunan beigns over there
@NASA @NASAKepler   pray our horrid species dont export pollution,control, religion,money, drugs etc. we r NOT ready, sort earth 1st!
@NASA @NASAKepler Yes, I get this news after long time............
@NASA @KerbalSpaceP @NASAKepler what are the space-time coordinates to get there?
@NASA thats the planet goku and the Z warriors defend 
@NASA @NASAKepler could be dangerous if it's the same as earth but bigger and older evolution of lifeforms
@NASA @GeorgeTakei @NASAKepler our lungs wldn't handle it. Their air cannot achieved ours. Also how come our telescope can't get any closer?
@NASA @NASAKepler  so cool kepler 452b is finally found
@NASA @NASAKepler KHO SEMPRE SOSPETTATO CHE CI FOSSE UN ALTRO #MONDO COME IL NOSTRO ,MA È MAGNIFICO .
@NASA @NASAKepler I cant find the vid of your earth 2.0 announcement anywhere. I tried reddit, http://nasa.gov  and google to no avail
@NASA @NASAKepler If Kepler is 1400 light years from Earth, more than 400 years, how did Kepler Space Telescope arrive there in 6 years?
@NASA @NASAKepler Now we have a direction. Let's get that Alien technology we have collected and get there. Let's not wait. :-)
@nasa @nasakepler @poptate u into cosmoism . . Neuword . Meaning all abt whats nt on planet earth
@NASA @NASAKepler Pincha cabron pues si es el planeta Namekusei, por fin habeis encontrado!!
@NASA @NASAKepler How to get there ?
@nasa @nasakepler would it be brother if life discovered?
@NASA @VitezLazar @NASAKepler now whe bring them Worldpeace and Democracy...
@NASA @NASAKepler lovely

@NASA @NASAKepler
Marvellous science @NASA @NASAKepler - goes to show just how precious our planet is!
@NASA @NASAKepler Okay, wow, so lets get into the stasis pods and - go for it, Nostromo! :-)
@NASA @NASAKepler A cuantos km esta de la tierra
@NASA @NASAKepler  Thank You. A beautiful site.
@NASA @NASAKepler when we'll  build equipment to get there

@NASA @NASAKepler how long before we know the composition of the planet?
@NASA @NASAKepler obama go home
@NASA @NASAKepler nice
@NASA @NASAKepler please take all governments, all political parties on 1 and give them 2.All the nations can live peacefully without them
@NASA @julieeflowers @NASAKepler thank you for this information it is much appreciated
@LoganOrsini44 you are very quite welcome
@NASA @NASAKepler it's time to move
Wow :D 
@NASA @thearvindswami @NASAKepler
@NASA @NASAKepler Cool!
@NASA @NASAKepler I guess before we start destroying another planet we should probably take care of the one we got.
@NASA @ @NASAKepler I guess there's no water in this planet 
@NASA @NASAKepler nice to know..
@NASA @NASAKepler @sclilly1 wow
@NASA @NASAKepler che emozione!
@NASA @NASAKepler Dinosaures lived for more than 120 millions years... and after 500.000 we already found this.
@NASA @NASAKepler OMFG
@NASA @NASAKepler how very beautiful!
@NASA @NASAKepler How is it possible to find a planet that is 1400 lightyears away? And even make a precise description of it without a pic!
@NASA @NASAKepler LETS MOVE TO IT
To tell the truth I very want to see…! But I have to call the alien partner…! #NASA @NASA @NASAKepler
@NASA @NASAKepler ارسلوني للكوكب شبيه الأرض

@NASA @NASAKepler mind blowing 
@NASA @NASAKepler BORDEL DE SHIT 
@NASA  @NASAKepler keep it  y'all know something we don't... trying to get ghost & hit us with the it's no more seats line

@NASA @NASAKepler are you telling me that Anne hathaway landed on this planet for real ?
@NASA @NASAKepler 太激动
@NASA @NASAKepler so, what would potential life/environment be like there in regard 2 gravity being twice that of earth's gravity?
@NASA @NASAKepler حدث تاريخي مهم جداً

@NASA @NASAKepler Mass Effect's Eden Prime planet came to mind.
@NASA @NASAKepler こんにちは、地球人。
@NASA @NASAKepler this is amazing.
@NASA @dustybayne @NASAKepler I saw this! So crazy, so cool!!!
@NASA @GeorgeTakei @NASAKepler Seen one planet, you've seen 'em all.
@NASA @NASAKepler any cops there?
@NASA @NASAKepler 
"Earth 2.0." can't wait to play this on my PC.
@NASA @NASAKepler hopefully one in a long list waiting to be discovered!
@NASA @NASAKepler what about Gliese 581? is completely discarded to have liquid water, Life ?
@NASA @NASAKepler So amazing NASA. Is there water on this planet? #LE #CG
@NASA @NASAKepler @auxipress
@NASA @NASAKepler wow who knew there would be another planet just like earth! I wonder if any living creatures are there #ed #kw
@NASA @NASAKepler Amazing news! When will we send humans to this planet? ehehe Maybe, after mission to Mars :)
@NASA @NASAKepler the only questions that matters: where do I sign up to get there?
@NASA @NASAKepler In honor of NASA finding the bestest Earth-like planet yet, I've named my new cat Kepler 451B.
@NASA @kerriecullinan @NASAKepler can't u get clear pic of a comet in our own solar system?!? And then lie about ison
@NASA @NASAKepler There are planets near us that harbor life, you do not worry.
@NASA @NASAKepler its far away 1200 light year. I want to know if this planet extinct.
@NASA @NASAKepler listening to War of the World's as I get this news. I hope it's not a sign!
Kepler confirms 1st near-Earth-size planet in “habitable zone” around a sun-like star. @NASA @NASAKepler  Kepler-452b
@NASA @NASAKepler This calls for music: https://youtu.be/IJiHDmyhE1A 
@nasa @nasakepler confessem que ETs existem :) não adianta esconderem eles de nós.
@NASA @NASAKepler neyyy
@nasa @nasakepler It's a fantastic plant hunting mission in deep space.

@NASA @NASAKepler Cause I think I want to move there.
People on earth are too savage.
@NASA @NASAKepler  Anyone know how far away it is from earth?
@NASA @He_Say_She_Say @NASAKepler What's the Name of This Planet near Earth??
@CassandraSande5 Kepler 452-B
@NASA @NASAKepler Brilliant Work By Nasa!
@NASA @NASAKepler really puts into perspective on how insignificant we are with the grand scheme of things.
@NASA @NASAKepler awesome
@NASA @NASAKepler i would love to visit there if there is a possibility of @kfc and @McDonalds 
@NASA good job!
@NASA @NASAKepler announce the Aliens
@NASA @NASAKepler Only 1400 light years away. Better start packing.
@NASA @NASAKepler yaşanılabiliritesi varsa giderim hacı..
@NASA @NASAKepler with all this Space news this summer @neiltyson must be flipping his shit.
@NASA @WTHRcom @NASAKepler Lets send all the democrats there!
Need to figure out how to teleport. @NASA Earth’s bigger, older cousin! @NASAKepler discovers new distant planet that's near-Earth-size.
