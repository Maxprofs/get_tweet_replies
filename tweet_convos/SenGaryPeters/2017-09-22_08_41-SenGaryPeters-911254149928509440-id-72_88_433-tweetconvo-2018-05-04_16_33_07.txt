Thank you ... keep up the good fight! Stall the senate vote and do everything in your power to shut it down!! Filibuster by Amendment, etc.
Your constituents deserve to hear more than proven false "talking points." Here's some info on #GrahamCassidy  https://youtu.be/H2lTrYLAtTE  1/

What is your plan?
We're paying more for less in current state. You only offer resistance. Where are 'your' solutions?
Not wrong if you're healthy. But we must care for our sick neighbors and they will die with less care. See with your heart, not your wallet
