Thanks for standing up for us. Glad you're my senator.
Thank you for standing up for our health care!
Do something other than Obstruct. We need Senators working for us. STEP DOWN
Thank you for your opposition,  Senator.
Thank you for fighting the good fight!
Also, thank you for this video message, it was a great call to post it!
We need to replace @SenGaryPeters!
Thank you @SenGaryPeters for fighting! Medicaid & pre-existing condition protection are critical for #Alzheimers families.
Thank you for your time and effort, this requires a lot of endurance and I'm glad you are staying there, staying focused. Your vm is full!
Many states are down to one provider. It is projected by 2018 many states will have no choice to obtain coverage.
Yep. Whether I attempted to go through work or the ACA nonsense, I had one option. Work was actually cheaper for equivalent coverage >.>
Replace Obama Care and then replace Senator Peters!
repeal and replace! OC has failed. Why keep it?
Thank you and stay strong, we need you!!
Get government out of healthcare!
You have done NOTHING to fix ACA.  You have no solutions other than to whine about everything.  Empty suit.  The adults are in charge now.
Thank you Gary Peters! Unreal the lengths to which the GOP at this time, will go. Well we need to step up the voter turn out. I vote.
This bill must be stopped. No #Medicaid  cuts for the #disabled. @SenCapito @SenatorCollins @senrobportman @SenDeanHeller @lisamurkowski
Go, @SenGaryPeters! Go! Thank you for fighting for our care!
Then why don't  you  work  with the senators and create a HC bill that would help MI?  Stop obstructing!
Do you like Obamacare? Really
@SanitySwell Paint them as thieves. That's what this is - theft.
Whats making it worse is the individual mandate you support by fining Michiganders who cannot afford exploding #Obamacare premiums. #Repeal
Please continue to fight hard... #TrumpCare will hurt millions of our most vulnerable citizens
Will you be addressing trumps travel ban on transgender soldiers?
Thank you @SenGaryPeters for fighting for #Michigan families!  As a pediatrician, I see every day how important it is to #KeepKidsCovered
REPEAL OBAMACARE NOW!
GOP is biggest threat to America, next to 45
Thanks Senator Peters for fighting against this horrible bill!
Michiganders need to get a job and quit living off of freebies and taxpayers. All for helping the poor and sick but not the lazy!
Would you vote for single payer system?
Wearing us down by adding constant stressors is what they are doing. You and DD and DS got our backs. How do we "flip" the others/districts?
Filibuster by amendment!
As someone who is benefiting from Medicaid expansion in MI, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Keep fighting.
Get a job!
Thank you for voting no and fighting for Michigan!
Thank you for all you and @SenStabenow do. You have my full support from Ferndale.
Thank you @SenGaryPeters for your continued efforts to keep us insured and alive.
Please keep up the fight for us.
It specifically says "take coverage away from Michiganders"? Stop lying.
Thank you for fighting for us! Keep amendments going! Michigan stands with you! Let us know how we can help!
Thank you Senator!!!
Thank you for keeping up the good fight!
Thank you @SenGaryPeters  @SenStabenow please keep fighting door us
You are no different than the GOP. You a greedy sell-out, sponsoring a bill to make protesting Israel a crime. Tyranny.
Thank you @SenGaryPeters!
U need to be on the trump train
Keep fighting for us, Senator. We appreciate you!
But of course. We want u to be our surfs basically. We use u up and throw u away. It'll be great.,
Touche'
Maybe you forgot. Nov. 8, MI voters voted Trump and his agenda! You are not repping the will of the people!
Half of Michigan folk voted for Trump. The will of the people is split down the middle. Makes it difficult for Congress to get things done.
Maybe you should "fight" for something more substantial...like the $20 Trillion in Gov't debt!  HC, or anything else, will ALL collapse soon
When do we see our monthly premiums go down from 1200/month & deductible go down from $6000/yr?
Thank you for your hard work, Senator Peters
Fight for everyone Senator Peters, not just Michigander! Thank you. @SenStabenow
Why aren't you fighting for #MedicareForAll?
Are we to believe the condition of HC just happened in the last 6 months? Or perhaps it has been unraveling since inception!
Its designed to fail for single payer move. Sad thing it can take our entire economy down. Its almost 20% of GDP now n growing uncontrolled
Thank you for representing the needs of us in Michigan. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you @SenGaryPeters and @SenStabenow for continually fighting to #ProtectOurCare
Do you honestly expect us to believe that O'Care is financially stable? Cost is going down? Coverage choices are better?
Support you from Ypsi.  Kill the bill.
We appreciate you, Senator
Keep fighting Senator I support you from  Ypsilanti. Thank you!
Like I said before, get off your dead a$$ and produce something!! Problem is: you have NO good ideas. Give us your elite health plan!!
