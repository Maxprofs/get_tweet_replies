vote NO on Steve Mnuchin
Wrong!Against my values not to properly vet. support will of people and POTUS instead of hinder.U R the traitor.@SenGaryPeters @SenateDems
The Dems are promoting anarchy. Why don't start governing instead of still complaning.@SenGaryPeters @SenateDems @SenStabenow
You say you R proud of womens march.Glad you liked the vagina costumes.Disgusting and pathetic.   @SenGaryPeters @SenateDems @SenStabenow
Meanwhile Republicans trust a sexual deviant.
Proud of you & all the other boycotting Dems for standing up for us against Republican hypocrisy and lies. Stay strong.
Keep up the pressure on Trump!!
Word ban is deceptive; stop fomenting the lie #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp #GodBlessOurRepublic #GodBlessPOTUS
you are saying we don't give ppl a chance.  You need to go to history school.  Shame on you.
From one of your MI constituents, thank you!! We need you to stand up to this terrible administration!
Did you forget 911?  I was there!  This ban is temporary.  Changing daily.  Represent America!
but it was ok when Obama did it
What values?  Actions speak louder than words.  No evidence democrats have American or CHRISTIAN values. #MAGA 
That is why the majority of people in MI supported DJT in the election.
Please block Sessions' confirmation for AG as well as Scott Pruitt for the EPA!
Not only that it hurts us profundly -Team T has not just attacked refugees but  Green-card holders 2- Outrageous
It about time for Senate and house Democrats to get your act together and stand up to Trump.
thank you from MI! 
Stand firm against Muslim Ban. The people are with you. Thank you.
Michigan gave the POTUS to Trump for a reason; support him and his nominees or be replaced next election term.
@SenStabenow  It would be fair to give @potus a chance like we did with Obama.  No protests then.
@SenStabenow What do Democrats know about "values"?  #babykillers
This is why he won....we the silent majority have had enough of this crap...just do your job and support him
Withold consent on cabinet votes and filibuster any legislation until refugee ban reversed.
#nojusticenobills
This is not a ban. Obama and Bill Clinton did the same thing. This is hypocritical propaganda.
Thank you from western Wayne county. Please continue to stand & act against short sighted & poorly executed EOs.
as MI res, disappointed you voted to confirm Chao. ALL Trump appointees s/b resisted until Muslim ban is changed/dropped.
Please block Sessions and Devos confirmations.
keep fighting for our democracy
time to withhold consent.  Shut down every bill until this is overturned. Every bill #nojusticenobills
Thank you
Protests are good. What are you doing in your day job as Senators?
thank you senator Peters. Honored to be part of the Michigan team
Given events at the Justice Dept please oppose Jeff Sessions and fight to protect Justice Dept independance.
Please help save us from this autocratic narcissist. Keep the checks and balances. It has never been more important. Vote no on Sessions.
thank you!
Who is "our?" http://m.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/immigration/january_2017/most_support_temporary_ban_on_newcomers_from_terrorist_havens â€¦ It would B nice to know that a system that we pay for-actually protects us.
you've had a busy day, senator! Thank you please vote no on all noms and scotus. Bannon needs to go.
it seems like the Senate is not doing anything about Trump. I hear about protests but what is the Senate doing?
As a constituent, please block Sessions confirmation! And Devos!
Thank you, glad to have you as my senator.
Still is, but we need borders secured.
Thank you for standing up to the bigotry that is completely unAmerican.
also no to all cabinet pics and Supreme Court justice.in Michigan we want no on all of them
Thank you Senator! Your constituents will continue to resist and we expect the same from our leadership!
Not anymore!
Not a ban!  Temp pause to allow the govt to put good vetting in place before we have a terrorist attack.  Fight for our safety
POTUS literally called it a ban in his tweet today.
Thank you from Macomb County, Michigan
Nice work Senator!! #StandUpToTrump
Thank you, @SenGaryPeters & @SenateDems, for standing up for our American values!

Not a ban.  A delay to protect the Americans that you swore to protect.  Everything is constitutional and done b4
thank you
Thank you!!!
Senator, please hold up all the nominations until Bannon is out.
Thank you for having the courage to speak out against the Muslim ban, your decency & principles have not gone unnoticed.
Thank you @SenGaryPeters !
Also, do you know where Michigan AG @SchuetteOnDuty spine is? He seems to have misplaced it.
@Fab_Uni @SenateDems Thank you from GA. Hope our Senators are just as courageous.
Thanks for speaking out!  You're going to the floor to support Warren, right?  Now is the time to Stand Up!
Stand up!Get Bannon out b4 our intell is propaganda!NO on Sessions or any AG until Constitutional crisis over

All Trump/GOP agenda will be horrible. It's your patriotic duty to vote no every time. No compromise!
we seriously need to get Bannon out of DC, Trump is bad enough without him.
Stephen Bannon is leading the Trump administration down a road of carnage, writes @MaxBoot http://atfp.co/2kktg73 
@JessicaFastball @SenateDems    Fight!   You may not be getting much sleep for a while and we're grateful. FIGHT?
Please filibuster all nominees until this issue is rectified.
