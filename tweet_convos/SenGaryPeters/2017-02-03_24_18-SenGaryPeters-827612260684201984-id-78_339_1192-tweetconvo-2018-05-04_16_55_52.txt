Work all of the rest of your term. It worked for the Patriots, all 4 quarters!
She wants kids and parents to be able choose where their kids get their education. Sounds like a pretty great idea to my fam!
thank you for standing up for education and against know-nothing DeVos.
Reminder to all non-registered voters: Register with a party type to select the nominees for that party.  Drain the swamp!
Vote YES to show you can work for America, not just the party of the Democrats - U.S. Senate UNITE!!!
We want DeVos. A change from the old school way of doing things and failing our students.
That's got to be a mighty long list...
@MISenDems what you haven't bankrupted the American people yet.
@almost_jane Other than becuz Betsy's the very personification of 'pay to play'?
We have everything now that you say she doesn't have, what we don't have is a well run system of educ..
Says who? Please back up your unsupported assertion (preferably using quantifiable data)...
Sir, http://mich.gov  2016 M-STEP results horrible.
and what does Devos specifically propose to address those 'horrible' (per you) MI results?
I believe that once confirmed, she will develop a plan to increase ed. standards for ALL.
Such plans should B presented BEFORE she's confirmed. She's literally had DECADES 2 do her homework!
I don't that you can say she expected to be offered this position.
Because unions?
Yes - please let's hear from one more teacher about why they don't want to see school choice - not rocket science
so?
Thank you
thank you!
FYI Christian homeschooled our son to bypass failed school system with EXCELLENT outcome. No #junkscience/fake history books.
Betsy DeVoss:  proven leader/advocate for school kids. Video is failed bureaucrat & teacher representing failed system. #MAGA
@SenateDems Thank you for your no Vote our children deserves a Better Leader
@SenateDems please urge republicans to see the light and stop being patsy to POTUS
fight against that thief DeVos!
@SenateDems 2018 is coming soon, the chairs of Dems will empty quickly. Voters will show their disapproval!
thank you for putting the education of our children first
Blah Blah  ask citizens how they rate the public schools?  Teachers are just too vested.  Plus they vote Dem, don't they?
AND maybe it would be best to not have a strong DOE. Return decisions to local & state govt. Too much prescription from Feds.
can we get one with a Detroit parent? US schools 17th in the world. Bad! Time for a big change
@SenateDems I think this is the first issue i disagree with in the Trump pres. era.  She definitely isn't a good pick for DOE
@jpakcmu Heck I want Peters out
thank you for standing up for our children's future
Thank you for talking to MI teachers for their input on this. Who better to talk about our schools? #noDevos
@SenateDems   Thank you Sen Peters and Tammy
ask some children from Detroit, Saginaw, or Flint how they feel about public school's? Not about problem in Birmingham or....
Grosse Pointe Farms it's a nationwide problem! Don't you have confirmations you should be attending? #getbacktoworkgary
CAN YOU PLEASE CONVINCE ONE MORE SENATOR TO VOTE NO???
That one of my states Senators.
Thank You!
Thank you, Senator Peters!
Thank you.  Keep fighting.  Fight hard, we need you too.
Thank you!
it's not hard to imagine that Betsy is buying this appointment, that probably should've been said, with alt. nominees also
Thank you Senator Peters for supporting public education and voting against Mrs. Devos.
thank you. Please convince your friends!
Thank you.
Even the head of a big charter school does not want DeVoss. Our children will lose with her. Totally unqualified.
@SenateDems Thank you #publicschools
@SenateDems because she doesn't want to be held accountable and she wants to hide behind the union
@SenateDems thank you. @GOP hear MI experience & see the difference DeVoss is wrong if you love anyone on Autism Spectrum
@SenateDems vote no
The only reason your in the Senate is because of the unions.
@SenateDems because she is part of the corrupt system
because you are a racist!
Bullshit! The federal government needs 2 let state & parents make child's decision. NOT the Federal government #Yes2DeVos
is she a member of any of these SOROS funded groups? http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewsubcategory.asp?id=1237 â€¦
take a look at an empty suit they call Sen from Michigan. Ashamed of him!
Thank you sir, You're doing a great service for education ..Keep Ms. DeVos from being confirm
@SenateDems Thank you Senator!
Thank you, Senator! #DumpDevos
@SenateDems in the pocket of the teacher union give a crap about actual children learning proven by spending vs results
@SenateDems Thank you for fighting for our children's education Senator.
@SenateDems More Slugs ..
@SenateDems if experience educators are the key...why does America continue to drop in the world rankings.  Next excuse
@SenateDems thank you both!
@SenateDems thank you #StopDeVos
