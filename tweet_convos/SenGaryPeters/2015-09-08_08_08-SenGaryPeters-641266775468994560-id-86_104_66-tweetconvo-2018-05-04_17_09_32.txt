@SenGaryPeters  We're just kicking the can down the road another 15 yrs - say NO to this bad deal! No more money for terrorists!
@abeavers @SenGaryPeters are you nuts! You want war right away, like now or something? Not willing to try for peace first? Sicko!!!
@Madaza41 @SenGaryPeters  Does "Death to America!" not scare you a little? I don't want war, but Iran doesn't want peace, they are using us.
@abeavers @SenGaryPeters it scares me a lot. But not as much as you sickos that want war every time an Arab farts.
@Madaza41 @SenGaryPeters  You unfairly characterize everyone who opposes this deal as "sickos that want war".  I think we can do better.
@abeavers @SenGaryPeters the only other option is war. Therefore, if you are against peace, then you are for war and thus, a sicko.
@iMIpolitics @SenGaryPeters It's a vote that could haunt him.
@iMIpolitics @SenGaryPeters Peters has to pray rhat Iran doesn't do something crazy or genocidal. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes.
@SenGaryPeters You should be ashamed of yourself and supporting this deal. You voted for dealing with a terror state that.no one can trust,
@SenGaryPeters Thank you, Senator! I want my grand children to learn about war from textbooks, not experience.
@dnaples3 @SenGaryPeters Oh they'll learn about war alright!  Maybe Peters and your tweet will make the chapter about a disillusioned nation
@SenGaryPeters Thank-you, Senator! Peace is better than war!! #IranDeal #VoteVets #UniteBIue
@KenWarnock @SenGaryPeters How stupid and naive can you be? Who can trust Iran and what do you think they will do with millions of dollars w
@SenGaryPeters then sir! We the people have told you to vote no! So we will do what we can to vote you out!
@EdEfow @SenGaryPeters no we didn't. He voted exactly how we wanted him to vote. He will be back in office after next election.
@Madaza41 check your facts 84.9 percent of Americans disapprove of this deal! That means no! He may get reelected! But not by we the people!
@EdEfow check your facts. Mine aren't made up.
@SenGaryPeters How can you betray over 70%percent of American people?  We do NOT want IRAN DEAL.  #tcot #StopIranDeal
@SenGaryPeters a state that funds terrorists and seeks the destruction of http://Israel.How  stupid can you all be?Your vote will be in
@SenGaryPeters  WHAT CHANGED MIND ABOUT SAYING YES TO HORRIBLE dID PRESIDENT OBAMBA PAID  MONEY? i WANT KNOW NOW FAT ASS
@SenGaryPeters sorry Senator Peters but this is a bad move.  please change your mind and vote NO!!!
@SenGaryPeters Thanks to you the world is now a more dangerous place.
@SenGaryPeters If you had "reservations" WHY IN GOD'S NAME DID YOU VOTE FOR IT? No wonder congress has a 17% approval rating!!
@SenGaryPeters "reluctant" acceptance of the #IranDeal doesn't sound very democratic. It sounds like coercion.
@SenGaryPeters Diplomacy  doesn't work with EVIL ....its people may not be evil But their Leaders are.
@SenGaryPeters Noooo! No deal! It's insane!
@SenGaryPeters Thanks for giving Iran the bomb. #OneTermAndOut
@SenGaryPeters As a MI voter, I'm disappointed to read your acknowledgement of the litany of issues w/ the Iran deal and still support it.
@SenGaryPeters ...and for what? To save face? How much credibility will we have when a nuclear Iran becomes an even bigger world menace?
@SenGaryPeters Thank you for supporting peace, party & @POTUS.
#IranDeal
@SaculSacul @SenGaryPeters @POTUS Thank you for selling your soul to devil for a political gain!)
@SenGaryPeters @jtabc10news Sad but not surprised he came out in favor of it. Horrible plan-especially since Iran can self-inspect.
@SenGaryPeters another day, you get paid and Hekmati rots in Iran's prison. The deal is contemptible b/c it empowers Iran. renegotiate now!
@SenGaryPeters The new Pew research poll shows that only 21% of the American public hold views similar to yours on the Iran agreement.
@SenGaryPeters only 21% of Americans support this deal. 1938 Evian Conference. History repeats.
@SenGaryPeters So disappointed in your support of the Iran Deal!!
@SenGaryPeters This is why I voted for this guy glad I did !!
.@SenGaryPeters now that u support negotiations with state sponsored terrorism, what will you do to bring home the U.S. Hostages?
@SenGaryPeters in history book. You just sold Israel for political gain. She, shame, she.on you!
@SenGaryPeters Bottom line, you made the right decision, Senator. The Iranian & Israeli people are also part of the deal. Peace lives on!
@SenGaryPeters I am SO sick of you piss poor Dems! Where have you been? Why are you just stepping up now that he already has 34 votes?Shame!
@SenGaryPeters Your statement gives all the reasons not to support? And you trust Iran to self inspect?
Thank you, @SenGaryPeters the world thank you!
TY, @SenGaryPeters Good job! The #IranDeal will take out Iran's capacity to make nuke weapons, and that's a good thing!
@SenGaryPeters Thank you! #SupportIranDeal
@SenGaryPeters thank you Senator!
@SenGaryPeters more and more sorry you won the Senate race.
@SenGaryPeters thank you for your thoughtful and comprehensive insight into the Iran Deal.
Thank you for supporting the JCPOA with #Iran, @SenGaryPeters. Vote to block resolution of disapproval, too. @POTUS shouldn't have to veto.
@SenGaryPeters If you are reluctant to vote against the resolution, then don't.
@SenGaryPeters Thank You for putting the country's best interests first.
@SenGaryPeters Thank you so much!
@SenGaryPeters key word in the whole article is "my career in congress" this isn't suppose to be a career, you've obviously been in to long
@SenGaryPeters thanks for the vote supporting the US/Iran deal...and for giving peach a chance!
@SenGaryPeters Thank you, Senator Peters!
@SenGaryPeters Made the proper decision.Everyone should watch C-SPAN.
@SenGaryPeters Didn't you mean to say, "...the most intrusive SELF-inspection & SELF-verification regime[n] ever negotiated...?"
@SenGaryPeters Thank you, sir. You are a class act.
@IranAware @SenGaryPeters w/ your name as nobody ,your profile like anonymous terrorist, who would believe you?
Thank you, @SenGaryPeters. We appreciate your support for #diplomacy in the multilateral #IranDeal, which offers a path toward peace.
.@SenGaryPeters a sincere THANK U!  For helping set the example to insure the USA doesn't enter another senseless war!
@SenGaryPeters TY for illustrating not a black&white issue.Vastly complex – ideal solutions not always possible.

@SenGaryPeters Thank you, Senator Peters.
@SenGaryPeters Another Carl "UN" Levin, giving away things to others to do the work you were elected to do, conserve the Constitution, now!
@SenGaryPeters Party politics has blinded you to real evil. Open your eyes and vote NO to #IranDeal
@SenGaryPeters Did you get any $ from the IPAC? I wonder when you meet your maker, what will he/she say to you.
@SenGaryPeters Iran's already laughing at your ignorant mind - traitor.
@SenGaryPeters Thank you for supporting the #IranDeal!!!!
@SenGaryPeters @brucepknight That was a rather wishy washy word salad. You should stand up proudly and support the #IranDeal
@usedtobgop @SenGaryPeters That's been the case with most of them.
@brucepknight @SenGaryPeters Very true. Fence sitting with toes acknowledged to be on one side.
@usedtobgop @SenGaryPeters Exactly.
@SenGaryPeters my Jewish soul thanks you for supporting #IranDeal, diplomacy first for Israeli security
@SenGaryPeters I think you have examined all the avenues & heard all the voices relevant to this deal & made informed decision, Appreciated!
@SenGaryPeters given all the wars in ME, the only thing that worked is the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt and Jordan. Thank you
@SenGaryPeters Way to screw Israel and the rest of the world pal. You won't be forgotten. #IranDeal
@SenGaryPeters Too Little;Too Late, Gary! Support Israel? Move u & family to Israel then..DINO's must GO!
@SenGaryPeters Thank you, Senator Peters, for supporting the #IranDeal and giving the diplomatic solution a chance to work.
@SenGaryPeters Thank you for your support of world peace, and Potus. Working on your Senate bid, here in the 7th of Mi., was time well spent
@SenGaryPeters you do realize that war is not the immediate outcome from voting against the deal, right? A better deal is the result we want
@SenGaryPeters Thank you for this vote, we do not need to continue the endless war the US seems to be in
@SenGaryPeters Thank you for your courage Senator.  Peace should be given a chance to work. Good & right decision! :)
\o/ @SenGaryPeters WILL support the Iran nuclear deal!
.@SenGaryPeters @emptywheel 
that is quite a bunch of words to just say "if General Powell likes it, its ok"
#IranDeal
@SenGaryPeters Dear Sir your vote for this bill is a cop-out you state in your letter all the reasons this is BAD BUT YOU STILL VOTE 4 IT
.@SenGaryPeters joins the ringing endorsement list of #IranDeal- "I will reluctantly vote against a motion of disapproval"
.@SenGaryPeters- #IranDeal "could set a dangerous precedent" of legitimizing countries "to enrich uranium on (their) own soil"
