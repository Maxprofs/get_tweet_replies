what is your plan to make care affordable for Michigan families? Most of us need 2 jobs to pay $1200/month & 6K annual ded.
@luvman33wife in other words , REPUBS idea of a perfect healthcare policy for the masses .  #DontRepealIt #FixIt
Thank you in advance for fighting this at every turn.
@howdycactus my senior parents have already seen a massive increase since your sacred ACA passed. What's your excuse on that?
@howdycactus and you probably said the ACA would reduce costs to the average American family, too.  #termlimits
.@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FLOTUS this okay with your faith?  The Pope thinks u need to help those in need.  What does your God say?
Their only God is money.
you realize the CBO hasn't released any numbers on it yet right?? #liar
@SenateDems Obamacare did that and you did not care. Now you make up numbers with n basis in truth.
The ACA did not do that in states that allowed Medicaid expansion. Ins Companies have raised rates
rates raise when costs do. Even the government raised rates. Medicare went up more than SSI
Ins Co are often HMO's who control what is charged. Much more complicated than simple response to
HMO's and PMO's are not insurance companies. Their entire business model is different. Executive pay is
HMO's absolutely operate as insurance companies. PPO's have negotiated prices with ins companies.
wrong. HMO's and PPO's contract with specific providers. Those providers are contractors.
@luvman33wife start calling it Trumpcare!  He needs to own this.
Obamacare has screwed my insurance and cost me too much money
You are not a credible source!!!
Thank you for standing up for what's right!
Vote No
You can keep you....wait.  No I couldn't.  It's the FIRST shot at doing something to fix broken ACA.  Thanks Obama.
Most likely, me and my husband would lose our coverage. We beg you, plz fight for all who need it, to have it!
@SenateDems #Nazicare deathcamps for everyone. Everyone poir
BULLSHIT!
What do we have to lose?
Obamacanre and govt intrusion screwed me and my insurance
Another banner week in politics. The people over party. Single payer. Real reform. Lead the way.
- Thank you for looking out for us. Please stay focused on investigating Trump ties to Russia. It's all a distraction.
@repdavetrott Dave, time to step up, speak out and admit this is no answer. When will you admit it?
,this bill hasn't even been scored by the http://CBO.You  must be thinking about Obamacare.
Thank you for your support of #healthcareforall
There's 3200 reasons why Gary Peters should RESIGN from the US Senate !!!
oH oH.  DEATH TO THE SENIORS. MORE PROFIT FOR BUSINESS?
isn't that what Obama care is for we will all have coverage affordable and get to keep our Dr. ??
How's Obama care working out for the country?
further proof we are not addressing the fundamentals of a broken system...
bad plan can't believe they have been working on this for over 6 years
as I said earlier. Quit whining and get in the game. ACA is failing. Work to make something Americans can afford.
@SenateDems HOW JUVENILE GARY ...
Stand OUR Ground rule applies here Senator
Thank you for speaking against it!
Thank you for coming out against this bill
@SenateDems prove it!! Be specific!! U made claim today, prove it today! If you can't then you are throwing political crap!
Why?  "Our" president doesn't back up anything he says with any proof....
so you're ok with all BS all the time. I'm not! Dem or Repub.
Nope..  I hate bs either way..  have always voted for the best candidate - no matter the party......
So you're saying it's the same as Obamacare?
Another bot. Blockec
all 11 of you. Block trumputin bot
the plan seems doomed to fail...which might very well be their long term goal...
...I read the proposed bill and didn't see that...Can you point out what section so I can go re-read it?
@SenateDems Just when you need Healthcare the Most they make it More Expensive!
I've read the whole proposal. There is nothing in there that would increase premiums for seniors
In fact, there are several tax reducing sections that would help drop our premiums.
The section that pretty much stays the same is how much your premium would be based on income.
So, if you make more, such as rich people, your premiums will be higher.
What I do not like about Medicare Part B is if you sell your home in that year for a profit, your rates go up
For income tax purposes, qualifying credit goes back to 7.5% instead of 10% under ACA. This is good!
. Where can we read this?
does not care about middle class. Keep spewing lies!
Bot. Blocked
That's right, vultuRes -- stick it to the poor while you go dancing. Trump is wasting so much taxpayer $ it's disgusting.
you should maybe give thought to that debt alone down 257 billion dollars, 401 K way up I love it
@SenateDems Have you read the bill?
It is only right that the Congress give up their own luxury plans and live within the means of the average American. @SenGaryPeters
exactly! Congress should give up exclusion.
Right on cue...Dem talking points. Where's our voice, Senator?
@SenateDems 
Maybe the GOP should put their HC bill back in its secret hiding place.
@SenateDems @SenSchumer @TheDemocrats get to work or go home without pay @POTUS @NancyPelosi @politico  Work or go home
@SenateDems Seniors, who are on a fixed income!!!
seniors on fixed income have Medicare
no, my money is being spent on "affordable" insurance now that has tripled in price
@SenateDems do stand against it!!!!!!!!
Well - you folks voted for this.
@SenateDems @RepBradWenstrup We see what you are doing giving to the rich friends. Unite against this increase say no!
#Trumpcare Will Kill People
just like Obamacare lowered premiums right?  #cough
what a surprise!
@SenateDems it's called republican welfare entitlements
@SenateDems And what about the increases these ppl suffered w on Obama care?  They are on fixed incomes, they will benefit.
GOP plan is higher cost for people, less coverage and at a higher price for the US adding trillions to the debt!
that's yet to bee seen, insurance should be cheaper for us now
why aren't these seniors on Medicare?
is that $3200/yr or $3200/mo?
