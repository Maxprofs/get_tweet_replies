@DSenFloor 
Say, just for discussion, what is the federal role in education?
DOE is the smallest and most limited branch, and yet is the most important besides DOD, strange, eh?
Did you answer the question?
(You should reference #cotus)
no reference needed, thanks
Oh, I get it now.
You just made it up.
Thank you.
no vouchers according to the MI Constitution
That is a state prerogative.
people in lower SES areas have no means to subsidize, thus rich parents get cheeper school for their kids
Sen Peters: So you don't want to return responsibility for & access to good ed to parents - NEA giving you too much money!
how does privatization & increasing religion in public education (unconstitutional) give responsibility to parents?
Because the education systems is working SO WELL now?  Wakeup.
No, it's what YOIU want to say, not the American people! WE WANT BETSY!
You are not the American people. If you are a Trump voter, you are a minority in this country. Enjoy! #StopDeVos

Stop shoving your geitalia in my face.

Elections over.  YOU lost.  Bwhahahahahaha.  Oh, and please provide ONE scientific fact that makes a person gay. GO
Thank you!!!
If a person is diligently working by the books, where is Mrs. DeVos? §he should be showing why she's right for this job. 
Thank You for Standing up for Our children's Education 
This constituent thanks you for saying no to an unqualified candidate #NOonBetsyDeVos
#NoBetsyDevos!!
Thank you, Senator! This makes me very proud. #holdthefloor
The American & Michigan citizens made their voices heard in Nov.  Did you not hear what they said. Stop being obstructionist!
This is SCARY. I'm hoping that MI has an answer to her efforts to dismantle our public schools!
If Spirit moves in all the right places, who's driving to the public school board meetings? I know where I go. As it's busing
@POTUS carried MI. MI has a Republican governor & legislature. Please represent your constituents & support Cabinet nominees.
@SenStabenow @senst You're listening, but Republicans with Republican Senators are complaining that their reps are not.
STOP IT NOW! Quit being a baby and do your job! Confirm Betsy and the rest! Shame on you Gary! You're in a RED state!
No they aren't.  You are tone deaf.
Thank you so much for voting no. Love the mitten's senators.
The American people WANT Betsy--it's YOU that doesnt

I expected GeorgeWBush to demonize Putin! Why are Democrats demonizing Putin? Democrats will get no support from me4ColdWar!
Dems voted for Mattis based on qualifications.  Reps should vote against DeVos based on total lack of qualifications.
Thanks for the extraordinary effort to get our voices heard on DeVos.
No War On Iran! No war on Russia! I left Republican Party because of thier warmongering. Why are Democrats warmongering?
