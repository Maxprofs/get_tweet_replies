How unfortunate. Particularly for the lower class Deplorables whom elected Trump. They shall indeed suffer miserably. Crying shame.
#MedicareForAll #UniversalHealthCare or you will be primaried and you will lose. If youre taking money from the healthcare industry STOP NOW
“we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it" but you thought this was an acceptable answer Incompetence #draintheswamp
Thank you for your hard work, @SenGaryPeters!

Please help stop the #AHCA.

My family, friends, and I are counting on you.
Notice he didn't say anything about #UniversalHealthCare I wonder how much money he takes from the healthcare industry.
Fight against this bad health bill-Rich get richer & reg folk can "Just Die" which is the R's motto...
fight this thing!  Please!
Senator...I hope you will fight it like hell.
@SenGaryPeters do you support #medicare4all and when is your next townhall? If you don't, enjoy your last term. Call him 202-225-5802
Isn't it your job to think about what's best for Michigan? How many Michiganders will lose coverage? And premium go up?
#michiganpride!
I guess you have selective memory re:ACA. You're pathetic & a liar. #DemHypocrisy
More than 50 million,  let's get more real. It will kill millions of seniors and children prematurely, Trump's "budget", kill 'em, cheaper.
No mandate, your donors at the insurance companies must be mad.
This is a henous bill, when did healthcare become a party line, last time I ✓ we all get sick, no party line there!
3/21/2010 #Obamacare passes House with ZERO Republican votes. 5/4/17 Obamacare Replacement Bill passes House with ZERO Democrats votes.
better than going broke paying for Obamacare
The un-ACA was even a worse bill. I know middle-class & working class people, eg my daughter, who chose to go without un-ACA & pay the fine.
Sir, where did you get that number?
I've heard 10 million, 35 million, 27 million, now 20 million. Which is it? #michiganpride!
Please remain opposed to #AHCA. The American people deserve better! Thank you for representing us.
Thank you for speaking the truth, sir! #msactivist
Tired of all you whiny little b*tches on twitter.  Go play with your coloring book.  The adults are in charge now.
It is time all politicians come to the conclusion it is the insurance companies that need to be pressured to make healthcare affordable!!!
@SenGaryPeters Thank's for voting #NoAHCA #NoTrumpCare. I beat #cancer last year and #ACA helped. We are counting on you now, God bless MI.
What is your stance? Dems need a platform to take action. Don't just resist, act!
Oh u libs lie. Like a shaggy old rug.
Like Debbie, I see you leaning right and that's why I will note vote for you when/if you run again.  But, I'm glad you'll vote no!
Gary Peters is spreading his usual garbage !!!When did Gary Peters read ObamaCare ??? Gary Peters is WRONG for Michigan and America !!!
Let's say it becomes law. 

So-called 'health care' racket is starved of funds. 

It collapses under its own weight. 

Costs crash.
Again, where is your solution to failing Obamacare.... I'm still waiting for some kind of reply from you/Dems #DemObstructionist
#BadBill #FakePresident

#TrumpRussia #Impeach45 w #AllPutinPuppets
Thank you, Senator. As one of your constituents I believe we need to take steps forward toward Medicare for all not backward to the ACHA.
Thank you! #NoAHCA
Anything is better than #ACA Lost Good Plan, Lost Doctor & many had good Full time Jobs now Part time job. Have Ins card too expensive 
thank you Senator Peters we need your voice now more then ever  Independent investigation into Russian influence tax returns
So, if you don't like this what's your brilliant idea to keep Obamacare from imploding?  Right, you don't have one.
I fear for my husband he had stroke at 38 has type 1 diabetes will he still be able to get the Insulin he NEEDS everyday
Thank you, Senator.
People say this w/o explanation.We Rto just believe w/o facts?U said no pre existing,yet other Senators say yes pre existing.
Thank you Senator Peters! We're counting on the Senate to expose and stop this dangerous legislation.
Terrible bill!
Thank you for speaking out in opposition to this bill. My son's have hemophilia this bill would prove catastrophic for our family.
Just ask the people in Iowa about Obamacare. 5 out of 99 counties will be covered.. and you wanted to keep it?
Thank you!!!!!!
I am your constituent.  Your job is to influence one @SenateGOP senator to see things your way.  This is what we ask of you.. thank you
@JayJandk17 I'm sure #trump & family will be getting on Trumpcare since it's such a good deal!
Trump goes to high risk pool if sexual assault is a preexisting condition...
Most of which didn't want it but were forced to or risk being fined big time.  And you could keep your doctor (not). Yep, Obamacare was good
This is what people voted for...A government that takes away their healthcare and anything that is beneficial to their well being.
Of course it is a bad bill. They do not care that it is a bad bill. The fundamental problem:  they do NOT care (about anything except $$$)!
Thank you, @SenGaryPeters for voting #NoAHCA. ACA #Obamacare saved my life 2 X thus far (cat bite & gynocological)- UofM hosp loves ACA!
Lol he didn't vote he's a senator the House of Representatives voted on the bill
They haven't voted on the bill yet. It's going to them.
....hopefully we'll be able to sit down and talk about it soon Senator.
You forgot to mention that the 24 million who won't have coverage will no longer be forced to have it with the Obama care mandate.
20m? That's about 7 percent of US population. I'm fine with that. Freedom has a price and if that's it, I'm in...
Thank you for continuing to fight for us!  Vote NO on TrumpCare!
Gary can say all he wants he doesn't get to vote the House does
Thank you @SenGaryPeters for standing up for ordinary constituents!
Most of which did not want healthcare. Now they do not need to pay for it anymore
Thank you, @sengarypeters!
Messaging 101: call it Trumpcare!
@SenateDems you should show the proof else you continue to LIE. #SadDems
Thank you sir!
Why aren't Democrats pushing for Single Payer Universal health care? It works.
