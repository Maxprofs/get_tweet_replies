Thank you Senator Peters!
@RhondaMiller7 does that include Hillary and Podesta?
have a good day
Isn't that what is already happening??
keep pushing this thanks
Thank YOU.
The time came a long time before this Gary.  You and Debbie are not aggressive enough. Lead, don't follow.
Agreed. Seems to be late out of the gate. And certainly not as responsive as Sen. Stabenow to letters and emails.
@IrfanSabrina  Independent Investigation is the only thing We The People would trust.
I agree but it takes so long, and that is with cooperation. Can't we do all of them?
Senator, we are waaaay past due for this. It is imperative before this Admin does long-term damage to our country/allies.
Bravo, Senator Peters!
Thank you!
@NakedBlunch  Thank you.
Thank you!  Nunes is compromised beyond all contemplation.
I think it's about time to accept the fact that you lost the election & you hate America, & always have.
Thank you @SenGaryPeters We must persist and insist this is done right. We have your back.
THANK YOU Senator Peters. We have a right to have an unbiased investigation into #Trumprussia   Nunes action were odd at best
Thank you, @SenGaryPeters! Please don't let this go.
@CindibiseniusOr Do it!
.@SenGaryPeters Not my Senator, but I support this. Pretty sure @SenSchumer & @SenGillibrand (my Senators) will get onboard with this.
thank you sir!
Can you just work for the people and not follow the BS of politics ??
Yep. Past time.
About time someone takes this on!
Thank you for standing up! I'm one of your proud constituents.
How about a special prosecutor to investigate Nunes obvious attempts to torpedo the current investigation????
Appreciate you taking these issues and your oath of office seriously. Thank you.
lets waste more money creating an enemy, you are a fear monger. Get to work and do something that will benefit Michiganders
Thank you from a grateful constituent!
Thanks Gary!! I knew I voted for you for some good reasons!!
Thank you from this constituent in 48375.
standing up never liked so good!  Keep representing your constituents and our America

YES!!!! from a Michigander--Proud!
You have NO facts to call for this.  Stop the partisan hack sh*t.  Fix healthcare.
@owillis if only you had spoke out against Holder, Lynch & Lerner this call would have been more credible. #CountryOverParty
Yes Senator please advocate for this. The public needs to know if this administration can be trusted at all.
@mrjamesob Ya think? 
(You do realise that the whole world is watching the antics in the White House?)
@owillis Who unmasked American citizens & leaked it to the press?
they cud probably do that from Bruxelles ;)
Yes, ask the Chinese government to do it.
What？
please retire and find a rock to hide under
Gimme a break! The only collusion was between Clinton campaign  & Mainstream Media to cheat/beat Sanders and Trump.
When are democrats going to stop Russia had nothing to do with our election?! We The People DID!
yes! Way past time
Americans do not deserve their elected officials engaging in secret unpatriotic foreign roles
@roblwilson Which probably will find nothing, cost a small fortune, but will keep Conspiracy Theorists happy for months
Thank you!!!!
Thank you, sir, for listening to your constituents and considering our country first. Thank you so much!
@JJohnson2u You think?

It's been time.
thank you Senator Peters. Nunes has discredited himself by his bizarre grandstanding we have to find the truth   fight on sir
Replace Nunes so whole thing doesn't have 2 start all over. Thanks 2 Comey America has Trump. No time 2 waste!
Finally, I've bitten my nails down to the nail bed! Thank you, Senator!
thank you from your constiuents in #Lenawee #lenaweeindivisible
I agree. Thx Gary!
Thank you! We've been saying that for 2 months! Trump-Russian collusion. Independent investigation.
@tedcruz @JohnCornyn I am sure you understand the gravity of the situation and are on board with an independent imvestigation
It should come quickly. We deserve answers.
Hear hear!
Means nothing without a time constraint. This could drag out on four years with all the lying liars involved
Thank you, sir.
@thinker128 Yes Yes Yes #resist #Trumprussia
well done, hope AND @stabenow are committed to filibuster SCOTUS!!
Thank you for moving to protect our national security.
Why don't you investigate @GCHQ and @BarackObama for using electronic surveillance and microwave harassment against @POTUS?
MIKE BISHOP SHOWS HIS TRUE LOYALTY-TO RUSSIA!HE OPPOSES NUNES' RECUSAL & an INDEPENDENT COMMISION! HE SUPPORTS TREASON!
I believe the POTUS has to sign off on that&even if he did, he will try to stack it&why Nunes sabotaged committee
Need to stop this Dem "witch hunt" & do something useful!  Why didn't u do this for Clinton's taking $$ from Foreign Entities
My Senator   TY Gary Peters MI
If you vote against Gorsuch it shows you are Dem puppet and nothing you do is "independent" or "nonpartisan"! U don't rep us!
@ybbkaren This is about #NATIONALSECURITY PERIOD we have A President that gave our enemies the codes for our Cyber Security
@charles_gaba Thank you , the American people deserve this. Maybe it will help restore our confidence in Congress.
That's my Senator!  Out , Trump + IP addresses + Grand Rapids + Spectrum Health + Russia!
PLEASE!!
Right.  Now round up your colleagues and do your jobs.

This Russia narrative is a bunch of sloppy lies like the weapons of mass destruction was. Investigate the DNC. #TermLimits
Thank you Senator Peters!
The American people agree. @Scone_Mason
Good luck with getting GOP onboard
right on Senator Peters. Be a leader and fight for it.
@GreatDismal 44 members of house voting in Sharia law hmmm 56 voted no. what real issue
yes!! folks are already writing tv shows about trump's america!
Thank you.  We cannot get to any productive level of governing until #Trumprussia is dealt with.
@stacy_friday Yesss
what is the name of this legislation?
@Eykis The time came back in OCT 2016, congress didn't have the courage then and still doesn't.
@MichiganDems Thank YOU! We appreciate you standing your ground on this.
thank you Senator Peters! While I appreciate your written response, cosponsoring this bill means so much more to me!
thank you Senator from Gary G. If Warren MI
Yes! Please stay on top of this. Thank you!
@lovliny thank you Gary I call your office often hold the line.
Yes! Has it suddenly become OK to have another country deciding who we elect? Please!
As a constituent, I thank you for your patriotism and for speaking out truth in these troubling times!
YES YES YES. POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS WITH RUSSIAN SPIE BANK.
Thank you, Senator!
i'll admit we need this but we also need the dems to not get distracted by some of this and watch @VP and the cronies at work
thank you Senator Peters. Proud to be a Michigander. Proud that you are our Senator.
It is time for Gary Peters to stop working for Russia!!! RESIGN Gary Peters !!!
Thank you, sir! I am your constituent and am happy that you are speaking for an independent investigation.
Absolutely! Too many meetings with so many Trump staff and always with nothing of substance discussed. Yeah, right!
thanks Senator! Pls vote NO on Gorsuch.
Thank you!! As one of your constituents, thank you so much!!
Agreed!
keep pushing for it and you'll always have my vote.
YES! Thank you, Senator Peters! As your constituents, this is very important to myself and my husband.
. Tilting at windmills! Fix this mess of a country! Thats what you are paid to do.
I think you should be enforcing the laws on the books about classified information
THANK YOU!
Others of us would prefer you to just accept the results and get to work for us.
Constituent here. I am equally concerned with the possible illegal surveillance/unmasking reportedly done by the Obama Admin
Ditto!
@rootwoman123 yes! bravo senator. looking out for our country's welfare!!
as do I. And if enough evidence can be found impeach both Trump and Pence.
@rootwoman123 Please. We must get cleanly to the bottom if this stain on our nation. @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
. The srain was on Monica's blue dress
Thank you Senator Peters.  Your Patriotism is showing!
. Investigate Detroit ballot stuffing
@GOP  Should have appointed independent counsel to investigate Trump-Russian collusion the day after Nunes briefed WH.
Thank you.  I am a constituent of yours and applaud your co-sponsorship of legislation to get the answers we need.
Thank you, @SenGaryPeters. A nonpartisan committee is totally what we need. Probably good idea to re-open Office of Strategic Influence too.
Thank you senator, for speaking for us. And for what's right.
Get r done
