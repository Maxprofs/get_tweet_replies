FOLES OWNS BRADY
No it was wentz not foles wentz made the play calls
Foles still had to execute it which he did beautifully
No Alshon and Torrey carries the team NOT NICK FOLES it’s just facts
Not facts at all just little opinions that are wrong and you’re entitled to your wrong opinion
Nick foles is average I’m sorry
he is a super bowl champion.
So is joe flacco

@NFL @POTUS44




Amazing game!!!
I'm in tears right now...this is real life?? Let's go Eagles!!!
Congratulations to the Philadelphia eagles from a Dallas cowboys fan .
You represented the conference and won the championship game . True champions!.
And they had to win it - Brady doesn't just lose. #FlyEaglesFly

Woah there bud, feeling kinda salty cause Brady is starting to show his age?
YOU FUCKING SCARED ME SO MUCH THE LAST PLAY. HOLY SHIT YOU GUYS DID IT.
Yeah, Brady is incredible. He was doing something unique
yea, the amount of times I shouted yes yes! no no NO! so many times that last play was crazy
Congrats!!! Well played game!!
Congrats EAGLES#Fly,EaglesFly
Yes you did gentlemen!
And today it happens. After nearly a decade of having a vacant corner in my office, and being laughed at because of it. The grand installation occurs. Thank you @Eagles! #FlyEaglesFly
Still waiting on my framed newspaper!! Last piece for my office. (Yeah right I will prob buy 10 more things).
That newspaper and the smaller one (from Modells) were the first of the "last things I'm gonna buy." That was many shirts ago. Did you order your framed pic from the store at http://philly.com ?
Yep! I saw that the delivery has been delayed due to demand. I thought I was done buying stuff after I finally got my pint glass with the roster on it but I just saw they have an Eagles super bowl build-a-bear and now I need that, too. 
I asked because of that--I had ordered mine around 2/5 or 2/6. (I have a few others from them.) I never expected it to take so long. I actually complained to them the same day as the email update. Mine finally arrived on 3/14.
Hoping mine arrives soon. I need to get my wall done. Don’t want to hang anything else until I have everything
I took so much abuse over the last decade about the obvious missing team in my office. Until now.
Yes Philadelphia wins Super Bowl Finally we did it 
#FlyEaglesFly #FlyPhillyFly
STEAK-UMM BLESS THE EAGLES
Goooooo @Eagles Goooooo Congrats
Yes you guys did & congratulations . I can’t believe Brady hurried off the field I understand it’s a tough loss, but show some sort of sportsmanship !!! Thanks Philly you guys made my night down here in Tennessee. 
 #FlyEaglesFly Eagles win it for the country
What the hell are you talking about Trump already won one for our country. He was an underdog who won an election that was rigged by the DNC and the Clinton's with help from the Obama intelligen agencys. Good try though.

Congratulations to the Eagles! I was really pulling for Philly; tired of seeing dynasties like the Patriots win so often, plus they had already beaten the Eagles once in 2005.
Awww thank you (smile).
Now, of course, this does not mean that I'll take any delight in the Phillies threatening the Mets chances this year in the NL east! <smile>!
Hahahahahaha I giggle I just said to someone tonight I'm ready to move onto #Baseball and #Spring this made me laugh out loud.
Fuck the patriots
I'm a patriots fan but I have to say congratulations to the Eagles....great game #patriots #Eagles
Now we can all take a knee..  Seoul Olympics and then what?   Gitmo Live!!!
I'm so excited my hands are shaking we won the fucking Super Bowl!!!
You guys see the new mini gun in Fortnite?

Congrats Eagles. Sincerely, a Giants fan
Fucking unbelievable
Congratulations
I LOVE EVERYONE #FlyEaglesFly
YEAH!!
@PhillyMayor please don’t do this to me!!! I need a parade tomorrow!!! Pretty please
I booked my flight for tonight till Wednesday morning..: the super Bowl parade is ALWAYS the Tuesday after @PhillyMayor
Career over...
The downfall is next season. You saw him play amazing a couple years ago, saw him start turning to shit last year, this year was worse, next year he will probably quit.


This photo would be banned if it was the other way around
Illuminati
Thank you in behalf of Seahawks nation!
no, the players did it. Philadelphia didn't do shit.
With some help from the #ReplayGuy who gave you 2 TD's you did not actually score
Congrats to the Eagles! I had no doubt you'd win it! You made Philly/Jersey proud. FLY EAGLES FLY.........E-A-G-L-E-S!!!!!

Congratulations but always remember, you didn’t beat the greatest of all time.

YESSS!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats Phily.
If we are lucky, the Eagles victory over the Patriots may be a harbinger of the American spirit soaring to victory over a Trump uprising led by a loud mouthed, over zealous captain who is full of his own self importance & whose arrogance made him unaware of his own vulnerability.
GOD BLESS YOU BABIES SOOOOOOOO HAPPY FOR YOU TO GOD BE THE GLORY!!!
Congratulations Philadelphia Eagles!!! #flyeaglesfly #superbowl championship

So does this mean there will be looting, rioting, cars burning, store windows getting smashed, etc. all night in Philadelphia ?

I don’t get my free coffee now but congrats
I am so glad that anybody but Tom Brady’s team won the Super Bowl! I am also glad that I made it through the whole NFL season without watching an entire game. The NFL will need to do better to get my support in the future #nflblackout
Free Meek

Even me a cowboys fan is happy with this result. It’s humbling and sticks it to the nfl that they aren’t going to ruin this game
Congratulations. You played a great game. We have won five times- I'm happy to see a team who had not won, share that feeling with your fans. #underdogs makes the win that much more special for you
