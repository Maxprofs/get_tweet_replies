Happy to! DM me

I’m more of a “Reserve Avenger”. But happy to help. DM me.
Nothing reserve about DP Bob Ross paintin some beautiful clouds happy clouds.
@realDonaldTrump can do it!
Just off work now   Suited up and ready
Very cool and very proud of you.  That speaks volumes and I imagine it’s not the easiest thing either .  I don’t think I could do it without tearing up
Every one of the Avengers actors should be already gathering to go immediately.
If only there was a catchy word for "gather."
Avengers...meet! Avengers...get your sh!t together! 
No, it needs an "A" sound, right?
Avengers...arrange yourselves?
Hm. It'll happen. I'm gonna sleep on it.
Avengers, assume the position?
Oh god, YES PLEASE.
I call dibs on The Black Widow 

I'm the purple one. DM me.
Barney. Joke.  Vision! This is amazing 
What’s his name?
That's so awesome. Maybe @clarkgregg and @MingNa or some of the others can assemble with you too!
Young Man look forward to your new life, it will be so awesome. You will be more  powerful than all of the  Avengers. Love you.
@HazOsterfield show @TomHolland1996
Sarah Silverman is probably available, judging how she retweeted this.
Shannon - just now seeing your tweet via @prefragoph and @entylawyer so not sure if you've succeeded or not. Go to my profile here and DM me or follow the email address in the profile and contact me. Will make it happen if still needed.
You rock, Himmmm!
God bless you bothpeople like you are the exact reason that social media is a very important medium. When special people drive this vehicle, dreams become possible, and lives are changed forever!
#MakeItHappen
@RobertDowneyJr Please take a moment to read @ShannonBream message and help a dying child. Give her a call at Fox News. Avenger to the rescue!
I wish you the best of luck, Shannon. I believe in miracles!
Shannon, God bless you!
dm me
You make me proud of our species. Thank you.
I can’t imagine being on my deathbed wanting to see an Avenger??? Even as a kid, I would only want those who loved me and those I loved around me. Definitely not some fictional character. To each their own I guess. Whatever will make him happy.
The good news is, a lot of other people are vividly imagining you on your deathbed right now, and would be happy to describe the scene to you
God Bless him and his family.
AMEN!
May the good Lord miraculously cure this child.
What do you need? I can help. Whatever musician he wants. No problem. DM me.
Hello Shannon , please DM . Best B 
I think it worked!
James Commie Comey is out of work..... Oh I thought you said revengers, not Avengers.  My bad.
@ChrisEvans @RobertDowneyJr
Excellent objective! Highly praiseworthy! GBU!
ONLY one person is dying,
In zoo NIGERIA thousands are dying every single day killing by FULANI HERDSMEN
And BRITAIN is full aware of that, but can't say anything because their plan for putting a jihadists as a president was to terminate all BIAFRANs and take over their resources
Avengers Assemble!
@Marvel
What city Does he live? Poor kid I hope he gets his wish

Saw this a week ago. Chris Evans, aka Captain America, and I think Robert Downey jr, and the actor that plays the Hulk, have all responded.  So many of these actors put themselves out there. They visit hospitals, with out any fanfare
@TimTebow a gem of a guy...
@joss
@RookerOnline @DanaiGurira @letitiawright @zoesaldana @karengillan @DaveBautista @AnthonyMackie
@RobertDowneyJr @chrishemsworth @prattprattpratt @twhiddleston @chadwickboseman @MarkRuffalo @TessaThompson_x
He “died” yesterday - March 30th, but did get a few shoutouts from the Avengers cast! His family is thankful!
Did you get your connect? I never heard back from you and I’m ready to help, but need details to arrange and time is certainly of the essence, but I can’t help you if I have no details to give when making the necessary calls love! @RealMichaelGuy
Contact Tonto. I'm sure Kris would love to help out

You need some inspector Callahan
I'm sure Gunny Highway would help you out with that!!! That's really sad so sorry.
Unfortunately I don’t have any influence with any Avengers, however I commend you Shannon and Kellyanne for believing in a small child’s imagination to save the world,Something missing in today’s society!
What about all the other children dying?  What are you doing to help them?
Thanks Shannon. I did at the time. I understand the wish did come true.
@GalGadot  can you help out with this?
@chrishemsworth  @RobertDowneyJr @MarkRuffalo @TomHolland1996  @twhiddleston @zoesaldana @karengillan @prattprattpratt
@AnthonyMackie @chadwickboseman
Super @seanhannity to the rescue ..
Shannon--tell @POTUS , He'll arrange it, , or Call Fabio, or  @RealJamesWoods . God Bless him.
I am more of a cheap knock-off billionaire. Well... in all honesty more of a hundred-aire - but if there is anything I can do, just let me know.
#BeSomeonesHero
@ChrisEvans  @RobertDowneyJr  @chrishemsworth @scarletjohannso @MarkRuffalo
Did you get any messages to him?
Thx to @VancityReynolds @ChrisEvans @Renner4Real n anyone else that went to make this young boys dream come true before he passed away Shannon Bream you are a gem Prayers to our little angel  #Avengers
Shannon what a wonderful thing you did. Such a credit to you and your industry. #USMC
Cool of you.
Praying for God's Grace and His blessings for this boy, and that he is received into His Holy hands.
For God no imposible..
@Avengers, please respond and make this wish of terminally ill boy come true!
THIS WHOLE THREAD IS MAKING ME CRY AND I JUST CAN'T SAY HOW MUCH I LOVE IT
he will be with the greatest superhero that never lived..god will bless him with eternal love and brightness..
@RealJamesWoods
Just seeing this -he’s gone? Well get ALL THE AVENGER’s lined up ...

@twhiddleston @chrishemsworth  can you please help .

Good girl, goOD ESQ
Bless you.  And bless his family at this terrible time.
This thread is awesome. Sometimes Twitter is a decent place. Way to go Jeremy Renner, Ryan Reynolds, Chris Evans and Don Cheadle.
How refreshing it is to see that Twitter is being used for Good instead of the constant hateful attacks which are ever present. This young man will be healed in either this life or the next. Thank you Shannon!
Prayers for that young boy and his family....
Stuff like this is the best part of Twitter
Outstanding outpouring of love and support. When this young boy does pass from this world (praying that is many years from now), may he find peace among the angles and a beautiful greeting from the greatest super hero of all, God.
@RobertDowneyJr @ChrisEvans @chadwickboseman @TomHolland1996
God bless you!!!
You are a good person Shannon.
Have you tried Make A Wish? Hopefully they can put a rush on it. God bless this young child.
Hope! Thoughts and prayers.
@chrishemsworth
@RobertDowneyJr Ironman would be the pièce de résistance
Imagine. This is how we are - we like to look up and see, aka Mr. Rogers, helpers.
All of them need to do this ....
#TheResistance check this tweet out @ShannonBream plz RT
@ClemsonFB D-Line Avengers
@IMDb @Marvel @Avengers Much courage!,to Emilio,the family of him and to their friends.
@IMDb @Marvel @Avengers A great gesture of your and of people who have answered to your petition,who also show the great people who are.
If only this poor boy:"Emilio",could recover of the disease who has and could see:"The Avengers:Infinity War".
I am sorry very much for him.
What a wonderful gift this would be, in such dire and sad circumstances.
Shannon, what else does he or his family need that the Twitterverse can help with?
I wish I were one of the avengers... just for that mission. 
All my best wishes anyway.
God Bless you for helping this child! You are an amazing person inside & out! Thank you to all the Avengers who are helping! God Bless you all & God Bless this child & his family.
God is good 
Bless this boy dear Lord w more time
@RobertDowneyJr @ChrisEvans @MarkRuffalo 

gentlemen. 
There is a time for promotional dreams, another for sad reality. 

A child is dying in a matter of days and wishes a greeting from one Avenger.

 If you wish to make his last dream true, contact @ShannonBream 

Thank you.

I am not Capt. America however in am a Marine and this country owes me a favor or two... so I make claim now for this boy.. to @POTUS AND @FLOTUS .. if any one can get the word out they can .. and I ask all vets to retweet
Chris was right about repeal of an amendment (2nd in this case) . Please see my subsequent tweet explaining why adding a new amendment is no easier.
The last 22  or so of amendments were pretty much soft balls to get through after the 4th or so. Not easy to amend the constitution.
@RobertDowneyJr must see this one 
I appreciate you involvement with this child. There are not very many parents alive who cannot feel the pain of this tragedy. Regarding Chris Steirwalt's comments on the difficulty in deleting the 2nd he is right. Where he is wrong is that creating a new one is equally difficult.
It's very impressive. A small thing but grt impact get responses by the celebs. Pray for the recovery of the kid.
Wow Shannon, a prayer with a little nudge from your community of followers.             So cool  
Kids shouldn't hurt AT ALL. PRAYERS 4 the LIL' GUY going up.
Praying for this child.
@MarkRuffalo know you’re off the grid so you may not see this but thought I’d give it a go! Know you have a soft spot for kids!
@RobertDowneyJr @chrishemsworth
@MarkRuffalo
Praying!
God bless you all!

Thank you so very much for everything you did for that Child. I hope that God will bless you and him.
@wongrel, @clarkgregg, @Renner4Real, @ZacharyLevi...hoping I didn't miss anyone. He was a huge film buff and loved your work. He's slowly fading away surrounded by loved ones. We will always celebrate his zest for life. Adios Emi, we will miss your humor and smile.
On behalf of Emilio and our family, I want to thank @ShannonBream, @jaketapper and all the wonderful actors and actresses who sent their videos and beautiful words to Emi: Paul Rudd @Oberlin1putt, @ChrisEvans, @paul_bettany, @VancityReynolds, @TomHolland1996, @ChloeBennet4,...
My condolences on the loss of your son, Emilio. I hope his spirits were lifted by the messages of love & support. Everyone touched by his story is holding him in their heart & in their prayers.

May God rest Emilio’s sweet soul & comfort his loved ones in their time of sorrow.
Keep it up, 6 degrees of separation right?

God bless u!
Thank you Shannon, sending prayers!
@HamillHimself  Maybe a Master Jedi could help?
That's wierd.  My eyes are sweating.
@chrishemsworth Thor is on Twitter
Is there any way @MarvelStudios could arrange a private screening for this kid to see #Infinity War before it opens?  It would be so cool if he could.
@MarkRuffalo is always tweeting
Guh.  So dusty in here.  Good humans.  
my prayers go out
Tears are streaming down my face from this and the responses from so many of the Avengers! Thank you Shannon and everyone for restoring my faith in humanity beyond our political differences 
Wow! All celebs aren’t a$$holes all the time? Now they just need to get their politics right.

Try and get him to see Infinity War in the premiere !
I've been loving all the reponses to this.  Such great support!  Great to see the @Avengers @AgentsofSHIELD (and @VancityReynolds) #assembling to bring a smile to this young man's face!
I know Emilio. He is the most lovely boy you  ever know. Thank you @ShannonBream  for your generosity
I'm so happy you got great responses. Way to go Avengers!
my money is on the under .if he wants to meet a cook thats a single dad im on my way.
Is the young boy ready to meet Jesus Christ?  Has he & his family believed on Him for salvation?  #Gospel :
@FoxNews For cryin out loud. I thought you finally got rid of that Hack Shep Smith and all that happened was he probably took time off for some face tightening or recovering from another bad dye job. Get rid of the guy.
Not to try to hijack this thread... But as a father, and a retired "super-hero" with a badge and a gun - Can we take this spirit of unity and all around American badassery and paste it onto the school safety issue? Let's put real life Avengers in our schools! TODAY
Aw I hope seeing all these guys makes his last days as best as they can be
Hey, this is wonder woman, i know that i am not an avenger but the justice league does do occasional work with the avenger team!  Cheers to who may be in needs of our skills anytime!
Very cool
Who is his favorite Avenger?
I'm sure there's plenty of those awesome folks who'd help!
Really cool ... no way I can help but sounds likely that at least some Avengers will help make his wish come true.
Look at all of them responding. 

I’m so not famous but this is so wonderful!
@TheRealStanLee can you please help?
Was the little boy's wish granted in time? I am so hoping it's a yes. 
Thank you for sharing all the help you have been getting from the Celebrities.  Very touching to see everyone unify for a really great reason. God Bless!
@Renner4Real @RobertDowneyJr
@prattprattpratt @DaveBautista @MarkRuffalo @chrishemsworth @zoesaldana @PomKlementieff @realmikecolter @vincentdonofrio @jonnybernthal @DeborahAnnWoll @ElodieYung @TomHolland1996 can you please contact @ShannonBream and send some love to this boy
@RealHughJackman I think it's time to dust off those claws old buddeh. Just incase them Avengers need some backup
We're ready to rally the NF community in support of this family - check your email for an email we just sent, or send us a DM if we can help. Thank you for doing this! #EndNF
@prattprattpratt will help!! 
Please keep us abreast and if you can we'd love to see the moment when they see him! My heart wells for this child.
This is one of the reasons why I love the cast of the Marvel Movies (beyond their sheer awesomeness).  Look how many already stepped up.  Makes me feel very warm and fuzzy.
Sadly no connection. Retweeting for this sweet kid. Hope he gets his wish.
@prattprattpratt
Bravo Shannon Bream for making it happen!
Anything for children. I am sure he got his wish. God bless you and be surrounded with angels 
@ShannonBream tell he is cleared for d the Avengers.Code 4
Yh
Go see him #Avengers please God Bless this child @MarvelStudios @Marvel @RobertDowneyJr
May god have mercy on his soul and bless you for doing such a great act of humanity. I did a RT, I really wish if I could do more to help..
@ShannonBream I hope all avengers can show up for the boy! Thank you @ChrisEvans @Renner4Real @Paul_Bettany @VancityReynolds. Is there anyway @MarkRuffalo @RobertDowneyJr @TomHolland1996 @prattprattpratt @chrishemsworth @twhiddleston to respond to this?
May heaven watch over this little boy and his family. It's so touching to see people offer a little time out of their lives to simply deliver joy and fulfill his wish. Go Avengers!
The greatest celeb I know is the Lord Jesus Christ. Do not fear my little friend He loves you dearly & you can trust you are very safe in His hands regardless !
Thoughts and prayers for him
@MarkRuffalo Is an avenger.
How about letting him pre-screen “Avengers Infinity War” before the rest of America gets to see it! & right after he sees it... the Avengers themselves show up!!!
Thank you Shannon for helping this young man! THANK YOU to all those that reached out, retweeted. And huge shout out and thanks to everyone from The Avengers who reached out to this boy. ALL OF YOU ROCK!!!
Thank you , Shannon and those Avengers that came forward! this was an example of what Hollywood should be doing and thus being acknowledged fir such.  Stay away from politics- either side cannot be trusted!
Omg it’s so cool...all the Avengers are assembling in the comments...
You are an angel .@ShannonBream And God is Great! Love it!
The awesomeness of @ShannonBream and all super-heroes out there! Get this kid his wish! 
PLEASE KEEP POLITICS OUT OF THIS. ITS A PLEA FOR A DYING CHILD. HE ASKED FOR AVENGERS - - AND THEY HAVE ALL COME FORWARD. They are true super heroes
Thank you Shannon and Avengers!!  For showing Kindness!  Its so good to see!  So rare these days
Forward this to @RealDeanCain @AdamBaldwin  and @RealJamesWoods  they might know someone.
