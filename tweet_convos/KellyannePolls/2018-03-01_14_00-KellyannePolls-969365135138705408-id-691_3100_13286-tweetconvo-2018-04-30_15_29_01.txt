During today's Opioid Summit at the White House, Eric Bolling shared the story of his son who died from an accidental overdose. 
@KellyannePolls @ericbolling @WhiteHouse Eric you were great on SNL last night!
Are you planning to use the same exit strategy as his son to avoid prison?
The left at it's finest.
Thankyou Big Data Rhondadixon0563@gmail.com
Yes let's make America great Again by impeaching your father and voting out the entire crooked Administration. You have damaged this country to its core you all should be ashamed of yourselves and I hope you all end up where you belong in jail
Well hell yeah we gotta do something about this it’s not like it’s killing them little nigglets or them little miniature Taco Bell kids it’s our children the next generation to continue the keep America white movement
Racist.
Your absolutely right iam  the worlds biggest racist against racist and racism so fars as my writing you understand perfectly you and those like you like to play dumb until I realized your not playing
There is a place for opiod use: controlled and managed by responsible medical professionals in coordination with the patient for pain management. When it hit the streets is when the horrific outcomes started.


So sorry for your loss. I’m living in fear of the call every single day.  My son nearly died of a heroine overdose after 8 months clean. It was to date the worse day of my life when that call came.  And sadly  battle is not over - nor is the fear of the call.
CALLING ALL TRUMPSTERS - STAND TALL, STAND STRONG, REMAIN RESOLUTE, BE PATIENT, HAVE FAITH - GOD IS ON OUR SIDE - TRUMP IS PRESIDENT BUT THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE - TO RENEW YOUR FAITH - Read "TRUMP KEEPING THE DREAM ALIVE" & RT

maybe don't send unwanted pics to coworkers?
We love you Eric.  Join you in your pain.  God will take care of you.
Front and Center? Yeah with those cuts to healthcare we should really be able to get all the addicts the help they need.

I have mixed feelings. As a rehab nurse, I witnessed many who regained function and meaningful lives through opioid pain control. I also see the danger. There must be a balance.
I got that call 10 years ago. I curled up on the kitchen floor. There are millions of us, Eric. Where were you before this affected you?
Prayers for your loss! It wasn't Eric's fault.
YOUR pain is just beginning
My heart goes out to Mr Bollinger. Our son continues to struggle with a heroin addiction developed after using roxies. It’s a living nightmare

Blame big Pharma pushing sales and doctors over prescribing
He doesn't care.
CALLING ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS - STAND TALL, STAND STRONG, REMAIN RESOLUTE, BE PATIENT HAVE FAITH - GOD IS ON OUR SIDE - DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT BUT THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE - TO RENEW YOUR FAITH- Read "TRUMP KEEPING THE DREAM ALIVE" & RT


That is pathetic




Hi Eri, has @LaraLeaTrump sought treatment for those underarms yet?
And close 3rd place for stupid post of the day.
Sorry for the death of Mr. Bolling’s son. God help us all, if we do not unite to stem the tide of this epidemic infecting our population.
Eric - don’t get caught sending dick pics and humiliating your kids to the point they turn to drugs to escape. Be a parent that is present. Become the honorable Trump.
Though there are many families in pain over the terrible anguish they are feeling from the death from opioids, you must also remember there are those of us that without opioids would be in so much pain would possibly end our own lives because the pain is so unbearable!!!!
Thank you, Eric Bolling for sharing your family narrative. President Trump loves your family and the American people. I know he will do all he can to end the opioid crisis in our nation. Stay strong! God loves you and Adrienne he is with Eric Chase!
Actually, that is not true, do some research rather than just drinking the kool aid.
Yeah, I saw it. He's crazy, it will never fly with the 5 million NRA members or the millions of other #Pro2A folks or the law! We still have a 5th & 14th Amendment! The Constitution, you should read it!
Both of you 
Yes. And Trump's administration hasn't done shit about it. Other than Kellyanne's ridiculous clueless advice "just don't do it" and cutting off access to the experts. THESE DAILY DEATHS ARE THE RESONSIBILITY OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. YOU ARE FAILING SPECTACULARLY!

But what about the 17 murdered children in Florida? Can  you imagine the pain they feel? #liar #nocompassion #brainless The gun debate IS front and center. #DoSomething
Then you must know how the parents of the 17 dead kids from Parkland feel. Yet you do nothing. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
Eric Trump, proof that the douche doesn't fall far from the bag!
Trump - the art of the con
So when is daddy-o going to fund it?

I'd say there is a good chance, his kid's drug problems were related to Eric's appalling behaviour.

Is that why trump put a 24 year old with a fake resume and no legitimate experience in charge of managing it? Makes sense
Maybe you and Eric can compare dick pics with David Dennison.

Earlier today, we filed this complaint seeking a ct order voiding the alleged “hush” agreement between our client S. Clifford aka Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump. https://www.dropbox.com/s/ocvnkwprbs7enje/Filed%20Complaint.pdf?dl=0 …
That’s awesome Eric! Does he show you his penis?  Apparently it’s ‘not much’ to see, or so I’m told.  Let us know!
The American people will work TIRELESSLY until the scum like Kellyanne and ALL the Trump family are removed from the White House and imprisoned. It's coming sooner, @KellyannePolls! They say nothing will happen for now, but tomorrow...
Um, you should give your kids a chance and change their last name.
Eric our prayers our with you I am a Father of two grown Children that are fighting opiate addiction,also I concoured the opiate addiction back in 2015 which went on and on for 25 years! Rehab 8 times then I put it in GodsI’m a living testimony
Maybe as a “new father” you will feel the pain that a father in the mammal kingdom feels when his child is taken as a trophy by some inhumane hunter. Nah....who am I fooling?
Can you imagine the pain his family suffered when he sent pics of his penis to female coworkers.

Conway isn't just any gov't employee, she works in the WH & reports directly to Trump. The WH refuses to accept findings she violated the Hatch Act, confirming again that they follow the law only when it suits them, which isn't how our Constitution works. http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/376945-watchdog-kellyanne-conway-violated-hatch-act-twice-in-tv-appearances#.Wp7a2KLCPjc.twitter …

Yes, AMAZING! Who knew Fox 'news'  is capable of any factual message  ?????????????? Is Fox getting ready to bail on the stinking ship?
You need to learn how to choose better friends...
Murderers.
JUST IN: Trump ends Obama-era ban on importing sport-hunted elephant trophies http://hill.cm/nKX3c6c  
The harassment guy?
Must be an Eric thing. 
Sorry, Mr. Bolling and family, that you have joined the legions of families who've experienced this pain and live with the aftermath of a grief that haunts for years to come.  All mind altering drugs should be severely curtailed and are way too easy to obtain.
Known so many now gone, who began by getting "numbed" through medical  opiates.  When that ran out, it was easy to be seduced by the street variety and availability.  It's the same as Meth.  People who like "numbing up" should never be given it to eliminate pain entirely.
Fuck Eric bolling
We love you & will never stop supporting you!NEVER! We will get through this by teaching youth that trying drugs one time is one time to many! One time means they will either be addicted or die. Less that 3 percent get sober. My dad wrote a book on it. He’s the 3%. (Sober 35yrs.)
Eric, your a brave, stand-upkind of guy.
How in the world , could you keep tears from rolling like a river. God Bless you and your family. No one can imagine your pain! Stop the Opioid abuse, whichpharmacutical companies push.
You want to #MAGA? Then we'll have to dispose of the MAGAt in the Oval Orifiice first,
We're working on it. Expect subpoenas soon.

#lockitup
Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway violated Hatch Act in TV interviews, federal investigators say
Then do what we need. @KellyannePolls CANNOT be our czar, she has NO experience. We the addiction pros can tell you how to help efficiently and humanely. If you truly give a shit, BE HELPFUL.
we love and miss you Eric. May god bless you and give you strength and guidance to heel.
@ericbolling, I cannot nor would I want to imagine what it feels like losing one of your children. Our prayers and sympathies to you and your family.
Bipolar President, a first
What happened to the law suites he was gonna file when he got fired at Fox News.
So sorry for your loss Eric boiling 

Get your hands out of Big Pharma money, then!!
So sorry.
CHINA WILL BE AGAINST U.S
AND RAISING THEIR GDP UNTIL 2030.
TO THE TOP IN THE WORLD
EVERYTHING IN THESE WORLD IS
" MADE IN CHINA"
U.S CAN LOSE BY CHINA
IS U.S  TOO DUMB TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?
But how your baby will not even know who you are when you are in jail

May God be with you and your wife always Amen               I'm still feeling so sad for your wife and you ;(                       We have a huge problem here in our community :(   Very sad to see and here about so many young kids and some adults toodying from this epidemic
Thank you for talking about your personal heartbreak so that we can learn how to address the opioid problem head on. So sorry for you and your family. 
I am praying for you Eric. I miss not seeing you on the five. Look to the Lord Jesus for healing and comfort. He’s there for you. 
So sad about Eric Boiling losses all at once. He was at the top and is at the bottom now I"m sure.   Very said about his son and all our sons and daughter's impacted by this life changing drug dependence that is so hard to quit with and without treatment, horrible.
Eric our prayers are with you! Thank you for your insight with making sure we communicate with our children! God bless you an your family. Keep up the fight!

Oh, my goodness! And r u going 2b as great a father as ur own?
Bad genes, Bad genes
WHO ARE  YOU KIDDING, YOU OR YOUR DADDY COULD CARE LESS. I AM GOING TO ENJOY YOUR DADDY'S FALL FROM GRACE.
God Bless you and your family.

This crisis is bad. I have faith POTUS can fix it. #MAGA!
Medical 3d printing can help with this and stem cells can as well. Let the body heal itself.
Our colleges are loaded with drugs. Have your kid go to a local school and commute.
I wish you would come back to tv! You are missed!
How about let’s focus on how u stole 1.2 million from your kids cancer charity for “ campaign funds” or your POS brother lied about Russia  coverup. Your family is going down
I lost my son to opioid overdose. Prescribed my worthless dr and medical board would not touch him.

GREAT THANK YOU FOR SHARING. MR BOLLING YOU ARE A GREAT FATHER .
Heart breaking.
What about the kids dying from guns? They didn’t choose to to die. And putting a needle in your arm is a choice
Your dads a sun bed warrior. Dec n Dids.
Dec and Dids are giving it some tonight...
Dylan, 10, is one for the future...when I’m gone, she’ll still be rooting out celebs and Cavy members !

eric trump thinks an opioid crisis occurs when Ron Howard doesn't get enough fiber


Way to point that illicit Fentanyl out ! I was getting ready to jump out and yell DONT ALLOW THEM PUT THIS DEATH INTO % of Rx opiates!! Great report RN advocating!
Thanks
Ahhh, but there are 2 on that list that are Rx related. While street Fyntenal isn't, the Rx kind can be just as deadly, and should be monitored as well.  Hospice issues it in abundance, and never collects the unused amounts.  Addicts target senior homes for that reason.
The prescription drug is already monitored enough!even to the point that it is illegal to even be treated with prescription drugs.TheDEA ischasingfairies going after the prescribing physician&the pt Npain!why isn’t the DEAhavingBootsOnTheGroundNthis?BCthePt/DrDontShootBack
Ummm could have fooled me that the Opioid Crisis was front and center other than a lot of #TinyTrump hot air initially nothing’s really changed, NO TOUGHER laws, regulations or enforcement of #BigPharma & #PillFactories, sorry. But hey good to dream right #MAGA2018 #MAGA
2014 South Florida - the Colombia of prescription drugs - to expose a bustling pill pipeline that stretches from the beaches of Ft. Lauderdale to the rolling hills of Appalachia
I lost my son to heroin in 2015... Where do we even begin... Treatment for the addict and extreme punishment for the suppliers (which should be labeled domestic terrorist)...

I'm going to a funeral on Tuesday for this beautiful girl that became part of my life. Suffered from depression and addiction. My heart is broken 
“Not my kid syndrome” is so real and alive!! Thank you for reiterating the fact that you must know what your kids are doing at all times. It’s a matter of life or death. Don’t wait till it’s too late!



Where’s the money?  Thoughts and prayers mean jack to an addict.
So sorry for your loss and the loss of many!
@ermmjames
Nothing like gutting healthcare to fight a drug addiction crises!!
Gun Violence!!
Feb 1, 2011 is the date a Spfld,. MA  policeman knocked on my door at 1:00 AM.   As president Eisenhour said "it never gets better". Dear Mr. Bolling. You will learn to compartmentalize for the sake of your family.  I walk in your shoes. Bobby K
So sad. I felt like I knew him from his years on Fox. No one should have to endure what he and his family has.
Is this the best thing you have to brag about
