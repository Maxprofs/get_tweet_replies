Oh wow: Federal judge who struck down Ohio law banning abortion of Down Syndrome babies used to be President of Cincinnati's Planned Parenthood!
Stop trying to spread hate propaganda about Planned Parenthood. Abortion rates are way down because of their services in education and availability of contraception. Not to mention the millions of women who rely on them for health services because they can’t afford it elsewhere.
I think you should be aborted now kellyanne!
Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself

Ms. Conway, I see that Mr. Trump has attacked our justice dept. while congratulating Putin, a KGB agent.  You are on the wrong side of history
Gary you are misunderstanding the entire concept of his actions.  Mrs. Conway is an exceptional person and is on the right side of history.  Let's see how it all plays out at the end of President Don's eight year reign.
@twitter got anothet bot, here
Sadistic.

Ok Kelly,,i got to apologise, ,,just met ur husband,
Now i know why u look the way u do..
Sorry..
You are a very  very sad person
Kellyanne is a very very good person that does not think only of herself but others.

Your twitter pic should come with a warning - viewer discretion recommended.
Hey, listen. Can I have my money back? Return our money tomorrow when you wake up.

Go on Fox & Friends or whatever brain sucking cult outlet you feel comfortable at and apologize to us right after you return our money. Thanks.

P.S Don't wait.
Uhh, Justices Gorsich, Alito, Scalia & others were members of Federalist society. Gorsuch has even participated in events at @realDonaldTrump’s hotel. Justice Thomas’s wife lobbied on issues that came before @Scotus & he didn’t recuse. Let’s not talk about ideological conflicts.
There is a difference between "ideological conflict" and flat out ignoring the law.

Before you bring up R v. W as a stipulation of law, know what you're talking about. Roe didn't legalize abortion; rather, it upheld an individual's right to privacy concerning the abortion.
Then why does it place a limit on when abortions can be performed?
With regards specifically to privacy, yes. It never legitimized abortion. It could not have done so without substantive discovery of when life begins.
Again, in Roe v. Wade, the Court held that a woman has the Constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion. The Court held that state laws infringing on this right are unconstitutional.
Trumper's have determined that life begins at conception with no substantial evidence. By their definition a cancerous tumor should be protected as life. It grows like a fetus inside the body similarly.  How do humans define life? Is it abortion to treat people for cancer?


Why are you wasting my money on private flights?
Your husband hates your boss and what you do.
No conflict there...
Nothing but pure genocide.  Something needs to be done now.  I have Faith that the Trumpster can turn this scourge around for us.
So we can send all the unwanted Down's Syndrome babies to your house? Got it. Thanks!
These babies are happy and often very high level functioning.
Many are not and take a lifetime of care. Getting help and education is hell and you have to fight for everything. Abortion for whatever reason is a difficult decision, is legal and none of your business unless you are the one pregnant. #Prolifeuntiltheyreborn #LyingKellyAnne
Just learned you’re linked to CA! Are you still working for them inside our WH? Maybe the @fbi @CIA @IvankaTrump @SecretService can answer that? “Cambridge Analytica scandal rocks already rattled Trump world” @maddow http://msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/ … via @msnbc
I would never even buy a used car from Maddow. Help!
What’s your point Ms. Conjob?
Broidy, a head chair of the RNC payed a playboy bunny $1.6mil. to keep quiet about an affair and abortion? I know you were proud to continue to support the GOP, the party where abortion is o.k., only if helps keep an affair for a chair from being reported.
#GOPPartyofHypocrites
No comment about your boss's relationship with Stormy Daniels? Nothing about her claim that Trump employees/contractors threatened her life?
Gross, kellyanne is still slithering around the news networks?
How do we get con job to shut the f up? Biggest mystery of 2018
Very convenient!!

Kellyanne brags Trump's wall is funded right before he whines it isn't 
https://shareblue.com/kellyanne-conway-trumps-wall-funding/ …


This would be none of your fucking business.
And your point families have the right to choose when and if to have children .How many unwanted children have you adopted ?
What does it matter, considering that the president just pushed forth continued funding for Planned Parenthood. SMH
You are next to be fired.
Kellyanne.... so .... you're WITH the program, huh?

@FBI is interested
Oh wow Crime family is living in the WH amazing
Hey you how goes it don’t let them make stand points
So you think Clinton and Biden are obsessed with Trump. Take a look at Trump’s twitter feed and prove to yourself what a liar you are.
Seriously, you don't get to call people out when your at least equally guilty.  I give you and your ilk credit, I would have thought this level of bat shit would gave been laughed out of this country.  Kudos on your fairly successful race to the bottom.  Credit where due...
How in the fuck do you sleep at night?
and ur point???? shall we talk about Trump latest judicial appointees? or cabinet members past lives?? might not want to open this one Con-man!
#ConflictofInterest


Remarks and tweets like this KellyAnne is one reason I have respect for you. There are plenty of others, just ask! #BowlingGreenMassacre
Is this a pun, Kelly?
you're an evil, ugly person and the world will be a better place when you're gone.
Good for that judge. He knows first hand about Planned Parenthood

That makes it worse not a celebration
I watched your interview with my local channels 9 -b4 President Trump's visit to NH. Great.
I can’t wait for you to go to jail.
Reporter: “So the candidate is the puppet?"   
Cambridge Analytica: “Always.”

EXCLUSIVE: Donald Trump's campaign consultants…
She is gonna be TOAST IN PRISON!  I can’t stand her and SHS lying!!  WE DESERVE WAY BETTER!  Time is running out for them
IT’S GETTING HOTTER
Dots...Dots...Always Dots...
Oh wow!  You colluded with Russia to elect this buffoon. Oh wow!
Have you eaten your young yet
Is your crypt keeper letting you out or will you be resting in your coffin for the remainder of the week?
These Federal judges are a blight, they have too much power.

So what are you trying to say ?
“Baby”? Gross.
What's your point?

And then they die.  Abortion for all of these birth defects involves medication that stops fetal heartbeat.  No pain.  Parents grieve for their loss, but they have decided to choose compassion.
The GOP platform of forced birth has no compassion.
The GOP platform of forced birth is archaic and monstrous.  Do you know what happens to a baby in utero who has osteogenesis imperfecta?
Their bones break as they grow, their bones break when they are born.  Their ribs breaks when they take their first breath.
Should not be vilified.
Not every Down Syndrome baby is a happy, healthy kid.  The ones who have the best outcomes are mosaics.  (Look it up.)
Stop trying to take away actual medical choices from loving parents.
Choice is about choice - if you want to give birth to a baby who will die in a minute or an hour or a few months - that's your choice.  And the millions of dollars in cost should be covered.
At the same time, parents who choose to end those pregnancies...
Have you ever talked to a woman carrying conjoined twins, one dead, the other dying?
What about those wanted babies who don't develop a brain?  Or the ones with no functioning kidneys or bladder?
"Late term" abortion is about compassionate care for fetal demise.
Do you know anything about birth defects?  Do you know that woman, every day, decide how to treat their wanted pregnancy when they find out their baby will die when the cord is cut because of a fatal heart defect?
So?  Maybe someone actually involved in the issue, and a judge knows the law.
Why do you all want to force women to give birth to babies with major birth defects, but not want to pay for their medical care?
Let parents decide the best course of action.
McCabe gets fired while this biatch keeps breaking the law. #LOCKTHEMUP

Oh baby as in you feel bad for the baby, or oh baby you’re a witch who’se missing ingredients for her weekend potion?
Judges are Impeachable..Read Mark Levin, Men in Black
at least with Down's we can tell when they're retarded right? @POTUS
Conway needs to have a talk with Trump he’s on another rant again about his Republican Mueller It’s Republicans who see how much damage Trump can cause to business and the rich
Your fake news kellyanne Conway.
Wow, you just can't make up stuff this bizarre.

#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
In this day and age of alternative facts, it happens all the time. lol
"Defund Planned Parenthood"
And you used to be opposed to Trump programs and plans (saw the videos.) Your point is?
Why don’t you forget Hillary Clinton?

Can't you focus on real matters?
My mistake, not good news, but just the opposite, bad news about the striking down, but good news about exposing the judge.
Good news!

Oh crook, liar Kellyanne.  Have you checked the microwaves lately? They might be spying on you.
MUELLER
Baby not part of @POTUS pure white America. He wants kids like this disposed of.
Thank god he did!!
Oh baby Kellyanne you're So hot!

Wondering why you are still in the WH..You violated the Hatch Act three times! #FireKellyAnne

"Oh baby?" Tone deaf?

"I have the best deficits"  "Nobody does deficits & bankruptcy like me" #Kleptocracy is for losers
How many abortions has @realDonaldTrump paid for over the years? If paid $130k hush money for a relationship, he wouldn't hesitate to pay for abortions.
And just who appointed that judge?  That might be a interesting tidbit of information to share,
saw you on TV

Icky



SUCCUBUS..................................................
Who did you pick ncaa
If you have any clout, please urge Sessions to FIRE McCAbe.He does not deserve his pension after what he did
If that is what YOU believe, then you live that way but don't force others to live as you do. No one is forcing YOU to abort. Usually, whenever I have the misfortune of seeing you on TV, I hit mute but I'm not forcing everyone to mute you.

Go sell some more of Ivanka's crap.
For those of you who know the agony of having, loving and caring for Down Syndrome babies, don't you think a government that wants to force you to have & care for these babies should then help you pay for the lifelong commitment? Not Trump/Pence's government. Your problem.
If only Kellyanne's parents had a time machine, I'll bet THEY would abort their down-syndrome baby.
