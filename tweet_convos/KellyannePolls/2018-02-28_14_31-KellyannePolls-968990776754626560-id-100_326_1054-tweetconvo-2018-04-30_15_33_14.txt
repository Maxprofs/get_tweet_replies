To confirm Russ Vought as Dep OMB Dir, this is the 9th time Pence has broken a Senate tie It’s the 3rd time he’s broken a tie to confirm a nominee. DeVos, Brownback & now Vought. No VP had ever cast a single ballot to break a tie to confirm any nominee before Pence. He’s had 3
Omg this is so terrifying.
No, you're terrifying.
Why do trump supporters always resort to name calling?
Don't think I called you a name did I? It's just that Liberals terrify me. Sorry
Apology accepted. I don’t think it should be a side, I think we should all be concerned that our election process has been compromised by Russia. That’s scary.
For sure... By the way, looked at some of your Tweets. I really enjoyed the article on David Crosby.
He’s awesome. I’ve always loved his music.
Definitely! I was always more of a Neil Young fan, but Crosby's voice is melodic.
And this is a positive thing?!!!!
Pure obstruction by the left.
Pure incompetence by the right, GOP grand old,predators,have all three branches and still have to use Pencil Head to break ties
Shows how poor the nominees Trump puts forward are for these positions.
This is not a good thing you realize that?
Shows how fractured and fragile the current interim administration is.

Lying Mike’s most important job @Bencjacobs
I wouldn’t be proud of this. It shows how unqualified your nominees are.
Why is @KellyannePolls RT'ing this?  The fact that @VP has to cast tie-breaking votes is indicative of this administrations inability to negotiate and build consensus.  I thought @realDonaldTrump was the best negotiator, like, ever?
All this proves is that Trump is picking shitty people! The republicans own the house and senate so they shouldn’t need lying Pence!!
He’s got a voting record we can use against him.
And your point is ?

Which means the GOP, with a majority, has to scramble to get votes-no wonder, the people being voted on are vastly incompetent
Why would you retweet this @KellyannePolls? It confirms your boss is an idiot who nominates idiots. Such an embarrassment!
God Bless VP Pence
He is committed to work for America and the American people
Frightening and toxic.
Pence is just a big fat RELIGOUS BIGOT, the only way he ever would b President is of course for Dumpty Trumpty to get kicked out, which seems eminent.  All he does is lie and coverup for trump, lying  constantly. We all know he knew all about FLYNN and lied through his teeth 
and your point is?
Will not those the votes in about..... let's say 6 months?
Why are you proud of this. It shows #chaos
YOU GO PENCE!  "SI SE PUEDE!"
Wow

#MAGA
#DrainTheDeepState
Thank God for Mike Pence!
Kinda pathetic. 
Nope

Very pathetic.
Would not happen if McCain would vote for his party...
What’s your point?
Republicans can’t even pass any bills without Pence breaking the tie. Doesn’t say much for GOP.    #resist
That is his job/responsibility
Proving just how broken this administration is.
#BlueWave 

His home State of Indiana will begin liquor sales on Sunday, a first in 80 years.  As Trump and himself work on ending Medicaid.
T
Pence will have to go back and fix what you guys have.done.
Well if the brain dead democraps did some actual work.......
Making America great again!
@KellyannePolls @ChadPergram not something to be proud of
Yes because of all the RINOs in office.
#MAGA2020. GET COMFY KIDS. ;)
Great job VP PENCE keep up the great work.
You say that like it’s a good thing... sad.
So?
Wen the US have a VP with a Bee & Rabbit Brian tats all he's capable of doin. Wicky Pence jus "Nut" holder.

Why is there a tie?  The Republicans are a majority.
It can’t be @TheDemocrats fault. The are the very definition of “bi-partisan”
So sorry to hear Mr Pence is having problems with ties.  Maybe try a clip-on?
“What this country really needs is a good 5 cent cigar” - Thomas Marshall
Really? How many for each?
SAD!
How many gop senators are there now? Arent they the "majority"? Seems to me the only way to arrive at a tie is if all gop senators aren't on board.
McCain does not count.
Translated: There aren't enough 'Rs' in the Senate!!! If Ds win 'any' seats over Rs then it is a Democrat Senate!!!
Joe Video made us believe VPs were useless.
Hey @KellyannePolls, this speaks to Trump picking the worst people, not to obstruction.  If he'd pick qualified candidates, there wouldn't be drama (and there probably wouldn't be the unprecedented turnover in the administration).
Obstrution by dems is the norm with the narrow majority
With 7 yrs to go it's going 
to be a RECORD for the 

Books !!
It already is Trump has surpassed other presidents
And so often voting against the best interests of our country.
That is what you have to do when you have obstructionist/ Dems. Their greatest fear is the success of our @potus and our USA.
#mother should buy him some #madeinchina #trumpties
Other than being "a heartbeat away", and going to state funerals, that's pretty much the VP's main job.
Yeah, but did he break your glasses?
Git R Done. Tired of the swamp..
YES!!!  Mueller is draining that swamp that Trump brought in with him.  #MAMAGA
Mueller ACTUALLY Making America Great Again.....restoring order to our democracy!
He's the deciderer  :P

He didn't.
If only the Dems knew how to say yes.
If only republicans knew how to govern. They control all three branches of government and both houses of Congress. Have some personal responsibility.
