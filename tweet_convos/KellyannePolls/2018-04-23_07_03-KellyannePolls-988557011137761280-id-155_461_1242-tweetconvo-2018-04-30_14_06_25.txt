Yeh... someone wrote a book about me too 
I just did because you’re an outstanding journalist. So very few of you left.
And #RobertMueller  is writing the  “True Story of #TrumpRussia “ , can’t wait for that one.
@AandGShow they would make a great interview!
#dondonomics  NO revolution since Glorious Revolution of 1688. Thanks to the  cult  its  1st, 2nd, or 3rd coming time. A MAGA picture worth a  million   words,  Replace the left 1% w/ the right  1%! Another book idea #dondonomics
There teaching our children, policing our neighborhood, implementing laws and killing our people.
Stop asking why the Republican Party is no longer inclusive come on you know that statement by the kkk made news on CNN many years ago.
They were going to do this so that eventually they can implement there racist agenda well here we are there in police department , there judges, lawyers, teachers, congressman, and senators bigly that is the republican agenda .
I understand there is a revolt and it has been planned for many years since the kkk decided there where no longer wearing sheets, they were now going to educate themselves , go in to politics, schools police department etc .

Hey Kellyanne you aren’t supposed 2 be promoting sales. Did you not learn when you promoted Ivanka’s crappy clothing line??
Well they don't want the truth reveled how they are connected to the sex trade and trafficing and anything else that is illegal. We will see the truth and then there will be no place for them to hide.

Does anyone have the number for the Vatican Demonic Possession Hotline? 
Nothing like an endorsement from the WH!
And this Administration his helping the sales of both books! So, who is smarter?
i rather comey book great book
You wrote a book about poor Trump? They are so mean to him?
Inside the what?  Money sweet heart...money is all you need to influence politics in United States. Piles and piles of cold hard worthless cash.
Give me a break...half the eligible voters can’t read beyond a 3rd grade level and the other half are watching porn all day....if that’s what a populous (bowel) movement is so be it...but it’s not influencing anything.
Everyone’s writing a god damn book...too bad no one can read them.

Watching you on CNN.....Good Grief , you are a total purveyor of  falsehoods.... you need to get your act together and start spreading the Truth.... or you will be in an orange jumpsuit with your boss!
Every Trump voter should send Hillary a post card with just two words written on it. "I HAPPENED"!  Perhaps it will give her a good perspective so she can see that we aren't stupid!
Buying your book although published by  look forward to it. @PredsNHL
Interesting subject and title. I'm intriged and I like it!
Cashing in on everything you can, huh, KellyAnn?
At least Comey and Hillary wrote books about subjects they are knowledgeable about.
I'll wait for the film adaptation.
Already preordered mine.
We want your husband to write a book entitled “A Thousand Reasons Why Trump Is An Idiot”.
Does it explain why voters supported @realDonaldTrump placing man working as foreign agent for extremist Sunni Islam (ISIS) supporting Turkey to highest USA security position?
Preordered, and looks like it comes out after my Korean final exam, so I’ll have some time.

Shit read
Trump ( had someone) write some books about how he is full of sh*t.
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @WhiteHouse Now Kellyanne is trying to sell books through her office in the whitehouse? Another trump admin person misusing their position. Kellyanne needs to be fired.
Nah we got all the info we need on those Neo Nazi #VeryFinePeople - https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/15/16781222/trump-racism-economic-anxiety-study … @CrownPublishing @germanrlopez @KellyannePolls @PressSec #WorldBookDay #WorldBookNight #WorldBookDay2018 #Russia #Charlottesville #Putin #MuellerInvestigation #TuesdayThoughts #Macron
I’m tired of the finger pointing and wish Trump would quit doing it.  Finger pointer in chief, Cadet bone spurs, Spanky.....so many choices.
And Im writing a book about all of the above.

 troll alert..
You are a bigger fraud than Trump! I hate that you represent yourself as a Pittsburgher! You only travel in the narrow GOP circles, ever been to a political event that wasn’t for Trump!
Because people from Pittsburgh all think the same way. I guess.
I’ll pass I will wait for trump impeachment and sentence ,  by the resistance !!!!!
You mean re-election and another SCOTUS pick. Pad the room, get out the coloring books, rent a puppy and keep the suicide hotline number on speed dial. #MAGA
Another bot here lmao I wonder where are all your bot friends maybe in jail ???
Mr Alex, go read a book or a real newspaper.
I got something better for you a real confession from a traitor
You and your alternative facts
You have zero credibility. Why on earth would anyone waste their money??
Should have named it as "The Racist Revolt " .....
Your using a government acct. to promote a book? I thought you've been told about this Smellyanne
You are very sad conway

Excellent I have it on order
I can't wait!! Mine is pre-ordered!
Who are you again? Trust me not many people will read a propaganda book written by a nobody.
@KellyannePolls again using personal Twitter account for commercial promotion. Illegal.
Just got this on Audible. Can't wait to start!
Pre-ordering now.

Thank you in advance, Salena.
Great idea for Christmas gifts for the die hard liberals on your lists.

When KC RTs you, RUNNNNNN
The Great Revolt? Sounds revolting.
Should be called;
THE GREAT LIE
Yippee, the blue wave is coming!!!!
Holy shit, the comments... If those guys are representative of the "resistance" there will be at least 8 years of Trump (barring prior salvation by nuclear apocalypse).
I think there's a #PeePeeTape or #PeePeeTapes that will prob stop that from happening
Can you please consider having a plan B that entails convicing a sufficient number of people to show up and vote for your candidate?
So your brilliant strategy is to insult people until they vote for you?
BTW, Rats are highly social and intelligent, not like Drumpf at all.
No RJ I said we were "working on it". And I'm sure they are. I was making reference to the fact that NYC rats (like @Trump) are carriers of disease, filth, germs & contagions the like scientists have never seen before - just like DT
Reshaping the people into ignorant followers, happy with less than their Grandfathers had, and happy with lies.
OKAY. Geez, the pressure!
Everybody is writing fucking books to get rich
I look forward to purchasing and reading your book, Ms. Zito. You have been the clearest thinker on political matters in the country over the past few years
Where is the cover from?
The Blue Wave is coming!
Anything for fame and fortune .unfortunately when he goes down so will your bank account
And you're still a twat. Your husband seems smarter than you.
Pass
Zzzzz.
CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS!!!
This sounds "Greatly Revolting" ... If  kellyanne recommends it must be full of unsubstantiated #AlternativeFacts . 

If #DotardTrump likes it, it must be wrong.

Look for it on the #NewYorkTimes worst sellers list.
Salena, your mentions... 



lol @ the biggest fraud since insurance , @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump
  wrote the book on TREASON.


Barf.
OH silly me, I thought being a Princeton and Harvard graduate was superior to being a bimbo trophy wife. Well I guess I should trust the judgement of an old man's scrotum named Kellyanne Conway.
Trump supporters look at this book and can't see that its subtitle actually is- Inside the White Supremacist Movement.


No one gives a damn! PS. you saying Melania is "superior" 2 Michelle Obama is laughable. Michelle hasn't shown us her entire naked body, legs spread.Nor did she cheat w/ another "man" to land him. You're disgusting! Go crawl back in the sewer! @CNN STOP giving this thing airtime!
Re Conway interview on CNN/Dana Bash...... I say there's something psychotic about someone who melts down on tv and then smiles brightly into the camera at the end. What a loooon.
Michelle didn’t get into the country illegally either. Having trump buy her the Einstein visa and then her illegal parents come. Did she find the cure for cancer??  Oh that’s right melania is a stripper. You r pathetic

Sounds awesome; will read.
What if I'm tired of the voters?
Then go find a lake, and jump in.
But it’s April.
Melania is better than Michelle??  Really dirt bag.   Michelle never did porn
Over 20 years ago an eastern liberal journalist wrote of the Patio Man as a voting force. It is highly recommended reading. Most of that voting block went for Trump in the last election.
Pre-ordered.
Did you interview any of the imaginary working class voters that you consistently profile in your columns? They're all so virtuous and inspired!
Time to focus on the forces that caused this rather than the politicians who are accidental representations of those forces.
Finally we the people have a reputable  book to read.  The other books are lies and garbage.
anything associated with #MsAlternativeFacts is not on my reading list

"The Revolting Act" is a better title!
@kellyannepolls This is the “revolt” your “coalition” sent a black man. Save your “economic anxiety” for someone with enough racist trumpist uncles and cousins to know the truth behind your hatred.

Hard Pass

Would anybody in their right mind ever buy a book referenced in Kellyann Con Way tweet?
I bet it's interesting.
It must be a picture book if Kellyanne understood it best book ever that doesn’t look at President Trump in a bad light
So you are promoting your own book? Nice.
Did Michael Cohen flip and spill his guts and rat on Trump yet?

Ignorant
Why aren't you in prison?
Done.
Writing about the voters, doing the work the "deep thinkers" are too important to bother with, keep this up you'll become indispensable
