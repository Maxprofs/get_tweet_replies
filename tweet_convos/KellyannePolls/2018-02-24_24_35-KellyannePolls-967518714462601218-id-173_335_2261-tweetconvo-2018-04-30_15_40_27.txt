Bald 'Spot'. 'SPOT' ?????? Too funny. Spot. Haaaaaa.

god doesn't exist, I'm just gonna rip that band-aid off for you real fast
Saw, heard you on @WattersWorld tonight. You looked great - rested, relaxed. You are one of the great women of our time.k
you think she looked rested?

Lawsuit alleges a 7-year-old girl was taken from her mother "screaming and crying" just days after the pair came to the U.S. seeking asylum. Mother and daughter are now at detention facilities 2,000 miles apart. http://apne.ws/NDoGRzI 
GOD BLESS YOU KELLYANNE CONWAY!!! SHALOM!
The orange hair is worse than the bald spot
And we won't care.
As long as meleana changed her hair color
he's so disgusting
Fake !
Y'ALL ARE CHANGING AMERICA ONE DAY AT A TIME, THANK THE LIVING GOD!!!
This is THE DONALD we elected !
POTUS you do a great job. I’d just cut it off I think. Women get bald spots too!!!
Yeah. His jokes about mexicans, muslims, POWs, blacks, gays, transgenders, nukes, women, pedophiles, treason, tax dodging, scam businesses and cripples are soooo funny. They make me laugh at the IDIOTS that voted for him. HAHAHAHAHA #WhiteTrashTrump
Gotta love our Prez!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nah

There are no lighthearted moments for us voters who have to watch the #chaos that you propagandize as governing.
#BanAssaultRifles #BoycottNRA
Our president  is just so awesome!  Got to love him and his humor.
He needs more than to cover his blad spot how about covering his mouth that would be the best thing of all
The bald spot doesn't concern me. It is empty head that worries me!!!
Rather than working hard on his bald spot how about working hard at running the country


Our President has a great sense of humor 
Hilarious.  I laughed out loud in my own home.
This is the President of the US???  What an embarrassment.
That is one of the scariest sights - I may have nightmares....
They must have reve removed part of his brain when they did the scalp reduction.
Yea TRUMP!!
Trump is proud of you Jesse! He congratulated you and Judge Janine last night on the phone! Awesome! Watters, you got that cool factor! Love ya! #MAGA 
Yesterday Donald Trump stood in front of 1000's of people at CPAC and got the crowd to chant "Lock her up" in regards to a woman who has never been charged with a crime...

Meanwhile 4 of his campaign staff have plead GUILTY to crimes.

Oh The Irony...

Gaslighting 101
Such a great tweet! Thanks
It’s the hole in his head.
What about the sores on his balls? Those SPOTS scared the heck out of @FLOTUS but not Stormy Daniels.
#SanctionRussia
#GetSmartTrump
We love you and we stand with youMEGA 2020 
I just love our President! He's the best! 
#TRUMP2020
Nothing is lighthearted at the CPAC conference
Sooo..... Great
Today bad he doesn't try or hid his stupid
Kellyanne, he absolutely MUST do more of this. The self-deprecation convinces independent voters that dems claims of narcissism, etc. is bs. I’m telling you, ahead of the midterms, this will be gold and is vital to disarming dems primary msg. Independents key 2 ltg midterm losses
Are you kidding? Sure that video will convince us that he’s not debasing and degrading Am values EVERY DAY AND WITH EVERY  UTTERANCE out of his mouth.! Settles with porn stars - has affairs while just married with a newborn - grabs women - Yeah he’s a great role model!
Too bad he doesn’t “work hard” at being a decent president.
Who cares? More BS and alternative facts from this has been. No I ne takes her seriously. No one intelligent that is.

He’s an embarrassment
"OUR President"
 instead of
"this President"
Kellyanne we Love you too!
Would you Please 
start the phrase 
Maybe it will catch on!

INSANE @realDonaldTrump CAN'T HIDE THIS...
Unless you wear a rug, or get those transplants it happens. I think most of it is due to listening to Democrats, and liberals making speeches, and scratching your head wondering what they're saying. It confuses the hell out of me, and brings on migraines.
She just turned fifty but she’s not a day under seventy five. Lying caused bags for this hag in a flag.
Awesome job Mr Trump!

You do a pretty crappy job! Remember how Ivanka describe your hairdo! So funny
This was priceless!!!!!!!!!!
@FoxNews @POTUS I love the fact the Pres had fun at own expense. Nice moment! Made me smile
Minoxidil 5% (Use the Foam version).  It might at least slow down hair loss.
We love you  just the same Mr President! Your bald spot is the least of our concerns Draining the swamp is the Goal! That includes both parties, also congress and senate need to immediately be on Obama’s care for health care coverage and maybe they will fix it!!
You've got more problems then a bald spot trump.Senilty is setting in.
Hey Mr. Waters,
Does YOUR world have disabled people standing more on their own?  OUR'S does!  MAGA with FTPU!
President has answers in mailroom. Good stuff.  Promise! God bless. @JackPosobiec @VPComDir @DanScavino @leeson_penny @realDonaldTrump @VP @FLOTUS @PressSec @nikkihaley
The POTUS is a real person who can laugh at himself!  A rare characteristic of most people in politics!

To him that is one of the most important issues facing the nation. Health of his hair plugs. Pathetic #BlueTsunami2018 #NeverAgain #VetsForGunControl
I love this man 

Nuts.
Mr president you have nothing to apologize for i have observed you for a long time and you are one of the most neat and well dressed people i have seen.
Not funny at all. You’re very polite, but c’mon. You know trump is anything but funny.
Mr. President, 
Wait till you see OUR highlights,  waiting for you in mailroom! MAGA with FTPU! Not hiding anything, here.
@realDonaldTrump @DanScavino @JackPosobiec @VPComDir @PressSec @nikkihaley @leeson_penny
You’re failing. We all know you have a gigantic bald spot on your head you #MORON
#saddo
OMG what a fool. Does he really think this is appropriate in this forum.
Not the only thing he's working hard to hide...
Face it, you're a very unattractive old man and your hair looks ridiculous. You'd have a hard time reconnecting with Stormy or any other porn star.
But you can't hide the emptiness underneath it....#justgoaway
Awwww It’s so cute when people take a break from their evil doing to point out their own ugliness. What a wonderful wonderful world we live in.
I hope those light moments keep her warm in jail
The cover up is not his bald spot

As he says that women are snakes.  You should be ashamed, Kelly, to allow yourself to lie for Pornald.
Favorite part of the whole speech #MAGA
You gonna lose more hair than that before this investigation is over.
Well it happens to the best
Oh my gosh this was the Greatest thing ever!!! You had me in tears I was laughing so hard!! Awesome job Mr President!!

You own #FakeNewsCNN.
All I see is more sane people watching channels other than the GOP propaganda channel.
The man is a walking obscenity.
At least he has a sense of humor
WE DONT LOVE HIM FOR HIS HAIR, WE LOVE HIM FOR HIS HEART, HIS STRENGTH N LOVE OF COUNTRY.

Bald “SPOT”!?  Have you seen the video?  His fat head is a patchwork of oddly sewn together pieces of scalp. It’s HYSTERICAL!! 

The irony of the post for people who don't understand the sick humor here is: they are not talking about Trump and his Admin. They are manifesting it into the American people. "You all" Is all of who is reading this and seeing it. You are being hypnotized by the serpent. Wake up!
He made me laugh love my. PRESIDENT @kellyannepolls please M.D. me
A great 90 minute speech and this is the MSM’s sound bite. The President trolled them again.
First true thing I ever heard him say.
Just like your administration tries to hide the truth. At the end of the day you all are found lacking. Nothing can hide the holes you dig.
#CPAC2018 President Trump's speech was really good. Best ever! Viewers got the President at his best an loved it. Thanks again for all you do for America.
I love my @POTUS
Yes he does for 3 hours every morning . Remember , Niro fiddled while Rome burned . Donny looks in the mirror and pukes . Narcissus want a be . The crazy hair is the bane of his miserable life .
Well, at least he works hard at something other than his golf game.
NOBODY IN #HOLLYWOOD OR #POLITICS CAN DO THAT IN PUBLIC, WELL, EXCEPT #PELOSI WITH HER DENTURES DURING THE #SOTU... 
Look at everyone who’s turned states’ evidence!!
MAGA morons still chanting lock her up at CPAC. They seriously live in another reality. Future conservatives will have to pay the price and they could care less
You. The man. Mr.  President 
What happened to all the #ReleaseTheMemo hashtags from you guys? No more reporting on memos?!
I sure hope nobody can see my bald spot. That’ll be embarrassing!
Harder than he works at being @POTUS, I can tell you that!
#MethBarbie   There were no light moments at #CPAC   It was an hour rant filled with hate, racist BS, divisiveness and narcissistic accolades. You are a #ComplicitBarbie and a #ToxicBarbie
The #Memo was released. I will add #DevinNunes to the #TrumpCrimeFamilyTree You are all a bunch of #ComplicitLiars and when #MuellerIsDone you will all be #PrisonInmateLiars
Love this man
It’s always good to have a sense of humor about oneself.

Kellyanne, why are you listed as Honorable Kellyanne Conway on the CPAC agenda?
Almost like stolen valor.
Funniest thing I’ve seen him do lol
I love his humor.
has humor? Who knew...
10 bucks says his hair gel is made from Putin’s sperm.
I didn’t vote for Clinton either.
I wrote in “none of the above”
My intelligence is quite intact, thanks.
Yup
Lighthearted? Ridiculous and self centered more truthful.
Jackass

He’s charming!
Extremely....
#MAGA 


I thought he should shave his head on Twitter!
But this was really funny!
Love our President Donald J Trump
I love his sense of humor. He's a 70 year old male me. 
That moment was indeed so lighthearted it caused my lunch to rise back up into my mouth.
