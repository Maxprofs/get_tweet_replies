Loved the game, loved the halftime show, and loved the Olympic ads, but the highlight of the #SuperBowl is Nick Foles

Fake MSM fails to cover Hillary’s abuse of Bill!
Hillary Clinton ‘gave Bill a black eye in the White House' http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/hillary-clinton-gave-bill-a-black-eye-in-the-white-house-former-secret-service-agent-gary-byrne-a7067066.html …
Stay off my boy they dont like u ..



You look like shit!

Wow. Colbie Holderness responds to Kellyanne Conway & others in the WH talking about her life: "Rob Porter is my ex-husband. Here’s what you should know about abuse." http://wapo.st/2BoP75k?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.40dfadbbf851 …

Colbie Holderness, Rob Porter's ex-wife, reponds to Kellyanne Conway saying she's not worried about Hope Hicks because Hicks is strong and smart: "Being strong — with excellent instincts and loyalty and smarts — does not inoculate a person against abuse." …
So Hope Hicks won't be hit in the face by Rob Porter because she is "strong and loyal" eh? Are you a complete idiot, or just someone who has sold their soul to the devil/fascist in chief? You're a waste of human flesh. Disappear.
Thanks for the vote of confidence towards John Kelly. Now I'm sure he's gonna get fired.
You r 1 sad joke! I’m recovering from addiction for over30 years, you insult me! How dare you play musical WH chairs until you get a good job? You know nothing about addiction! Your boss is the bigges victim, ACOA, do you even know that killer? Dry drunk, look it up fool & quit!
Ah the 2 notorious accomplices of #moron45, cruella de vil thinks that the opioid crisis can be solved with a border wall how stupid is that? She has zero experience in this matter and yet acts like an expert.
Hicks stayed after this: "The reported pairing prompted Trump to tell Hicks on one occasion that she was 'the best piece of tail' Lewandowski will ever have". She (and you) defended. covered up, and (of course) lied for a man who beats women. http://people.com/politics/hope-hicks-dating-rob-porter-corey-lewandowski/ … #MeTooenabler

How do you sleep at night, truly?
You are a horrible person. Any real friend and colleague would tell Hicks to drop that pig like a red hot horseshoe.
Kellyanne Conway on #CNNSOTU saying that Hope Hicks is not in danger of being abused by Rob Porter because she is “strong” and “capable”.…

Heard what you said about strong women don’t get abused. Well I am afraid your way off base. My mother suffered at the hand of my father for a couple decades. She was one of the strongest women I ever knew. Sorry lady, Hicks, if she was your friend, you’d tell her to back away.

How can you live with yourself? Can you look at your kids in the eyes? You're betraying them, helping to destroy their futur country.
You’re irrelevant

Building a wall to prevent the opioid crisis it’s like shutting down #fatnixon twitter account,  and expect that he will stop being a racist, narcissist, or a liar.
You are going down just like your SHITHOLE boss

What is your salary for lying to the American People?




Orchestrated smear? How on earth did porter the wifebeater handle classified material without sec. Clearance? Dt had to allow it, understand? Your integrity called, said it was getting a fox job.
You actually watched
Noted online: It's time, again, to remind everyone that @KellyannePolls grandfather, Jimmy "The Brute" DiNatale, was a brutal enforcer for the Philly mob - who specialized in drug trafficking. Also, his cohort Sam Siligato should be out of jail by now. http://www.phillyvoice.com/paying-respects-when-mob-said-their-good-byes-kellyanne-conways-grandfather/ … …
Only one Church goes directly back to Apostles that Jesus Christ gave authority to in Matt 16:18-19. Their is a direct lineage like in Matt 1. The Bible was established by  the Church at 300 AD. The original Kings James was an English translation of the Latin Vulgate.  @NFoles_9
Study the early Church, Nick. The 1st Council of Nicaea in 325 AD & the origins of the Nicene Creed. The Roman Empire became the Holy Roman Empire. It was the Catholic. Have you heard of generational error? Others learn a different faith (not Christian) & conversion is difficult.
Our Lord left a sign which leads to the truth. His Mother. Read Rev 12 (NOT Israel, Matt 19:28).

Read my paper on the explanation of Rev 12 (pdf file on dropbox)...
https://www.dropbox.com/s/2zzfueqkn96ir5x/MaryLeadsToTruth.pdf?dl=0 …

The first great realization of Rev 12 was the apparitions at Guadalupe, Mexico in 1531.
Jesus proved that He was God by the miracles that He performed. A miracle is an alteration to something physical in this world which bypasses the physical laws. Listen to the story of Guadalupe and the explanation of the tilma's miraculous qualities.
Due process pertains in a court of law! Kevin Spacey, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby Donald Trump are all sexual deviants. That's a fact. We all know that. If they were to be taken into a courtroom then they would get due process.
If Hope Hicks had her head on straight she wouldn't be working and lying for Trump. Same is true of you, Sarah Sanders and Ivanka Trump. Not only have you all ruined your professional reputations but you  have directly enabled a sexual assaulting criminal treasonous monster.
You do realize that it is highly unlikely that the Eagles will not being going to the White House right?
On behalf of battered women everywhere: You're a vile yet perfect representative of the worst President in history.
Hey, there, KellyAnne.  Did we ever find out anything more about this?  So sad to hear that you and your hubs will be splitting, but you landed a "good one" to replace him with.
Conway said this morning that Gillibrand “protected and defended and harbored” Bill Clinton while he was impeached. 

Clinton was impeached in 1999. Gillibrand arrived in Congress in 2007.
watched on @jaketapper A woman having a job doesn't have anything to do with having sympathy for a woman who is proven to be getting beaten by a man.

Why isn't the press asking Kellyanne Conway about her grandfather.
Conway's grandfather is mob associate Jimmy “The Brute’ DiNatale. 
DiNatale is mentioned 26 times in the 1992 New Jersey Organized Crime Commission report. 

…
Better ride this job till the end bc your career is over after this debacle...

Love the lies and liars oh and dont forget all the enablers for the wife beaters
How do you look your kids in the eye? Or sleep at night? Or look yourself in the mirror?
Your truly blinded by money & power   you believe this man abused his wives but dont believe Donald  abused over 20 women
BIG DICK NICK!!!


Ms. Conway, as you hit the talk shows this weekend, please don't make excuses. Domestic violence is NOT a political issue. For once, acknowledge these women
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations …
Eagles can win all the Super Bowls but they will always be LOSERS because racist are never winners!  President Trump is the best President we've had in decades!
You should add a new makeup artist to your list. If shit could smile, it would look like you
Nick is a good man. You know who is not??  Someone who does this, and is defended by the chief of staff, granted access to the president when everyone knew what he had done. HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT??  Seriously??  My god, you have kids. How do you explain this.
What despicable KellyAnne and Sarah miss is-- NO DECENT PERSON WANTS YOUR FANSHIP.. take your lying asses elsewhere
Hi kellyanne Conway, just noticed that your birthday is January 20th, did you ever think about the president taking office on that day as you were growing up?
Kelly I thought you were boycotting football.
President new about voter hacks because he mention in one of his speech. Someone go back an review all his speeches, because he tells on himself all the time. Anytime someone ask for collusion from another country and it happen. What's the problem really!
WHY must you lie about EVERYTHING? Especially when it can be easily proven as a lie? Why did you go on @FoxNews and say the Eagles NEVER took a knee?? FFS. https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/csn/eagles/An_Eagles_player_takes_a_knee_during_the_national_anthem_on_Thursday_night.html?amp=y#click=https://t.co/ucQZDCL55N …
How do you endlessly covering-up, #complicit deplorables sleep at night?
Please look at the  $2000 cap for Social Security SSI that hasn't been updated with inflation for the past 20 years
Kellyanne doesn't mind men beating women as long as Donald Trump doesn't mind. Don't let your girls look up to Kellyanne.
Did you mark the one year anniversary of the BOWLING GREEN MASSACRE too?

Report: Kellyanne Conway is preventing drug policy experts from forming the drug policy agenda: http://slate.me/2E8Jria  
Satan’s not trophy wife
I so am delighted you are in this position. This shows young people esp. girls can get a high level job without doing dirty deeds. For us old girls who had so many sexual assaults while at work but kept getting on with belief in themseves we are proud of you Lady. Thankyou. : )
@KellyannePolls  I would be honored if you would pick me to take the place of any Eagles player that does not want to visit the WH.  I am a Veteran from Philadelphia and would love to visit and possibly meet our great President. Thank you
Cra cra crazy
Please invite me to the White House, Ms. Conway!
Dear Kellyanne, take it easy on the Opioids and the Alcohol, you  look like crap, they are killing you. I know you have to take care of Senile trump and his tantrums, but your health is also important. Take turns with mama H Sanders and papa Gen Kelly. It will all be over soon
I keep wondering ...what I’d your job?
https://media.giphy.com/media/xThtavRRXiw9pPg7S0/giphy.gif …
Enjoy the trip, Hag.
Hey Kelly are you the president counselor?  that’s disturbing!
I’d love to volunteer to take the place of any Eagles player that won’t visit the WH. Lifelong Eagles fan. 100% disabled vet.
There’s only one way to celebrate the #EaglesParade
I only hope he doesn’t go to the white house

Kellyanne Conway has frozen out drug policy professionals on her “opioid cabinet”—instead involving the West Wing’s political staff to organize solutions for the deadly drug crisis http://thebea.st/2BZvP2Q 
What is this all about? Its not just opiods that are being abused. I for onr dispies headings in newspapers with hidelines "war on oids". Tons of poppies arrive daily in NJ. 
Where is all that going and please don't say they go the coka cola plant. The leaves go but not the drug.
Lol bot.
Hey!! WTF are you doing to prevent the deaths of 175 people a day??
How’s the stock market today @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump . Seems kind of quite today at the White   House . Very odd !
http://blacknwhitebeauty.blogspot.com/2018/02/top-10-tricks-to-become-attractive-men.html …
Take a knees hoe.
And refused to accept an invitation to the White House. Gotta Love it.
Now that is a smart move. No one wants to be photographed with a loser like the donald
Has trump told everyone he's never met Tom Brady the coffee boy?
Wanna bet that if Foles was black, you and the rest of the racist hypocrites in the Trump administration wouldn't be fawning all over him with your faux piety.
Don’t ruin this moment for eagles .. adopt another team please
He and his team are refusing to go to the White House.  What say you?
Hi Kellyanne! Im a USAF veteran, if any Eagles skip the White House invitation, I would be very happy to take their place! #maga #veteran #usaf
F*ck your flag
Watched part it of football has lost me most of the year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6oD6umSMH8 …  if lying on TV should get you locked up, does that mean you are already lawyer'ing up?  Few people have lied on TV as much as you Conway
NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years

Tough to boycott the @NFL and watch the game at the same time isn’t it?
Eagle players marketed God and Religion.  Not product.
Can we stop winning now?
DOW Jones Industrial average is Down the Most it has ever been down in the History of the US Stock Market.  Down 1528 points

The Trump Economy is here!
Congratulations, Kellyanne, on a huge stock market drop!
Not like you ever did care but what do you think about the stock market now???? I don't like you but honey you will be thrown under the bus

Please help my father, Mark Radcliffe, an Air Force Major veteran. He's been framed, slandered and imprisoned ultimately because of his business that has been PROVEN to fight prescription drug diversion! Please get this cry for help to President Trump!
