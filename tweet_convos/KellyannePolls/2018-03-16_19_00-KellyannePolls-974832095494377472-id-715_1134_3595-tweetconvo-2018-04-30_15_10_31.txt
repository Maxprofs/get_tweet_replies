As usual, a good note from @katherinemiller. Full story: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/jeff-sessions-fires-the-former-no-2-at-the?utm_term=.dsYrLxAjQ#.kcvp3KyJL …
As an aside, McCabe very explicit in his statement about interactions with the press at FBI. ("It was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week.")
Trump weighs in:
Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!
Story updated here: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/jeff-sessions-fires-the-former-no-2-at-the?utm_term=.vn4541yzl#.ssvXkYBNl … / But, stepping back, what the hell does Trump's tweet even mean?
Trump explicitly linking his disdain for McCabe to his hatred of Comey in a tweet is the "Lester Holt 'this Russia thing' interview" of this firing.
Do that. Because he needs hard working fast in his cabinet. Good Presidents or good kings don’t want crooks around them. It’s very hard for majority of ppl to understand why President is doing that.He wants to get rid of corruptions, needs ppl working for him feel the same as he
Toward his country & ppl of his country. To me he is doing good. Presidents or Kings are responsible for making comfortable life & enjoyable living for the ppl of their country. Defend their country, protect ppl. That is exactly what President is doing? Don’t know why ppl should
Listen to Democrats? Last generation think Democratic are the same old one. (Excluded Bush). Most Republicans have done way better then Democrats. From the President to Senators. Of course not all Senators are Crooks. Not all Republicans Senator are good either. But there are few
Republicans. Not anything like Democratic. From Clinton’s till end of Obama’s Presidency Country was deserters. Now ppl please think go back can’t name one. But all military including bell helicopters other American agency know what I’m talking about. Of course all must be old or
retired. just wished to know why most ppl think about our lovely President negative & against hem. Looking at tweeter mostly are too young to understand what are they Tweeting. At the moment we have the best of the best President in the worlds. Doing everything for us ppl, his
& for the world. Just got home 3 Countries I went just realized what good President we have. There is Plenty of jobs. None was in Obama’s time. Obama, Clinton’s and the rest brought down the country down President is trying create jobs make ppl more comfortable & think of other
Countries too. In Europe’s no jobs low wages. Majority of ppl are in pool level. In Europe anywhere you go, for one small bottle of any kind of soft drink ppl have to pay $10 to $8 with out refills. Now at this moment groceries are cheaper than Obama’s time. Do you ppl want
President or senators including other head of the agency’s to deal & get rich. Of ourself When Crook President with Secretary of State deals for money can’t have it all they get involved their own party even head of CIA. That’s why Obama is too rich or Clinton’s how much
Chris no wonder you’re single? Frist you look ugly, second don’t look honest. President is very smart man. He smelled the rate that’s why Mr. Comey was fired.Went along with Obama’s, Clinton’s involved with their dirty deals benefitted too President needs honest loyal around him.
Not something to be proud of, Kellyanne.
PROSECUTE and lock up
He'll be joining him soon at the Employment Development Department.  There is not much call for red neck racists these days.  He may be out of work for a while.  Unless of course, he slithers back to his own kind in alabama.  Intentional with the lower case a.  If the shoe fits..
He has Million of Friends of Hillary monies in his bank...
No pensions for traitors.
Discovery for this lawsuit should be a doozy
DOG and PONY Friday Show
He gave him 2 days. If it was me.. I would have waited hours haha. Ok ok it's probably wrong. But who wouldn't want to do that to someone who is against you. Lol
Chris. Even in his own cabinet founds out member of ppl around him, lies, dishonest not capable for the jobs fires them. In fact what President does its a good technic. Searching for the best.Till find the best ppl around him. Unfortunately most ppl don’t understand why President
Sessions is a fraud, he is in way over his pay grade. Trump should have fired him when he recused himself! He is a JOKE
I think he got exactly what he deserved--- Karma. Thank you Mr. Sessions. Your awesome.
What took him so long! And why is his boss still there...to redact more papers, cover up more trails?
Good talk out all the trash...
Classless retweet Kellyanne. Thought you had a legal background. Ahhh never mind.
This is mean-spirited.  I cry foul.
PRES. TRUMP, you're so VERY FOOLISH to care more about DACA than your VOTING BASE, who you made clear, unkept promises to concerning how you'd handle DACA. Unless this changes YOU'VE LOST MY VOTE--& MY RESPECT! To support DACA & DACA recipients is NOT putting America 1st. #NoDACA
Shady as sh&t.
No he needs to fire Mueller!  Pronto!
... While he was investigating Sessions to boot. Nothing to see here move along....
interesting how @thedemocrats / @fbi leaked information on the Trump/Russia investigation over and over and not once mention "McCabe authorized criminal probe of Sessions." More proof that it is a political attack to ruin/distraction the Trump Administration.
Not something to be proud of.  Sessions has proven himself to be a spineless puppet.
Finally.

McCabe was fired out of Spite and Vengeance from Trump because he was a democrat.  What happened to Due Process? Where is the IG report so that America can read it.  #FakePresident #ImpeachTrump

Reporter: “So the candidate is the puppet?"   
Cambridge Analytica: “Always.”

EXCLUSIVE: Donald Trump's campaign consultants…
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS

I pray counter offensive has begun.

Drain the..

FBI
JUSTICE DEPT
STATE DEPT
DHS
NEA
CFR
MOCKINGBIRD MEDIA
TRILATERAL COMMISSION
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES

DRAIN IT ALL.

YOUR BASE IS BEHIND YOU 100% MR. PRESIDENT.
Spiteful and so petty. Just as the image of "our president".
.......a tweet from former UN Ambassador Samantha Power — whose full role in “unmasking” Americans who appeared in foreign intelligence wiretaps has yet to be exposed:
The president’s critics seem to like Brennan’s tweet. In fact, it confirmed what Trump has been saying all along: that the senior leadership of the intelligence and federal law enforcement services had become highly politicized.
That impression was only reinforced further by....
You forgot the Russians went on TV and said there was a plot to assist and make you President 5years ago. You just fell into the trap and you try to play it off. How many Russians involve with your compaign? OOOOOO I did't know they were Russians. REALLY
Decent of him
In other words..."President Trump just obstructed justice, again, and kept to his long tweeting promise to fire McCabe."  You must be so proud?
How about this: BREAKING: trump administration commits to funding its war on opioid addiction.

I hope all of the Trump con artists in the WH get the same treatment. What disgusting human beings.
CHUCKY STRIKES AGAIN!
Bye bye
Disgusting. @KellyannePolls
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html …  This fish just got a lot smellier.

How did this get lost in the news cycle? I expected it be a huge story.
Good job Sessions
More shame, more disgrace.
Jeff Sessions was the executioner.  Donny did not have the courage.  Advice, look out Jeffry.
About time.
Kellyanne when’s the anniversary of the Bowling Green Massacre ?? I wanna pay my respects. Thanks Perra
I hope that corrupt treasonous liberal don't get a dime and I hope he rots in prison with  that dirt bag comey and Mueller and Obama and Clinton's

Shady AF.
Just so you know Kelly Anne your NDA is Unconstitutional. ACLU statement: “Public employees can’t be gagged by private agreements. These so-called NDAs are unconstitutional and unenforceable.”
Great, maybe a few more should go

History will not be kind to you, @KellyannePolls.  You support a corrupt, lying, cheating, stealing boss.
@KellyannePolls  Who will be next to go:  Ivanka and Jared are probably safe, just because of the nepotism thing. Melania may not be, but she's more likely to do it herself.  Sessions is no longer weak...that leaves Sanders & Conway on my Bingo card.
Trumps on Tweeter lying about Mueller now!Someone should tell the old fool Comey, McCabe/Mueller are Republicans!Mueller is a G.W Bush Guy! that only 6 of his 13 Professionals gave Donation's an they did so to BOTH Republican/Dem"s! Other 7 has never politically given Donations.
Your all unbelievable this guy should have been fired a long time ago
I guess we now know why Trump was still in the West Wing after 5pm on a Friday.
I called this.
Thank goodness justice  prevails. Now let’s even the playing field and bring him before a judge along with all the others who were cooking schemes and breaking laws including the clintons and it’s foundation. Pay to play scheme
Funny how Rex Tillers on was fired right after he made the statement that russis should be sac tinned for committing state murder. Very interesting  on the timing.
Trump is moving towards getting  all his cronies is key positions. This gets trump people who have similar opinions of trump being not guilty of treason, money laundering, collusion with an enemy. Trumps must be impeached.
Sessions and Trump fire McCabe for lying to the FBI. Trump lies at least 3 times daily. He lied to the Canadian PM. When is DT contempt for america enough?
Maybe it’s the Jersey thing that trump keeps Kellyanne on. Two sleezes from Jersey  that took it to Washington.  There’s no other reason after all the lying and ethical breaches that Kellyann should still be there
@KellyannePolls #McCabe served his country for 21 yrs. Trump serves less than 2 & half of that was playing Golf "tax free"

Yes, and hopefully, he didn't lose the letter he had written to give them before , as he quit. I mean, this happened to me at a commercial job, but the letter security was not that high.

Pop Quiz: Who's the bigger whore: Stormy Daniels or Kellyanne Conway?  I'm voting for you, Kellyanne, since all Stormy did was take money for sex.  You sold your honor, patriotism, religion, ethics, and personal respect.  Let's hope you think it's worth it.
Would someone please inform our Pontus that re-training is better than firing?
So this is what is looks like when  You run the WH like the mob?
I hope you rot in hell
It's Witness Tampering! I'm pretty sure McCabe already did a Grand Jury Investigation/turned over his Memo's an testified to Trump Verbal pressuring/His attempts at Tainting his career an now Physically took step to Witness Tampering by Firing him!Grand Jury was waiting for this!
STFU Crooked Conway.

Experts say Trump should fire Kellyanne Conway over ethics violations http://read.bi/2FXwUMd  via @businessinsider
McCabe has Memos and Comey! Mueller make America Great Again put Trump@in jail!
So Robert Mercer has $15 million to hack his own country but can’t has yet to start paying back the $7 Billion in he owes in back taxes??? How are his assets not frozen???
Start at the Top!

String em up
Look not one of you has seen the IG report but you all know McCabe is  innocent it's clear no amount of evidence will change anything

Who Does Number 2 Work For!?!?!
Session:good dog, got a couple of ataboys.  But T-rump may fire him to for rescuses himself from the Comey B.S. that T-rump started.  T-rump is doing his damnest to get out of the shit he and Jr. started with the Russians.  If the investigation is like the IRS/audit, no end to it
And that’s a disgusting thing to have done.  Trump is a vile human being.
Maybe if McCabe did the right thing we wouldn't be talking about this. Hmmm. Instead he did wrong, got fired as recommended, and the left calls it politically charged, ignoring any OPR recommendation. Seems about parking for the left course. Mueller's nwxt, eh!?
A few out of the swamp. Lots of draining left. Nice job!!!
Oh baby. What till it's ur turn #SatansTrophyWife. Ain't no one gonna catch u or help u on ur way to #hell. In fact,  no one would piss on u if ur #blackheart (& lungs) were on fire. #reapthewhirlwind #kellywise #karma is comin 4 u and she has something "special" planned.
Why aren’t YOU fired, Kellyanne?treasonweasel?
Let's see now the FBI,DOJ,the Democrats and the media all colluded to cover up the tarmac meeting and Trump is the bad one???
Hey Kellyanne are you gonna payback the American people for all those private jet rides ?
Yeah boast and brag. You’re all soulless bastards and am so going to enjoy watching you all twist and turn on each other when the loop starts closing in @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachTrump #MuellerIsComing
That's too bad.
I love it.
Way to stand up kebler man...
fucking disgusting
the Dotard needs to fire you too.
This is wrong on many fronts; but I know how it feels when bastards fire you just before retirement without cause.
For get it Folks, varmints all ways takes care of another varmint. Hell I knew that as a child. We are watching Mr. Sessions.
What took so long

Incompetence, lies & deception will not go without impunity at these levels.
Yes! McCabe the Obsessed Trump hater who broke every moral and ethical rule we hold so dear to take down his target is exposed as an FBI RATFINK. GOOD RIDDANCE and may this be the beginnings of a thorough FBI house cleaning.RESTORE AND REVIVE THE FBI!
#corruptwhitehouse #corrupt45 #ObstructionOfJustice #FBIisComing
Justice Department inspector general investigation that found McCabe authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media about a Clinton-related case
Great day for our country, now focus on comey, hillary, lynch and obama. All it will take is arrest of the right person to get them to sing like a bird.
Should have been long ago. Now where are the charges. No one seems to have to pay for their corruption. What’s that about?
Mueller is working on that.  Just be patient.
Sessions is WHITE TRASH!
Like they just found out... used this as a diversion.. MULLER must be real close and Trump  bashing FBI again to be able to say they can’t be trusted. Everything trump does is contrived.. make no mistake he is vile
Welcome to the real world.  You break the rules, you get fired.
Jeff Session did this to save his job l  Trump has sunk to a new low .Russia, Stromy and now this . I will never vote Republican again !!
How disgraceful is Trump & his chaotic Administration especially an Administration that has a revolving door never before has an administration fired & people resigning then this Despicable Administration Dump all GOP especially Queen of Fake News
Sad day for our country
He should have been fired months ago!
