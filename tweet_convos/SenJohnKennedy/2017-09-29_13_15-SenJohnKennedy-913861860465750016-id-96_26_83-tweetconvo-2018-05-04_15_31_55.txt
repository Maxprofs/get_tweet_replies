American dream is actually not going #bankrupt paying outrageous medical &RX bills if we get sick or in bad accident. We could lose our jobs
Let's say that the supreme leader ever tells the truth and the economy is wonderful and boundless! Why would you want to fuck that up by adding more taxes on the middle class to burden them.I hope you are coming up for election soon because I will give everything to your opponent
It's an American nightmare. And, we deserves an open, fair, and competitive internet. Save net neutrality. @gop = the party that hates us.
So we can pay 100's of millions for DACA and subsequently $120 Billion for "family reunification"?

No DACA!
eh?
SHUT UP.  #PuertoRicoReliefNOW
Trickle down doesn’t work! This is a tax break for the rich.#november2018

GOP is making America gag AGAIN!
That something is congress. All this talk of the middle class does not define "middle class." It could mean just a pay raise for the illegals.  Probably does.
It doesn't take an expert to see that you are lying abt the tax plan that really provides tax cuts to the Rich!
In the past people didn't always know the details of bills. We do now. Stop lying. This is a HUGE tax cut for rich people like congressmen!
LIES! The tax reform bill gives HUGE tax cuts to the wealthy & corporations & a tiny tax cut to middle class. Tell the truth. YOU benefit

That's not liberating the middle class. Are you kidding? You are SCAMMING them to give the rich tax cuts
As of midnight, 9million children at risk for health issues because of your one health issue.....no backbone!
How about investing some money in #PuertoRicoRelief ?
First, you need to define the American dream.  Health? Education? Meaningful employment? Cheating others? Lying? Stealing? Power? Or what?
This tax reform appears on the surface to help middle class. Removing deductions for state and local taxes doesn't help anyone.
My taxes would go up significantly and your sabotage of ACA will be the nail in the coffin. Needless to say I quit the GOP. You crooks!
That something stalling the economy is Obamacare. Greatest tax break of all would be repealing it.
Let's pay Americans more than the $7.25 an hour @GOP has been fighting against raising for 8 years why you rake in the $174,000 we pay you!

#ZeroTax30K
It's not a tax code for the middle class, you're RAISING our taxes you lying sacks of crap while you give your donors massive tax cuts!
We the People have watched Congress & gov. workers outpace the People with income, benefits, parties, top-of-the-line clothing. Taxcut joke!
So far under @POTUS you have NOT shown your trustworthy side. Under the Usurper Obama nothing could stop you not even the Democrats! Time! 
When the elite get all the breaks by cutting Medicaid etc, you'll have written ur own political futures
HELLO, CHIP??????
Middle class? there is no middle class GOP destroyed it. There's only the Haves and have- nots. Your destroying USA #start2stop #Resign
Sadly that is the plan, now is it?
Shame on you.
Numbers don't lie this smells
Will you insist corporations use tax breaks to raise wages and hire people? Will you get a guarantee ?
Why did we have so much growth between 1950's-1970's when corp rate was higher.?
Or, they loan the $ they should have paid in taxes to the government to pay for stuff.
Just wondering which of you dim witted senate Repubs undermine this one.  
Lowering corp rates only helps corporations. They use that $ to buy their own stock back.

A tax code to shift the burden to the middle class - let's invest in the wealthy.
Hahaha!  Total @GOP LIES!
Drop the "class" from your narrative. This is USA, #WeThePeople, not this or that class, one nation. #UnitedWeStand
Trump's applies his business plan to USA  "Borrow, Transfer$, Default". $20T Debt + $7T deficit + $6T tax cut = $33T US DEBT.. bankrupt USA
Segmenting citizens by classes isn’t ok in a constitutional republic. Let’s shrink government and create a flat tax code that is fair to all
Very boring & repetitive 
Some action please!!
And the last eight years of those eleven were led by Obama.  This should open democrats eyes to the obvious.
That's why the plan give 80% of the benefit to the top 1%
#STOPTHECON
#YONOGO
What tier of middle class r u referring to? Appears taxes go up for 73,500 and below simultaneously taking away deductions.
This is nice, but there are so many giveaways to the wealthy and large corporations in tax reform that this is disingenuous...
Please sunset the IRS in an ample number of given years, & replace it w/ National Sales Tax. #Pragmatism
#TaxReform #TaxPlan #TaxCuts @realDonaldTrump #Trump #MAGA #AltRight #GaryCohn @stevenmnuchin1 @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @USTreasury @GOP @Cabinet @WhiteHouse @POTUS 

GOP tax plan favors the richest, tax analysis shows
Nothing ever trickles down. You're totally for the wealthy.  Let them invest.
Shame it is what you guys are pushing on us
This still needs to be a tax reform to stimulate growth.
Market it however you want, you’re stealing from the poor to give to the rich.
LOL. The wealthy will have a Rose Garden celebration with box-of-rocks @POTUS if this piece of crap GOP "tax plan" passes.
Sen Kennedy, are you going to vote for this trickle down Reaganomics proposal making rich & corporations richer? Let people know!

Top Reagan adviser: "The entire Republican theory of tax cuts & #taxreform is just complete & total hogwash as far as growth is concerned." 
#TrumpTaxScam
 “Trump isn't telling the truth about his tax plan. So I am.”
Even Reagan's boys call you liars. The numbers also call you out. https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/913849250953523201 …
