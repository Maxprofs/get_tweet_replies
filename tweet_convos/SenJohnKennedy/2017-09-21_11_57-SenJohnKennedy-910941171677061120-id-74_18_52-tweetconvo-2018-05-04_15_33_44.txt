But the tax cuts are for the rich
You really really need a new do..from head to toe.  Sloppy dress, speech, thought.
You led Louisiana to being the third poorest state in the nation.
Please explain how he did that?
Google "what does a treasurer do"
He does not pass a budget, does not allocate funds.  So, once again I ask, what did he specifically do?
Then why have CEO salaries SKYROCKETED in last 10 yrs? Why haven't raised minimum wage?? YOUR TERRIBLE!!

Honorable Sen. Kennedy, AARP, AMA, AAP, BCBSA, and more AGAINST! We need bipartisan solutions. https://www.ama-assn.org/ama-urges-senate-oppose-graham-cassidy-legislation â€¦
Isn't #bullfeces grand @SenJohnKennedy
Why must you try to take good care away from millions. Justify all you want. Makes you feel better?
Vote against the repeal of ACA or lose your seat in the Senate.This is nothing but a vendetta against President Obama, a true & legal POTUS
Cutting middle class taxes and raising Rich taxes is a good idea.  Doubt your party is behind that though
How much should the rich pay? 80%, 70%?
Yes
Seniors will be hurt by the Graham-Cassidy Bill. Please do NOT support it!
Why no tweets about healthcare?U said CBO cant score plan b/c no idea what state will do,how do u know u aren't hurting middle-class?
But you have no idea what the states will do and you're removing federal protection so how do you know that will happen?
you don't live in reality.
Because this keeps failing you want to do it again and again

Jimmy Kimmel owned your traitorous inbred ass! You want to rip healthcare from millions of AMERICANS! #GoToHell
I thought it was getting oil and gas pumping again.  Can't decide?  Decide NO on on repeal of ACA
I am surprised at the way you are thinking on this!!
What happens when a state runs out of money? Why no CBO score?
Watching your ignorance towards this health care bill is scary.  You can't defend anything with FACTs this is Pathetic.
Do not replace ACA.  Don't RUSH this abomination. We r looking at you. Do the right thing.
...And taking health care away from 30M people. Brilliant.

#HealthCareForAll #HealthCare #ObamaCare #TrumpCare
You are taking our healthcare so you can give the rich tax cuts.
Why do Republicans hate the American People?
Inbred!
Omg found a young pic of you.. is that ur mom and dad?
KENNEDY HAS SINGLE PAYER/MEDICARE INS. CVRS EVERYTHING,
PAST, PRESENT, & FUTURE HLTH ISSUES W/LITTLE OR NO COST TO HIM. WHAT DO U HAVE???
Senator, Chris schooled you! I believe the CBO, the AMA and Jimmy, thanks! And you are certainly not a health expert!

I can't believe what is coming out of your mouth. Nothing but greed.
You're spinning like a top on New Day. Are you dizzy?   You're a dotard.   
Another puppet of trump.  Leave our healthcare alone. Fix the ACA.  If you vote to repeal it, you are not qualified to represent the people.
Loving to see that both my US Senators have a plan for their future in comedy.... #yougonnaneedajob
I don't trust anyone who blinks that much.
So what do you think that fast food worker will do with a whole $3 a week
so how much are you going to raise upper class taxes or does the deficit not matter under right wing gov't? #nola #stillnotownhall #wgno
If someone wrote you as a character for a movie, no one would believe it because you're too much of a racist caricature.
Are you voting for the genocidal Graham Cassidy bill? Yes or no?
This senator is pissing on our leg and saying it's raining. He is exposing himself like his colleague Cassidy. 
Trickle down as usual from the Republicans.   IT DOESN'T WORK!!!
To get LA moving we need to invest in education & attracting companies that won't destroy the environment not give tax breaks to rich donors
BS
Propose middle class tax cuts & I'll stand with you.  But try to throw us peanuts while slipping caviar to the 1% and I will be relentless.
Then why does #Trumptax give tax breaks to the unbelievabley wealthy?
Must lower corporate taxes.
Lower Corporate taxes
I live zip 70433,  I don't consider people earning top 10% to be middle class, how do you?
NOT A GOOD TIME FOR TAX CUTS, MAYBE NEXT YEAR
So you want to give states the right to run their own health care, but you wouldn't allow them to run their own single-payer plan? 
32 million offof healthcare u will b voted out of office especially when this new bill fails terribly.
What u said shows u people don't know what the hell to do. One thing for dure is by kicking
Well guess what, ur so scared that it's going to work so well that everyone will want it. Hands off assclown let the states alone.
U say let the states do what they may and now u want to tell them they can't go to single payer healthcare.
More of their money, not my money. Tax refund should not be more than they paid in.  Happens too often.
 you're joking right?
by people u mean corporations
by middle class u mean 1/10 of 1%
Tell the truth about helping middle class, which your plan does not do. You choose rather to help rich donors like Koch Bros. Shame on you.
Tax cuts are great. But please explain how they will help pay off our $20TRILLION deficit? It seems like you're just being irresponsible.
