PATHETIC COWARDS! @NRA has you bought and paid for since you accept their huge donations! @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump!
Arogance igorance  and thick describes  you. When it happens to your family you then might regret your thinking and regret being bribed
2bad U have same name as a good man. Facts show U sell out Cheap 2NRA. They pay ur Co workers way more. But U say more NRA support? Failure
You're an idol and a coward. How about you do something about it instead. #GunControl #actionnotprayers
Letâ€™s turn those thoughts & prayers into gun reform action. We can make this situation better. Value the American people over the @NRA
Got the cojones to stand up to the nra?  I didnâ€™t think so. Coward.
Nobody needs your worthless prayers, save them for your soul.
Good thing we didn't waste our time legislating drinking & driving - that didn't do a thing nor did creating seatbelt laws.
Stricter GUN CONTROL needed to help SAVE lives! BRING IT to the table! @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP NOW! We INSIST!
Uâ€™ve been taking dirtyfrom the NRA long enough, Senator. Innocent victims have their blood on ur hands. Weâ€™re coming for reform!
How much money did you accept from the NRA again to vote on their behalf? How much was that bribe? We have a record of it bubba!
Received $5000 from the NRA in the last election cycle.
Here are the 20, 6 year olds and the 5 adults who died trying to protect them in New Town, WHY is the right of gun owners more important than these lives?? Tell these 6 years olds, how all that NRA $$ was worth their lives! You ARE Godless!
TIME! Gun Controls SHOULD come to the table NOW! @GOP @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan! How many more will have to die BEFORE you stop being COWARDS
Your thoughts and prayers are useless and a cynical attempt to clear your conscience for being bought by the NRA.
Stop taking NRA Lobby money- save lives- no automatic weapons or silencers
As a senator you could actually try to do something to stop future such tragedies. But this is easier and you still get NRA money.
Thoughts and prayers. Such bs.
Saw u on news trotting out NRA's tired lie that ANY gun control leads to losing 2nd Amendment. You're wrong, sir and people r getting killed
Did you just say we DONT punish all Muslims bc of a few? So you DIDNT chide Yates for defying a BAN...on Muslims?? #GOPThoughtsAndGarbage
Thoughts and Prayers don't cut it. Stop the killing with meaningful gun control! Or does the NRA have you in its hands!
That's nice of you. Too bad it's w/blood on your hands off the money you took from the NRA to buy protection for it rather than LV victims.
money bloody money
ACCEPTING huge donations from @NRA is "BRIBERY" @gop @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP! You'll have blood on your hands! GUN CONTROL
Your "thoughts and prayers" are bullshit. This was indeed a horrific tragedy. Yet you accepted $4,950 from the NRA in 2016. There is blood on YOUR hands.
I can't buy lawn darts, but you say better gun safety cant be legistlated? #FUCKYOURPRAYERS
You are a #coward & a sellout to @nra #hypocrisy
Very nice, but $10K in NRA donations has bought your loyalty, so your words are meaningless. And change your name...please.
Which did the NRA spend its $9,900 on, your thoughts or your prayers?
Your NRA $$ fueled thoughts and payers mean nothing. #emptythoughtsfullpockets
How much blood money did you take from the @NRA? Your thoughts and prayers are useless and empty. #GunControlNow
what good are thoughts from the mind of someone who is so intellectually deficient? You have nothing to offer.
I'm sure that $4,950 gift the NRA gave you hasn't influenced your votes on gun control at all.
We are all impacted! I'm praying it's time for gun control, what would Jesus want?
We don't care about your empty thoughts & prayers. What we want is not get shot in the head at a concert, in a theater or attending school
Empty words. You couldn't care less about those ppl. If you did you would enact stricter gun laws. Don't think you're fooling anyone. Sick
You,Trump and other NRA money grabbing sinners signed a Bill in Feb to make gun ownership easier for mentally impaired ppl. Now silencers??
wel instead of thinking and praying it is time for you to do something about gun control, it works in Australia, The Netherland, Switzerland
the "horrific tragedy" is that you have taken money from the NRA. Stop! Take action now!
Louisiana Senator John Kennedy received $4,950 from the #NRA during the 2016 election cycle
you're an #islamophobe.
We need more. Repeal Dickey Amend & Resend Trump' s signing on repeal of database for individ w/mental disorders wanting a gun. SilencersðŸ–“
To note on your comment today, we don't blame all Muslims for a school bombing. But we do outlaw bombs. Sensible reform needs to happen.
Donate your NRA blood money to the victims to help them pay for their hospital costs. #stopNRA #LasVegasShooting #CommonSenseGunLaws
As you do all you can to ensure that thousands of Americans die because of your refusal to help fix the ACA? You, sir, are a liar of the nth degree and have contributed to what amounts to mass murder. May you have a heart attack and no one is there to help you!
Your thoughts and prayers don't mean anything! You took money from the NRA, you hypocrite!
Why give thoughts and prayers now, you enabled this !!
may you please also send the NRA their money back. or better yet donate it to save lives. thank you.

You're thoughts are that the NRA better give you more money next year.
Really?  Because you took $4950 from the NRA to make sure people like that can buy crazy amounts of weapons.
and yet you accepted campaign contributions from NRA  u r a hypocrite
Prayers are more powerful than policy. Never forget who elects and owns you @NRA.
Enjoy your $5k of #BloodMoney from the NRA! #LasVegasShooting #GunControlNow
$4,950
Republicans have become nothing but a disgrace to America
Tragedy? How about mass terror on 22,000 concert goers, killing 59 & injuring over 500 ppl!!
Do all you GOP NRA toadies have the same typist, or do you copy & paste?#derelictionofduty#bought&paidfor#sleeplessnights?
How about the people yet to be killed by the next killing YOU allow with YOUR vote. I've got $4,950 from the @NRA to prove it. #Shame
Senator John Kennedy received $4,950 from the NRA
Fraud. You received NRA funds last election cycle.
I'm sick of thoughts & prayers from congress. Lets get to wrk on meaningful gun legislation. We'll take care of the thoughts & prayers part.
but your bank account is hefty by your support of the white terrorist and the NRA... so you say this not meaning it
What is preventing you from making full auto conversion kit illegal?
Thoughts & prayers are absolutely appropriate as immediate reaction to this. But follow them up with action - work on true gun control!
Save your prayers. You take money from the NRA. Take a stand. Gun control now!!
Talk is cheap. You took $4,950 from the NRA in 2016; try turning that money down next time.

$4,950 From #NRA in 2016 elec
#NRAorUSA #PrayForVegas Please do more
Sincerely,
Louisiana Voter
please give the NRA back their $5,000 and use your position to finally do something about gun control in this country.
What did you think your impact on the safety and well being of the American people would be when you accepted $4,950 from the NRA?
Please pass gun regulation and laws to keep citizens safe.
Let me fix this tweet for u: I will help pass #GunControl to save lives because one dead American due to gun violence is too many. #LasVegas
So does this mean u will vote against the gun silencer bill & also push 4 strict laws as to who can own automatic weapons? Cuz u took NRA $?
If you had thought before taking NRA money, maybe you could have saved your prayers. #bloodmoney #GunControlNow
BLOOD IS ON UR HANDS.
You take money from the NRA. You are as guilty as Paddock and a stain upon our state.
POLICY helps. Tweeting "thoughts & prayers" and accepting $4,950 from NRA does not. Enough is enough! NOW is the time to talk about change.
Know what's horrific? You got $4950 from the NRA last year!
You accepted $4,950 from the NRA in 2016. Your "thoughts and prayers" are meaningless and hypocritical. What are you going to DO?
Gun control now.  DO SOMETHING.
You took money from NRA to get your senate seat and you are obliged to do their bidding.  And you think you can be elected again?  No way!
Stick your thoughts and prayers where the sun don't shine. Stop taking money from the NRA. #LasVegasMassacre
Mine, too. What will you do to prevent such horrific tragedies in the future?
My prayers are with them too it would be helpful if you did not take $4,950 from the NRA as you did in 2016 #guncontrol
#itsthecultureofdeathnotguns
#50milliondead #respectlifeamerica
So was the $4,950 you got from the NRA last election cycle worth it?
Youâ€™re not worthy of that name you Judas. Go and mourn over your 30 pieces of silver.
Your votes are impacted by NRA blood money you accepted. Thoughts and prayers? How about gun control legislation? Waiting for your reply.
If you cared, you'd pass #guncontrol
Maybe you should take the $4,950 you got from the NRA and clean your #BloodStainedHands by paying for someone's medical bills. #GFY
Really? Like you didn't know something like this would happen as you took money from the NRA for your campaign. #LasVegasStrong
Save your lousy and hollow prayers. The majority of Americans want  sensible gun laws but  you sold us out for a $5,000 donation from the  @NRA. That's less than  $100 per human life lost in Vegas.
Save your prayers. Stop taking blood money from the @NRA start fighting for stricter gun laws! Iâ€™m an LA citizen, Iâ€™m ashamed of you.
According to WaPo, you've received $10,000 from the NRA. Your thoughts and prayers are easily bought.
Why not take a break from praying, give back $ you accepted from the #NRA, and join sane #Amercans in the fight for #CommonSenseGunControl
The grieving will never stop unless you reject the #NRA and work for #CommonSenseGunControl. #LasVegasShooting #StopTheNRA
Blood is on your hands for taking money and supporting terrorist @NRA
This "horrific tragedy" is partially YOUR fault; you took $4,950 from the NRA and let them control your votes. You should be ashamed.
Please use this to ban assault rifles from civilian sale - I know you  the NRA but civilians donâ€™t EVER need assault rifles!!
You should pray God has mercy on your soul after promoting the NRA's agenda that lead to these deaths. #GunControlNow
*led
Scores are dead because your NRA buddies pay YOU to allow lunatics to have guns! Pray for your OWN redemption. #GunControlNow
As a Louisiana voter, I would much rather you put your thoughts and prayers into legislating meaningful and sensible firearm restrictions.
#sendthebloodmoneyback. Not just thoughts & prayers. Stop taking $ from the NRA and stop assault rifles.
...even when you offer many prayers I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood! (Isaiah 1:15)
what are YOU going to do to stop the gun epidemic killing innocent people? Letâ€™s treat gun violence like opiates.
Yet you won't refuse @NRA money, will ya? You took $4950 from @NRA in 2016 alone - Shame On You! #Bloodonyourhands
