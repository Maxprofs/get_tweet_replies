.@SenatorRisch Sadly I can't unvote for you, since I never voted for you in the first place. You are on the wrong side of history.
.@jabney8 @SenatorRisch That is exactly what all the uninsured folks in emergency rooms are doing to you. You happy about that?
@jabney8 Purpose of the ACA is that everyone buy insurance. 1st yr penalty for not doing so $95, 2nd yr is $325 - that will b their premium
Having conversations with ppl like @jabney8 is like discussing finances with a 5 yro. Pathetic. I don't know why I even try. Blocked.
@SenatorRisch @JoshMBlackman You go bro.Sweet standing on the wrong side of Justice and History at same time.
@jabney8 @SenatorRisch @JoshMBlackman No one is stealing anything from you.The election said it all and your side lost.DEAL!
@SenatorRisch And because of that, I will never vote for YOU!
@SenatorRisch Thank you, sir
@SenatorRisch @FlorMGOP  Thank you, Senator!!
@SenatorRisch I'd like to suggest u guys get #Obama much needed MENTALHEALTHSERVICES #ObamaMeltdown #POTUS needs Haldol Shot #Time4Solutions
@SenatorRisch Please stop voting to defund. As one of your constituents, let me tell you that we WANT affordable healthcare.
@SenatorRisch Thank you for your votes on both cloture and Reid's amendment.
@SenatorRisch When oh when will you start representing the people?  You are ruining the 2 party system.
@SenatorRisch @redrivergrl Thank you. We need to continue to #makedclisten We the people want Obama defunded.

@SenatorRisch The real abomination is that thousands of Idahoans will fall in the gap left by a state that refuses to expand Medicaid.
@SenatorRisch How is providing a way for uninsured Americans to have access to health care an abomination? Do you have a plan?
@SenatorRisch OPPOSE CLOTURE MEANS YOU DON'T WANT TO VOTE ON THE HOUSE BILL THAT YOU ACTUALLY LIKE.  #CRAZY #RINO
