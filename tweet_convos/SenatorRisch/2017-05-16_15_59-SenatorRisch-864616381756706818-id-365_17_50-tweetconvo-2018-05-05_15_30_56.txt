You are a great American. The media and democrats are using fake news to commit treason against America.
Fake news is what Trump says so you won't listen to anyone but him and the media he's molded. You are a victim of brainwash.
You are 100% sure that democrats and media are not still rigging your information?
Oh, & btw, I didn't vote for Hillary or trump. Just bc you hate one does not make the other ones actions perfectly ok!
The fact that you couldn't decide between the only 2 candidates who could win the presidency and vote for one makes my case PERFECTLY.
The fact is is that we weren't given a decent option for president. That only proves this governments failure.
So your incapable of deciding,  and I'm ignorant...you decided that good girl  your growing up
I guess I don't understand what you are accusing me of. Coherency not your thing?
We won't forget this
Thank you
Who are the losers? American people. Hold their feet to fire on this issue - all Republican leaders.
Party before country.
Please support our President and tell the people how the left media is denigrating our President who accomplished more than other presidents
Reminds me of the "snitch logic" the crime is not as bad as the one who reported it? Insane thinking!
Thank you for standing up against the Swamp Media! This is brave considering how the Swamp attacks anyone pro Trump! God Bless You! Patriot
There's a slimy weasel Dick here, senator, and it's YOU! Complete with an STD.
While the democrats are laughing and goading more disruptions. They think by putting Pence, they will take over next 4 years. Pipe dreams.
Of course you are a member of the GOP, A TRUMP STUMP SO YOU WOULD BE IN THE FAKE NEWS CHANNEL, SMH PRAYING FOR OUR ONCE GREAT AMERICA
Idahoans find your suggesting the leaks preempt the impeachable offenses of the WH abominable We'll remember next election #craven #fakeprez
Will you be discussing the impeachment of treasonous tRump?
Thank you sir, for your sanity !!!!!
You have got to be shitting me...
She's not.  There are 63 million complete morons in America, as show by the number of people who voted for Trump. She really is that stupid.
Ur mom is on the payroll of all the truckers across the state. $3/a trick charges extra to remove her teeth
She doesn't have *any* teeth, false or otherwise.  Yes, yes, she IS a Trump supporter, obviously.
Sorry yet about all these appearances?  Time to look at the facts.
Senator Risch, whistleblowers are not traitors. When will you take the concerns of your constituents seriously? Stand up for what's right.
At some point will you realize that you are kissing the behind of a criminal president and start caring for REAL Americans?
Hey... Shit for brains!
defending Trump is not going to work out for you
Please tell them how the leftist propaganda of impeachment brought down our stock market today. How American people are losing....
You're a tool
Stay on Fox, their viewers are the only ones who will believe you.
Risch is just a mouth for Trump a small minded self-centered mouth. What constitutes he has none a lot like his morals. D-bag all the way!
Traitors? If not for leaks Flynn would still be there. You have it all wrong
Your comments are despicable

Was it "some traitor" in Israel who said "This Confirms Our Worst Fears"?

#TrumpLeaks
Traitor is Trump - who leaked to RUSSIA

And betrayed our ally.
WE WONT 4GET #ANNNNY OF THEM!!!!"BYE BYE"....
Fox? Really. Nothing more than an angry child's blog.
The only weasel around here is you and the GOP!  So it's alright to spill secrets to Russia?...Reagan would be rolling in his grave.Traitor!
You, sir, will go down with the ship!
Apparently, you have gained some new fans.  And all of them are #Deplorable. Congrats on sliding down a few notches on "honorable" score.
Discussing how you think a traitor started trump's mess? Not discussing trump's treason or impending impeachment? No surprise there.
from responsibility, prosecution and/or impeachment for his actions.  You are as corrupt and complicit for looking the other way.
According to your logic, Nixon wasn't at fault for Watergate. Hmmm ... shame on your partisan politics. Looking forward to voting against ..
We will vote you out if you keep supporting the lunatic in the Oval Office
You are blaming others for Trumps incompetence.  Pathetic
Dear Senator Risch - really, you think things are getting better with this administration... sounds like a severe case of denial. #whennotif
Aaahhh, Fox News and the GOP. The media that trump has molded to his desires. Pay no attention to the treason behind the curtain.
You are an embarrassment to the American people I'm praying you are on the ballot for November 2018
Was great to see you willing to speak the truth.The national security risks ARE terrorism & leaks of classified data
@Potus was right to try to get agreement to help against terrorism. Leaker and press wrong to tell the world about intel and source = FELONY
of course you'll be on FoxNews. You don't have the nerve to go anywhere else and spew your crap about the "leakers" typical @gop #idiocy
Time to heed your own admonishment "Oh come on, get that look off your face ...... he's not that bad"
Speaking as a life long Republican, please put country over party loyalties and do the right thing. Stop this obstruction of  justice by DT
You just wrote your resignation letter... see us in the next election.....
I'm sure a lot of us will be happy to donate to your opponent in the next election. Standing with Trump is standing against morals & ethics
“Get that look off your face,” Mr. Risch said, grinning. “Be happy! Come on. He’s not so bad.” Really Mr. Risch?
.@SenatorRisch remember duty so that government of the people, by the people,  for the people, shall not perish from the earth. #USA
Do you honestly believe these words you speak?  Let Trump stand or fall on his own.  No need to tarnish our faith in you and/or the party
#countrybeforeparty #IndependentInvestigationNow
@marthamaccallum laughed at you when you said "I think it's getting better as time goes on." Your appearance was pathetic & on the record.
MEMCON is not a "scrap of paper". Stop being obtuse.
Party over Country and Freedom of the press.  Vote him out! Shame
We had a view into ISIS to safeguard our aviation & any troops we have in theater. Trump said fuck it to try to impress a pair of Sergeys.
Question: Are you also being blackmailed by Russia? If so, you should come out to someone. It'll only get worse for you
So... how'd it go? Lol
Resign, traitor.
Thank you Senator, refreshing to see a true professional who speaks the truth & is respectful to our Republic & our President.
Your career and your soul are never going to recover from the evil you're perpetrating right now.
Great talking points Sir!
@SenatorRisch The history books will read "Jim Risch.  A man who put Party Before Country.  Scared of the president".  Good luck Jim!
Great job today on the show Senator Risch. That's why I voted for @POTUS we needed a change at the White House tired of the same o same o

Your attempted defence of the indefensible will not be forgotten in the voting booth. You're a disgrace to your state, nation & constituents
Candidate @realDonaldTrump publicly encouraged illegal act and asked for hacks to base campaign. #deflectiondistraction
You are on a sinking ship with Trump. Even rats know when it's time to jump. Trump is a traitor and you're complicit. Leaker is a patriot.
Great:  can you explain your oath to defend the Constitution and reconcile it with your "weasel" remark?  Campaign ad coming...!
I hope your constituents toss you to the curb... your pathetic, & as the corrupt POTUS often says.. SICK!
You just made your legacy @SenatorRisch one that punishes whistleblowers over traitors. You are #partyovercountry #resign #fuckhead
Tool, fool, and toady. You should be ashamed. #lockstep #resign
We need a special prosecutor for Trump. #trumpforprison
News of the day?!? How about week? Or minute...with trump you gotta keep on your toes man!
Disgusting I head on PBS someone's paying you man. So out of touch
Please make sure this Stooge is not re-elected 
#NeverRisch 
what a waste of a senate seat. You do not represent Americans
Better start looking for a day Job #NeverRisch
History will remember you as a weak opportunist. This proves you are either incompetent or complicit or worse!!!

Compromising our allies intel with our enemy (Russia) is not something anyone should support. He just fired the guy investigating Russia.
You are a partisan hack who cares more about party than the USA. Shame!
Blaming Media and leakers is always a sign of trying to cover up! Time for an impeachment!
Impeach Trump!
Your PBS show was utter bs. You let slip one telling statement, that errors like this have happened before so Trump did indeed fuck up!
How do you sleep at night?
You will be judged harshly in history for putting party over country.  Disgraceful!
"He (potus) should be commended for that"that=givingclassified info that put Israeli spies lives @risk.Haha #movetorussia #partyovercountry?
Are you for real? Everyone's fault but Trump.  Do you believe , Trump a liar or Comey? I pick Comey!
#TheResistance #TrumpRussia #DoYourJob #Traitor
massive coward and weasel.....cringe-worthy to behold.
Two more, for good measure. Getting the message yet?
Another of YOUR relatives.
You're not as cute as this one. Same species, though.
You have the power to help protect our country. You choose to support a crook instead.
Hope there is room in prison to fit another traitorous politician.
Do you uphold the Constitution, truth, justice and law?  Republicans used to stand for these things but appears they stand for money now.
How long are going t defend that idiot..thank God someone leaked it..
What a sad man

Only you care. Your disappointment to Idahoans is growing more than tRUMP tweets
Idaho iswatching201820182018 Does FoxNews reportwhats reallygoing on or isit @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @PressSec Alternative Facts
News about the President allegedly pressuring Comey to stop investigation of Flynn?
House and Senate Republicans are colluding with Trump to conceal http://Treason.Vote  them out
So,we are to understand that you DON'T care when secret intel is shared with a "non-ally" but you are angry that the American people know.
Your loyalty is misplaced and will not be rewarded.
You are an embarrassment to our country. Complicit?  What does trump have on you? Party before country?  Shameful enabler. Lock him up.
History will remember you and your family as the traitors you are.  Shame shame shame
History won't be kind to you, nor will the voters. #Russia #PeePeePrez #partyovercountry
looks like we know you have putin and trump in same bed with you Jim who getting more action?
Will look forward to hearing details on your post political job.  With your low bar should be easy.
Sen. Risch '16 "We can do better than Donald Trump" turns out you were right.
just saw you on PBS, making more excuses for the traitorous behavior of Trump. We wouldn't have or need leaks if you did your job.
You're and embarrassment to this Great Nation.  Your party and protecting this criminal President is more important to you than our Nation!
Why? To hear how complicit you are in #RussiaGate? You too are a #Traitor to America.
Listened to you spew utter lies and falsehoods and you are obviously blind as to the President and your duty to the American people. #Shame
You have attached your wagon to the crazy train.....we will not forget... party before country shame on you.
You're a disgrace. Calling others traitors when the Traitor-in-Chief is the one you are defending. Enjoy this next year and half.
I thought prostitution was illegal in DC.
Of course you will be on Fox! Arse kisser! I hope your term is about up!
The traitors will be jobless soon, and traitorous surrogates, such as yourself, will fallow them down. Good riddance!
You're sooooo done. You don't defend this kind of behavior and keep your job, hineyhole. You're a true turd and a BAD man.
Jimbo, you are without both vertebrae and ethics.  If you have children, I hope that they see you for what you are - a little, little man...
Ugh
If DJT shot someone on Fifth Ave. you'd charge the victim with vandalism for the blood stains. #Hypocrite #ImpeachTrumpPence
Embarrassed you are the face of Idaho right now! We deserve Senator who puts country/state over party. Praying Idahoans make this last term
Hearing whining libs speak of party over country is the most hypocritical quote of the week, haha!
you want to blame journalists because trump gave Russians classified information-get a grip, your president is a screwup, #impeached
I like this guy but is it Jim or James as  Fox News has it?
if it was Hillary how would you react? #hypocrisy #partybeforecountry #disgustinglackofmorals
Wow. You are ridiculous. And? Complicit in treasonous activity.
Whistleblowers are protected by law. But you know that, you're a Senator.
What we are asking: WHY u r defending a clear & present danger to our republic? Russia's tentacles many and long... Answer Jim? #russiagate
We all know who the #weasel is in this scenario &it isn't the Press.  Technically legal does not equal right. Country before party! #resist
Idea! Admit that Trump revealing classified info to our enemies was not great! Another idea! Don't go on @FoxNews
Saw your statement. You're a joke. An absolute embarrassment.
You are a so called Senator.....You are Party over Country & the American People will not forget about this. #TheResistance #LOSER #SICK
that was horrible. you are an apologist for a traitor. shame on you
Great interview! Finally sanity/context@ intel sharing by all US @POTUS/@WhiteHouse & on shared interests in commercial flight safety→kudos!
Going on DJT State News, huh?
Of course on FOX/RT BUT YOU DONT HAVE THE GUTS TO FACE YOUR CONSTITUENTS....COWARD & CORRUPT JUST LIKE TRUMP
Is your inability to become embarrassed a congenital condition? #MAGA #Trumpski # #ComplicitInTreason #RussiaFirst #CountdownToBackpedaling
You going to discuss your Trump trying to obstruct Comeys investigation.  Naw.  Your the one who thinks the people telling the truth are bad
in the words of a not so greatly man, "sad".
This is some legacy you are cementing. Yikes.
You're out of your mind. Stand up to this chaos or do you have something to hide? I think your moral values are way off. Vote you out
@SenatorRisch @POTUS   Thanks for your standing up for Pres. Trump!  We will WIN over all this garbage being strewn across America!
Holy cow! Are you serious? You say the word treason & like a dog whistle or a feather on a string, your constituents think you're brilliant
Republicans have yet to show the backbone to stand up to Donald Trump.
So the weasel is the one reporting the bank robbery, not the bank robber? Got it GOP. What kind of mafia are we running in our govt?
You should be ashamed! Putting party before country! You, sir are what is wrong with this country!
You are a mean, little man -- please return to Idaho
Blame native Americans 4 being almost wiped out by invadors? Blame Poland for being invaded by Germany? Jesus' fault cause he carried cross?
you are a sad, sad person
Your moral compass is broken.
Unbelievable. A patriot puts country above party. I'm old enough to recall Nixon & Clinton partisan/apologists who ignored facts just like u
Who is the traitor?
Wait. So you think the traitor is the one who leaked to the press and not Trump. What the hell is wrong with you?
Your comments today sir are very distressing.  Why are you protecting a President who is obviously a loose cannon & unprepared for the job?
You're calling the wrong person a traitor? Sir, yr bias has blinded you to what is good for America. History will remember little men like u
So sorry to have missed it.Will have to watch local news to see if your integrity and loyalty to country have surfaced yet.
Please resign.
