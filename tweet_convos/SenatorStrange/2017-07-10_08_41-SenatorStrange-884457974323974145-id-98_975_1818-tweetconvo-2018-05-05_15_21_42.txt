We want our President Trump's agend done!  Thanks for speaking out!
#MyPresident
But all he has done is appoint Wall $T execs to his cabinet. They very ppl he complained about during the election.
Honestly, I'd prefer congress did a lot less interfering in our daily lives.
We living in the information media technological age Nothing stays the same How long does it take to tweet 140 characters #MSM bias #Potus


The swamp dwellers will teach him to be a slacker. All of Congress should be freshmen. #DrainTheSwamp  #MAGA  #TermLimits
I'll second that!
You have a keeper #Alabama #AL 
If he wants Congress to work hard chain them to the chairs. Beginning 2 think they suffer frm the me syndrome. We pay them lest they forget
Absolutely true, President Trump outdoes Congress when it comes to actual work. He does more than all of them put together, what a SHAME!
@SenatorStrange @BreitbartNews Work at what? Your golf swing?
And he's not wrong, GOP congress has done nothing to further the President's agenda,complained for 8yrs #emptywords #congresssucks

Then you need to be polishing up your golf clubs  if you wanna work as hard as @POTUS !
Oh my, you are funny  So Senate should all go golfing. Have fun at Mar a Lago. Bye bye 
Luther= finger in air which way is the wind blowing for votes he's corrupt, I know I live in Al.
Work as hard selling out the country or playing golf? Which one, @SenatorStrange?
Well, in order to do that, they would first have to WORK!
At least one senator has got it right.
Bill, it is going to be very hard for any official to come back with nothing constructive done.They have no excuse. Better do HCare right.
You mean be at the golf course one out of every three days?
Amen!
Most of them don't have the stamina to keep up with the President.
That's not saying much

Why do you retweet a racist blog?
This is why we sent @realDonaldTrump to DC!
Along with getting some legislation passed, we could really benefit from recess appointments. Let's hope they work through the break.
Well they are going to need to spend over a month on the golf courses than.
Which is to say . . . work hardly at all.
More golf! #MAGA
Some decent people in the Senate. Thank you Senator Strange.
As of week 13, Trump has spent 25 days away from the White House at another private residence, while past presidents spent far less.
Wow, what a concept....
For sure as from what we see you are not working as smart.
Wow, there's a thought...
They actually need to work harder just  to keep up with @POTUS the work even harder
Randar this thetroll  bitowch wreight
Thetthore
Yes. Yes you do
What he's really doing is challenging the rest of the republican senators to up their golf game!
Novel idea!
Trump is a straight up agent for Russia and was ready to turn the keys over to Putin.  Anyone that supports him now is a traitor.
Are seriously retweeting a Breitbart article?  Breitbart is a racist, sexist publication and the editor is in the White House.  Shame.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 
Amen to that!!!! @realDonaldTrump is nonstop!!! 
Amen!  Voters need to get their money's worth out of our elected officials!
Luther refused to endorse Trump and received his position by killing an investigation into the governor who then appointed him to the senate
There's something that's NEVER been said about Obama!
Okay, Luther, R U for Real with this, or is it just 2 get a full term on the Senate?
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP @POTUS @VP
DITTO

We are awake, Proud 2 say! We R watching the GOP! #MakeCongressGreatAgain #UnitedWeStand #MAGA #USA #Deplorables #UnitedWeStand #MAGA

Sadly, that might kill a few of them.   Where can we get a job that pays so much with so little work?
if these morons worked 1/4 as hard as @POTUS I would be impressed.The fact is that with all their assistants they cant come close.#maga

Ya think! Trump makes them look foolish
It's a foreign concept to most of these politicians 
You said it, congress.  Senate need to work as hard as trump!!
Never will happen, only care about&$$$$$$GREED!
Good luck with that right now but, wait until after 2018 They'll all get the message loud and clear.
Not only slow motion, but have homes worth millions, not one but more, nitwit waters has a 5 mill home! With no brains!dear GOD!!
Strange but true. Haha
A Senator who actually gets it?! > knock me over with a feather!
Uh, no. Luther refused to endorse Trump.
@POTUS tireless work ethic running circles around GOP ELITE...proving IQ's matter & GOP ELITE very low IQ's to squander #GOPtrifecta
How'd he get in there? 
Harder!! Senators are getting paid
They are making corrupt$$$
@SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP
uah, we've been saying YOU need to work harder for 40 yrs.
Then nitwit makes millions, lives in a 5 mill house!! Her daughter licks envelopes for her and makes 750,000.00 tax money
Big Luther Strange is crooked though

These guys aren't used to someone who isn't there to fuck around and make money.

Never happen!  They don't know what work is. 
wow,he is awake,i wish he would tweet!
Unlikely to happen with a bunch of worthless bums
Mixed feelings on this... diligent and incompetent are a bad combo.

No one in congress has the will to work that hard.  They dont know how.
Congressional GOP is a total shit show.
So not that hard and play tons of golf?
Golf is a great stress reliever. People use hobby and break time to mull over issues. It's better than making a decision under stresd
Woah thanks for your thoughtful comment - I personally think he plays too much but respect your take. Have a great day
>Obama plays golf alone & w/ friends constantly
>Libs fine w/ this
>Trump has golf meetings as part of persuasion strategy
>Libs throw a fit
I agree but they are not physically able to keep up with Trump
Wow, 5 mths in and some r finally getting with the program
Not sure I can play that much golf.
http://Yes.You.Do !!!! #MAGA
#InmateMike is #FakeBase. We love @mitchellvii!
Question: Do you really believe this stuff or are you in so deep at this point you can't turn back?
