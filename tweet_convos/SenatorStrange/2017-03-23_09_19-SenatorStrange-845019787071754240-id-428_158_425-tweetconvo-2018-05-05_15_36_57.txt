So you say. But Gorsuch supports Big Business over the People and has religious bias. Too far right
that is just plain old not true
YOU, McConnell are a racist, a corrupt collaborator with the junta working to take our Republic apart!
deal with it.
@SenatorStrange @GorsuchFacts please do whatever it take to #confirmgorsuch #SCOTUS is too important!
Breitbart and Evangelical pick.  Wrong!
You & your stupid, malevolent cronies blocked @BarackObama most qualified nominee because our Pres. was black.
No, as per Sen Biden and Sen Obama a Pres shouldn't be able to appt a Scotus in their last term!
No, liberals don't agree, you unprincipled liar
UNLESS YOUR AMERICAN CITIZEN AND WANT RIGHTS AGAINST BIG BUSINESS
#NOT TRUE, Mitch!  It's still Garland's turn!  Remember, u refused to give Garland his turn!  Shame on u!#KYGirl
@stacmof3 @GorsuchFacts gotta love it.
#NoOnGorsuch
what drugs are you on and don't you care that your place in history will be marred by your lies?
My place in history is starting FIRES & burning this MF down ....oh and I have a strict diet of 
you are delusional. This man is not fit to serve.
Wrong! Confirm Chief Judge Garland to #SCOTUS #StolenSeat
@letmebePaco @GorsuchFacts Oh how short the liberals memories are!
not even a moderate Republican who believes in a president is elected for 4 years agrees with your 
NO!
All 8 sitting SCOTUS came out against Trumps nominee Neil Gorsuch! #MerrickGarland
No, we do not agree.
.@SenateMajLdr .@hughhewitt .@GorsuchFacts Agree, but don't believe that GOP can outsmart Dems.
NO WAY NO TO Gorsuch
No we don't. What would it cost you to be honest?
What have you been smoking, Turtle Man?
2018! Women won't forget your hate!
Your lying, liberals don't agree!
What "liberals", Mitch? Name names.
You had no principled reason for denying Garland his chance. Obstructionism is a two-way street. Hypocrite.
Why is Steve Bannon even allowed to be within 100 miles of the White House?
@SenatorStrange @GorsuchFacts Oh no they don't.
no, we dont agree. He is awful just like you.
reason to vote NO is #Trumprussia #goprussia MUST be fully investigated by independent. Period.
You should have held mtgs for President Obama's nominee.
@PatriotDoright @SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts #Gorsuchno  #NoToGorsuch #Kremlingate #Trmprussia
Then why is Schumer going to Filibuster?
Hey Mr. Bourbon.....what was better half tweeting......
they should reject him since he was nominated by the reckless @realDonaldTrump.  The people need a voice - no vote until 2018.
He is a wonderful pick for our country to uphold the constitution as it was written!!!!! Happy!!!!!
Uh, not we don't, there you go again. Who are you working for today? Russians, Ukrainian Businessmen, Koch's?
You stole the seat that should be held by Merrick Garland, you obstructionist hack.
stolen seat. NO AGE TAX IN HEALTHCARE BILL MITCH
.@SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts He's a stolen Justice seat, you hypocrite.
his ideas on IDEA Act r unacceptable
John Roberts and the court sent their regards unanimously told Neil, WRONG. Gorsuch interprets precedent WRONG.
but most AMERICANS agree that there IS something fishy about the President who nominated his. Uve waited a year.
liberals do not agree! How dare you speak for us?
No, they don't. You are fantasizing again. #GarlandNotGorsuch
@MarianneHofer @GorsuchFacts Let's go McConnell! We have you everything you need to get this done.GET TOUGH OR GO HOME!MAGA!!!

MERRICK GARLAND!
Since when do you care about being principled?  You snubbed Obama's SCOTUS nominee.  #filibuster

BULLSHIT
Your credibility is zilch.
too many "{anti-]Federalist Society" members already. Pick a remarkable person not a runathemok drone clone
Uh. Not so much. No. Really, Methuselah. They don't.
Getting worried about McConnell's ability to perform the duties of his office, his memory is impaired. #retire
WRONGO BUCKO.   Only Treasonous GOP members agree.

liberals do not agree...Garland for SCOTUS
Dem/Libs are not going to work with you and you know it! Nuke it Now!
don't presume to speak for this liberal. No on Gorsuch
So where was this position when @garland_merrick was on deck you hypocritical #turtlefacedfuck
Use the nuke option and put this thing to bed
NOT THIS LIBERAL!  #STOLENSEAT
Conservatives and liberals DO NOT agree. How can you spin lies so easily, especially when you refused to consider Garland?
principled reason to oppose- nominee by president under counterintel investigation inherently illegitimate. all deserve better inc Gorsuch.
For his #StolenSeat? Name one "Liberal"?
While he may be qualified you must admit it would be totally fair for opposition to cram the nomination up yours
sideways  in response to what you did last time
I disagree. @GorsuchFacts seems to have no concept of how absurd his oversimplification of law is. Not SCOTUS material imho.
@Jackie_Blue_CA @GorsuchFacts You're lumping us all together LdrMcConnell--i'm one of your constituents who DISAGREE. Listen!
worst choice ever
Cease all legislation until corruption investigation is complete! That is Patriotic. Never mind it's you #fraud
You screwed the pooch when you wouldn't hold hearings for Garland.  Choke on your own bile.
: there was no principled reason not to give Judge Garland a hearing and confirmation. #Unconstitutional #resist
they agreed on garland,  but that doesn'tmatter to u
I too believe Judge Gorsuch deserves a vote.  The @SenateMajLdr has earned a vote of no confidence for his foul treatment of Merrick Garland
nope, puppet
we are trying to pass #acha forget Gorsuch until this is done. He doesn't hit our wallets! @POTUS @SpeakerRyan
@freedomcaucus @RepMarkMeadows and @SpeakerRyan I dare you to retweet this - #draintheswamp #FOCUS #ACHA #passthebill @vp @potus @PressSec
no we don't agree.  The president who wants Gorsuch is under FBI investigation for crimes.  No vote!
It's Garland's seat, and the fact 17 million was spent to prevent that is a VERY principled reason to vote no.
why did you guys spend nearly $17M on this guys nomination and confirmation?
NO  that's another of ur lies! He is no SCOTUS for all Americans just for ur @GOP #CORRUPTION #NeverGorsuch
Koch Bros pushing hard for Gorsuch like they did @SenateMajLdr
@Jackie_Blue_CA @GorsuchFacts 
Lol.
Merrick Garland
That's total fucken BS. No lifetime appointment should be made; administration is under FEDERAL investigation.
Liar.
Merrick Garland
@hughhewitt  Nahh. If you like him that's a good enough reason not to confirm him. I'm with @SenFranken
no he is a bad choice
you really gave a heart on for this guy
@hughhewitt @GorsuchFacts absolutely not.
Gorsuch should not be confirmed until the investigation of Trump and Russia is finished.
Of course not. You refused to give garland a simple interview. We will not confirm
There's one very principled reason to vote no. That would be YOU!
Uhm, no they don't
Right after the Garland vote, Slick.
No we do not all agree. MERRICK GARLAND deserves his chance. #MitchtheBitch #KingoftheHypocrits
There are no principles in liberalism so your appeal will only confuse them.
try a stolen set
Liar, liar, pants on fire. Now tell us again how much you love god.
@hughhewitt @GorsuchFacts  Nooooooooooo.  This seat was stolen from Merrick Garland.
@hughhewitt @GorsuchFacts Liberals and Conservatives also agreed that Garland should have been confirmed
The word "Principled" is not known to the Democrats, they haven't been for many years. Too partisan.
Well then, what's holding you up?
@hughhewitt @GorsuchFacts go NUCLEAR!!!
Not this liberal Crusty
what liberals have you been talking to?
@TheDemocrats better filibuster for McConnell Rule (prez in last yr does NOT get SCOTUS pick) 2017 2B last yr of Trump term.
There was NO PRINCIPLED reason to hold up Merrick either!!!

No confirmation while the president is under investigation - now there's a principled reason to vote no.
#MerrickGarland deserved a vote
Merrick Garland. The POTUS is under investigation by the FBI. Let's wait and see if he broke the law first.
Stop lying you profiteering hypocrite.
We Love Gorsuch/  Need him right away 
lol I love that "we couldn't find anything scandalous" is used to try to get bipartisan support of a politician
@Heavens2Betsy1 @GorsuchFacts Gorsuch worked for Bush Cheney on enhanced interrogation aka torture. COMPRAMISED IDEALS
Uh, no. Think you are drinking on the job
after we have hearings for merrick garland. You sir are a traitor.
no they do not but keep up the lying hypocrite
Then Git'er Done
There was no principled reason not to give Merrick Garland a fair hearing before the Senate.
NOT SO FAST...
Unfortunately for you your constituents say No which means no more you in a few years!
So u lying bastard's can cover up treasonous administration U all WILL pay at the poles
Get back in your shell!
Not until after the trump/Russia investigation.
Honor the McConnell rule - no supreme court appointments in a president's final year in office
Senator You lie and cheat. How do you people sleep. MERRICK GARLAND!!! You cheated America for years to come
I'm a Liberal and I disagree. I'm tired of @GOP constantly choosing the wealthy over the rest of America.
NO. Actually we don't. The Supreme Court already found is legal reasoning WRONG.
People, regardless of party, do NOT agree that he should be confirmed. We need answers in #Russiagate first.
except majority of American people voted for HRC. What happened 2 honoring the will of the people?
Confirm Merrick Garland. He is just as qualified & the will of the people (not EC) would be fulfilled since BHO & HRC won clear majorities
you abused your power by refusing a hearing and vote for Garland
MUST CONFIRM! #USA #America Is Behind #Gorsuch #JusticeGorsuch @SenateGOP @SenateDems #SCOTUS #law @ABA
Hmmm nah, they don't agree...what channel are you watching? #resist #filibuster
Actually not what I heard.
here's one: he consistently votes in favor of big corporations against individuals
Until Trumps FBI investigation is completed, The SCOTUS nomination should be halted. #CountryOverParty
Time to bring out the NUKE. (D)omestic terrorist be damned.
vote and get on with it
No, we don't all agree.
Merrick Garland, you traitors
Really?
You know I agree with you. BTW there was no good reason to delay Garland's nomination either, was there?
The American people cannot move past what you did with Garland yet sir
Which liberals agree? Your imaginary friends don't count
Wrong. Sad
23,000 coal miners agree you should Keep the Promise! 39 days! Tick Tock
You wouldn't consider the last nominee because the Pres was lame duck, should wait on this considering russia
nope. 
what rock did you crawl out from?
LIAR!
Merrill Garland, there is a reason 
Keep the pressure on the Alt Left. Chief Clown Schumer wants to filibuster.
Actually, liberals overwhelmingly say "NO, he doesn't support women or LGBTQI rights"
Comon Senator. Get the confirmation done. Ignor Shumer.
That is a lie. Perhaps "a few liberals" --- most of us are NO GORSUCH! Stop misrepresenting us.
Just shut up#liar
Nope
no, we should not. #Filibuster
Pres. can't appoint in the last year in office isn't that what you told 44, same holds true for 45 then.
More Alt-Facts, Turtle?  Liberals do not support Gorsuch nor you, @realDonaldTrump, or the GOP.  Nice delusion.
