DHS read Exe Order concluded it did not apply to Green Card holders. White House overruled them, CNN reports. http://cnn.it/2jCYwg9 
thank you and please report back to your highly concerned constituents
@EricLiptonNYT seek impeachment
But why vote yes on Pompeo??  Be courageous!  Suspend bipartisanism in time of emergency.  We will have your back if you are brave.
Please keep asking questions. There are NH families affected by these exec orders
@ezlusztig @EricLiptonNYT Senator Hassan, trump and his whole administration need to be removed from office and now!!
TY. But more than seeking answers is needed. Trump & Republicans must be stopped. Unconstitutional.
do tell what is unconstitutional about this?
Let's keep some Muslims out, but let the ones in where trump is doing business. Understand???
where was the outrage when Obama kept Iraqis out with his EO during his term?
Indont recall Obama letting Muslims in from countries where he was conducting business.
where in his EO does it specifically say Muslims only?
That's the thing, it doesn't. And those people who were on their way over were already vetted!!
@EricLiptonNYT lEqually disturbing were CBP and DHS not following court orders to desist -- Look into thata, too!
Respect you! Some things have to move quickly in order to save lives!
@JoyAnnReid Exempt of GnCd is missing point! What are you doing about ths? If ths wasas terrorism you'd be doing not tlkng
@ezlusztig Trump and his entire crew need to be removed. Independent Treason Investigation, Special Prosecutor, Impeachment.
Keep fighting against this wreckless Administration for NH. We are behind you 100%!
@EricLiptonNYT you better not just seek answers! You and EVERY Dem better be SCREAMING in frt. of BANKS of MSM microphones!!!

@EricLiptonNYT Thank you, Sen. Hassan, for pursuing green card questions.  Stand strong vs @POTUS cruelty and disrespect!
.@SenatorHassan If they're GC holders & stuck overseas, they'll still be taxed by IRS & have bank details reported to FinCEN #Humanrights
@ezlusztig we need more than "answers" you must dtop him. Get "answers " later like they do
@upwithmike @EricLiptonNYT 
Malfeasance is grounds for impeachment.
@JoyAnnReid @EricLiptonNYT How many "incidents" like this will Secy Kelly endure before he resigns in disgust?
Thank you, Senator!
@SenatorShaheen @RepSheaPorter Our children and grandchildren are counting on you for moral vision and moral outrage #resist
@realDonaldTrump is ignoring Court orders and enforcing the ban-more than seeking answers-call to action!
Thank you, Maggie, for taking action on this travesty.
But who really is in charge Senator? Have we leased out Our country's security to the alt right?
Answers and then, ACTION.  Dublin, NH
@SenatorShaheen @RepSheaPorter Not merely seek answers.  DEMAND ACTION.  HOLD TO ACCOUNT. NEVER REST.  NEVER STOP.  #resist
It won't go anywhere while Repubs control Congress, but he's violating Constitution. Start calling for impeachment
Thank you, Senator. We need 2 put pressure on all members of Congress 2 do same. This is not normal & will make us less safe

Thank you.  We should all be worried about our liberty and Freedom.

Thank you @SenatorHassan for standing up to this scary new administration. NH Dems got your back!
@tcwittes 
@EricLiptonNYT Thank you, Senator!
"Seek answers?" Where is the outrage & leadership from Senate Ds other than Booker, Warren, Sanders?
@ezlusztig Its past time for Congress to step in. The WH is trying to destroy US. We are watching & taking names.
@ezlusztig @EricLiptonNYT One word: Bannon.
@ezlusztig @EricLiptonNYT sounds like Steve Bankon has his finger prints all over that one senator
@ezlusztig @EricLiptonNYT -- what are you and others doing to get Steve Bannon out of the WH?  We are all watching.

@senateDems @houseDems
@SenDeanHeller  @SenCortezMasto @RepKihuen Remove Trump & Bannon !
@JoyAnnReid @EricLiptonNYT To add more clarity to your statement: Steven Bannon overruled Dept. Of Homeland Security.
@JoyAnnReid Thanks ladies!
I was fed employee, we always held congressional mandate, respect for Constitution above politics of administration.
@JoyAnnReid @EricLiptonNYT Don't seek..F'ing DO something about it!!!
We used to be horrified if government shut down, now I'm horrified of it being open under Trump.
DHS issued statement it will not adhere to court order, so that might be important too.
@JoyAnnReid @EricLiptonNYT Fight them, Maggie!
so disappointed in political stance on Syrian refugees as gov. Didn't give money to your campaign because. Do better now!
@EricLiptonNYT You mean Darth Bannon and Nut job Flynn overrode it. Same guys who implemented it so poorly due to ignorance.
@JoyAnnReid all of congress needs to convene TODAY and stop this. Danger looms u will b held accountable!
Get These People Out Of Our White House.
Meanwhile, these advisors are whispering into the ear of a guy with his finger on the button. We should all be disturbed.
It's time for you to stand firm. NO on all Trump appointments until this unAmerican travesty is reversed
We need 2 put aside party affiliations and save this country from further damage #StopPresidentBannon #StopBannon
Making America Regret Again.
YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP THESE MADMEN!
@JoyAnnReid @EricLiptonNYT Pease do! Although which clown is driving the clown car maybe immaterial
@JoyAnnReid @EricLiptonNYT Hassan is a new senator and should learn her job first
Thank You .It feels like I woke up and I not in American any more
Thank you, also please look at Bannon replacing the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the National Security Council.
@EricLiptonNYT every day I'm glad you won
@pamelamwalsh @EricLiptonNYT Truly shocking and offensive.
A CNN report ! They are the leading liars !  How bout this? http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-greencard-idUSKBN15C0KX â€¦
Let's not forget WH Political staff being placed at top of NSC either.
@TMMcKernan Thank you. Don't feel obliged to confine your criticism to gentle words. We are not dealing with gentle people.
@EricLiptonNYT what?
Hahaha..good one #WhisperInTheWind
Don't become an obstructionist. Consider becoming a Republican. Your values are more in line with that party.
Good.
@EricLiptonNYT I am horrified by this.
Dear Sen. Hassan, Please go after Bannon. He's not representing anyone but himself. Thank you.
he is the main problem and sad he is #1 advisor.he is racist ,ignorant & part of the anti-muslim industry
@brandycjudkins @EricLiptonNYT  you mean DHS actually read this stinking pile of garbage and approved it? Green card?obvious
@EricLiptonNYT Thank you, Senator!
