Public Education doesn't serve the country well. We need massive change there.
It would be gr8 to get an EdSec who wanted to improve public schools. That's not DeVos, who wants privatization.
the are not fixable. Give people choice that is all we can do now.
We have great schools in some places, like here in MA, so it must be possible to fix them.
I have no issue w/ school choice, but there must also be commitment to public ed. DeVos has no interest in it.
No. Public school needs to be over. As with anything, the left destroyed the idea of public anything..
democracy is about compromise, to find best solution. Not polarization.
the problem for you is that for 8 years the left has shut Americans out and polarized everything
Are there GOP senators still on fence? Constituents will call.
as a retired public school special needs teacher, I thank you for your stand.
from a mother of a child receiving special ed services through NH public school, thank you!

you have me glued to the tv! Amazing speech.  Thank you for sharing your personal experiences with Ben 
thank you Senator Hassan, you are a beacon of light.  I was so moved by your presentation.  So proud of our representatives!!
THANK YOU for supporting children with disabilities in education. DeVos is wrong for Secretary of Education!
thank you Maggie!
unfortunately @SenToomey doesn't have the cojones to stand up for what is right.  He has been ignoring his constituents 4 wks
- time for another democrat riot! The party of 'no' AND the party of 'RIOT!'
THANK YOU for standing against an unqualified non-professional for this Bully Pulpit position.
so far you have all voted for every one of Trump's cabinet. When are you planning on standing up?
Pathetic rhetorical move, worthy of the Trumpster. Why not send President Bannon your resume?
Bc I think they should stand against this awful administration? Excuse the hell out of me!
No, anyone with a real interest in opposing the Trump admin knows that Nh congresswomen are our strongest advocates
@BFBoomhower @realDonaldTrump Please, we need the best education we have to offer. Not DeVos. No shortcuts. Vote NO
has a single constituent actually wanted @BetsyDeVos ??
thank you!
Hassan wants the status quo
For God's sake if they can't break on #DeVos there's a worrying lack of personal agency. She's barely sentient.

GOP senators voting on #DeVos have received $115,000 from her & $950,000+ from her family. 

RT to say our public schools are not for sale. https://twitter.com/huffpostpol/status/827324598647664648 …
How will the Dems reward the RINO when the Repubs are in control? You would destroy the RINO's rep.
plz use when u speak on floor.HelpinTX:  http://sites.ed.gov/osers/2016/11/ … @brianmrosenthal
Competition from school choice has proven to improve local school performance. Bad results=bad teachers.
Maggie has a history of accepting illegal campaign donations raised serious ethical ? about her
I don't think that will happen.
thank you!!! Devos is not qualified!
Thank you Senator Hassan for standing up for the disabled! Ms DeVos has no business in the job of Dept of Ed
you are a terrific advocate for individuals who have experienced disabilities. Thank you for your work. Stand proud. 
Thanks for sharing Ben's story. IDEA is a civil right & students w/ disabilities deserve SOE who knows that! #DeVos #NotMySOE
Thank ou for fighting to keep Betsy DeVos from being an absolutely horrible Education Secretary.
Why? because you want to keep the same old failing status Quo, catering to the teachers unions. Shame on U
thank you for standing up for our children. They are the future & deserve a role model and believer in IDEA
I'm a teacher! Please urged your senator colleges to vote against DeVos.
Ugh another stupid senator
How much better did public education get with DOE heads (R & D) w/ deep experience?  The "best and brightest" have failed us.
. Please do anything you can to help stop this disgrace to American education.
excellent op-ed in the New York Times today.  Totally agree with you.
Sen H.Heartfelt thanks for caring about the future of all children in America, & not just the privileged.
Right! Thank you Senator!
Thank you! I work with children that have special needs and I am glad you are on our side! #NotoDeVos
Senator, great work you are doing! I am making calls to Senator's McCain and Flake.  Demanding a NO on DeVos
Thank you! #publicschools
I've called my senators in Colorado to vote NO. Thank you for your persistence @SenatorHassan.
Please tell @SenToomey to that we in PA want him to vote NO #DumpDevos
DeVos has no business being Secretary of Education.  Thank you for standing strong in representing NH's students and families
Senator Hassan-thank you for all you are doing for promoting the tenets public education and IDEA.
THank you! We support you in your objection to #devos
tried calling @marcorubio but answering machine during business hours AND mailbox full
Thank you for voting NO on DeVos!
Thank you so much for your activism. #devos will be a disaster for public schools and children with disabilities
thank you for voting NO. Appreciate your good judgement. #thankyou
thank you for your strength and courage in standing up to sorely unqualified nominees.  So happy you're in the Senate!!
@JerryMoran @SenPatRoberts anyone going to stand for my children? #StopDeVos #VoteNoDevos
Thanks so much for your principled stance.  There must be one more Republican with the grit to stand up.
What we really need is 8 more Democrats to stop whining and get on with the business of the country!
This is a betrayal of your NH values!
Merci Madame! you are our "heroe"! #yeswecan #yeswewill 
this shouldn't even be an issue.  Shouldn't have to fight for 3 Republicans to make the right choice.
thank you. She didn't even know what IDEA is. Uniquely unqualified as she doesn't even know the basics.
@EPICGOPFAIL @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @RandPaul @GOP have some moral integrity and do what's right!
TYVM, Maggie! This is why we sent u 2 DC - 2 fight 4 us! #RESIST @realDonaldTrump with all u got! We R behind U! #NHPolitics
thank you!
Thank you, Senator! Please get this done! DeVos is a disgrace. #TheResistance
Thanks for exposing @BetsyDeVos as a businesswoman out to extract profit w/no concern for kids. Sickening @realDonaldTrump
Who could be moved? Give us a few names and the phones will flood. Thank you for what you're doing!
if 4 or 5 withdraw their support, he may just withdraw the nomination

Sorry Mr President I sent this cunt to Washington 4 #OneTerm to make a point to @KellyAyotte #WeThePeople
Presbyterians started public education so all could read bible 
Mention during DeVos debate

@DemAwakening @realDonaldTrump @SenDanSullivan @SnJohnMcCain Please!! Do the right thing!!! Vote NO!!
I feel Pres.
Trump is making changes for the good
how about the #waterCrisis? #SB127 #ecoi #shitstorm #ShitShow #accountability #watergate #human #geneTech
& I urge Sen Hassan to vote "NO" on Price and Sessions and stand up for women, LGBTQ and Seniors
Which states have recently voted down Voucher ballot measures? (their Senators are the best targets)
"YOU MEAN I PAID TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR NOTHING?"
#devos
Thank you! DeVos is not qualified to take the lead on educating America's children.
@porter_debby @realDonaldTrump Be careful what you wish for. Trump eats POLITICIANS for breakfast
I'm from SC, but I applaud you for listening to your constituents. @SenatorTimScott @LindseyGrahamSC take note!
I say vote yes to choice in education. Yes to Devos
thank you for standing up for public schools and ALL our children!
@NEAMedia Pat Toomey. Call the hell out of Pa Toomey.
@LoganLevkoff @realDonaldTrump Please for the love of everything that is holy do not confirm this woman. 
thank you
we need change vote yes
vote yes it hasn't worked so far let's try a different direction
Thank you!!
who are Republican senators that could possibly be convinced to vote against DeVos?
You did a great job in committee. @lisamurkowski & @SenatorCollins need to find 1 more NO vote after saying 'aye' yesterday.
w/DeVos wld Feds follow TX? students w/disabilities be denied svs due 2 benchmark?  https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2017/02/01/disability-sue-special-ed-cap/23260/ …
- we're counting on you! Stand strong.
charter school are public, dummy. You're for your union donors, not the children.
YOU'RE FIRED.
Public schools are an abysmal failure.. Holding a monopoly has proven disastrous! School choice NOW!
Thank you for representing our children with disabilities!! Son with Angelman Syndrome 
Vote yes!
Who else do we appeal to? Any senators on the edge?
thank you for fighting for not just strong communities, but a strong country lead by world class #education. NO #DeVosvote!
I run a support group for #autism moms & heard a horrific story today about "school choice" Not an option
For special needs children like ours. #NoToDeVos
I'm hearing Sen. Portman is undecided! Keep calling 216-522-7095 or 202-224-3353 #NoToDeVos
@CarmintheB Sorry Maggie, not going to happen. If it was a D, she'd have dropped out.This is just a game to them sorry to say
They'll all have reservations, but they'll vote Aye. McConnell knew this from the beginning.
@SenatorLankford This is what I'm talking about!
boy did the people of New Hampshire make a mistake. they had a Great Senator in @KellyAyotte . sad.
true, but she earned her vacation for not supporting Trump I voted for John Stark
she did muck that up no doubt, but #newhampshire downgraded to an empty suit. sad4 all.
Do you ever wonder why your compared to Hitler?#furher
@ChristinaDimase @realDonaldTrump
.....Not gonna happen......
Thank you.
My school district has students w disabilities in residential program + $100,000  voucher that.. #noDevos
Thank you for standing up for our children with special needs!
WONT HAPPEN.... EVER. Dems need to suck it up for once and let the grown ups fix the mess they've created
Im praying that one more of them has the courage to stand up to the evil monster & face his wrath
@azalben @realDonaldTrump your new world order agenda won't work
You were my hero during the hearings! Son with #autism in Maine! Thank you for being a voice for people with disabilities.
I'm an #autismmom too! Hearing Sen. Portman is undecided! 216-522-7095 or 202-224-3353 just need 1 more!
will call, thanks!
Thank you for your efforts. She needs to be rejected.
So, you don't support enlarging school choice....don't you represent the @FreeStateNH?
 #DeVostating
why is no one investigating Erik Prince's connection to #45 and DeVos nomination
please do hear parents across the nation we want and educator not a faker #DUMPDEVOS !
I believe Ohio would like to see that GOP senator be @robportman. I hope he says NO to #DeVos.
Hi my name is Harry im 14 from Hollis and attending public high please do not vote for DeVos thank you
Senator #RubberStamp a embarrassment 2 NH

@staceyabrams @realDonaldTrump According to John Cornyn, "DeVos will be confirmed and you can take that to the bank".
https://twitter.com/senatorhassan/status/826904399201042437 …
You can do it, Senator.. Find one. Our children's future is at stake. #DumpDeVos
We only need one more GOP Senator to break with @realDonaldTrump on #DeVos. I urge my colleagues to stand up for public education & vote no.

Vote is on Cspan now!
As an urban school district board member & public school mom thank you for your leadership!
Public education shouldn't exist, government ought not be in charge of education
