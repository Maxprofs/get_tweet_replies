haters gone hate but Brady will go down as one of the greats QB's. 
#SB51
without James white patriots stutter to a stop. James White MVP hands down. Nfl is such bs
lmfao! You do realize Brady throws for over 300 yards if you deducted Whites performance
yes I do. Compare stats. Who had better game? Ok then. Next time lil man...maybe!
That's cute. 2TD's over 400 yards passing, and lead the biggest SB comeback NFL history.
ok... stick to naps n snacks ok kiddo
Really? Go look up how many QB's that's thrown for over 400 yards in a SB.
go find your friends outside. Yaaaawn
Remember when you only have 1/2% chance, you still have a chance. Never give up, never give in, never quit! @espn
@NBATVAhmad last year's Superbowl and yesterday's ESPN Win Probability. Never give up, never give in, never quit! @Vikings @stefondiggs @casekeenum7 @Vikings @Saints 96% @AtlantaFalcons 99.5% #SKOL

meh pats were a common pick to win it all again. Not very special...
rigged
I agree definitely rigged. I blame Trump 
THEN WHY DO YOU WATCH IF YOU BELIEVE ITS RIGGED, that way we wouldn't have you guys complaining
everybody watch it's entertainment. Still could be rigged somebody paying off the owners and coaches
@AronsLit @Patriots @SuperBowl
lol they scored that screenshot was probably after he already broke the plain then pulled back
nayyy
he was going down look where the ball lands when his body hits the ground
his knee was down fym
falcons should of won this is crazy you patriots cheated and you know you fid
lol
@TomFcknBrady go for it you can do this bro!    
@gablesch @Patriots @SuperBowl yes almost a year ago can't forget greatest comeback ever Pats
@SochiDuru @Patriots @SuperBowl umm are you a Patriots fan?
@jordiiii_13 @Patriots @SuperBowl rigged and cheating all the way 
why are you watching then?
that's the only thing you tweet
rigged
.@NFL @Patriots @SuperBowl - One of the greatest comeback victories in Super Bowl history.

Well done, @Patriots. Congratulations!  
1 of the greatest fixes in sports history...
.@TimonMOE @NFL @Patriots @SuperBowl - Explain how @AtlantaFalcons manage to blow a 28-3 lead like that, then?

You can't. That's that. 
Explain why they would continue to pass when they're already up 18 points...
.@TimonMOE @NFL @Patriots @SuperBowl @AtlantaFalcons - I don't know, I am just a spectator as you are, not their defence coordinator. 
u mean offense coordinator. maybe next time kiddo. Stick to naps n snax
.@UbbyUbb @TimonMOE @NFL @Patriots @SuperBowl @AtlantaFalcons - I am older than you, "kiddo". 41 in a fortnight. Nobody like a smartass. 
Rigged. We all knew what was going to happen. Vegas makes odds and games
did Vegas rig the coin toss too?
did u see the coin?
"u stupid" and you need speech class! At least I know how to talk. You are  plain and simple. Stick to snacks and naps kiddo!
wow you know how to talk! You deserve an award.
nice! What did I win? Carry on simpleton.
calling me simpleton, yet you brag about being able to talk. Are you 4 yrs old?
Brady can suck a big dick
lol mad much?
just a phone call to the falcons sideline that's great defense bill or Rodger. What a Joke!!!
it was obviously scripted any one with common sense can see that
Remeber when @RSherman_25 got in Brady's face?  That's how he'll be remembered. As the Dipshit who popped off to wrong guy
why is the new edit of the Super Bowl highlights on the NFL mobile app removed the Matthews hold that cost us the game.call.
don't hide it let the world see how terrible the refs are
lol falcons fans will blame anything to boycott that win, stupid...
Falcons blow a 28-3 lead?
but Ryan didn't blow the lead he got em in fg range to make it two score game. Penalty knocked em out
lol a penalty doesn't nock a 28 to 3 lead out
@AlyshaSarkar @A10_SL55 @geomedia04 @G987FM  incredible game #SB51 @Patriots right @jporty13 @ILiburd @Track_Shaw
unbelievable #bestever?
best ever, at the edge of our seat. Way to @NFL #SB51
hats off to Brady and Belichick. Both are the greatest of all time. Can't believe what I just saw.
You just saw the two biggest cheaters ever "win" another tainted title.
I'm not a Pats fan but to say that Brady cheated his way to 43 completions, 466 yds & a comeback"win" is silly.
The point is, he was suspended to start the season. All of his titles have a cheating controversy attached to them.
Please be assertive by making sure Patriots not wishing  to attend White House announce it now. Embarrassment to NFL.
Champions
Falcons Choked
damn right I owe them an apology!
PLEASE SEE & SHARE ASAP @TheDemCoalition #DworkinReport
congratulations
believes the @SuperBowl is a tool to be used to force states to allow the delusional and perverted to stalk their bathroom of choice.
play the game
BEST EVER..
If you liked your ratings in 2016 -2017 keep up threats against Texas about the bathroom issue and you'll love the ratings next season.
Its amazing where cheating will get you.Atlanta stopped the 2 point conversion and it was ignored Lmao
Bummer.There's always next year
@espn Mustangs blew a 26-0 lead to the Dillon Panthers in the Texas State Championship game


rigged AF
やった、ペイトリオッツだ！
Saw something on Ebay with the user name deeflatedballz 
Someone from Fitchburg, MA or is it's a scam??
Nicely done Patriots! oh man I waited this game so long and then I fell asleep after 30mins..jesus mary and joseph
yes it was time for the Patriots to win again good job
RIGGED! Not even in movies you see BS like this!

After farther review the player was in he simultaneously hit the ground & the line at the same time Wow!!! Champs
Wonder if Brady gonna go see @realDonaldTrump he didnt see @BarackObama @POTUS with the last ring..  #BigotGate
That overtime rule needs looking at! The Super Bowl shouldn't be effectively decided by the toss of a coin!

Thank you! I can't remember who won because of a concushion. I need new furniture.

I'm really happy that the patriots won! Congrats to both teams for trying their bests tho! 
Nice win!

Incredible may be, corruption and fraud more possible is Brady

#patriots #winning #5forbrady #bradyisthegoat #micdrop
The first half was lousy. Yet,the second half &
the 1st overtime in NFL history,made all the difference!
That shit is rigged
Congrats...Brady you really out did yourself...AMAZING!!!!! Congrats to a true MVP

NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS BEST EVER..CEMENTED.!
I have successfully boycotted my fourth season of NFL reality TV.
the nfl is garbage anything for mr tom brady bs nfl is dead the new nba goodbye football
Never give up! Nothing is impossible. It's not just a game. It's a belief.

an amazing game. What loved the most was the sportsmanship and comradeship both teams showed
congrats to Tom Brady and the @Patriots he showed us why he is the greatest of all time last night. No arguments #Goat
The Greatest come back in sports history.
Atlanta coach @ QB r Stupid run it then kick FG game over idiots
The pats had a rough start yet they came back stronger never had a doubt that they would loose. I love the pats
totally awesome
@josema_buyo @Patriots @SuperBowl pero porque das rt notas si no has visto el partido
hasta el descanso vi.
i try to watch that but it was funny to watch guys in long johns and shoulder pillows on
woo patriots won the superbowl
I want to see brady do what manning did. Go to different team and have two superbowls and atleast one win.
Bill is the mastermind not brady. Brady was done in 1st half.
Bill Bellechick IS the N.E. Patriots not brady. Bill makes stars out of nobody's #MattCassell #Fact
congratulations patriots !
can finally buy NFL game ticket and watch every single game again!
*Quarter*
