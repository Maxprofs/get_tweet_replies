How is an "educator" from Indiana a constituent?
And the Senator is a "she".  Maybe you should focus on your home state.
I'm no "progressive"
Sorry, "life"
S/he won't do it, otherwise the vile human being in the peoples house won't close her/him.
Sexism & intentional misgendering, Hope? You sure you're not on Team Trump?
The Marxists did a great job with you as a child
You guys need to get serious with his impeachment or force him to resign!
On what grounds?
Emoluments clause?Money laundering?
What money laundering ? Emolument clause was addressed
Trump still enriching himself.This has not been addressed.US banks stopped dealing with Trump.He launders the $ "pouring in from Russia.
It doesn't bother U that the left leaning media distorts and misleads U, sometimes half reporting or not reporting? Don't U question?
I question http://everything.You  need to question that fraud you support as president.
Do you live in a parallel universe. Ever met a middle class American? Go live in Cuba, see how communism is a failure. You need to go.
#impeachTrumpnow -derelection of duty.Sabotage ACA signup/funding/fail #PuertoRicoRelief #TrumpRussiaInvestigation Why is he still here?
Haha so hysterical
Enough! #SenatorStompyFoot #NobodyIsListening #nhpolitics
you are a fake senator. As a NH taxpayer my vote was canceled out
Sorry, this conversation is for grown-ups only.
We are Fed Up with the Democratic bull crap. America citizen voted get rid of Obamacare and Stop the Democratic's division.
He is sabotaging our lives. Get him out of there now.  #ImpeachNow
or let demcare implode and ruin millions of lives!
You must live in a bubble. Obamacare is in full swing, prices are rising and you’re blaming Trump?
Trump will probably nominate Hannibal Lecter to replace Price.
Enough is enough. Trump has to go now. Article 25. He isn’t just sabotaging HC he is sabotaging a nation.My nation.Speak out now. #Article25
#NotGunnaHappen #newHampshireHatesObamaCare #ObamaReallyDidNotCare #FollwingTheMoney #HowMuchDidYouGetInBackroomDeals?
nice thought. Won't happen.
The failing ACA has become a single payer, Government run operation. We need to repeal it, and replace it with a much better plan.
No, he must continue to make those markets stronger and more competitive. You call it sabotage, when in fact it's progress.
And who's going to enforce that? Senate and Congress DO NOTHING TO STOP THIS. Looks what's about to happen w the Alpha Banker?!!Unbelievable
We're counting on Congress to stop this madness.  DO YOUR JOBS. Stop Trump #kleptocracy. 
@realdonaldtrump #trump #WH couldn't do more DAMAGE AMERICAS #healthcare  he MOVED #PUTIN into #LINCOLNbedroom PRAY #MUELLER TIME comes SOON
Wont happen. The GOP is hell bent on decimating the middle class &further subjugating the poor. There will be 2 classes- the rich & the poor
Feudalism is the GOP wet dream.
Sh*t! He needn't have resigned. It was more of a 'pointing out' than a damning accusation.
Hassan is a Muslim and wants Sharia Law!
But that's they're job
#EnoughIsEnough @SenatorHassan! End for-profit health care once & for all by signing on to @SenSanders #MedicareForAll! #MFA #SinglePayer
Do you honestly believe Senate Rs will care if the nominee later ignores confirmation promises to faithfully administer the ACA? Fat chance
Enough is enough!  Get Washington out of our healthcare.
Sequestration of veteran health care to a corrupt, malicious VA system to never end correct Senator? Suicides at VA facilities messages sent
#MedicareForAll
Work on the Rs to confirm a qualified person, one who didn't come in with conflicts. Thank you.
But then how could he really be Trumps HHS guy. I mean.. c'mon
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/28/government-report-shows-attorney-general-fbi-used-luxury-jets-for-personal.html ….  Remember this Senator?
What exactly are you doing to try working WITH @potus instead of against him?
Dems sabotaged healthcare - you ruined it for millions
You support ACA which is an abomination of insurance markets.
The GOP has been undermining the ACA by taking away the Fed.ACA Money to the states. They R causing the spikes/failure.
You do realize that the Fed. ACA money was never authorized by the ACA legislation or appropriated by Congress. It is an illegal payout
Dreamer
Obamacare was dying long before Trump. You are the swamp.  Retire.  Go home
Make sure I vet them and don’t approve just anyone.

You hypocrite!It was the Democratic Party that destroyed our medical insurance with the Obamacare SCAM that you FORCED upon working American
Not Rick Sentorim
The only ones destroying our USA are
Lousy Politicians who have become quite the dictators! Repeal Obama care!
You work for USA do your job!
Most people don't want full repeal. Deal with it.
Most people are idiots and have no clue that government involvement is why it is so expensive.
Fat chance of that happening 
Thanks Senator Hassan!
Blah blah blah...
If he can find someone honest that is willing to work for a big crook?

As @DNC protects criminals

Vote your criminals home

Ha, you believe something written by Neil Munro? That dude's biased agenda is easy for anyone to spot.
Price was Ebola to healthcare system
YES! We're so tired---and tired of---begging repeatedly for a reasonable approach that prioritizes public need over political agenda.
Sabatog = deconstruction. All bad!
This is why he will just delay nominating anyone. Still waiting for a new DHS secretary.
we do not want the ACA, it is horrible, the only ppl that like it is the ones that get it for free, you try it instead of your cadillac plan
#RUSSIA #PUTIN #GRU #BOT speaks LIKE #TRUMP divide foment hate RACISM GREED 1% TRUMP FIRED SCUMBAG #tomprice than on TAXPAYERS DIME PILLAGES
Senator: you are embarrassing yourself again with your extreme left basis. Please do something to help the health care in the Granite State.
Here's an idea----make everyone pay for their OWN INSURANCE. Tired of paying for illegals and moochers.
#liberalsRmorons
Sabotage not needed for a severely flawed system. But you are not in the ACA because you are “Special” and exempt
Oh, FFS, members of Congress buy their insurance through the ACA. It's IN THE LAW.
No.  They do not.  Obama granted them an exemption from the law.
40% !  Mine went up 32% 6 years ago because of Obamacare.
Really?  How much are health care premiums in NH going up? Not a surprise. Told this for the past 2 years this was going to happen.
Get the HAND OUT "TALK to the HAND" His hand has Blood on it!
