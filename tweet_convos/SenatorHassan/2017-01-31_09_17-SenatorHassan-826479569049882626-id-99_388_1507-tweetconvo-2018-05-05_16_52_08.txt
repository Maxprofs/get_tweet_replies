do more than that!  Find a way to prevent the vote from getting to the floor. #resist
We need some GOP members with a backbone to join in or there won't be enough votes to block her. They are power hungry.
I wish they'd listen.  Don't they have kids or grandkids?  I guess they have the money to pay for private education.  I wish I did!
Thank you Senator!
