TY for @SenatorHassan's comments during today's session. TY your vote  #StopDeVos
I'm a Republican that hates Devos. Hopefully other Republicans in Congress do, too. #603 #DenyDeVos
thank you for stating that you will not vote for the extremely unqualified Betsy DeVos.
glad you will vote NO on DeVos.  You MUST vote NO on Tillerson too.  In fact, wjy would you vote yes on ANY?
@AtlBlue2 Thank you, even from those of us who are childless. Because we care about the future of all of us.
Stupid move!
#Thankyou she is inexperienced, incompetent has huge ethical issues including  illegal campaign contributions
@educatorsresist Thank you, Senator!
Please vote against Andrew Puzder as well.
You go girl!
Hope you are able to reach across the aisle and get some R's to agree she is NOT a good choice for our kids.
THANK YOU! #nobetsydevos
THANK YOU from a Kingston teacher and Manchester resident.  The rejection of this nomination is so important.
Thank you from an educator and Exeter resident. Please do all in your power to convince enough republicans to block her.
#DeVosmustwithdraw
THANK YOU!  She's a horrible nominee!
@DeborahHealy_ I seriously hope others listen to you &watched her being vetted. That spoke volumes.
Great, vote against them all. Pompeo was a mistake, but I suppose you get one Mulligan.
Totally agree. Vote against ALL of them.
I wish I could leave a voicemail for my senators. @tedcruz @JohnCornyn.
Thank you!
I knew I could count on you to do the right thing when it comes to education. I'm very grateful you won't be supporting her.
- thank you, Senator Hassan.
Oppose them all. This has to be stopped. #resist #obstruct #MakeAmericaAmericaAgain
@GovChrisSununu maybe you can talk some sense into sununu while your at it?
Thank You @SenatorHassan. Please convince @senmarcorubio to be the voice of his all his constituents - not only the voice of big donor(s)
THANK YOU SENATOR!  Please urge them to vote against her nomination.
Please follow the lead of @SenGillibrand voting no on all of them. Tillerson, Sessions, Pruitt they are awful & unacceptable.
Many thanks, Sen. Hassan! She has no background or experience in public education!
Thanks for your leadership on this!

Thank you. You are playing an important role in DC as one of our NH senators. How grateful I am to have you represent NH.
I am so thankful that you are standing up for our students. She is the worst possible choice for the position. Thank you.

As a NH resident that works at one of the state colleges thank you so much!

Good. Should be no doubt now amongst Dems. If you even consider DeVos, Tillerson, Sessions etc., you're in the wrong party.
HELL YEAH MAGGIE THANK YOU

There is no middle ground.  No acceptable appointees. No acceptable policies coming out of the White House.
Thank you.
