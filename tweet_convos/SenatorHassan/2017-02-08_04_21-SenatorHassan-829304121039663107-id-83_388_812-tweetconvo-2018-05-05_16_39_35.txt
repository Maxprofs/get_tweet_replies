@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions All you dimms have is your identity politics. So sad and pathetic.
Oh please give me a break.
self entitled private school princess rights?
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions 

Sad sad day when @SenatorHassan elected to represent great State of #NH 

Nothing more than a party puppet
you mean abortion. You're pro abortion. Call it what it is. You want To be able to abort babies.
Your leftist identity politics garbage is just annoying now. You're helping people off the Dem plantation.

@SenatorHassan @OurRevolution2
then you are a nut case, Sessions is a "law and order guy" , get over it
Unity should override Conservatism and Liberalism. We matter, stop dividing 330 million unified people.
Whats your 1 constituents  fear concerning women's rights & her autonomous life?
#DemHysteria can be treated
drama queen much! lol!
What is she some kind of crook?
Stand strong Maggie,  I stand with you.
Sessions is a crime fighter. So, don't commit crimes. It's easy.
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions you are perpetuating a lie about Mr Sessions. Read the case!  It was Black on Black voter fraud
You mean yours and your daughters right to KILL an unborn baby?   How would you/she feel if you had!
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions But not worried about rights that disagree with you. I'm a woman and my right are just fine!
Don't worry about it, I think the exact same thing every time a Dem politician speaks.
I truly fear for the Democratic Party's existance if you continue this obstructive behavior.
She impuned Sessions as a AG candidate not as a senator. U Dems are so weak. Please find some courage to stand
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions Are you  SERIOUS!! This is PREPOSTEROUS!
I agree entirely. Imagine the girls that are brown and/or disabled, what kind of fairness will they recv?
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions Americans can't trust you people. Totally disgraceful what happened at the @DNC convention..
And the condescending comments are from men. Imagine that!
Thank you @SenatorHassan for fighting for us!
was this before or after shutting down a woman for reading a black woman's words?
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions seems like a bunch of overly dramatic bs
Watch this video then tell us about women's & your daughters rights, with more refugees in the USA!!.

@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions@dacullington.Devos as SOE shows Rep's aren't looking out 4 folks w/kids!Two Rep. Women voted No
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions I fear for women's and my d's right to an autonomous life if @POTUS can't control immigration.
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions I am truly fearful of my future if Jeff Sessions is NOT confirmed.  He will keep us safe!
Of course U R Democrat! U will rather favor anything with sharia & really destroy women's rights
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions Tell her it will b ok. We worried for 8 years n the US is still here.
GET A LIFE! fear mongering is rampant by the US senate. You look like the fools you are! EXPOSED
Yep!  All lefty Lucy's want to be able to commit murder without prosecution!  Puleeeze...
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions@dacullington /2, yesterday, then women who don't hold a seat as Warren does, are in huge trouble
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions@dacullington.If Sessions believes in silencing women's rights as Sen.McConnell did w/Sen.Warren
thank you! @SenatorSessions is a dangerous bigot who does NOT represent majority of Americans. #stopsessions #letlizspeak
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions but that's not important to the rich white GOP men who will vote him in.
@SenSchumer  

I will breathe easier for myself and my daughter that the Rule of Law will be back.

TY, @SenatorSessions
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions : MAGA
Its a good thing Killary didn't win....
@SenatorShaheen @SenateDems I hate the appearance of obstruction but in w/o the option of honest debate #goontherecord
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions In the end, Trump will get his mostly sub par cabinet; who will care about the American people?
They put Freedom of Speech and TRUTH on chopping block.
Telling press to Shut Up & then inflicted this on SenWarren, we need to PROTEST.
@SenSchumer More fear mongering& intimidation tactics from dems. WON'T WORK. We the ppl know truth behind ur lies
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions By Gosh if 1 person said it bring the while process to a stand still
@SenDeanHeller in NV voted to abuse school children, destroy Education & women to sit down & shut up!
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS This is such bullshit! Get off your ass and live your life!
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions Drama queen.
Its what people know about themselves that make them fearful and afraid.
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions MAGA
Sen Hassan is the problem, Sen Sessions is the solution.
nope.
Don't be stupid Hassan, Sessions would be an awesome DOJ to help the safety of the US.
wrong.
do your job and give our president his cabinet. SICK of the games.
@katelinnea @SenatorSessions I, too, am worried about women's rights & the future for my daughters.
like how?
To make a statement like that shows you're either corrupt or incompetent!
Are you quoting Trump?
we all fear for our rights, period, under this administration. Also scared that the IDEA website is DOWN.

America is ready for an #AmericanRenaissance leaving #GOP cronies behind: @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain
