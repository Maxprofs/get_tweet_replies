you realize reps blocked obamas congress for 8yrs as a stated plan
due to not being qualified; these ppl are the worst picks
republicans stated stalling in congress was their goal - not alternative facts
not really - no respect for targeting children
Sounds like someone did us a favor and stopped her from boring us and wasting even more time. She's irrelevant.
. When she 's sworn in as next potus let's see how irrelevant she'll be. Old fart mcconnell irrelevant
until then... irrelevant. Until then... no influence or pull. Until then... shhhh.
sorry you can't shush me!   n sorry you can't shush the majority of the country!
and yes, dear, I can shush you. At least as it pertains to bothering me further.
and why would we want to shush her. Let her spread her crazy to her peep
So Coretta Scott King is crazy? Wow
No. You are crazy.
it's unacceptable for Pocahontas to be in government.
thank you resist
we stand with you Sen Warren!
@Ladybug014 @SenatorHassan @JumpTheRework @SenWarren #LetLizSpeak! Don't they know this kind of crap makes us fight harder?
really? Not working so far. Try harder lol
Bless your heart! The pups on your banner are adorable!
Southerners know that's the biggest insult in the book :)
and there's no comeback for it!
God bless you too! 
@JAMnSC @SenWarren  I just blinded myself looking at your pic. My eyes were protecting my heart.
don't let her speak please
There's laws against it don't you know ?
#letlizspeak
Disgraceful for this to happen in Congress to a fellow senator
Especially since she'll be our next POTUS! She can put that idiot in check too
@SenateGOP your hunger for power and wealth have been shown to the world. We will not be silenced or oppressed
You lose
Yep. CNN just reviewed that.
was outline. A gentleman would understand.
I am so happy you are representing NH and Mass.
have never seen anything like that wondering what country I'm living in these days
Of course I agree, but wasn't she stopped for quoting Ted Kennedy? Well, that's the story at least #resist @SenWarren
Since when isn't ANYBODY on this planet allowed free speech?
@jonfavs  this is very wrong
The GOP are a shameful bunch of hypocrites and we will vote them out!
how's that been working lately? The GOP; a shameful bunch in charge of everything.
I was also mystified as to why 4 white males were able to read from it the next day unchallenged.
the Fascist's Led by McCornhole, and Ryan And Trumpist aka Bannon
It's inappropriate to impugn another Senator.  Real Senators know that.
#ShePersisted 
With respect, mealy mouthed language like "unacceptable & inappropriate" won't stop these barbarians #uspol
Odd watching Sen Hatch blow his nose on TV and look at his handkerchief like he did not understand what came out?
@SenateDems @SenWarren NAZIS! This is SO unacceptable! Don't let them walk all over you!!! Grrr
@SenSchumer @SenatorHassan @SenWarren You're all OBSTRUCTIONISTS!
damn right! Obstructing evil!
It is unacceptable and inappropriate that @SenateDems ignore the abuses at Standing Rock. #NoDAPL
they are acting like nasty frat boy bullies
. FirSt amendment FReedom of speech.
@janet_yackle @SenWarren Especially since the President tweets "disparaging" remarks to CIA, media and anyone opposing him

it was inappropriate and unacceptable 4 the Senate 2 boo Congresswoman Maxine Waters too.
And allow MALE members to read the same thing unchallenged.  Keep firing that forest #GOP
It's equally unacceptable to me that Nancy Pelosi is saying T has committed no impeachable offense. Violating law
maybe all senators should go to the floor and read the same speech?
Mien Kampf Trump &Swamp Rats cant handle strong women or deal with any truths!
Absolutely Agree!!!!
@GetWisdomDude @SenWarren @SenateGOP Both @OrrinHatch & @SenateMajLdr should b impeached for ABUSE OF POWER! #WeThePeople
@traciemom @SenWarren ALL PPL ARE GOING TO GET VERY PISSED IF DISCRIMINATION BECOMES UNPUNISHED! GOD BLESS MRS.KING!
it all for show. Transparent much?
GOP #SUCKS
Discrimination is what it is! Set women back a hundred years! SUFFRAGE for what! We can't speak??????
proud to have you as our senators. Proudly shared Mrs Kings letter
@SenateDems @SenWarren thank you yes it was
Not if the act of reading the letter violates the rules of the Senate. Cannot pick and choose the rules to follow
@citzgirl @SenWarren and yet someone's poor daughter was so badly treated and daddy can speak out openly about that.
she got the attention that she always seeks!
TALK ABOUT SHOWING TRUE COLORS! #GOP TRIED 2 HITS Last pm, ANTI-WOMENS EQUAL RIGHTS & ANTI- CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS!
We will always remember #ShePesisted
what is the specific legality of this? An arcane rule has been mentioned, where are the arguments?
Thank You for standing up for all Americans. Georgia is ashamed of @senatorisakson & @sendavidperdue #LetLizSpeak
@MOVEprofPHD @SenWarren cry harder
these rules are enforced very selectively.
this is what society tries to do to all women. We will not back down now. Our country is in peril.
@jaq_jackie @SenWarren The Senator president should have shut down McConnell. This is totally Civil War
@SenSchumer @SenWarren A 30+ YEAR OLD LETTER!!! We've all heard the letter before, we know what it says, not necessary VOTE
@MamatoGirls @SenWarren We know how you alt-left Dems hate 2 follow rules. U can watch Pocohantas on CNN MSNBC I'm sure
.@SenateGOP .@SenateMajLdr  #RosaParkspersisted
@deejay90192 @SenWarren it might n unacceptable and inappropriate but it was done
@MikeOkuda @SenWarren #DucttapeLizMouth she pollutes minds  every time she speaks. @ thefive @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends
Maybe you could ask her: did she not understand the Senate rules, or was it her conscious decision to flaunt them?
#shepersisted
Time to abolish that Senate rule. Americans should all have the right to disparage Senators: They've earned it.

;My Name Is Paulette Darow And I Strongly Agree; Peace, Republican Stop The Ugliness!~_~
After the GOP is done with messaging, Sessions will lbe the victim and Warren cast as bully. How to keep facts?
@SenSchumer @SenWarren that's the problem with Dems, can't follow rules, many you approved, very sad
#letlizspeak you make all women proud
@CitizensFedUp @SenWarren the lies disrespect and abuse of power shown by @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan is out of hand!!
actually it was pocahontas who broke a rule.  Don't call her out tho, it's against the programming
Are Dems going 2 actually DO anything or just complain & suck it up?
someday soon, all Democrats will realize they now face the GFP - Grand Fascist Party.  Democracy is quickly dying.
racism is alive in the Senate
agreed
.@SenatorHassan @SenWarren Incorrect. She wasn't "stopped from reading" the letter. She read the letter. She was stopped later in speech.
It's unacceptable & inappropriate that Warren  violated Senate house rules & when asked to stop declined to do so
Then you take up the letter and speak for her, we can't do that for the Dems, you have to do it. We'll do our part
@carmic14 @SenWarren what are you going to do?
#NeverthelessShePersisted
By gagging @SenWarren & ms. King posthumously, @SenateMajLdr only amplified accusations made against Sessions.

DUMB.
Hassan the more you tweet the less respect I have for you You spin everything Warren broke a senate rule U know it
THAT RIDICULOUS COURT RULE BROKE HER ORIGINAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH DID IT NOT?
OREGON CASE #16-DR-12492 CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED DAILY IN AMERICAN COURTS. NOT ALL OF US HAVE LEGAL $$
Stand tall read king's letter live on social media #joinwarren
@Deanofcomedy @SenWarren
Are you serious? She's a complete fool.
@RahamanMD @SenWarren #johnsessionsisago!
@SenateMajLdr Republicans silencing @SenWarren  
making  louder & angrier. 
ALERT!
MIAâ†’ #RepublicanEthics
#LetLizSpeak
@tedcruz@johncornyn new roads to fascidm
I'd call it just barely criminal. But that's the GOP & gerrymandered congress. Fraudulent.
because Mitchell McConnell is racist just as Sessions!
Sue them! Unequal lattitude to question nominee because it's a Senator? Rally and be intolerant @GOP overreach.
that's funny because she asked to finish the letter and was allowed to. #Blinders
We need to express our outrage with our presence. We need to make phone calls and send faxes. We must respond.
Let's help @SenWarren
I am proud of my women senators. You are doing what the men can't or aren't willing to do. Thank you!
Thank you for taking this stand
this is Mitch paying a favor back to Trump.Warren ripped Trump during the campaign and then Trump hired Mitch's wife
Have you raised the same opposition to Sen Reid when he many times stopped similar... but no-here are consequences
This was a measured gamble by Rs to define the face of the Ds as that of Warren. Not a spur of the moment error
The GOP boys club gets off on steamrolling women.
WARREN/BOOKER 2020!!!
hahahahahahaha
What's the plan moving forward?
@girlsreallyrule @SenWarren IMPEACH
yeah, not really; rules are rules, sweetie..
#hesyourpresident
see thats the problem. You people cant follow rules.
Except for the fact that she broke Senate floor rules? Seriously? Typical Liberal attitude.
hey organize a protest or something.
name the perpetrator! Mitch McConnell.  Write to him
@SenateDems @SenWarren GOP setting up a dictatorship.
Maggie, I see you don't understand the rules any better than Liz.
this is the start of something bigger being put in a corner like a child. Shame on the senate.
@SenSchumer @SenWarren paybacks are hell aren't they?
This is crap, repububs pushing women back 60 yrs to be silenced. This is 2017 you schmucks.We will fight you.
.@SenatorHassan .@joandgordonjoan .@SenWarren 1986 ! wasting time & our resources.Ever hear of linear time #RaceBaiting should be a crime.
SO for God's sake DO SOMETHING - this is an attack by Americans on American Democracy
So he brings more attention to the letter he didn't want read.
Even nasty women need to follow the rules.
you guys should take up mantle. Take turns reading  where last one left off after being taken down. #solidarity
TRUMP TREASON TRIBE
It unconscionable to confirm Sessions, racist,sexist, DJT loyalty over our nation.Why do u play corrupt Mitch game
@badgirl_loony @SenWarren can't let that ocean of dicks  drown her.. seriously look at that pic..

@randyprine @SenWarren #SwampCabinet

I felt demeaned as a woman just hearing the actual words and knowing so many senators voted to approve the silencing
@brianoloughlin9 @SenWarren GOP is a bunch of snowflakes!!!
@Purplegarter1 @SenWarren 

...finally @SenateMajLdr shows his true stripes, ie a bigot and racist denying words of Mrs.King.
Let them impugn you next or will you stop that?
irrelevant like her party
Maybe they don't want to be reminded how foolish those senators r who support @realdonaldtrump as he kills us all.
krooked Republican leaders are afraid of women! First Hillary and now Elizabeth. They need to be ousted@
it would be a shame if McConnell's office was inundated with faxes and letters of Coretta Scott King's letter. Just sayin'
Read the letter tomorrow on the floor.
No it wasn't. She was out of line. Stop pretending this is about sex when it's about Dems breaking the rules. @SenatorHassan @SenWarren
Read the letter yourself please
u guys must think ahead of GOP tactics like this. Have strategy. Like every other dem continuing reading speech
@SenateDems @SenWarren Take floor now and read CSK's ltr. Make them silence you all. An injury to one is an injury to all.
It's what she had said before...that resulted in the B***hSlap!  NOT the King Letter!
Do we  Sen Hassan to the Dem Ladies ( a stretch!) Goon Club? I think we must for we are judged by company we keep
-No, it's not. @SenateMajLdr did exactly the right thing!
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @KellyannePolls
Here's What @SenWarren said to impugne @SenSessions
It's unacceptable that you don't get it.

So women should be above Senate rules? @SenWarren
it's your considered opinion that senator Fauxcahontas is exempt from senate rules?
oh GOD!! We are all so sick of every one of these #DEMocRAT frauds!  @SenatorHassan @SenateDems @SenWarren @FoxNews @OANN @nytimes #MAGA
They let VP Dick Cheney tell a representative to f himself but that was ok? Aren't standards same 4 all Congress?
PresidentObama 10/26/10: "They can come for the ride, but they gotta sit in back." You're no longer driving!
@SenSchumer @SenWarren boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo go cry w #cryinchuck. Get out of the way and let the adults run the show
Let's honor Sen Warren and CSK by sharing the complete text of her letter and statement:
@bobi_gillyon @SenWarren look respectfully we have told you what was happening and you all ignored it .FIGHT NOW OR NO LATER
@mooshakins it's acceptable and under the rules of Senate mouthing off and if you don't know these rules learn up
the rules also apply to women #Equal #shutlizup
and it's despicable what happened at Phillips Exeter. But you cast stones at others.. What Faith do you practice?
"what do you have to lose?" The answer - your right to vote, to send your kids to public school, and to healthcare
#letlizspeak
U mean racist GOP led by McConnell who obstructed EVERYTHING of Obama?
No Pocahontas has had her say , No refunds Liz needs to sit the hell down
@SenateDems @SenWarren Consequences- read the Senate Rules. You are not above them even if you think you are.
Unacceptable &  inappropriate for hypocrite Dems to remain silent about Dem Senator Byrd, KKK leader & bigot!
Wrong. She must follow the rules. America is the better anytime they don't have to endure that voice. #Winning
It's unacceptable to slander a colleague with what you know for a fact to be false accusations of racism.
Please let her speak, thus ensuring a Republican majority for decades to come. #fauxcahontas
each democrat should read the letter when on floor of House/Senate. Don't they dare silencing freedom of speech
Thanks for standing with our Senator!
.@SenatorHassan @SenWarren yes rules apply to degenerate democrats too lol break the rules now you'll be called out on it 
Very Shameful!!!
Youâ€™re wilfully misleading people. You're #fakenews.

@denlibby @SenWarren What can we expect from this disgraceful trumpist GANG? Consideration? NO WAY. IMPOSSIBLE!!!
.@SenatorHassan @SenWarren https://twitter.com/PuestoLoco/status/829169377035554817 â€¦
Typical of wacky liberals to take this route. Always play the race card.blah blah blah
disgusting #LetLizTalk
#letlizspeak #LetLizTalk
Democrats man up and fight back. Don't let the GOP win!!!
No it wasn't. She was wrong, and was disciplined per senate rules. The rules still matter regardless of party.
The letter was 30 yrs ago.
She was warned. She continued, she knew the rules of the senate. Its her own fault.
Totally unacceptable. Mitch O'CONNELL is going to burn in hell. Please don't vote him in 2018.
