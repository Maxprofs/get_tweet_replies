your lack of that @SenatorSessions will stand up to @POTUS is valid! Probably will be the best racist AG for Trump voter supp
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS wonder how you voted for Holder - the domestic terrorist?
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS Mr&Mrs leftist libreal there is a new sheriff in town and laws will be followed&enforced
Agreed! Thank you for speaking out Senator!
@SenSchumer @POTUS Funny, you've been working side by side with him for years and we've heard nothing bad till now.Convenient
I  lost my confidence in the Democratic Party. I am changing my life long party loyalty.
And you think Holder and Lynch were independent. They politicized the AG office.
@SenSchumer And Lynch stood up to Obama, when ??
The extent of the current constitutional crisis dwarfs Watergate!! Keep up the good work!
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS thank you
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS He would me much more independent than the political hacks of Lynch and Holder.
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS what made up rights are you worried about now?
I'm not that confident in you as my senator either
@SenSchumer yes but because you all changed the votes needed from 60 to 51, you can't stop it. You guys are so short sighted
No you are afraid he WILL abide by all laws!
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS nor do I have confidence in YOU Mr Sessions is a good man that respects &enforces the law
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS You mean like Eric Holder or Loretta Lynch was independent and stood up to Obama?
Fight this evil! Thank you for standing firm! @SenatorHassan @SenatorSessions @POTUS
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS Will he sell guns to drug cartels?
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions My educated brain is rattling. You know Sessions don't you? Why then do you seek his destruction
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS That's what you have been programmed to say! We the people don't have confidence in you!
@realdonaldtrump I agree!!
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS vote no on Sessions
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS this quite sure you're absolutely correct
@nylibrarian Does he support public shaming as tool of White House when attempting to induce conformity?
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions You're right, and congress will then be powerless to stop the genocide that's coming #resist
oh, like Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch? We're tired of corrupt, dishonest dems like you.
@realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer But OK @POTUS44 DESTROYED 9M US ppl abroad w/#FATCA?
None of his picks will stand up to POTUS; sad they are sheep.
@SenSchumer @SenatorHassan @SenatorSessions you are being obstructive not constructive

.@SenatorHassan @SenateMajLdr admitted as much when he silenced @SenWarren & barred any Dem from criticizing nominee #BlockSessions
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS Reps are using their power to continue embarrassing de Democratic voice of the People!sad
Yet, silence about Holder and Lynch?
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS you all couldn't care less about the United States of America. SHAME ON YOU ALL
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS you senators are ridiculous. all you want to do is block anything to do with President
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS@dacullington.Btw,McConnell was way out of line for silencing Sen.Warren!She should fight!
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS@SenWarren@dacullington.Sessions was 1st to support DT.He's a puppet who'll support Trump!
Stand your ground.
your stance is important. President w/o majority vote, supported by people who hate America, must be resisted.  @SenSchumer
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS I do.

@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS I agree with you; how to prevent another Betsy Devos tragedy?
No one does.
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS Standard line from the left.They've said it about every Trump appointee #obstructionists
b/c his picks are inappropriate, unqualified, have conflicts of interest, etc
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS All sound and fury signifying nothing. Trump won. You lost. Sessions will be AG.
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions meanwhile effigies of @POTUS are being burned in England, one of our most loyal allies.
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS he'll be trump's lapdog and Yes man.

@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS I do. Whim away, Trump. Unlike the Democrats, just keep it legal.
@SenSchumer @SenatorSessions @POTUS too bad he's already getting confirmed
thank you Maggie.  The American people agree
thank you!

Most of us feel that way. As a minority I feel he is a disaster. No one cares for us.
Ohhhh, Just like when Lynch gave a pass to Killary???
Is that yours concern?
Please vote AGAINST Sessions for AG.  THAT is what we want you yo do.
