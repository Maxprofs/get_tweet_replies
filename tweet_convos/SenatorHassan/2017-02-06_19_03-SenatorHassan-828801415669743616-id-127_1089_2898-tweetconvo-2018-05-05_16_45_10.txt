@SenateDems #BetsyDeVos will be Outstanding as #SecretaryOfEducation. She needs to be confirmed!
Just wondering what you based your opinion on? Is there evidence of her success you could point me to?
#DeVoss champions #charterschools; infuse competition into education; uproot bad public schools.
What metrics will she use to determine which schools are bad? Do you mean schools should have competition like they are businesses?
To boot it is very simple to let consumers (parents/students) decide...just give them the choice...are you afraid of that?
No, I'm afraid of my tax dollars being used to bankroll for profit schools. A school is not a business. And it's "metrics"...
Catholic schools are for profit? Nope. Charter schools? Nope
Here's some actual evidence from a credible source.
@sueludad Many thanks for your strong commitment to listen to your constituents. #noDevos
Except she's listening to the unions who fund her campaigns, NOT people of NH - as usual.
#nhpolitics
She has been listening to me.
You live in NH?
thank you Sen Hassan! My kids go 2 school in NH, private but benefit from a strong local public system!
I don't live in NH (local Mass public schools are not as good!)
You live in MA but send your kids to private schools in NH?  You're exactly the problem/reason Y Hassan's the problem she is for us
does not compute.
@SenateDems proud of our democrats tonight!
Stay strong, Senator Hassan! #holdthefloor
@SenateDems so you can go to Saudi Arabia or Venezuela!!! Crazy communists!!!
If you think Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are communist, and you vote, you just demonstrated why public education is necessary.
@BetsyDeVos will save our education system!!!
I'm just glad I escaped and live in a country that values and funds publuc education. (and outperforms usa)
i guess Saudi Arabia
apparently you dont know how to use twitter.... but byeeeeeee
I agree that DeVos is a totally inappropriate choice for Secretary of Education. THANK YOU for voting "No", Senator!
Under the Dems our students are illiterate , that most . Technology has taught not to use their brain to reason.
You should really take a good look at your self when you speak. You look like a chicken pecking at food.
ty ma'am
Thanks for your strong stand, Senator.
Thank you! You're awesome! Great work.
you mean she doesn't value corrupt teachers unions that Democrats depend on.
thank you for doing all you could do
sad times for US children. So many ppl are fooled.
She doesn't value it as much as you value teachers unions money.
@SenateDems Thank you Sen Hassan. Thank you for trying.
Thank you for fighting for our children's rights!
.@SenatorHassan Thank you for voting #NoToDeVos on behalf of all who want to  OUR protect public schools! .@Network4pubEd
keep going strong.
Maggie Fights 4 the Teacher Unions while US Students are Last in Science & Math thanks to 8 yrs ofOBAMA'S Sec ED!
Thank you for supporting our children.
@luisacva thx for fighting for Am education!
@SenateDems Dems only care abt preservation of an adults teachers union. You should be on the kids side. Confirm Betsy DeVos
Look at the public school system,wake up and stop the politics.It's about the children,not unions,political careers,or donors
Agreed. Anyone this rich has no clue what public education even means.
@Italians4Trump Good grief, Dems are still yapping on & on; get over it DeVos is in.  What next more trashing of Tom Brady?
Teachers Union trembling. Losing their paycheck. Losing strangle-hold. Betsy is giving #OPTIONS #FREEDOMofChoice
Thank you #ShowMeTrumpsTaxes #RussiaIsRulingUSA #ImpeachTrump
@SenateDems You have screwed up the US education process over the past 50 years.  Its time for some new ideas - yours suck.
thank you!
One of best floor speeches ever @SenatorHassan
feel better now? Get that out of your system?
thank you, Maggie! Stand strong and vote NO
Education needs to be controlled by the parents, states & the schools.  Get the FEDS out of education.

if you care about children's education you wouldn't have backed Hillary Clinton the crook
@SenateDems  u guys lost prez, house, senate, cross your fingers and hope Ruth doesn't kick the bucket any time soon! Lol.
A 100% increase in spending since 1970 has resulted in a 0% increase in test scores. 
Yay.
@SenateDems Thank you for putting our children first! #NoonDeVos #holdthefloor #resist

@SenateDems public education sucks and it has only gotten worse last 8 years, you Dems suck
@SenateDems Your efforts are appreciated!  Keep going!
thank you for sharing your moving story and speaking up for others.
@SenateDems another lie.
@SenateDems devos brings fear to the liberals because she takes control and power from the government & give it to parents
How much more $$$ do WE need 2throw away2get same lousy outcome?Now they want 2do away w/cursive!
I'm glad states are doing with uncommon core.
THANK YOU SEN H!  KEEP GOING!!  We support you! From Portsmouth!
YES!#holdthefloor
imagine how awful she would be if her husband had mishandled sexual misconduct allegations!!! @gop @TheDemocrats
Then, shouldn't the Democrats have fielded a candidate who had a chance to beat Trump?  It's a little late to complain now.
Thousands? There is 300+ million people in this country.

Send her through, Senator.
@SenateDems thank you for standing up. Millions are behind you and ready to do whatever it takes. Be our voice.
Have liberals experienced Pub Ed lately?My son is Senior-It's infuriating 2 see how dumbed down curriculum has become,even AP
@SenateDems  thank you!! #HoldTheFloor
@SenateDems your opinion and you are dead wrong.
Having $$$ you think would open doors but this Billionaire Betty plans on slamming them shut to our valued educational reward
Thank you for standing up for the children who cannot speak up for themselves.
Thanks, Sen. Maggie. Millions of SpeEd parents agree with you. Keep standing strong. We stand with you.
@SenateDems Democrats are in bed with the Teachers Union and always have been. Vouchers gets kids out of failed schools!
@SenateDems  GO DEMS!! SMASH HER LIKE THE DIRTY LITTLE BUG SHE IS!!!
Thank you. I am so glad I donated, donated and donated to your campaign!
worry about students and parents....not unions
@SenateDems Concern yourselves with education instead of brainwashing our kids with Social Justice Garbage You have failed us
I don't care how rich you are THAT DOES NOT MAKE YOU  SMART!! If your stupid - your just plain stupid. DeVos $$$ closes doors
#DeVos Teacher's union 'values public education', students deserve better!!
@SenateDems Never attended one, never taught in one but worked to weaken them. Check out her effect on MI schools.#StopDeVos
@SenateDems Also No on Sessions when he comes up. No on both.
The  teachers union doesn't either! In fact, even FDR had a thing or two to say about public sector unions.

@SenateDems Thank you!!!
@SenateDems too bad most senators don't care because rich kids go to private school
@SenateDems thank you. We are up tonight with you. America is behind you. #DumpDevos
Thank you  #holdthefloor  #noDevos
@SenateDems who would value one of the worst education systems in the world that spends the most money? Are u serious? 
@SenateDems thank you Senator for opposing the DeVos nomination
thank you!!!!
Thank you for your advocating on behalf of me and my students. 29yr-veteran teacher who knows she is unqualified.
You make me hopeful for my family's future in Maine! Thank you!
But you support public unions and teachers unions. Ever heard about right to work? Any family ties to education unions?
Thanks  to all our Senators that are standing up all night defending our children &their #education -we need more heroes!
Common Core Suxs. And thats what you did to NH public education.
