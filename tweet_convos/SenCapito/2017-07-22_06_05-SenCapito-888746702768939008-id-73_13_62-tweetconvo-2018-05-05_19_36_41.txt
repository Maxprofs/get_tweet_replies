Mr. Gracy: If Senator Capito votes Yes on Trumpcare, your employees will receive horrible health insurance. Or none.
We need a full repeal not replace
Why won't you vote Yes to a Clean Repeal of Obamacare! You talk the talk but don't walk the walk! Obamacare is destroying the Middle Class!
For Love of God! Please repeal Obamacare. Why has the middle class been abandoned?
Straight repeal= 32 million lose coverage
Current Trumpcare= 22 million lose coverage, 15 million alone next yr
per CBO
But you will because as much as you hate ACA, Trumpcare would be worse. Not only will millions more lose coverage, but the economic impact
Of closing rural hospitals would leave $900 million in healthcare industry damages per Gov Jim Justice
And Trumpcare bring back lifetime caps and cuts in EHBs- that would financially drain you if something were to happen
Lifetime caps? Really! Stop trying to push your anti-trump propaganda on us.
Just read this or not. I'm no longer willing to explain to someone how horrible this bill is if that's their mindset
Speaking of great decisions, how do you feel about $13,000 deductibles for some of your most vulnerable constituents, per the new CBO score?
That's why it needs repealed
REpeal Obamacare now!
#PutinBot
Will @BullyTools employees appreciate a senator blindly voting to proceed on a bill which could endanger or kill millions? Time will tell.
How can @GOP support any Medicaid cuts when the Sociopath Trump said over and over again on the campaign trail "no Medicaid cuts!  Liars!
We had Medicare before communist medicine was passed. We had cheaper insurance and everyone could get care. Time to completely repeal
Did the pastor who visited you and shared daughter's cancer story mean nothing to you?  #repairdontrepeal
Modern medicine cannot cure cancer! You have 2 choices chemo, or radiation, and either one kills you faster. That's not an excuse to keep it
Would u like to dm me ur phone number so you can tell my 5 year old that his mom should just die faster rather than see him go to 1st grade?
Don't trust her!!  She lies!!  She is another phony politician.  Come to WI instead.  Aside from the Democrats, our politicians have honor.

Capito, Heller, & others used to invoke needing to wait for a CBO score to justify wavering. Now going along with lack of a score—OR a bill. https://twitter.com/sangerkatz/status/889585434627645440 …
Will the people he hires have healthcare?  Will any of us?

5- in West Virginia, @SenCapito, do you really think someone makin$25k wants to pay 4x what they pay today? How is that good? 
She's so popular 53 likes lol
Let's let @BullyTools know what happens when they support these types of senators that support killing millions !!
If you cant stand up to protect the most vulnerable in WV then you have no business calling yourself a United Stated Senator! @GOP #BCRA
Vote no on this atrocious bill. History will judge you appropriately.
What tax breaks promised, I hope there is a clause that they must provide jobs promised and stay X amount of years or tax breaks due back.
Please vote to repeal Obamacare! Please!
Good you can use one of his shovels to dig through Trumps bullshit.
You've research networks w/leading partners, proximity to grow in #WestVirginia. But not if poverty ↑ for healthcare
Do the right thing on heahthcare please. Too many people will be affected. Please do the right thing. Work to improve the ACA with the Dems
Inbox: AARP letter to senators, warning that they’ll tell their 38 million members about every GOP vote on repeal.



Trump's latest approval ratings could jeopardize his entire presidency http://bit.ly/2vsNONl  

71% of the public favor a bipartisan effort to improve the ACA, instead of GOP continuing repeal efforts @DrewAltman http://kaiserf.am/2vtqCOQ 
We need factory jobs in the central part of the state. Panhandle locations only help the already well off. Sen. Capito, help the center.
WV seniors R hanging by a thread. Stand strong for yr 50+ citizens. #NoAgeTax #SaveOurMedicaid. Tell Sen Capito #VoteNo on MTP 304-347-5372.
This is how democracy dies.
8- There are rumors about virtually every R Senator being lured to vote yes on MTP.

Do not be comforted by statements until the vote.
