Don't become a chicken and let @realDonaldTrump bully you. You know what's the best for WV.
Lots of self serving tweets to pretend your working for WVians while you screw the on HC. Get serious, get some courage
She's a fraud
#ProtectOurCare  #SaveACA

Remember saying this? 
I once heard someone say on the tv 
"I didn't come to Washington to hurt people"
Joe is gone you want to be next vote repeal
We need you to protect the ACA....don't give in!!
You are NOT listening to your constituents. Stop normalizing DJT and stand up for WV.
You promised not to hurt people, @SenCapito, but voted for BCRA, would cut care from thousands of West Virginians. #VoteNO on final bill.
The skinny on "skinny repeal" is that it screws us just as much as other  GOP plans.  DON'T SELL US OUT for an inadequate concession.
Great, but who cares. Start touting your achievements when you show courage to oppose the healthcare bill. You've lost my respect.
#voteoutcapito
That's nice but voting to keep Americas on their healthcare and fixing ACA for others would be a better step
Pence didn't save Trumpcare; @SenCapito did. @SenCapito's change of vote made the difference. And West Virginians will suffer. WEAK!!
You sold us out with our health. Don't try to pretend you care about our personal welfare, you are unbelievably now
No cuts to coverage, no premium increases. Medicaid for all, sliding scale. The only acceptable vote is NO. Stand up for healthcare.
You say you won't hurt us. Then you vote to hurt us. And then you go dark??? Unacceptable. At least have the guts to tell us why.
Your repeal and replacement will occur in 2018
Trying to distract from the healthcare vote??

"I did not come to Washington to hurt people" - Sen. Capito  

Did you come to Washington to kill people instead?  VOTE NO!
It was a moronic move 2 vote against WV yesterday, where is the empathy for the people in WV? Following trump & mitch is political suicide.
Vote no on repeal with no replacement  like you promised you would
She's a flat out liar. What a disgrace.
I am so disappointed that you opened this crap storm against the WV citizens. We are watching.
While we pay health care that is more than our house Payment because of cowards like you
Primary out Capito for her defection on repealing Obamacare.  Let's start finding someone else now.
Sen Repubs acting recklessly, dangerously, irresponsibly with healthcare. Enablers will be held accountable. WV expects you to vote NO!
Healthcare Sellout!
I no longer believe anything you tweet or say. It seems you did "go to Washington to hurt people!" Go and vote NO on Trumpcare!
I'm sorry, did you say something, Liar?
McConnell has taken out the $ promised to Shelley for Opioid addict because knows she will vote yes anyway. Watch.
Opioid funding Capito+Portman negotiated reportedly out of Skinny; they presumably know won't cost them C+P's votes. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/27/obamacare-repeal-republicans-status-241025 … 
You better get behind Trump or be replaced
I would LOVE to hear you explain why you voted for BCRA after months of promising us you would defend Medicaid.  You are a fraud.
Your tweets don't change that you are a liar and hypocrite.
SHAME on you.
You need to fire the Maw Maw in your Charleston office. Very rude to your constituents...not that you would care.
You lied yesterday. Big sellout for big donors
you didn't stand up for WV yesterday. Heart breaking.
If you vote for this repeal, it doesn't matter what else you try to do. There is no forgiveness. Dead people don't care about transportation
My nephew called your office to express concern about his healthcare/your vote and was told "good grief" by a very rude woman! 3043475372
The Charleston staffers are particularly bad
She was extremely rude. So unprofessional.
Last night you showed all of us EXACTLY how much your promises are worth.  Shameful.
Noting you do will erase yesterday's vote.  Your name is all over Trumpcare.  You own it. Congrats. Have a great day.
This worthless hack voted yes on Trumpcare last night. That tells you all you need to know on her failing political career.
Who cares. You are taking away health coverage from millions!
BS

You're not fooling anyone. We remember your betrayal. #KeepKidsCovered

Forgive me for saying this, but I am so angry Taking bribes and betrayal must be a family trait!  Shame!
Delete your career, sellout. #ZeroIntegrity
Don't think this is going to detract from your betrayal of your constituents &state, senators. When Trumpcare is passed, shame on you!
She voted YES last night! Shame!
Senate *rejects* Obamacare replacement plan (BCRA w/ Cruz amndt) 

9 GOP NOs…
She voted YES last night!
No mam. You don't get to pretend like you didn't vote to take away our healthcare. We will never forget and we want our town hall!
You are so uninformed

.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
Please invest in wind, solar and Geothermal. We have the capability to go clean.
Announced that you can be bought & intimidated by a president who doesn't give a damn about folks in WV. Or about you. Ask JeffSesh.
You tried to fool us w/your proclamation that you would be the 1 to KillTheBill. U caved in the biggest, worse way.

Talk is cheap.
Real people will be devastated by your capitulation.
The Bill didn't pass anyway, I hope selling your soul to that scumbag in the WH was worth it

What about your promise and responsibility to the West Virginians that will lose their healthcare and die as a result of your repeal vote?
Yeah THIS is what you should be focusing on. Going to be fun plotting your demise in 2018 #aca
What about some grants for Healthcare for Wvs u love so much @davidclark1965
protecting WV'ans is important. So protect Medicaid and Thebpost-ACA marketplace
What you did to West Virginia yesterday puts me in mind of what your dad did when he was governor here. Despicable.
Im glad that someone said it. They both sold us out.
Did you do that before or after you voted to kick West Virginians out of Medicaid?
Why should anyone believe anything that comes out of your lying mouth ever again?
Yeah, the kids with Spina Bifida, Down Syndrome and folks who can't afford meds will be real excited to hear that bit of fluff.
Remember you lied to us yesterday. Did Congress by stock in graveyards across the country?
You should spend the day reflecting on why you came to Washington. You said it wasn't to hurt people. You did.
I don't know if you sold your soul Mitch or donors, but I'm sure you got a very good price.
2018 can not come soon enough!

The DEP just shut down the WV pipeline project. Now you announce more money from gvt for pipeline "safety", & will allow them to proceed...
Shame you chose the dark side along with your colleagues. Depriving people of life saving treatment because you hate them is deplorable.
@SenCapito 218,000 West Virginians will immediately lose their healthcare due to your vote. YOU are not living up to your word!
She came to *kill* people.

Repeal healthcare
I hope you won't be a party to throwing millions off their health insurance. I trust you'll do the right thing, ultimately.
Why do you trust that?
Do you even pretend to listen to your constituents? #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #SinglePayer
Police Chief of Star City, WV (pop: ~2,000): Programs to fight the opioid addiction depend on Medicaid. Cuts would mean less help. 
Simply awful https://twitter.com/senatedems/status/885533596676763649 …

Police Chief Probst (Star City): Medicaid cuts will force West Virginians to wait for opioid treatment. “That’s not going to help anybody” 
You're a disappointment https://twitter.com/aslavitt/status/889189034446254081 …

5- in West Virginia, @SenCapito, do you really think someone makin$25k wants to pay 4x what they pay today? How is that good? 
Sure, try to distract from your vote to proceed on a mystery bill that NO ONE HAS SEEN. You do a disservice to those you represent.
She also voted for the BCRA, cutting $700B from Medicaid.  Shameful.
Wow. The bald hypocrisy is truly appalling. Medicaid expansion has been crucial to ppl in WV. @SenCapito, you are failing to represent.
Fix #ACA
Why did you vote Yes?  1000's of WV citizens depend on Medicaid.  TRUMPCARE DECIMATES it by 800 billion over 10 years.
Acting like yesterday didn't happen? It happened. U voted last night to take away HC. JUST B/c it didn't pass does NOT mean we will forget!
i can only guess your position about Transgendered people serving in the Military. Care to clear it up?
