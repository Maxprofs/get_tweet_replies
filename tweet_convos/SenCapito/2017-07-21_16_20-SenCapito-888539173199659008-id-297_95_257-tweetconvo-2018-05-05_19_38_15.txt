Please be sure to stop up the road in Minden, WV & show him what lax environmental regs and no health care can do to a community.

Maybe stop in for a cool refreshing drink of water? http://wvmetronews.com/2017/07/21/fayette-county-water-outage-affecting-thousands/ …
Or pop by Oxana, I mean Oceana...
Haha  PAST DECADE! That's Obama's era of failed economy & our state can answer to its water cleanliness. Opioids r huge problem everywhere
Thanks for stopping by to contribute nothing to the conversation...
Awe Great rebuttal! You sound like every other uneducated Dem in our state. No answer? Didn't think so! This is why #WV went #RED 2014
Not a dem. And happy to discuss any old thing. With grown ups.
Great idea.  He's such a fantastic role model for these boys.
My daughter is at the Jamboree, which I thought was a friendly learning experience. Maybe not, if he's going...
All we can hope is that he doesn't have a speaking role
True. The Jamboree is for THE KIDS. Politics shouldn't overwhelm the wonder of the experience. @potus @realDonaldTrump @boyscouts
So just curious - what did your daughter have to say about @POTUS and his speech?
Cringeworthy.
Definitely.  There's an article floating around about the 17 most jaw dropping comments from the speech.  17!!  Unreal.

Wasn't that something to behold? You witnessed the Kick off of the Trump Nazi-Youth Brigade, and yet you still voted yes today? SAD
I’m an Eagle Scout. But I’m glad my son wasn’t at Trump’s Boy Scout speech. http://wapo.st/2uWzdvx?tid=ss_tw-amp … @boyscouts
You mean to brain wash them. How many boy scout oaths did he break in that speech?? Heil PO(tu)S!! New brown shirts!!

14 Most Inappropriate Moments from Trump’s Boy Scout Speech http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/inappropriate-moments-trump-boy-scout-speech.html?utm_source=tw&utm_medium=s3&utm_campaign=sharebutton-t … via @intelligencer
So @SenCapito was cheering and clapping for Trump's demoralizing and degrading BoyScout riot? Then votes to take away their healthcare!
Yeah that was a great #BoyscoutJamboree you should be so proud to see all of those boys learning early how to be a disgusting person
How much is the Putin lover paying you to disregard your constituents?
Stay strong Senator, don't let the POTUS intimidate you.
So Senator, were you laughing, cheering at that appalling "speech" yesterday? If you support this embarrassment, you're going down.

Yeah did you like that sex story he told the kids omg laughed so hard I spit
That was disappointing.  I object to my son being used as a political prop to encourage the country to throw away healthcare for millions.
I live in west Virginia and I'm so glad my boy was out of the scouts for that hot mess. Was that the trade?
Joined the Trump's Hitler Youth rally. Hope you enjoyed your few hours of hate.
Tell him to support medicare for all...
No!
You are outvoted. Join the rest of the modern world now... as a healthcare provider... Healthcare is a right!
How"proud" you must have been to witness that crass,beyond                 in appropriate "speech" to Boy Scouts. Ugh.
I hope you were just as horrified by Trump's speech to the Scouts. He said nothing that would inspire any of these boys to be a good leader
I hope you felt embarrassment and fear when you heard the @realDonaldTrump diatribe. PLEASE VOTE NO TODAY. Your ppl r counting on u!!!!
Maybe U can explain 2 him why your not going 2 repeal Ocare! You said U were 4 repeal when BO was in office...what's your excuse?
you know 40% of the people on Medicaid are kids??? That's not very sweet or nice to sell them out for a taxcut to the 1% ..
So how'd this turn out?

He has a history of assault, blatant disrespect for women, Peeping Tom/contestants, attacking strong women, body shaming 
@SenCapito say no! https://twitter.com/TinaPirlot/status/888620776726966272 …
There will be females in the audience there. PLEASE speak respectfully. And NO POLITICS, just leadership. Celebrate the kids,  please.
After Trump Injects Politics Into Speech, Boy Scouts Face Blowback https://nyti.ms/2tWF6Vn  @boyscouts
The 17 most jaw-dropping moments of Donald Trump’s speech to Boy Scouts
PLEASE DO NOT DISCUSS POLITICS AT THE JAMBOREE. Celebrate THE KIDS, not adults or policies. @2017Jambo
Trump’s Boy Scout address was another opportunity to show himself as demagogic, non-inclusive, dishonest, and crude:
After the event, are you still glad he came?
Good. Maybe he can look into the eyes of the generation he's screwing out of healthy parents and explain to them why.
Terrible idea, Senator. RT @SenCapito Excited to welcome @POTUS to the Mountain State Monday. Will join him at the Boy Scout Jamboree ...
Parents railed against the Boys Scouts of America after Trump's campaign-style speech http://read.bi/2tVbjN6  via @bi_politics
Total DISGUST that I watched the POTUS @ the B.S. Jamboree today, as you stood by. PLEASE don't fall for his"repeal and kill"  bill.
What potus did was beyond disgusting at the jamboree, he shouldn't be welcome back and someone owes America an apology for politicizing this
please think of your constituents and vote no!
He embarrassed U, @realDonaldTrump is an embarrassment to Americans.  Speak up, the man is #Unfit for @POTUS
Disgusting and embarrassing to face these young people. Shame on you Sen. Capito for subjecting them to this freak show & poor role model.
Don't let him bully you. Vote no on Trump Care.  People over party.  Do what's right for WV
Maybe, you should have stopped him from making his speech.  It has disgraced the BSoA, it's too late to disgrace himself This was deplorable
If you aren't completely embarrassed by Trumps performance, then you have either sold out or aren't paying attention.
fantastic speech in front of the scouts and a nice sound of support from the scouts
please make sure you tell him you're voting no on the healthcare bill
I hope you will NOT stand for being BULLIED by him!
What could POTUS have possibly given you to get you to change your vote?
How can you as a female leader, who was excluded from the boys club crafting this horrible bill, invite  this POTUS 2speak 2male children?
Please ask him how he'll make up the $3.4 billion health care spending cut to WV? 200,000 WV'ians are interested.
ANALYSIS: West Virginia would have to make up $3.4 billion in lost federal Medicaid funds from 2020-26 under #BCRA http://kaiserf.am/2tDB5dn  
It's very exciting that he coming!
I don't think @realDonaldTrump is a good example to hold up to the young men in the Boy Scouts.
What did he offer you to sell your soul? Money? Power?
Excited? You should be disgusted. Shows your lack of moral courage & backbone.
Support Potus
Escorting an admitted sexual predator into a sea of children.  Way to be an enabler.
Withhold funds for sanctuary cities.  Create national voter registration policy that includes a photo ID.  W/it, wouldn't B in Russian hoax.
POTUS voter base grows daily, Republicans R going 2 have 2 step up their own game 2 keep up.  Many were elected on his coat tails.  React!
Republicans have a strong leader, but you R weak next to the Dems. You must B as vicious about your defense of POTUS, as they are against.
Maybe you can see Russia from the Jamboree #SeekTruth #NoRepeal


Maybe don't let him near the kids.
He's really excited to come visit U in W. Virginina. 

Introduce him 2 the many W. Virgininans who will lose coverage now that you've caved.
The orange king visited your State & you sold out the ppl of WVA

5- in West Virginia, @SenCapito, do you really think someone makin$25k wants to pay 4x what they pay today? How is that good? 
Please ron't vote yes on the repeal of ACA. People will suffer, many will die and/or go bankrupt.
Please vote NO on healthcare bill! It will harm so many!!
Remember he is wooing you for your vote .. do not betray your WV citizens and the US citizens for a traitor.
Why is his Sec of Ed imposing sanctions on WV public colleges & universities? Tell him WVians won't be bullied! #Resist
Is he coming to sweet talk you into voting for his awful healthcare plan?
So like is there any way for me to see the speech please??
He'll visit the Boy Scout Jamboree but won't talk to the @NAACP, who invited him to the conference in January? #NextRally #NoSubstance
Sad
That's a good idea those kids can see what a true leader and role model is like. They see the man who swindled students for $36,000 each.
You are excited to see a misogynistic, lying, tax evading, draft dodging, ego maniac?
REPEAL!
welcome him 4 all of us & tell him u will keep your promise, do your job, and vote to repeal obama care. Proud to call Mr Trump My President
Don't let him bully you. Spicer is an example. He took it for 6 months and then said "No more. I have my pride"  Will you?
Tell him how in 2015 6.5 million people were forced to pay IRS $3 billion for no healthcare. Repeal Nomobama care!

I think he is only visiting WV in order to bully you about the health care bill. The boy scouts should strike a ring of defense around you.
Tell him you will not be voting for the Senate Trumpcare bill! Protect the citizens of WV, not your potus or party.
Please don't fall for this. Trump doesn't (and won't ever) care about West Virginia...and the thousands of ppl who need healthcare. VOTE NO!
Hope you will get him to read the Boy Scout Oath.  "To help other people at all times" seems to be a problem for him now. #VoteNoBCRA
Having grown with the Donald in the news in Jersey during the 70s he is nothing more than a lying used car salesman. Birds of a feather?
That's great , now keep your promises to support our president

Shelley, Please don't let Trump bribe u or blackmail u into hurting older Americans.
We see right through him. Don't be a doormat.
I think our children need to be fed, healthy, and educated in order to be leaders. You know, the kind of thing Trump is eliminating.
Don't let him bully No means No
This is a huge event!
Wow! Really? You are excited to see a Man that Good parents point out to their kids "Don't Act like him!!!"
My sentiment exactly. She is in his pocket like a good little puppet. I choose to replace her asap. Manchin too.
How many of those scouts' families on #Medicaid?
No current healthcare bill is good for your consituents or the US. Please vote no
Dramamine is an excellent anti nausea med.
Pls remind him that he promised to #ProtectOurCare not demolish it. Pls stand firm!  #VoteNoBCRA
Vote NO!! Don't let trump intimidate
We hope and pray that you will protect the nearly 200,000 West Virginian's healthcare by voting NO on these killer healthcare bills
Don't let him bully you on your stance on repealing the ACA. It would be disastrous for West Virginians.
The simple idea that there are whispers of you being for repeal is beyond shocking. You do not understand the state that you serve at all.
Shame on you if you sell out the aging population, the I/DD communities and disabled that benefit from Medicaid and ACA for a kickback!
He will lie to you about Medicare and how it effects citizens of West Virginia http://www.wvgazettemail.com/gazette-op-ed-commentaries/20170304/craig-robinson-more-realizing-health-economy-would-hurt-in-aca-repeal …
And the cuts will hit West Virginia hardest
Hopefully he doesn't buy your vote for the repeal bill while you are celebrating. #NoRepeal
Touring nursing homes? If you vote YES on repeal good opportunity to tell the elderly they need to pack and the staff to find a new job.
#SaveMedicaid #VoteNoOnMTP #SaveOurCare #BCRA #NoCutsNoCaps
You know dang well trumps on the wrong side of the fence, are you really going to let him make things Harder for WV and the country? VOTE NO

#WestVirginia ns, keep those calls up! 
32 million will lose healthcare & you are fine with people begging YOU for THEIR lives; good luck explaining to God

saying people can be moved from Medicaid to Cruz plans without harm. Via @WSJ: 
trump is on the wrong side of History. You say you don't want to harm people.trump doesn't care about average folks. VOTE NO ON trumpCare

Trump's latest approval ratings could jeopardize his entire presidency http://bit.ly/2vsNONl  
He wants to strip healthcare from many of your constituents. The fact you "welcome" that is pure insanity.
He's only coming to get your vote. Don't You Do It. Put Your Country Before Your Party. You Know What It Will Do. HISTORY IS WATCHING
You need to cut ties with this traitor or you'll go down with him.  WV is pissed at you
How many new coal jobs have been added in 2017?
He will threaten you re repeal
Tell him instead that you feel for what his family is going through
Conservative AMA:
The AMA calls on the #Senate to reject efforts to repeal and replace #ACA, and work instead towards improvements. http://spr.ly/60128s6QQ  
Pls remind POTUS that we are more than coal and panhandles -- factories in center state went overseas and we need those JOBS back.

https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2017-05-23/manchin-warns-about-trump-administration-budget-cuts?src=usn_tw …
So you're going to let him woo you into that yes?
Sure. Vote yes to start debate on repeal, they vote yes to repeal ACA period.
Hi SenCapito, I descend from the "Moore" DNA. Anyway, will congress defend our constitution & institutions from POTUS & FAMILY?I smell a RAT
Remember your pledge: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFIM19FXsAA47rt.jpg …
Hi Sencapito, my mother & ten of her siblings & eleven double 1st cousins were all born as "Moore" in SE Virginia & NE North Carolina.
His days are numbered. You can safely ignore his bullying, bribes and brainwashing

On my honor, I will do my best . . . To help other people at all times . . ." #MedicareForAll
He's a great example to the scouts of everything the Boy Scout honor code says NOT to be.
He is not a leader. He is a bully. Keep him away from children.
a good in person opportunity to let him know why NO on healthcare #ProtectOurCare
@sencapito Don't let yourself look weak.  Stand up for WV -- esp those in need of medical care.
Gross.
Better not cave on trumpcare. Millions will lose coverage. Can you really do that to neediest?!#voteno @SenCapito
Excited to welcome @POTUS to the Mountain State Monday. Will join him at the Boy Scout Jamboree to celebrate our country’s future leaders.
Does this mean you are trading your state's healthcare so you can schmooze with toddler pres?
Super! Hope needs of WV outweigh pol pressure to reduce healthcare coverage- as a WV surgeon argues in this vid:
What the fuck is wrong with you?
How could you possibly think it's a good idea for a President who is on the verge of dire legal troubles to have a chat with the boy scouts?
Stay strong and #VoteNo #SaveOurCare
Awful Trumpcare would hurt kids w/ disabilities. Here's how it'd cut Medicaid from schools here in VA: http://bluevirginia.us/2017/06/sen-kaine-releases-report-medicaid-cuts-harm-virginia-public-schools …
Vote no on the hc bill! Don't let your vote be bought.
Your constituents wanted repeal of ACA until they realized that they would lose coverage.This is why you should go against campaign promise
When voters become informed, many times minds are changed. This is is perfect example of that. Only 12-17% want repeal now.listen to us!
You let him near children??? Not my child! He's the creepy uncle who looks at your chest while commenting on how much you've grown. Nope.
I wouldn't let my kids anywhere near that guy - he's a sick guy.   But, I guess Shelley is a YES on repeal now!!  Easily bought!   Sad!
@sencapito please stay strong and consider 24 million uninsured-you said you didn't come to wash to hurt ppl. This WOULD. Vote NO.
Tell him that he promised NOT to destroy #Medicaid for the #disabled community. Fix insurance but don't run what is working for your peeps
Double talking Capito       
Excited?? Why? Shame on you!! You're letting him bully you! We DO NOT WANT HIM HERE! Him or the damn deathcare bill. NO!! #Resist

Please see that these children are real people livingthis nightmare.
Repeal&Delay won't work. Had 7 yrs and couldn't come up with viable replacement, 2 more yrs won't do it either.It's time to #fixaca for all
Stay strong. Remember that you didn't go to Washington to hurt people. We can't afford to lose our healthcare.
We are real people out here, not just numbers in paper. CBO score says it all, #repeal will hurt tens of millions of us. Children the most.
The small pittance he will offer you for your vote will not cover the people who will lose their healthcare. Please think of the real people
Please don't sell your soul to the devil!  My child is counting on you to vote NO to any repeal of ACA. He is disabled and needs #Medicaid
uugh i wish he never set foot in this state.
Just vote no on his #trumpcare

Schumer doubles down on his earlier calls for a bipartisan health care plan 
 

I worked w/ Pres Obama to roll back part of Obamacare that was harming vets & now I hope Dems will to the same. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3oKgKEAIDw&feature=youtu.be …
Please stand firm for your state.
Praying for your safety @SenCapito

All these liberals crying on here! You were elected to help fix the failing Obamacare ! Do your damn job!  How's YOUR healthcare? Free?
Country before party...stop normalizing @realDonaldTrump .
He's too weak to discuss things that concern the Mountaineer- losing health care, poverty&drugs. He needs to be met with #resisters #Impeach
The only time I'll be happy to see that incompetent, corrupt traitor is when he's hauled away in cuffs and leg irons.
Please tell me you didn't cave to this horrible health care bill??? 
We know you're obligated to greet him w/a smile, but we've seen all too clearly what a snake oil conman he is.
Don't you let him sucker WV!
That's going to be so COOL @POTUS Trump at a Boy Scout Jamboree! Have fun #MAGA 
Read the news sometime. Probably not the guy you want affiliated with. Think re-election :)
@potus is the worst role model possible!! Putting him in from of boy scouts is irresponsible and disgusting! Says "ok to grab, he does."
Are you going to have him tour pediatric hospitals? So you can tell children you're taking away their hope to live? OR WILL YOU VOTE NO!
I wouldn't let #45 near #BoyScouts.He's a liar,3x adulterer,4x bankrupt,unathletic guy;opposite of BoyScout values.Famous but not virtuous!
Glad to see the men of your family proudly serving so virtuously

BOT!
Make sure to stay out of reach. I hear his handshakes aren't normal.
You voted against repeal. R u a Dem. They created ACA. You upheld. You're out next election. We voted Trump. Did you?
Sure you want to be on Trump's side?
So are they going to practice bashing news media and sexual assault? What a joke. This guys needs impeached in a hurry.
Americans demand @HouseGOP @SenateGOP get off your ass! Make our damn country, citizens you serve a priority over @GOP! #ImpeachTrump NOW!
Will there be a public speech?
I bet the people below making comments to go against @Potus didn't vote for either of you

Maybe you should start supporting his agenda from one WV to another!
When you look at the 40,000 faces  in that crowd, you should tell Trump that 4 times that many WVians will lose insurance with his plan.
