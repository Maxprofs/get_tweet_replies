This tragedy was domestic terrorism & should be treated as such. It is incumbent upon all of us to reject this type of racism & bigotry.
What do you have to say about Trump's comments? Do you have the guts to denounce them and the man that spewed them?People of WV are watching
Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but @POTUS defended Nazis today. Is that too far for you yet?
How did he defend the Nazis? BLM, Antifa and hate groups are ALL to blame for the riots.

So why is @POTUS not denouncing them?
Why is the left NOT denouncing the hateful, violent & racists groups BLM and Antifa? Trump has been denouncing white supremacy for 20 hrs.
Born & bred by the GOP
What about the violence perpetrated by BLM and Antifa? They had flame throwers, were throwing urine and feces. Why aren't U condoning them?
So, is it okay for the @realDonaldTrump to call them 'very fine people'? I think not. #IMPEACH
Will you denounce Trump for defending those Nazis?
How about the hate on the other side?  Just as condemnable.
Agreed. Where is your condemnation of other hate groups perpetrating violence across America, like Antifa? #Crickets #HateIsHate #Duplicity
For real. It's a punch to the gut for West Virginia's 70% that voted for Trump. What's a 6 letter word for left wing hate group senator?
About time. Let's see if you can show some spine now.
Taking down war heroes,America's great-great-grandfathers,no matter the side, for political reasons has no place in USA either.
#FreeSpeech
Empty words Senator. Too little - Too Late. You have blood on your hands. Your inability to stand up to potus CAUSED this. This is on You.
Ridiculous, Suzzane!!
Since @POTUS has declared as a Nazi supporter, words aren't enough. The GOP must lead to #impeachTrump
Neither does the hateful, anti-American Communism espoused by violent #Antifa. Both sides are equally EVIL & Authoritarian
#Communismkills
DJT just defended Nazis & the Klan. If you can't bring yourself to rebuke him 4 this, shame on you. You r no American.
Thank you. Now how about you put pressure on your leader to say the same?
Are you going to call out all the hate groups?
What about the hate and violence expressed by ANTIFA and other left wing extremists???  U R very one sided and biased in your tweet!!!
All those groups that are spewing hate. Nazis,Antifa,BLM,white supremacists. Frankly done with all the name calling from the left.
Why are you leaving out the other half of the violence The thugs from BLM and Antifa
You Republicans are cowards but wait your a fake
Why does it always take you so f*cking long to come out on anything? Do you feel you have to wait for permission by white men in the WH?
You really are a weak, weak, weak WOMAN. Let's go woman, take a stand on SOMETHING. Grow a spine. Show all woman what is possible!
Let us not ignore the radical left groups who also came armed with clubs and battle gear. BOTH sides had hate groups there! PC is everywhere
The specifics are where the principles are.
What are we putting on a pedestal, and what are we putting in a museum?
So you support removing remnants of confederacy form union supporting WV?
It is time for confederate monuments to be moved from public places of honor to cemeteries and museums.
No it doesn't! No hate should be tolerated. It is out of hand! Government Folks, Step up to the bat and DO something!
No comment about the far left antifa,  BLM  Hatemongers??
Funny how you don't say anything until after trump makes a "condemnation" speech.  
No place for Leftist Socialist violence either!!
What about BLM & ANTIFA!  Let's be fair Senator!
A little show on the response to this. I guess it wasn't clear to you which you should go on this.
Too little, too late. Your outrage should have been on day one like Graham, Ryan, & and Hatch. Now you are just following dear leader again.
I agree  They need to go away like you and your RINO friends @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain
I see you also received the public perception memo a couple days late: #Nazis and #WHITENATIONALISTS Bad.
Same goes with BLM and Antifa
Thank you for standing up and calling them out by name. For the first time ever as a WV GIRL I can say I'm proud of you
It's about time.  Was this so hard to write that you couldn't have done it after the events happened?  Did you need to wait for Trump?
What about Anti-fa Senator?
Thank you
You know the Virginia mayor set the stage for violence protesters and hate group equals fuel for the fire
How did he set the stage?
The mayor approved the hate group permit and they allowed other groups to protest without permits which fueled the fire
Standard canned politician response did u really hafta make a statement? I think NOT
Thank you for calling them what they really are. WV must speak out. Too many think this is how our wonderful state feels. No way!
@realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @foxandfriends @seanhannity @rushlimbaugh HATE AND VIOLENCE by KKK, BLM or ANY group is ILLEGAL. Bring2Just
I MUST,SAY I'M DISAPPOINTED,  AFTER YOUR VOTE ON REPEAL ACA, YOUR LEFTIST SUPPORT I CANNOT VOTE FOR YOU AGAIN  IF U SHOW ME WRONG I WILL
The stuff that happened two days ago? Oh. Thanks for chiming in.

I would have been happy with any criticism of Antifa. CNN still not satisfied w/ @realDonaldTrump denunciation of KKK. It will ever be enuf.
REALLY,  WHY AREN'T YOU CONDEMNING  ANTIFA AN BLM THEY,ARE HATEFUL RACIST,AN VIOLENT ANTIFA & BLM CAUSED THE FIGHTING  IN CHARLOTTESVILLE
Then it's safe for me to assume you will openly oppose voter suppression/restrictive ID laws in WV,  & support removal of S. Jackson statues
ASKING FOR,A,SIMPLE ID, THAT TAKE 5 MINUTES TO GET IS NOT VOTER SUPPRESSION DEMS JUST WANT TO CONTINUE VOTER FRAUD VOTING RIGHTS OF THE DEAD
Then state needs to provide, and pay for voter ID, because it's just not that simple. And, ICYMI, voter fraud isn't real.
Excuse me I paid for all my I'd,s and I should pay for yours if you want to vote bad enough U will by it or not vote so you better git busy
Oh ok you are just making a statement now. Too late
Neither does the murder of cops by the black extremists
The hate of antifa needs to be called out.
Supremacist not Nationalist
As usual you wait to see what others do and say. #copycat
What about #BLM, that is a hate group. I guess now a days white people are the enemy
Still supporting DJT who has legitimized this behavior. Shelley NO Moore Capito.
NO ITS NOT REPUBLICAN  VOTERS MAGA RED HATS THAT ARE RIOTING ASSAULTING PEOPLE TRYING TO SILENCE SPEECH IT'S ANTIFA/BLM THEY ARE TERRORISTS
A little late....what, you were waiting to see what @POTUS potwas going to say today? I watched all weekend, you said nothing. Disgraceful!!



You and your party forgot what this statue means ?
Thank you for clarifying your earlier statement.  Pres.Trump is on dangerous ground here.  The People are taking a stand. Please advise DJT.

they are Trump's base and they got many of you elected. They didn't bother you during the election. Hypocrite
Remember her face Senator
Hold tRUMP accountable!!!!
Little too late u should of made your statement on Saturday but yet you still support white nationalist in the White House smdh
You forgot to mention the BLM groups
Thank you for finally calling it what it is.
Unfortunately we have those groups n our state (304) too!!
.stop standing by @POTUS speak out -#FireBannon & all Alt-right Pres advisors @JeffFlake where r ur principles
don't forget Antifa, BLM, New Black Panthers and Bernie/Hillary supporters.
@GovernorVA why haven't you called out the hate groups BLM or ANTIFA? Coward
When is the GOP going to do something about people in the White House encouraging this? They do it because they can, and will continue.
You as a Democrat failed to mention BLM and ANTIFA. Surely you watched the videos of the event? Denounce ALL hate groups. #closetdemocrat
Tell that to their chief enabler, Trump.  His refusal to condemn them reflects on the entire Republican Party.
Read his statement moron! He used the word condemn in his statement.
Including Steve Bannon & Donald Trump
So the #changeStartsw/U+Congress Actually do your jobs Protect & Serve all Ams not kill health Care. WORK 4  Living wage, #SaveOurHeritage
You are absolutely correct. Did you make a statement about Antifa & BLM? I must have missed those. Could you retweet? Thank you.
ha ha people dont consider those hate groups for some odd reason..We are all just a bunch of Nazis to the left!
thank you
Thank you @SenCapito . We appreciate your leadership!
Senator, please include the antifa and black lives matter TERRORIST GROUPS.
Seems right at home in the White House...and helps explain medicaid cuts you voted for Senator
How can we fix this then....
Hey, remember when Trump cut funding from the DHS's anti-extremist program, and specifically ended investigation of white supremacists?

All #life on Earth will perish.

MP 1:44 = God

I am not sure to survive the next few hours of #intense #RussianArmy tortures against me.

Do you #realise what it means?

MP 1:44 = God
…………..

In my own name, and in the name of my beloved #JesusChrist,

this is a #very #extremely #urgent #issue.

MP 1:44 = God
Bannon, Miller, Gorka...if you're serious start by denouncing the Trump Administration. Don hires only the best and whitest.
Agreed....but neither do the leftist supporting hate groups such as Antifa!! They should be called out as well!!
Hatred of the poor and sick don't either, yet you voted to take healthcare from millions. You are no better.
HEALTH CARE IN NAME ONLY PREMIUMS AN DEDUCTIBLES  ARE SO HIGH  THAT IT UN USABLE. . THE ACA WAS DESIGNED TO FAIL FROM THE BEGINNING
Tell your president.
When you speak of violence, why do you leave out the others participating freely in this violence.  Hate is hate and I condemn it all.
#WOD  #photooftheday #EXO #BTS #FelizLunes
All groups need to stop.
I agree.
#firebannon #firegorka #firemiller
Please retweet and help save America:

There's a #Nazi in the #WhiteHouse and his name is #SteveBannon 

…

Your silence makes you complicit. Demand that @realDonaldTrump remove Gorka, Bannon, and Steven Miller. #FireGorka #FireBannon #FireMiller 
Antifa and BLM are just as bad as  KKK I have no use for any of them.
