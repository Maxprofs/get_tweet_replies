You are wrong! How are you planning on keeping Americans healthy? #CleanAir #EarthMatters
This won't improve coal jobs. http://bit.ly/2g2zm8b   It will only increase coal corp profits at expense of the environment.
LOL

This is why you get Trump as your leader.
And our state turns dark and dirty again. Sick kids! Bad water!
You are completely out of touch with the people of WV!! BTW, others here besides miners!! Ruin our beautiful state. 
WRONG!
Please provide scientific data that shows that this strategy is good for WV. Haven't seen many benefits to date - health, education etc.
In right direction for ur donors, not WVians in general, only a few. Invest in clean energy! Do ur job and protect WV environment
WV still stuck in the previous century. We need people who can think ahead and get things done. Not the same old miner death traps.
I think @SenCapito  is showing WV people exactly who she stands with.  It's not with WV or the USA. It's all about her own bank accts.
This will have little impact on coal jobs according to WVU professor James Von Nostrand.
Are you this clueless?

Renewable jobs are growing incredibly fast, while coal is dying.
Amen it is about time we rolled back Obama's craziness.
Totally wrongheaded. R u living in 1817? Climate change is real! And it's deadly! There is no strong American future without #cleanenergy!
Kiss your seat good bye......coal is dead.  Clean energy is what is needed.
What is wrong with you?  Climate change-induced disasters abound and you want to make it worse?
Will you refuse to take #energymoney? Because it's only the right direction for YOU, not the rest of us. #clueless
Absurd @SenCapito & you know it. Come elections we'll remember that you're in bed with coal barons & don't care about our children's health.
Guess that’s destroy the earth direction?
It's ridiculous. If you agree you are killing our planet. Retrain WV for solar power, hydro power. Grow medical marijuana!
It shows that you & the GOP have sold your minds and hearts to a few and will risk destroying the earth to please them.
Yes cause none of us like breathing. You guys sure know how to kill the American public.

Is that what you're telling your grandchildren when global warming changes ? Are you denying science as well?
You want to sacrifice the health and safety of West Virginians for money. Got it.
How so? Capito has got to go
Get WV out of reverse!
How do you figure? Isn't this going to put us even more behind than we are already?
Boo. Hiss. It heads us back into caves.
@realDonaldTrump You're sure a huge disappointment time & time again SMC.  Trump and GOP are liars and coal is finished
Back to the 50s.  Asthma. Cancer.  Lung disease.  West Nile.  Zika.  All brought to you by the coal industry. Making America sick again.
Wow ... just when I thought you couldn’t sink any lower. Shame on all of you.
It is not. Profit over anything though, right? Invest in the future.
Senator can you work on the following list of items to bring back? Maybe throw in the leisure suit, too. Oh, the classics!! Thank you.
You’ll make Virginia look like China.Those rolling hills will be grey and your constituents will be wearing masks.
We need to develop clean sustainable energy sources and the 21st century jobs that come with that development. #WestVirginia #Jobs
how much is your kickback check this month?
What have you got against clean power? Have you noticed most new jobs in energy are wind & solar? WVians want clean air, water & power.
Your commitment to the past and old money is what continues to hold this state back begging for the crumbs from those who kill them.
Entire towns and regions and waterways are laden with cancer, its easier to go bankrupt than clean-up, you are not serving #WV   interests.
How's our environmental strategy? It is unconscionable to cut regs for industries that only  want to use #WV up. Shame on you.
Mad about the direction Capito is taking WV? VOTE! @HansenHouseWV is an MIT scientist w/ a Masters in Energy&Resources running for WV House!
Are you a fucking #moron too @SenCapito?
Remember when leaded gas was a thing?
Science proved it wrong, despite moronic minds and interests.

Speaking of interests,what will U win?
Your a fool, next you will back horse and buggie "put our transportation strategy in the right direction"

Killing the environment is not worth the few Coal jobs it will save. As a state we can NO LONGER bank on Coal and it's jobs.
Coal will not save WV's economic woes. Mtn top removal requires big machines - few ppl. Nat gas/cheaper energy killed coal, not regulations
By polluting the air, soil & water leading to food shortages, more diseases & chronic illness & destroying the planet for the future?
No it shows that you and Scott Pruitt put large corporations before the health and well being of people. Stop subsidizing coal
Senator, your statement  is total BS
Sounds pretty counterintuitive from an agency that's called Environmental "Protection" Agency. WV will keep looking backwards
While the rest of the world looks to the future. WV will be in worse shape than it was before. Only people who will use coal is Santa
And he should be putting a lump in your stocking!
Headed straight into the toilet. Shame on you Capito you can think bigger than this. Stop collecting a paycheck & act with intelligence.
Senator, coal is dead. WV needs to retrain its workforce and attract new industry that will last.
Or.. probably more like.. the opposite of what you just said.
Right to the 19th century!
do your wv constituents a favor recruit some clean modern businesses now.
Sold your soul to the devil, huh?
BS
Why do you hate West Virginia and West Virginians so much Shelley?
PLZ join this century.
And it shows how WV will never move forward and the destruction of our environment.  These false promises keepsus poor and dumb for years.
just stop it.
destroy our beautiful planet so some dumb redneck can buy a pick up truck?
What the Fuck? Yikes! I followed you cuz I thought had sense. Obviously not. OMG!
whats it going to take? cat 8 hurricane zeus?
you guys are co-opted by fossil fuel baron donors. or just plain blind to mother nature.
resign
You're being sarcastic right?
Backwards? To the 1950's? You gonna bring back yellow pages? Cassette Tapes? Horse & Buggy? The rest of the world is passing us by...
