That's an article not a SME using peer reviewed published studies. You need a SME to corroborate your actual claims

MIGHT hurt? Does it or not! I have a disabled son-vet. #TheRinoList #RINOs #HealthcareBill #healthcare @POTUS @lutherstrange #Hannity
My son not on medicaid though. Why are vets on medicaid and not under VA?

@SenCapito Please, begging you not to strip healthcare. To build a bipartisan answer. We are scared and exhausted.
This. Because the @WhiteHouse for political agenda, would rather hurt the poor, disabled, children, and elderly- than fix #ACA for all.

What will our future be  if your party continues it's efforts to disrupt & destroy the ACA? @VigilanceJCWV @PersistResist2
Sure hope he does not have any pre-existing conditions.  What will you say to him then?  Too bad, too sad, you are going to die.
Hopefully his parent have healthcare so that he can grow up to be a leader.
Hope he is not on Medicaid....
Please remember John's grandparents this week. Older West Virginians get SLAMMED in disastrous healthcare trainwreck. #VoteNoMTP
Call Sen. Capito TODAY. Tell her protect West Virginia's Medicaid! No pre-ex punishments. No lifetime caps. #VoteNoMTP 304-347-5372
Ruraral hospitals will be destroyed by severe Medicaid cuts. Call Sen. Capito TODAY. #VoteNoMTP 304-347-5372
*Rural hospitals!
Unless he gets sick..
All that are afflicted with opioids will be taken care of. Repeal Obama Care.
Did you tell him you were taking away his healthcare? #sellout
166,000 children in West Virginia depend on Medicaid. Don't forget them.
Quick steal his healthcare
Did you advise him to lose his soul first, like you did? #YourLastTerm
So are you teaching him that anyone can lie and bully people as president/senators/representatives? Your party @GOP are despicable liars!
Sure the little tike as healthcare. What about other WVA kids that need HC to grow up to adulthood free from childhood diseases
Hope this cute, smiling boy has wealthy parents and doesn't get sick. Thank you Senator for supporting 1% of the people in your state.
A profile in courage. McConnell and party loyalty is way more important than helping people who trusted you. How do you live with yourself?
Nice looking kid. Hope he never gets a serious illness and his family needs Medicaid.
Seriously. He's already got glasses, hope his family can afford his future eye care!
Did you tell him to never keep his promises or are you just leading by example?
Did he ask you why you will make WV unhealthier then it already is if u vote for MTP?  How you can u represent WV and do that to its people?

I hope @SenCapito remembers as she watches Trump make this vile speech to Boy Scouts that 166,000 West Virginia children are on Medicaid. https://twitter.com/mrdanzak/status/889617053447008256 …
Hopefully that sweet boy never needs affordable healthcare because you voted to screw all people of the US over
Ok, but do you also care about WV children with preexisting conditions?
#VoteNo
Too bad she sold him out.  Her vote was purchased, McConnell reneged on the deal & she will vote yes anyway.
Opioid funding Capito+Portman negotiated reportedly out of Skinny; they presumably know won't cost them C+P's votes. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/27/obamacare-repeal-republicans-status-241025 … 
Hopefully WV will remember your NO vote in 2020.  You're supposed to vote for them, not your own ideals and wants.  SHAME ON YOU @sencapito
No one will Ever Believe In you now 

@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @GOP We will never forget what you put us through. Rollercoaster of misery & helplessness. Our lives devalued.
Did you tell him how to be gutless?  How to sell out?
that kid will definitely remember your name, you absolute fraud and coward.

#saveACA #trumpcare #killthebill #repealandreplacetheGOP
Did you ask him if he feels like he might want healthcare available to him throughout his life? You're a coward.
Bet the little guy would have voted today for children instead of the wealthy. Too bad you didn't.
Have you forgotten?
Hoping we can trust you to put your constituents' needs over that of party & the psychic free-fall of #PublicServant45. #SaveACA
Are you going to vote to take away his health care today? That's the question you need to ask yourself. Remember his face when you vote.
Soooooooooo that was a yes then.
I love kids on fire
Cute kid. Too bad his family might lose his healthcare thanks to you.
For the sake of all, #VoteNoMTP

Hopefully he will not have joined your Hitler Youth -Trump Boy Scout Camp by then. You need to apologize for that hideous rally!

#VoteNoMTP
Please be a hero and save healthcare for millions by voting NO! We need your help desperately!
Vote NO Senator. Remember WHY you chose to serve the people.
Hoping he doesn't still have to deal with healthcare for all as the obvious pathway for equal opportunity for all
Please remember that little boy when you cast your vote.  Without healthcare, he may not even have a future .
Please don't fail the 564K people in your state that are covered by Medicaid, 61% of which are elderly/disabled, 53% kids. Vote no!
