What Could Happen to Premiums Under a 'Skinny Repeal'? http://kaiserf.am/2uH84L7  by @larry_levitt

Under ACA, premiums increased, couldn't keep dr of choice, insurance providers dwindled, tax imposed, many still uninsured. #UownACA

How can you vote yes to move or built a conference without knowing what the outcome will be for the people you serve
Because republicans are morons
This catastrophe of #ACA was a gift to the American populace by the @TheDemocrats !!
ACA is, surprisingly, doing pretty good.
Then why all the fuss about repeal and replace. Leave as is.
That's what I would prefer.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? This is not democracy...this is chaos!  We want serious convo & bipartisan solution for 1/6 of economy.  #WealthCare
Please continue to VOTE NO REPEAL!! Please keep the ACA. With bipartisan efforts we can fix the flaws!! Keep America Healthy!  Thank you!
No bipartisan effort to pass ACA and now you want to fix it?! You sold us a lie!! #VOTEREPEAL or #VoteThemOut
#senatorcapitulator #youndirtytricksmitch #doesnotrespectUS #politicaldonorclass #liningtheirpocketswithyourblood #stealingfromUS
More Marxism.

2) This is no longer hypothetical. They are doing it in plain sight. This will be law by Sunday unless one more Republican stands up.
Paul Ryan's statement gives no certainty that what you vote for out of the Senate will not be passed by the house vote no
Please VOTE NO
Please vote NO on every ridiculous permutation of these wack health bills @SenateMajLdr is trying to force through. He's being irresponsible
Great words by a public servant. Vote has to match words.

You should be a Democrat. It's not just about WV. It's our whole country. You're not a team player. I hope you lose your seat.
#RINO
Every moderate GOP Sen knows health debate has devolved into madness, & that *best* possible end is a bill that is awful by *their* lights.
You understand the moment you pass this POTUS will criticize you and use it to demolish GOP????  You are a fool to think you can trust him!
Please vote YES on the #skinnyrepeal. You ran on repealing Obamacare/ACA. Follow through please! YES ON OBAMACARE REPEAL
It is sad that you caved to the vocal minority. Enjoy your last term.
@marcorubio AARP say No and will tell members who voted Yes Publicity
Your colleague John McCain is literally asking Paul Ryan to guarantee that he will not allow a vote on the bill you pass. This is idiotic.
Do not be bullied into hurting Americans for a GOP "win" We are better than this. All just 1 illness or accident from needing coverage.
You prolly should have had a plan before you proceeded to debate on the "healthcare" bill. This is pathetic.
Ready to sell out.  Veto and go to regular order!
YOU SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT PEOPLE.  THE SKINNY REPEAL HURTS PEOPLE, VOTE NO.

You voted NO on full repeal,you just lost a vote here An many more.I hope your time as a senator will be a One time senator
More details: 

If U pass the skinny HC-take-away bill, it will become law . 

Will you hurt or protect people?
BREAKING: The House has invoked martial law. If the Senate passes skinny repeal, the House can vote on it without notice.
stand strong & remain honest to your oath to the nation & your people-don't do this for party or points-too many will be affected negatively
Please vote no on skinny repeal. #LetUsLive
@SenCapito  Soon Beckley will be the Capito no-jobs zone if Senate healthcare bill passes. #JobKiller
@SenCapito Vote no on the job killing Senate health bill.  It will kill thousands of WV jobs in the healthcare field in WV.

Skinny repeal by any name hurts Americans.

We need more details on how you're voting on the repeal of ACA.   DON"T HURT PEOPLE.  Vote no!
Senator it has been reported that the house will vote on Saturday on whatever you say yes to today without modifying it
Don't take away health care from millions for a bill written over lunch?!?!
Losing ACA will cost the state $8 billion a year.  This is just a drop in the bucket and a said way to sell us all out.
This is your chance to redeem yourself. Vote down the skinny repeal and protect our healthcare!

In 2010, 16% of the U.S. was uninsured. That's 49.9M Americans. Do not go backwards - #VoteNo on motion to proceed. Call (866) 553-8040. 
Please oppose the skinny bill: http://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/politics/advocacy/2017/07/letter-on-senate-repeal-bill-final-july-2017-aarp.pdf …
If you vote for this "healthcare" bill then you own whatever death and destruction it brings.  @SenateMajLdr is a conman.
Senator you have flip flopped-- you have not done what you ran on.
Oh, Senator. Your vote was bought and paid for? Does this mean Repeal and Replace w/increased premiums and NO insurance for 15M? Will see...
Vote no

American Cancer Society against skinny repeal as well Hurts patients!
Voting YES on "Skinny Bill" is FULL REPEAL of the ACA - W.Virginia will suffer. 
CALL . CALL . CALL. CALL.

Senators, Repeal and Replace the ACA today. The President has given you momentum. Don’t squander it. Income tax… https://ifiwerepresidentiwould.wordpress.com/2017/07/27/senators-repeal-and-replace-the-aca-today-the-president-has-given-you-momentum-dont-squander-it-income-tax-replacement-and-a-balanced-budget-is-next-dont-lose-your-momentum/ …


Vote no on skinny repeal! Kicks 15 million off insurance, many from WV and premiums will rise 20%! Bad for citizens bad for economy!
Pls, Sen. let's just go back to reg order & bring in other Dems Mods to fix ACA... Just rename it USA CARES! Since certain ppl hate Obama!
Then stop obstructing Repeal and Replace Obamacare because that's my fucking money.
This clarifies the yes vote. $ for a year old flood doesn't compensate for thousands losing HC (unless it's putin rubles in your wallet).
Did you have to promise Ben Carson that you'd approve any health care bill they put in front of you to get this? If you did PLEASE return it
Is this in exchange for your YES vote asking for a friend

A vote for the "skinny repeal" is a vote for full repeal and you will likely lose any special deals you were promised.
This 42mil for flood relief could be the special deal she was promised. If she takes any deals they'll do it to her again on the budget bill
The special deals most likely violate the Byrd rules, I expect all special deals will be lost.
IF they find out they are special deals. I imagine it happens under the table. If the Justice Dept doesn't investigate how will we know?
