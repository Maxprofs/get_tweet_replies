When I see your bio "proudly serving west Virginia ". I wanna PUKE because you don't serve us especially the disabled elderly or sick ...
#GrahamCassidyِ will cost West Virginia $1 BILLION and leave thousands of us uninsured. And @SenCapito is voting for it????
Please vote NO on Graham Cassidy.. it is a terrible bill, even @RandPaul and true conservatives in your state agree! Be courageous
West Virginia will be crucified when the "per capita" recalculation is done and you know this! In exchange for what for the ppl of WV?
It undermines protections for preexisting conditions even for children and those on employer plans. NOT free market, doesn't lower costs
#turn2018/2020BLUE
BTW
You cannot support Graham Cassidy. This bill is a crime and will cause great hardship on the people you were elected to represent.
