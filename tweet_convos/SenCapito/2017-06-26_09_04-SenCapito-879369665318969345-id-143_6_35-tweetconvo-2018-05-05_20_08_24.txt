Hope you have enough broadband to get this message: passing the monstrosity of Trumpcare will destroy the lives of your constituents.
VOTE NO ON THIS DUMPSTER FIRE OF A BILL THAT MITCH WANTS TO RAM DOWN YOUR THROAT.  WORK LONGER TO GET IT RIGHT.  DON'T LET TRUMP BULLY YOU.
Where do you stand? Your state wants to know. Where in the world is @sencapito
Why are you not addressing your constituents?  30% of them will be negatively impacted if this bill passes.  #shameful #heartless
IT'S IN YOUR HANDS, SENATOR. WILL PEOPLE LIVE, OR DIE? #StopTrumpCare #ACA #SaveACA SERVE UR CONSTITUENTS NOT trump!
Protestors thoughts just before 5pm 

Do not vote for the proposed healthcare bill if you want to remain in office!!!
Carl & Donna Starr
@SenCapito YOU NEED TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT YOUR VOTE ON HEALTHCARE!  WHAT IS YOUR VOTE? SO WE CAN DECIDE OURS!
Seems so phoney of you talking about this when you need to tell us you are voting No on GOP health plan!!
You are another Senator who is against the #HealthcareBill. Good. It would be a legacy for Trump just like the economy is a legacy for Obama
Vote no on HC!!!! Wake up.
Not 1 of ur constituents/won't read this? Ur voters saw that: https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/woman-tells-capito-her-daughter-would-have-died-without-aca/2017/06/23/57d84fb6-5851-11e7-840b-512026319da7_video.html … PLZ VOTE NO! #StopTrumpCare FOR THE  OF GOD! PLEASE!
Thanks but would rather have your help to deliver a broad band of health coverage for all. Please vote no to #TrumpCare
Excellent response!
Thank you.
Please vote NO on the "health" care bill.  We beg you.
.@SenCapito please stand against the tax bill disguised as a health care bill.  It helps the rich while constituents suffer.  Thank you.
Vote no in the trumpcare ridiculous  bill
This is great, but what about the 150,000 #WV residents who may lose health care? Please do the right thing. -Native West Virginian
Vote repeal
Please help KEEP healthcare for 20+ million of your fellow Americans #StopTrumpCare
Bottom line: This bill is a tax cut for the rich at the expense of health care for the poor and middle class. U ok w this?
West Virginians won't be able to use your new broadband if they're dead. #Trumpcare #WV and you wonder why all the young professionals leave
Do you honestly believe that broadband is what your constiuents want from you right now? Are you that out of touch? Vote NO to #trumpcare
WATCH THIS: https://twitter.com/funder/status/879527706219749376 … … U'LL HAVE 2 ANSWER 2 A HIGHER JUDGEMENT, and to #WestVirginia VOTERS #VoteNo #VoteNoAHCA #NoTrumpCare
Watch this.

#ProtectOurCare #SaveACA #Resist 
#SaveMeCapito
Vote NO on health care reform bill. Then we can talk about bandwidth. Until then, tweet something of real value. #SaveMeCapito #VoteNo
Come out, come out, wherever you are! We need to know where you stand on CapitoCare (TrumpCare). Parents and children deserve an answer!
no1 cares about broadband right now..we wanna know if your gonna vote 2 take away OUR insurance, if your gonna put PARTY above WEST VIRGINIA
Still waiting for your NO on #TrumpCare, @sencapito. Maybe discuss over brunch today with @SenatorCollins?
Celebrated #NationalSelfieDay a little early with my lunch buddies yesterday. @SenatorCollins @SenCapito 
Glad to see more will have internet access because the only diagnosis we'll be able to afford is WebMd if you vote Yes on Trumpcare
22-million uninsured under trumpcare, many of them West Virginians, if this unthinkable legislation passes. Let it be on your head.
broadband is easy. Stand up for your voters to say NO to TrumpCare! It can be written better. Hold out for that.
You'll deliver broadband - WHAT ABOUT AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE?

Certainly NOT McConnell's GARBAGE.

LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS!!!
Pretty powerful stuff that lady said to you about her daughter. We are all watching to see if you choose party over country! 
Broadband?! You should be sent packing if you vote to strip Health Insurance from your constituents. What kind of person are you?
Who cares about broadband if you are DEAD!!! Please vote NO on this disastrous tax bill!!!
Hope you'll be as concerned about our access to healthcare. Also, internet privacy and net neutrality. But thanks for the broadband.
30.2% of your state relies on Medicaid you're about to vote to gut. Broadband is worthless for your constituents if they're dead.

You need to be focusing on how you'll deliver HEALTHCARE to #WV residents.
We want to hear about the health care bill
Senator Capito, please vote NO to Trumpcare. #VoteNoBCRA
Uh who needs broadband when we're uninsured? #VoteNoACHA
Senator, please please please vote NO to #AHCA ! You KNOW it will be catastrophic if it passes. Can you live with that?!
Hope you don't vote to decimate health care for thousands more.
Would you want a family member to b diagnosed with a dire disease and b told they will not receive care? Protect your constituents!
Please remember all the sick children with leukemia and cancer and elderly and low income people depending on you to protect them. Vote NO
I really hope u vote NO. If you have a bit a compassion for Amy! Think about her mother. Think about all the people who you would hurt.
Please Mrs Capito vote no on the repeal bill
TrumpCare is a Mass Murder about to happen. How can you support it? Geezus, $4 a day to keep everyone insured!
This is a NO brainer! Give up a pack of cig or cup of coffee for Healthcare!
Broadband isn't important. WHAT  ABOUT HEALTH CARE? Please tell us if UR going to stand again with Mitch McConnell or for WV?
So disappointed that you seem tone-deaf to the pleas of terrified constituents. Did you learn nothing from the consequences of DeVos vote??
Please commit to our healthcare @SenCapito #SaveMeCapito #CountryOverParty #WeNeedYouNow I am a constituent w/ metastatic cancer~Protect Me!
While that's important, it's not nearly as important as healthcare. The Repub bill will hurt our state and our people. #VoteNoAHCA
How about delivering a No vote for the disastrous Trumpcare bill?
Imagine how great those broadband speeds will be once you kill millions of people!
Why are you having people arrested for protesting?
All 6 protestors arrested after refusing to leave @SenCapito 's office without promise of a no vote on AHCA 
Not good. Horrible.
What you need to deliver to WV residents is good,affordable healthcare! Talk  to Sen Collins about how to proceed
Kudos to you...we'll have internet while dying because we don't have health insurance. Well done, Senator.
Do you hope that will take their minds off the heath insurance you are denying them? Are you ok with condemning people to death?
You are more worried about 9000 getting internet than 100k having access to healthcare.  #yourprioritiessuck

If you're 60 years old and make *any* amount of money, get ready for premiums to go way up under the Senate bill.

People will need Dr. Google when you take their healthcare away. Do you care at all about WV or just yourself? #noAHCA


West Virginians arrested for trying to convince GOP @SenCapito to oppose health care repeal

http://shareblue.com/west-virginians-arrested-for-trying-to-convince-gop-senator-to-oppose-health-care-repeal/ ……
The fact that you're talking about this instead of healthcare scares the hell out of all of us. Brag about keeping us alive, earn our vote
@SenCapito- Will you stand with your colleague, @SenatorCollins, and vote NO on #Trumpcare? We're counting on you!
I want to work w/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to fix the flaws in ACA. CBO analysis shows Senate bill won't do it. I will vote no on mtp. 1/3
Come on. Stop hiding on Trumpcare. You must vote NO if you care about WV constituents. A yes vote is pure pandering to Party.
senator collins released a statement that she is voting no on AHCA. Millions of americans are hoping you will too. Thank you
30% of West Virginians use Medicaid.  VOTE NO ON TRUMPCARE!!!
http://www.theintelligencer.net/news/top-headlines/2017/01/30-percent-of-w-va-families-on-medicaid/ …
Yes they will need wifi while bed ridden b4 they die 
But if they are dying because of lack of healthcare, it does them no good. #SavethemCapito
I feel like you're just trolling us at this point. Either that or you think access to WebMD is a good-enough health plan?
22 million! My god, astonishing! Unthinkable
How many of the 9,000 will die under this healthcare I mean tax cut bill?
How can you still be considering voting for the #Trumpcare monstrosity, which will impoverish and kill people in your state???
It seems that u are a true politician ignoring healthcare  vote No
Where are your comments on the *deathcare* bill? What are you hiding?  we'll find out your vote. AND if you hide the votes, we know it's yes
Why are you not talking about healthcare?  VOTE NO!
VOTE NO!
When your constituents die they really won't need broadband but thanks anyway.
When are you going to speak with those people outside your office?
People can’t use the internet if they’re dead!
What?  Are we going to google our way to good health care?  Lol
Will you deliver your NO vote on the Senate's healthcare bill too? My family members in Wheeling area want you to.
Consider turning your attention to the West Virginians who are packing your office right now to oppose the #AHCA.
Internet access is great. Health care is a BASIC HUMAN RIGHT.
Vote

NO

on the Repubs' pathetic and mean

HEALTHCARE bill.
Access to internet < healthcare
Well? CBO is out and it isn't much better. What say you?
I know there are other things going on... but you seem pretty vocal about broadband and quite mute on healthcare over the last week.
She seems to be taking lessons from @realDonaldTrump & trying to detract us. IT'S NOT WORKING! Healthcare is more important to us right now!
*distract
Well the CBO report says AHCA is a bigger POS than we thought. What is your comment?
Broadband won't matter if people are dying from lack of affordable care.
Seriously, @SenCapito.  No one in WV will be able to afford broadband, let alone healthcare, if the AHCA passes.  VOTE NO.
Before #broadband, we need to protect healthcare & #NoCutsToMedicaid ! Note NO on #AHCA. No #Trumpcare #wealthcare
Senator Capito: Do not vote to throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance - including 122,000 in your own state. 

Good for those 9000. Why is WV behind in so many ways?

That's great! But what we really need is healthcare. #VoteNoAHCA
We'll need that to "YouTube",how to perform your own surgery, if you help pass the new senate health care bill. Vote no! Keep WV healthy.
Healthcare before broadband.  Vote NO!!!
#byeshelley You will be voted out for someone with a heart and conscience #capitoshame #voteno
How can sick people with no affordable healthcare enjoy 'broadband?' Vote no. Do the right thing. Your constituents will suffer w new bill
Can you vote no in order to save health care for all the people in WV who have been helped by the ACA next?
You ain't delivering nothing taxpayers are I do not like the way you choose to spend my money I am a West Virginia taxpayer
Please vote no on TrumpCare. We need healthcare not internet access.
Who will die from #trumpcarekills
Hey WV pillheads, there's a shitload of Oxy on Craigslist, so this is your version of addiction treatment
If we have no one who can afford healthcare, and everyone in WV dies, then good internet is a moot point, Senator. Say No to AHCA for WV!
.@SenCapito Vote NO on the #AHCA. Do your son and protect those that need it the most.
What's most important to WVians right now is that you #ProtectOurCare. #WestVirginia would be one of the hardest-hit states. #saveMeCapito
screw broadband what are you going to do about healthcare?
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair.

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Must-watch. Beyond powerful.
