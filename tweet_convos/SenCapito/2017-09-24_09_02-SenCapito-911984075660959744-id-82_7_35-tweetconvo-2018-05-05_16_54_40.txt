#Medicaid #ACA stop pretending band aids help. Throwing money at the problem while undermining the ppl isn't great news, it's kick the can.
While that's great, please vote "no" on #GrahamCassidyBill . WVians will be harmed by this bill.
Yes please vote no.  Your country depends on you!
Only the losers and addicts want Nomobama care. Government out of healthcare now!
#defundpp
Is this what it took for your vote?Glad to combat epidemic, but must help the millions that will lose their cover too.#VoteNoGrahamCassidy
But if Medicaid is decimated by passing Cassidy-Graham half of WVians now receiving care will lose access to substance abuse treatment
Senator Capito, please do the right thing, for children's, humanity's sake. You will be blessed.
Vote no on cassidy graham
How are you signing off on GC bill with the opioid epidemic in WV? If you vote yes it is morally irresponsible and repugnant #GrahamCassidy
But then why do you support Graham-Cassidy, where opioid addiction treatment not covered? Not even as good as AHCA.
How do you justify this?

Addressing opioid addiction is important. So is access to affordable healthcare. Please vote "no" on #CassidyGraham.
Just vote NO, forget excuses have a back bone for all of WV
Yes Senator.  But where do you stand on Graham-Cassidy?
I care about the healthcare bill.  Vote NO, please.  Fix Obamacare.
What did you promise (And to who?) in return for the  $1,108,186? Vote no on Graham-Cassidy.
There won't be an epidemic if you vote for #GrahamCassidyBill because there will be no #WV!  @PersistResist2 @VigilanceJCWV @Appalachia99
Graham-Cassidy is a DEATH SENTENCE to millions of Americans, and GUTS vital programs.  

If you care, you will VOTE NO
The best way to combat drugs is affordable healthcare & jobs.please put citizens b4 politics and vote NO #GrahamCassidy
Buying your vote and your word to West Virginians?

You have a second chance to make it right. Remember: 1/6th of Economy, no CBO score.
Then make a real move and vote against Graham Cassidy.  2 billion dollar cut to West Virginia    That is not acceptable.  Protect us.
Great..needed but not at expense of remaining.90% of West Virginians. Vote NO PLEASE

Don't vote against West Virginians. Most have preexisting conditions. Selling your vote to combat drugs is abominable. Find another way
What happens when there are 0 insurance $ for treatment & many are considered to have preexisting conditions & are denied? #NoGrahamCassidy
Please vote NO to Graham-Cassidy bill it would be a travesty to all the families with loved ones who have pre-existing conditions.
what drug epidemic, Heroin, or Meth, or crack...... there is the problem drug dealers on the street before the officer finishes his report.
Does that mean @SenateMajLdr bought your "YES" vote once again, for the Graham/Cassidy Bill?
If so, I hope your Constituents vote you out!
Does @SenCapito have @SenJohnMcCain courage? Vote NO on G-C. Bill disaster for state. WV loses millions. READ below:

One time grant spread around the state of $1,000,000. Doesn't make up for the millions cut and thousands losing care if your vote sells WV.
HUGE BLOOD MONEY INVOLVED IN GOP REPEAL of O'care.  Needed to offset lost revenue from GOP TAX CUTS to wealthy -
Good work -- but don't let this (bribe?) distract you from large picture:  Say NO to #GrahamCassidy!  #ProtectOurCare
YOU'RE A CHARLATAN
Please don't throw all Americans under the health care bus in favor of a party vote..our health is not political!!!
Did you take the Grover Nordquist pledge? did you pledge to some man's 30 year old fantasy? or you pledged to do what is right for Americans
NO to GrahamCassidy.  Every relevant medical assoc and organization has studied the bill and are vehemently against it. We watch your vote
Get a job
If you really cared about that you'd vote NO on Graham-Cassidy!
Ted Cruz just announced his opposition to #GrahamCassidy. Join him and John McCain in voting no.
Your position on Cassidy Graham?
And how will you be voting on #TrumpCare? Do you understand its adverse impact on substance abuse treatment?
Was your vote bought Shelley?  When will you ever stand up for us?
NO, @SenateMajLdr did w/a huge payoff->Skinny Bill.
Now he's trying to get @lisamurkowski to vote 'YES' in exchange for keeping ACA in AK.
A pittance compared to what will be lost by slashing Medicaid which provides most of opiod addiction money. Give w/right, take w/left.
Get a job
Again is this for your vote on Graham-Cassidy bill..... if it is shameful
That's great! But was it bought at the expense of WVIian's & other state's healthcare being taken away?Please vote NO to #GrahamCassidyBill
Good for the medical industry?  Or families in need of help?
Please do not vote to gut Medicaid 4 elderly or protections 4 those with pre existing conditions. Working poor want to afford insurance.

#HYPOCRITE
There won't be any money if you vote for #GrahamCasiddy bill. Not a single medical org supports this bill.Bad for Americans. Vote No for us.
Protect our kids!!!  #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
Why won't your office answer phone calls. How big of a grave are you planning to bury us in?
MULTIMILLIONAIRE @SenCapito wants to STEAL healthcare from 218,000 West Virginians so she can get a TAX CUT!!!
MULTIMILLIONAIRE @SenCapito wants to STEAL healthcare from MILLIONS of working Americans (again) to give MASSIVE TAX CUTS to the RICH!!!
