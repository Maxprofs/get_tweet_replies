Thanks @SenCapito for hosting today's #OpioidBriefing and convening an important conversation. An entire generation is at stake.
I am writing to ask that you work on a bipartisan effort (as you were elected to do) to fix the Affordable Care Act.
But supporting #GrahamCassidy will not.  VOTE NO.  It's bad for WV.
 Reminder - #GrahamCassidy ends #Medicaid 

Do you still stand by your words to #ProtectOurCare ?

#TheResistance  #SaveACA
@SenCapito are you willing to start looking kids with cancer in the face and tell them you voted to kill them?
That's nice. Except without access to affordable treatment, the crisis will continue. More people will die. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill.
#GrahamCassidyِ will cost West Virginia $1 BILLION and leave thousands of us uninsured. And @SenCapito is voting for it????
And rehab is a big part of it which #GrahamCassidy makes optional to cover.  Seem wise?  #noGrahamCassidy
YES it is and w/o Health care West Virginians will die. Please do what is right by God for Humans.
Please Vote NO on Cassidy-Graham Bill. 
Americans spoke out&said KEEP & IMPROVE ACA. Please speak up for us!
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill. It will adversely affect hundreds of thousands of your constituents. #ProtectOurCare....please!
If you Help Pass Graham-Cassidy there won't be any help for Opioid Victims Look @ # of Ppl who need help That's how many are likely to Die
#GrahamCassidy makes addiction a #preexistingcondition and slashes #medicaid to WV. Vote NO on #TRUMPCARE
What will help even more is healthcare that covers mental health and substance abuse treatment. Those would be pre-existing. Please vote no
...The best choice at this time for the opioid crisis is a no vote on Graham-Cassidy. Fix the ACA..
#ACA #FixItDontNixIt
West Virginia would lose $1 billion under Graham-Cassidy.
You said vote was a yes because you got opioid funding. This one doesn't have it. We can do so much better. Just say no to #GrahamCassidy.
This bill is worse than July skinny repeal which was favored by 12% of Americans. Collins & Murkowski were national heroes. Seek redemption.
Graham-Cassidy bill will greatly impede services available to those with substance abuse and mental health issues.  Please vote no.
WV deserves better than this bill by Sen Graham and Lying Bill Cassidy...no CBO score and tax cuts for rich? Stand up for WV! #Courage
Isn't this what you fought for? VOTE NO GRAHAM-CASSIDY!!
GOP leaders put $45b for opioids in their 1st Ocare repeal bill. Now it’s gone. http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-latest-obamacare-repeal-bill-doesnt-include-opioid-funding-once-deemed-critical … via @desiderioDC
@SenCapito didn't negotiate well in the block grant wars for her vote....West Virginia is a loser.
Please vote No on #GrahamCassidy which will strip states of $$ needed to fight #opioidcrisis! Please support @SenatorCollins to improve #ACA
All these efforts will be for naught if GCHJ passes. Please vote no senator. We need your leadership. NOW. #CutsHurt

PLEASE PLEASE OPPOSE GRAHAM CASSIDY!!!
A vote this bill would be a slap in the face to these efforts.  Even @LindseyGrahamSC knows it's bad. https://twitter.com/stevekopack/status/910637563584684032 …
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy Opioid problem won't be helped by that disaster of a bill.
I read you're willing to be the "no"vote when needed. You are needed NOW. This bill hurts people. #noGrahamCassidy @SenCapito
SMH you shock me! WV is in crisis and you will strip healthcare. Just quit if you don't care because clearly you don't
Don't be part of this opioid coverup.  Your state needs you.  Vote no.
The GOP could bring a bill to the floor spending $45 billion on the opioid epidemic & it would pass easily. They just don't care https://twitter.com/fivethirtyeight/status/910492493917114368 …
Severely comprised 4the aid of WVians if Uvote yes on Graham-Cassidy.U were elected 2represent the ppl not a party & its ppl need a NO vote!
Ya know, HEALTHCARE would help with the opioid crisis... #KillTheBill vote NO on GC!!!
Please vote against this inhumane CassidyGraham bill. It is misogynist and inhumane. Stand up for women children elderly disabled. NO

"Someone whose pre-existing condition will be addressed because of" Graham-Cassidy is just a brutal lie. https://twitter.com/dylanlscott/status/910347132972027905 …
No funding for opioid crisis in GrahamCassidy bill Senator.  A yes vote for this bill would be cruel & unconscionable for WV's vulnerable.

It's a bill that's so vile that they have to use blatant lies to sell it -- up to 32 million will be left uninsured https://twitter.com/NewDay/status/910481100660707328 …
If you are serious about this you must vote no on the Graham-Cassidy bill.  Do not let trump intimidate you. He is a bully.  Stand up for WV
Vote what your state needs and don't buckle under party pressure. We are in the midst of an epidemic, don't take our health care #VoteNo
If Sen Capito is really concerned about the opiate epidemic in beautiful WV she will vote NO on Graham Cassidy!
Senator, time for you to stand up for the working people of West Virginia and support bipartisan improvements to ACA, reject Graham-Cassidy

#GrahamCassidy
CALL ALL UNDECIDED GOP

Where Republicans stand on Graham-Cassidy @CNNPolitics …
STOP representing corporations! We are all human beings for Christs sake! We only get one shot at this life, please vote no on #trumpcare
Sen Capito, they took out the money for opioid treatment! You can't vote for this bill that will kill WV citizens!
Graham/Cassidy takes $554 million from West Virginia. Why would you consider voting for this heinous bill?
Vote no on #GrahamCassidyBill that cuts opioid funding.
CAN'T HELP ADDICTS WITH NO HEALTH CARE!
$400 million to GOP campaign from Koch brothers on condition ACA is repealed. :( VOTE NO on #GrahamCassidy! USA before party. FindAbetterWay
is anthem making an antidote? greed got us into this mess maybe it can get us out
Quick question, @SenCapito. Did you weigh in on Graham-Cassidy BEFORE it was rolled out? Bill affects women disproportionately.
Graham-Cassidy allows insurers to NOT cover:
-Pregnancy
-Newborn care
-Mental health services
-Prescription drugs
-Rehab
-Birth control
Opioid crisis will be made much worse by #medicaid cuts for #disabled. Kill #grahamcasaiday

If you live in another developed country, it's hard to grasp the true horror of what Americans are living in at this point. #GrahamCassidy
Under Cassidy-Graham opioid addiction treatment would no longer be an essential service.
Addicted to opioids?  Sorry -that will be a pre-existing condition. And most addicts will need Medicaid to access treatment.
NO on G-C bill.

Is Susan Collins the only Republican who read the bill? https://twitter.com/jakesherman/status/910187046345560064 …
GrahamCassidy Bill and opioid
Graham-Cassidy would mean a death sentence or bankruptcy for many.
Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
Do the right thing. What helps your constituents?? #GrahamCassidy bill will end Medicaid as we know it.
Translation another program being financed by the working taxpayer get out of my wallet
Vote No on repeal, work to make it better!
#GrahamCassidy #RepealAndReplace = No.
#MedicareForAll = Winner, winner:  dinner.
#OpioidCrisis #drugfreewv
 history notes the diversion.
Best way you can fight #OpioidCrisis, if you really care about WV, vote no #GrahamCassidy
Notice #GrahamCassidy doesn't include funding for the #OpiodCrisis. Still gonna vote for it Shelley? Or kill Medicaid and any hope for WV.
Repeal Obamacare

#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
Lyin' @SenCapito voted to STEAL healthcare from MILLIONS of Americans receiving substance abuse treatment through Medicaid!!!
#HYPOCRITE
MULTIMILLIONAIRE @SenCapito wants to STEAL healthcare from MILLIONS of working Americans (again) to give MASSIVE TAX CUTS to the RICH!!!
