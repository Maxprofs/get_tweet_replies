What is it going to take to get YOU to listen??????
President Trump blocked a woman with stage 4 cancer on Twitter. 

Here’s her response: 
People over party over politics.  Please take care of all Americans with a no vote on Graham-Cassidy.  We are depending upon you.
Look at all of YOUR CONSTITUENTS as well as the rest of the country BEGGING for a NO vote on #GrahamCassidy ! Country before Party Please!
Let's get this straight. If you vote for the #GrahamCassidy bill, and it passes, and hundreds of thousands suffer, it becomes CapitoCare.
"I didn't come to Washington to hurt people," @SenCapito. G-C "violates the precept of ‘first do no harm,'" @AmerMedicalAssn. Don't hurt ppl
Please announce your position on Graham-Cassidy, inquiring constituents want to know! How can you lead w/o taking a position? Yeah or Ney?
Please vote against GrahamCassidy bill. Nothing else matters.
Please reject the new health bill. Everyone knows it's crap and only purpose to put more $ in the pocket of the rich!
Stop pivoting and refusing to discuss the crime against humanity the GOP Congress is contemplating. Graham Cassidy cannot pass.
Sorry to see you avoid public support of President Trump. Sniff of the swamp.
This is my brother, Tim. Without Medicaid, he and many others wouldn't get the medical treatments they so desperately require. VOTE NO!
We deserve a bipartisan healthcare solution, not a death sentence! Listen to your constituents!
Not a single medical advocacy group has come out in support of #GrahamCassidy 
They all oppose it. You should too!!!
You said you "didn't come to Washington to hurt people". Make us believe you. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
