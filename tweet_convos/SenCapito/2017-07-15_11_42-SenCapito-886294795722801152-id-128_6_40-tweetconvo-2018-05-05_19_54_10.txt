Rural centers & nursing homes (& jobs) across WV will close if Medicaid cuts mean bills aren't paid. PLEASE vote NO!
There are no Medicaid cuts stop it!
Medicaid cost went up $200 billion in the last six years--more than double.  People still can't afford coverage or aren't carriers.  Failed
We are in that situation now.  The lien still goes against the house
I have a friend in that situation. Her mother needed more care than could be done at home & not cash to pay nursing home. Medicaid paid.
If she does that they can come back against the house for all that Medicaid paid
In my friend's case, the husband also lived in the house. Medicaid didn't seek the reimbursement as long as one of them was living in house.
Am saddened for you and all of the folks who are in this very difficult situation with loved ones. There are no easy answers. Best wishes

1.3 million? Whats that gona do pay for some  tongue depressors? Thats like giving a starving homeless person a penny for food. VERY SAD!
God will call you to account for every life lost by your Yes. It's not too late. Find courage. Be on the side of the good.
What about all those that have no coverage in their counties/states because no insurance will cover them with the policies OC requires
That is fixable. All they have to do is write the bill. Out of the country's 3007 counties only 40 have this problem.
Joe write your own Senators in Tennessee.  Obamacare has to b repealed.
Safe to be a NO vote on current health care proposal.  Wish Susan C  was my Republican Rep.  Guts! Independent thinker! Pls Save Medicaid
What are you doing about better and more affordable HC for taxpayers?  Are you invested in maintaining WV as a poor state?  DEMs are.
Put  a cap on free  stuff  for able bodied working  people.

Based on what?
What we'd like 2 learn is if UR ok w/77,300 folks in WVa losing Medicaid?  And RU ok w/WVa losing $1,795,000,000 in fed funding?
There is no cut in Medicaid!!!
Have you read the plan?!
Is this the bribe from McConnell to buy your yes vote on #bcra? If so, it's a bad deal for you & WV. Won't make a dent in #Medicaid cuts.
Hi Friend Nice looking I like you
Is it #MedicareForAll? We're hoping it's #MedicareForAll.
I hope that you will not support any cuts to Medicaid and Medicare nor any proposal that will make insurance more expensive.
vote no on BetterCare,  this bill will hurt WVians. support us and we will support you.
Will it matter if women all over #WestVirginia lose health insurance? Be significant! Join @SenatorCollins in stopping this cruel bill.
Is McConnell buying your vote?
You vote yes on this bill your political career will be done as people will remember you choose greed over them and sentence them to death
Cruz amendment will sabotage everyone's healthcare. Medicaid cuts will devastate families. PLEASE don't let them bribe you. Vote NO.
Just read ur newsletter. Still "reviewing" #BCRA. Waiting on the CBO score, huh? What will u do if McConnell moves w/o CBO scoring? No4 #WV
@SenCapito Now vote NO on this deplorable healthcare sham and insure good healthcare for all WV and US. Kill the bill. Be a hero.
There is a difference between having access and being able to afford it at least Senator Collins is putting her constituents first
.@SenCapito You could go down in history as THE Senator who averted a national health care crisis. History will not be kind to #BCRA backers
Be a hero and tell McConnell NO.
That's great! Please also vote against the proposed healthcare bill that will adversely affect the citizens of WV
Nothing is most important for West Virginians than your voting against #TrumpCare NOW. Don't let this harmful bill onto the Senate floor
You don’t fix the Affordable Care Act by giving America's 400 richest families a $7 million annual tax cut. Please vote no!
trying supporting our healthcate....tell Mitch to take it and shove it(where the sun don't shine...)
You can listen to voters or special intrests if you want to keep your job i would listen to voters repeal n replace
85% of people telling you to vote no on here, live in other states we will vote you out plain and simple
Im already starting to campaign for your replacement in 2018 so i would act now if i was you
vote no on aca bill
Was the funding from McConnell to try to buy your vote for BRCA? Just wondering...

Fixing healthcare takes putting us, we the people, before your party! Either fix the #ACA or give us #MedicareForAll. 

Families in Texas will be worse off under #Trumpcare. Health insurers could cut benefits and weaken protections. #ProtectOurCare

Is this like the #kodiakkickback? Don't sell out and take their bribe. Have some integrity. Vote NO to the #BCRA .
VOTE NO for WV, don't sell out
Don't vote to kill us!!!
Vote no on #BCRA
You need to work with the rest of the GOP Republicans and pass the current HC bill
Be conservative leader NOT a party follower.  #VoteNoBCRA
Yesterday, expanded WV #Medicaid allowed me to have surgery before my condition became life-threatening. Please #VoteNoBCRA, thank you.
Pass healthcare bill
Vote no for the republicans healthcare bill
Is this one of the kick- backs McConnell has paid you to vote for your Obamacare vote?
Please protect your constituents from the BCRA. VOTE NO!
A "YES" vote by you equals early retirement. You will be finished!
Uninsured in WV will triple under the Senate healthcare Bill.  Do the right thing by WV and the Country.  Lives literally are in your hands.
https://m.facebook.com/acastorybookproject/?ref=bookmarks …
Just say "NO" Shelly!
WV is one of the top states that require and rely on Medicare. You won't have anyone left to vote for you cause they will be 6ft under.
What about the 22-23 million that will lose healthcare if you vote for the TrumpCare Tax Cut for his rich family and friends?
And if GOP votes on this bill, w/out the Cruz amendment considered w/in  the CBO score, it's beyond reprehensible, shameful, and disgusting.
If you really care about WVians, you would vote NO!! #HealthcareBill #voteno
Not the time to boast about your health care efforts when youre mum on #BCRA. If you truly care about WV and health care, VOTE NO ON #BCRA.
I've never seen more recklessness, greed and cruelty than what I see in revised Senate health care bill.  VOTE NO!  #SaveOurCare
.@SenCapito, good, but more important is voting NO on #wealthcarebill, and protecting #healthcare for #WestVirginia ns. #ProtectOurCare

This cancer survivor can't speak, but that won't stop him from speaking up against Trumpcare 
.@SenCapito You could go down in history as THE Senator who averted a national health care crisis. History will not be kind to #BCRA backers
Please stay strong, unswayed and unpaid by McConnell and vote NO on this atrocious legislation.  #Trumpcarekills
#Trumpcarekills
If healthcare is important then vote No on the BRCA. Insurers, Drs, actuaries and the vast majority of Americans know it's a disaster.
Do you really think this funding makes up for all the folks who will lose their coverage? Very disappointed at your lack of courage.
Please stand up for those with pre-existing conditions! We all will get sick at some point.

These American families took a risky road trip with one goal: to save their health care http://cnn.it/2v46gLW  
We care about you saying "No" immediately on this giant Tax Cut that is trying to be passed, so 175,000+ WV's don't lose health coverage.
Don't sell your vote to Mike Pence - tantamount to selling your soul to the Devil
Plz protect your constituents from #Trumpcare. 

@realDonaldTrump has filed 6 bankruptcies.  

He survived, but can they?

#VoteNo

Correct the @GOP is morally bankrupt.
This is not the Republican party from the Reagan era, this is about greed not Country

What do you have to say to this woman and her friend?
Cancer survivor shares with staffers of GOP Rep. Lamar Smith a powerful story about how Obamacare helped extend the life of a friend. 
Do you have ANY idea the distress this is causing every day Americans,  using healthcare as a political football? PLEASE stop, and fix it.
AARP, AMA, Canc. Soc., and every major prof. group can't stand the  bill. Citizens hate it. Even insurers say it's awful. What are we doing?
The doctors, hospitals, citizens, etc. who are spending their time in angst to protest and lobby are relying on you. PLEASE VOTE NO!
Senator - nobody with a brain believes that Ted Cruz is authoring a bill  that is going to help the 99% of us, and POTUS will sign anything.
Are you trying to justify supporting a bill that will kill thousands. You can't be serious. Loyal republican or Patriotic American? Which??
Fantastic news. Please #VoteNoBCRA so WVians who rely on Medicaid now and in the future, are protected. We need BIPARTISAN leadership now.
Vote NO. That does nothing for WV in the long run. Drop in the bucket.
Thank you for protecting WV folks - and this country - from the terrible BCRA. Your no vote on weathcare bill does so much for US families.
Please do the right thing and oppose this non-health bill.
And Evans need you to vote NO on motion to proceed with Senate healthcare bill!!
I agree with the other comments.  Vote no
What about Medicaid???? Trumpcare will destroy WV! Vote NO!!
Thanks for supporting community health centers! But #TrumpCare cuts threaten CHCs: 36% of WV CHC patients use Medicaid! #VoteNo #ValueCHCs
I love that your tweets keep talking about health care. Let's hope that means you will be making the correct choice on #BCRA for WV's health
Please be on the right side of American history and Vote No for this terrible Healthcare bill that will hurt millions of people!!!
Please defend America and vote NO on #Trumpcare, it would be a dissster for America and you dont want your fingerprints on it.
Question for any Republican reading this who voted for Capito: Are you for/against the #BCRA & why? Should she vote for/against it?
It's called a job arch.
.@SenCapito Millions of Americans in WV and beyond are counting on you to vote NO on #BCRA. Our lives depend on it. Please don't sell out.
Please vote no on latest version of #Trumpcare. It takes away dollars from #Medicaid, which will force many rural WV hospitals to close.

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
What is your decision on #TrumpCare? People or party? Decency or despotism? Health or wealth?
Did you sell your soul to McConnell to get that funding?   I hope not.  #resist
Expanded Medicaid too? #SaveMeCapito
Benedict Arnold hailed from Connecticut but betrayed the ENTIRE country, you are a W Virginian and are about to do the same. VOTE NO #BRCA
