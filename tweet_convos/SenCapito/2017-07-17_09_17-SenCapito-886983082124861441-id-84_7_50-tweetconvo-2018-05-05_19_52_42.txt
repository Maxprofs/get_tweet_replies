@SenCapito @Sen_JoeManchin @WV4TRUMP1 #MAGA #BetterCare You have let WV's down.  We have had 169% incr in healthcare and u refuse to fix it!
This was known when the ACA passed... anybody who read it said it was a fraud...
No to Repeal please. Work on lowering premiums, drug co. costs and insurance companies.
Coal cause it helps your state . ACA cause it helps you
Why work with the dems at all? They ram thru what they want when they are in power. Quit pretending you have opposing views to Reid/Pelosi
SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU @SenCapito!! You should have spoke out & said "NO" way before now on behalf of ALL WOMEN
How about a bill that encourages the conversion of coal-fired power plants into Solar plants. ACTUAL clean energy and better pay.
One thing @wvdemocrats need to know is Capito is a spineless wonder who talks about saving WV's Medicaid but hides when she has the chance.
Your friend, Susan Collins, on the other hand is a hero and will go down in history as a role model for young girls in our country.
Oh my goodness! You got that right! She's strong as hell, she isn't afraid to represent her folks! That's called integrity!!!
Is there such a thing as 'clean' coal-its still a fossil fuel making climate change worse - we need renewable energy
Ocare is destroying American taxpayers and small business please repeal ocare now
Bipartisan actions are most needed. Most voters desire collaboration & compromise of 2 party government. Thank you! 
Alright, the health care bill is dead. I know you like waiting until bills are dead to come out against them so, now would be a notable time
This heartless bill was created in secret by a dozen old men who didn't give one hoot about women or the poor, many of whom live in WV.
How about you get the miners back to work and help your state and not try to do something that will bring no jobs
Nice, but get some of those coal miners green energy jobs.
You have the wrong letter next to your name
You are (D)
Please look at solar, wind, and other green options.
GO HOME NOW
Or on clean renewable energy like wind and solar? So many great jobs in this new field. WV could be a world leader. Save the planet for kids
In other words not going to keep your word.
Dig baby dig! Coal is the future of America.
Thank you for putting people first!
You've been quoted as saying that repealing without a replacement would hurt WV residents and be a bad idea
Senate Republicans who are ON RECORD against repeal and delay: 
Thank you for saying no on trumpcare! Im so proud of you!!
Don't you care? Are you so concerned about your political standing that you have lost your sense of decency in the process? So disappointing
I really thought you were going to step up and say "No!" to Trumpcare, and yet you remained slient. That saddens me greatly. Think of others
There's no clean coal. Thousands of solar jobs being created but you ignore them. That's pathetic.
#CleanCoal is an #Oxymoron.
I'd love to see you grow a spine and speak out about TrumpCare. @SenatorCollins might be a good role model for you.
SenCapito ask Apple and Microsoft to fund small campuses to allow your constituents to learn how to program and code with Corporations Tax $
Should have been brave
WV and all USA needs good health care to fight the opioid crisis. Trumpcare would fail good people of WVA and across the US fighting this!
Please vote NO to Trumpcare.  People will respect you more. Do the right thing. Please! The time is right! Right now!
Clean coal doesn't exist.  Wind, solar is the way to go.  Pay to train coal miners in Green energy.  It's a better investment.
Looks like you missed your chance to publicly vote NO so we will just have to assume you were willing to sell out your constituents. Shame
Waste of money...? Natural gas is cleaner and cheaper.
DUMMY, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS "CLEAN" COAL...maybe less dirty!
Agreed. Bi-partisan hc bill. Most urgent, most needed. Step up 2 the plate. Never did USA  need courageous determined senators more
You should be rallying against this bill. It destroys your constituents.
Uninsured rate increases 300%.
What about health care??? Why can't you stand up and lead like @SenCollins? It's time for you to put your constituents above party politics!
#CleanCoal?
Really?

#MountaintopRemoval
BTW:
I got your #CleanCoal, right here...
The #uninsured rate in #WV will TRIPLE if #TrumpCare passes.
#McConnell will shut down amendments.
You ready for 300% more uninsured voters?
Bipartisan solutions would save healthcare and you could claim you did it to correct the evils of Obamacare care.  A win win.
300% more people will be uninsured than before if you vote yes. Are you that evil?
BCRA's impact on uninsured rate in the main wavering senators' states:

WV +299%…
I hope that is short for working, not twerking. Although that might get a quicker better solution if the senate had to twerk until passage.
Please vote no on trumpcare. Rich people don't need tax cuts. Poor & disabled people need their healthcare. Why do rich ppl need tax cuts?

Whistleblower Tarref Simon needs help in bringing attention to the VA. https://twitter.com/refee00/status/880540730174967810 …
Healthcare bill ? State your position to this cruel bill?
Stop it Shelley Mo! The direction is forward not backward! #forward
And does this program include some of the same policies that you and Don Blankenship spewed against?  Tell the truth. What does it mean 4 WV
We love BIPARTISANSHIP and hope you will continue that with health care.#VoteNoBCRA #killthebill BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS NOW.
I applaud bipartisanship.Please work with DEMS to improve healthcare for West Virginians-Vote NO on BCRA
So, you are still a NO on TrumpDontCare, right? I mean, you didn't make a deal with Mitch, did you? This bill will harm WV.  You know that.
Last I heard she was a no. Are they trying to buy her?
She isn't talking. There are only 2 solid NO votes right now.
Unconscionable. Lives are at stake. Vote no!
Thanks for this! Please also consider NOT supporting the @GOP health care bill. It leaves millions of Americans without coverage.
What we need is bipartisan solutions to healthcare NOW. BCRA is NOT a solution. It creates new problems!
How about opening back up the plants that were shut down
Called her office. She is still reviewing the current bill. Call (202) 224-6472 demand she make her position known.
Now that it's safe, she'll come out against it. She has to have political cover. Still not sure what Mitch has on her. #hesaysjump
Agree
Healthcare bill? Remember that?
THIS BILL DECIMATES MEDICAID.  WEST VIRGINIA COAL MINERS WITH BLACK LUNG WON'T HAVE INSURANCE ANYMIRE, BECAUSE IF YOU.  VOTE NO.
Clean coal? You have one job right now for ALL the citizens of WV: save their healthcare. VOTE NO ON BCRA.
Billions in taxpayer dollars are spent to subsidize the coal industry.
Oh, come on....
A miner who gets sick and loses his job may quickly lose healthcare while NO safety net would remain for him or his family. Please vote NO!
The healthcare bill will greatly raise premiums for middle class and destroy healthcare for the vulnerable and low wage earners. Pls vote NO
You must be a Dems,or have free http://insurance.Insurance  is so high now you can't afford it.Obamacare deductibles so high you can't afford it
Better still. Form a bipartisan group to work on healthcare Americans actually want.
There is no such thing as clean coal! How about making WV the leader in solar and wind!
What planet you live on?I didn't think we was no farther than space station
Bipartisan. Nice ring, right? Thank you @SenCapito
