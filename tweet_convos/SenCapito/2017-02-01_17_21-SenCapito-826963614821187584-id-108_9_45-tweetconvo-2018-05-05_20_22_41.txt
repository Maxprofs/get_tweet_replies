.@SenCapito @RepMcKinley @RepEvanJenkins @RepAlexMooney We do have to drink the water here in Coal country, Senator. #DisgruntledRepublican
Water is Life!! Wake up!
We can add in @Sen_JoeManchin  here since he supports it with the other 4...
Thanks, we don't need clean water. We'll put coal in all the water. We'll even water plants with it. Plants crave coal.
WOW. You do not care about birth defects in WV children?!
http://time.com/4657438/congressional-republicans-environmental-regulations-coal-streams/ … so is this what "harmful Stream Rule" means...
you know this isn't right. Protect the jobs, don't destroy the environment.
Pay for play. Dirty coal and oil payoffs.  Miss More wins.
To my reps: You are failing this state. I'm glad I'm being forced to leave&never come back to get a job in my field.
I regret ever voting for either of you.
How is protecting our water harmful? How is allowing secret dirty oil payouts right?
Disgraceful
You can't possibly care about water in West Virginia
Explain how Obama's law was harmful, yet dumping mining debris into water is not?!
just what we need in WV- LESS restrictions on clean water. Whose side are you on?!
I see Miss More pocket $$$$!
.@SenCapito doesn't want West Virginians to have clean water but does want the profits from the coal industry.  Noted.
#VOTE2018
Who needs streams anyway? Right? short sighted votes do not help WV.
Please consider a no vote for DeVos!
Vote NO for DeVos
harmful? 
that makes it better for WV
Oh now we're out of harm's way? Thx for showing us who you care about--industry first
Interesting choice of the word harmful. Polluted water isn't harmful?
Cuyahoga River burning due to industrial waste. We don't want to go back to this!
Who needs clean water anyways? How soon we forget - 2013 #waterislife
I'm sure you are, Ms. Rich Out-of-Touch Greedy McSouless. Have fun destroying WV and her residents!
"harmful stream rule"? I think it's the coal companies who are harming the streams in WV. Pollution is not an "alternative fact".
Shameful you've put wishes of corporate sponsors over health of constituents. We won't forget, if not dead/dying.
how will we protect our water and the people/wildlife that use it from coal dumping? Keep WV beautiful and healthy please!
celebrating dismantling of protections is disgusting
You all suck
What can I say? Coal and WV. You have never represented me. And maybe you don't represent them?
So disappointed in the stance you're taking to work for coal companies over WV citizens. We will remember.
Harmful to who?  Explain how protecting clean water is harmful!!  Only to wallets of those polluting our streams!
That so-called "harmful stream rule" protected our drinking water and forced companies to treat our great state with care. SAD!
Good job helping to poison WVs water. How do you even get elected? #sellout #notmyrep
Stop being so weak ..this is humiliating .. wrong ..WV demands your support !
have you no #shame? There are towns in WV where everyone's thyroid had been removed..
thanks to pollution from mining run off. #climatechange #coal #FossilFuels #Health
and what a shame for the residents that will impact.
vote NO when this goes to senate. This will destroy our ecosystem farmland and future
"Harmful" to who? Our water? Our people? Oh, the mining companies. Thanks?
join your 2 other female colleagues and vote no to DeVos.  She is no good for education! @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski
Don't poison our waters in WV. Not worth the jobs if you make everyone sick.
I like clean streams. Don't you?
If you vote yes on DeVos, you will betray every family with a disabled child. Please, think of the most vulnerable. No on DeVos.
You guys gotta drink the water too. Shame shame shame
How can having clean water ever be a bad idea? Bad Priorities!
how can you be proud of this?  Us WV folk have to drink the water here in our state
an embarrassing capitulation; short term profit over human health & the environment
explain how the stream rule was harmful please.
please vote no on DeVos !
those darn streams are so evil. How dare they.
Ma'am:iWe the People ask you to review the IDEA and fact that Ms.DeVos doesn't know what it.is or how http://important.Vote  No

#PeopleBeforeProfits
@SenCapito @RepMcKinley @RepEvanJenkins @RepAlexMooney

@SenCapito @RepMcKinley @RepEvanJenkins @RepAlexMooney
Really thrilled you have decided to poison your constituents water supply.
WV's best natural resource is its beauty and pristine wilderness.  You are letting coal companies ruin it for short-term profit.
have you forgotten the water crisis in Charleston circa 2013...bad move.
Do the right thing, vote NO on Devos!!!
Again I urge you to vote NO on DeVos, Price and Sessions
Awful. No, not Obama's stream rule. You 4 who celebrate ruin and destruction. Shame!
OUTRAGEOUS
you can't drink coal
vote NO to DeVos - our kids future are on the line
you are so wrong
thanks for polluting our water! Your voting public was against it Way to work 4 them! Disgusting. Votes list 4 u
PLEASE vote no for Devos!!!!!!
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
Also, how about saying NO to the highly unqualified Devos. At least Pretend like you care about who you represent.
You're glad?!? I know you don't seem to get it, water is more important than coal.
Please consider voting NO TO BETSY DEVOS
Water is life.
Because clean water is not important to life.  Be pro-life after birth.
harmful?!?? That would be you. To our environment. What a joke you are, Senator.
Disappointing!
You're so proud of poisoning our water...
vote to block Trumps SCOTUS pick. Do what's right for WV and Block Devos for Ed.
clean water is harmful? This alternative facts thing must be contagious.
You sold us and the ecology of WV out. You don't represent WV interests just your own
As a constituent, I am disappointed. You're on the EPW: an environmental committee!
- awesome SHELLEY!!! Now you can poison your constituents & perpetuate WV COAL LIFE!!
Dear Senator, please vote NO on DeVos. I urge you to investigate her failed experiment in MI. Unqualified!  Thank you!
After #aquapocalypse,  you vote this way? Responsible Coal Mining: it's our health!
-COAL is dead!  Time to re-train & educate workforce. Shelley keeps herding the gullible miners/sheep along.  SAD!
until they are trained and educated the miners need something to do in order to support their families
- no one has a plan to train & educate them - that's the problem.  Shelley has no plan.  Coal's dead - sorry
no need 2 b sorry. Not a fan of coal or Shelley (as of late). WV missed the mark when they forgot 2  create a plan B
Because clean water is overrated?  You will not be reelected.  Fraud.
how can we help
We need a dem to run against and we need to start door to door letting folks know how these republicans have sold WV out.
You must not live near an area that get run off from Fossil Fuel operations.  @RepMcKinley @RepEvanJenkins @RepAlexMooney
I am against having inadequate representation as my/our Secretary of Education. If you can hear our voices #saynotodevos
- Shelley doesn't care about dat edumacation thingy!!  She got dat coal & guns!!  Go WV!! #SwampCabinet
Harmful? You ever seen what mining does to our drinking water? Then we can talk harm.
Yes we should celebrate the poisoning of our streams for the sake of corporate profit
Seriously? Protecting our water is far more important!
You have no moral compass, you're selling our resources to the highest bidder.
so you're polluting streams & poisoning your constituents http://midwestenergynews.com/2013/02/20/research-finds-additional-harm-from-coal-dust-exposure/ …
vote no on Devos! #DeVosvote do what is best for WV
Perfect! Poison more of your fellow WV'ns. Water is precious and you don't even get it. Throw WV under the bus!
Looking forward to taking thousands of tourists rafting in Coal sludge. They only bring in 10s of millions $$ 2WV
Yes, thank you for making money more important than water. Who needs water anyway?
Farmers in WV say Thank You!
God forbid he tried to protect clean drinking water. You're another paid puppet...
