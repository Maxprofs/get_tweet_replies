How about you don't cut healthcare. Our seniors and disabled matter. #votenotrumpcare
Great to save health care clinics for poor, but what are you doing to make productive taxpaying citizens have better, more affordable HC?
...22 million without healthcare and some will die because of the senate bill....is this the right bill?
and how will you be able to vote for a tax cut when you have taken "life" away from Americans over money?
Keep the momentum up & vote NO on the senate bill. Then work to repair the ACA. @VigilanceJCWV @PersistResist2
WVA elected Trump and you voted for repeal 18 months ago.  You will not be re elected.
"Supporting"
Please vote no on tne Trump health bill.
Why won't you tell us the scoop on how U will vote on the mot'n to proceed on @SenateMajLdr 's outrageous TrumpCare bill? U know it's awful.
U know it will result in an avg premium increase of 108% in WVa! And that it will cause 118,100 real people in WVa to lose coverage!
U know this tax-give-away-4-the-rich will result in 77,300 real people in WVa losing Medicaid! U know 26,900 WVa kids will lose Medicaid!
U know 34,500 folks in WVa will lose private insurance! U know WVa will lose $1,795,000,000 in fed healthcare funding!
U know this will devastate the healthcare market place because key insurers told the senate YESTERDAY that this will happen! 


What on God's earth are U waiting for? You promised to protect WVa & you said you would cast the deciding vote if necessary. It's necessary.
VOTE NO on senate healthcare bill!
CBO Score = Devastation to WV!
CBO projects that Senate bill cuts Medicaid by 26% within 10 years, by 35% within 20 years https://twitter.com/vp/status/885946066075602944 …
What about the healthcare bill? State your position!
She's being silent, because her yes vote is being bought ofg.
Or she is waiting someone else to vote no so she doesn't have to state a position. Capito has got to go. We need a real representative in DC
These Senators are bribed, given millions to vote yes.  Look into it, called SLUSH funds, illegal, they're scumbags, criminals
Vote against healthcare bill!! If this garbage bill is not good enough for you, Americans don't want it either! Be a true patriot ~ VOTE NO!
Health Centers rely on Medicaid, Senator. This funding will not offset the devastation that #TrumpCare will cause. Vote no. #SaveMedicaid
Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people in West Virginia are counting on you to protect them. Please vote no.
Congratulations nice step on health
So you are voting against #TrumpCare? You said you would, but now you're back to "reviewing" it.
Stay Strong, Stay Unpaid and Unswayed by McConnell.  Please vote NO to this atrocious legislation.
Do your job or someone else can do it for you repeal and replace

These American families took a risky road trip with one goal: to save their health care http://cnn.it/2v46gLW  
Please vote NO on the updated BCRA!
Great to see, also be sure to support WV by voting NO to #BCRA - we're counting on you, @SenCapito

I spoke with Foxborough resident Chantel on the phone recently. She’s worried about what cuts to Medicaid would mean for her son's health. 
Vote NO for this horrible bill. Your constituents and your country are counting on you.
Please consider with the adjusted ted cruz bill, lots of us still wont be able to use health centers. VOTE NO!!! stand up to the lunacy !
Great! Continue your commitment to WV by voting against the repeal. It would neg impact WV's most vulnerable & decimate rural healthcare.
#Trumpcarekills
If you vote yes on this death bill ur party can never claim you are PRO-LIFE again u will be a party of PRO-DEATH
Please vote against any health care  that will harm West Virginians!
The best thing you can do for #Healthcare in WV is oppose the horrible bill! Please keep your promise!
Great! Now please also vote for #wv when you kill the #BCRA. 
#SaveMeCapito
You going to vote for a bill that will kill Americans ?Take away MA from poor elderly disabled.? A bill U Senators will be exempt from ?
You work for US not the other way around. Overwhelmingly WV says NO to this disastrous bill. Vote for us! Vote NO.

True support for WV health care will be shown in your vote on Senate health care bill.  Only a NO vote will protect our care!
Please vote for WV and not GOP!  Be the 3rd NO vote.  Have courage.  Make a difference LEAD!!!

‘There is no plan B’ - this woman is battling stage 4 cancer and Trumpcare at the same time 
Oh, and by the way, stand up for impeachment before we all suffer irreparable harm!
Chew on this: 83,700 of your constituents in WV will be losing Medicaid if you vote for this insane bill. Do you care? Vote no!
Dear Senator - let's not do the smoke and mirrors routine. This is all great, but a NO vote on the current healthcare bill is what we need!
Please vote against this bills procedural vote   you've held strong so far don't disappoint your constituents.  #killthebill #teamjanice
PLease vote no on this disastrous healthcare bill. Our lives depend on it. Put people over party!
Please oppose this bill. Medicare will still be decimated. How will elders afford nursing home care?
Please vote no on this disastrous trumpcare bill.  #killthebill
West Virginia (Shelley Moore Capito): 83,700people losing Medicaid 
History will not be kind to the GOP who legislate murder
WV appreciates this funding. I'm also glad you've expressed strong reservations about @SenateMajLdr 's horrible bill. Stay strong. Vote no.
Medicaid call it what it is taxpayer-subsidizing healthcare for druggies and losers don't like it I'm a West Virginia taxpayer wage earner

Vote NO and stand up for us!

Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage."

That's like giving your dog a treat then kicking him across the room. #Shame
Will this make up for supporting Trumpcare?  While Under great pressure to vote yes, this is your chance to stand up for people, not party.
Please vote against this dreadful bill.
#SaveMedicaid
No short term deals at the expense of WVIANS healthcare. Don't let them take our healthcare away. All experts even ins co know BCRA is bad!
Senator must be a great job if you're willing to sell your soul for it.
Do you plan to vote to destroy West Virginians' Medicaid and save Obamacare just for yourself? There is NO other question or excuse.
Are you leading up to justifying a yes vote on #BCRA, which cuts millions off their health insurance? I hope not
You have the right to purchase your own health care you do not have the right to get into my wallet in order to do it. Yes that is a period
SHAME ON YOU FOR ACCEPTING SLUSH FUND $ TO VOTE YES ON HEALTHCARE BILL.  THAT'S ILLEGAL.
What are you waiting for? Stand up for WV. If you do the right thing reelection won't be a worry. Vote No. stand up and be counted
