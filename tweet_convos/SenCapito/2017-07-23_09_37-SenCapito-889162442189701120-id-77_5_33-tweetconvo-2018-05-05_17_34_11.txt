Health care bill would  premiums & take coverage from thousands of West Virginians. RT to tell @SenCapito: #VoteNo 
I have a feeling capito will be looking for a new job if she votes yes on health bill
She is nothing but a puppet for the Rockefeller crime syndicate! She doesn't care that 75% of the state went with Trump campaigning  repeal
Who?
RESIDENTS OF W. VIRGINIA - Shelly Capito is taking away your Medicaid to give a tax cut for the rich. (right now)
After voting for motion to proceed earlier today, @SenCapito now also voted TO BREAK THE RULES to make it easier to pass BCRA.

Are you smiling because you stuck a knife in our back and voted to keep obamacare.
Please don't let Trump intimidate you with his rant at the Boy Scouts. He is a schoolyard bully who needs to answer for crimes
Is #TrumpLackOfCare going to affect Kayleigh? Probably, unless she's wealthy.

.@SenatorCollins: GOP health care bill "could lead to insurance plans that really are barely insurance at all." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
Repeal Obama care. It has made the insurance companies richer

Local journalists need to ask her abt these increases in deductibles & premiums in WV b/c they are astounding
5- in West Virginia, @SenCapito, do you really think someone makin$25k wants to pay 4x what they pay today? How is that good? 
To simplify- just look as the % of change you will pay under ACA v BCRA/Trumpcare. That's unacceptable- there are lives behind those #s
We need a complete repeal, not a replacement plan
Did you tell her you were taking away her healthcare? Restricting her access to contraceptives? #sellout #shame #immoral #bloodonyourhands

#Medicaid & #CHIP cover 44% of children w/special health needs due to conditions such as autism, spina bifida & more http://kaiserf.am/2ur56vu  
U want2put your neck out on the line 4 this kind of person?
Please vote no on the motion to proceed! If it proceeds, the poor, elderly, kids, women (esp us w/defunding PP) are the most harmed
Remember how many people will lose coverage.  You will be part of this massacre.  Do you have daughters? Sons? You never know the future.
If you do not vote The Failing Obamacare out we vote you out.
How much more are Kayleigh (and everyone else in #WV) gonna have to pay for #healthcare once pregnancy isn't an essential service?

#Insane
Sunday thought: "He who gives to the poor will never want, but he who shuts his eyes will have many curses." Proverbs 28:27....VOTE NO!
Vote for clean repeal.
WE THE PEOPLE want Obama care gone.Please get on board w our POTUS & vote yes 2 rep. & replace. We the middle class ppl r being crushed w OC
Stop putting ur agenda b4 people who you are supposed to represent. Repeal & replace Obama Care. We can't afford the high premiums any more
Maybe it should be state by state. I live in CA, and the ACA works beautifully. Compared to when I paid privately, I have great coverage.
Does Kayleigh have health insurance? Did you ask her? Is she on her parents' policy thanks to the ACA?
Please don't vote for repeal and replace under with this new health care bill. You know it's wrong and horrible for people.


Did you tell her about that time that your dad got arrested and sent to prison?
If you vote yes on the disastrous trumpcare  you better remember who sent you there. A trip in the Force one?this belong to us not to trump
#votenoCapito
Don't hurt millions upon millions of lives by voting for Trumpcare. You said you didn't go to washington to hurt people-prove you mean it!

Wow. Catholic nuns: this is the "most harmful legislation for American families in our lifetimes"; it is "simply immoral" and not pro-life. 
Sen. Capito, have you seen the CBO projections for repeal or the abhorrent GOP replacement plan for healthcare??? How DARE You!  
Here are all of Sen Capito's office numbers. If you are in WV please call her & have friends do the same! #NoRepeal #SaveOurCare
Why would you vote for a health bill that is rejected by patients, doctors, hospitals, AND INSURERS? What sense does that make??
SHAME
Capito has decided to give a tax cut to the rich using the backs of W. Virginia residents. Over 210,100 RESIDENTS will lose health insurance
What happened to your concern about 200K constituents?
Bill hasn't changed but now has your support
200K constituents STILL get hurt
SHAME
Are you willing to defend 1st amendment & free press while your party's POTUS attacks with fake news BS? Stand up for journalists!
Former GOP senator: Resist the bullying. Don't vote for a mystery health care bill.
Vote No on MTP !
No one cares! Get to repealing Obamacare like you promised and stop pretending you're working.

Pouring rain will not stop the #ADAPTandResist campout to #SaveMedicaid at 1st/Constitution NW at Senate buildings. #ProtectOurCare 
did you explain how you could vote to ruin healthcare (and her future) this week?

If you betray your constituents by voting yes, you can be damn sure your days are numbered.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilcvby2tbA8 … Do you remember this?
The majority of Americans want you to fix the ACA & not repeal or replace.  Trumpcare is a genocide plan.  Millions of people will die....
Medical experts strongly oppose the BHCA.  Millions of jobs will be lost.  #peoplebeforeparty #CapitoVoteNo
Please cut all healthcare for non whites!!

NO NO NO on motion to proceed!  You will destroy ACA with NO replacement - Guaranteed disaster and you will own it.  Sell-Out!!!
Repeal Obama care. We don't want to replace it. Obama care was designed to make the insurance companies rich!

How much more evidence do you need from doctors, medical groups, citizens, & insurers to understand just how cruel this bills is? VOTE NO!
Sunday thought: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater is our own sense of well being." - Dalai Lama....VOTE NO!
Fox news is the best. I hope God blesses her with a long, prosperous career there all the way to retirement as she serves a grateful nation.
Who hates the bill? AARP, AMA & all legit professional groups, GOP Gov's, Citizens, etc. Insurers call it "unworkable." VOTE NO #Wealthcare
Your tweets suggest you are caving to pressure to pass the #Trumpcarekills bill.  No one in health care supports this bill.  Please LISTEN.
I can only hope she will have a career in REAL journalism instead of being another fake-news puppet on a string. May God bless her with real
You're selling her out if you vote for the bill.
Repeal Obamacare damn it
No one cares leather face liar. DO YOUR JOB AND STOP BLOCKING REPEAL
