Please vote no on #GrahamCassidyBill! Please put people above politics. Your constituents need you!

#GrahamCassidyBill 
Pay attention, Senator. Those voting with their words, will also speak at the ballot box. #NoGrahamCassidy  #NoTaxCuts
The truth...90% end up paying more overall for tax cut to the rich...!
At the expense of massive cuts to children's, senior's, & the disabled American's healthcare? Nope. We won't trade our lives for your wealth

No tax cut will matter if our healthcare is gutted...VOTE NO on Graham-Cassidy...it is obscene!

Increase the federal minimum wage! It WILL enhance WV growth. Ppl making more  buy more, Employers hire more. More $ collected 4 WV taxes!
WE WILL NOT STAND FOR G-C BILL!! UNACCEPTABLE! LIVES OVER SLOGANS! VOTE NO! AND STOP THIS NONSENSE! WORK W/ Ds ON ACA!! SHAME ON @gop!! 
Lives over slogans...love that!!
It's not tax reform. It's tax relief for the wealthy at the expense of every average WVian. Your support of this and ACA repeal betrays us.
We're a state where cancer has soared via toxins in the air, soil, & water. If @SenCapito votes for #GrahamCassidy #WV will be a graveyard.
Senator, I know you think we should follow you blindly.  The Republican tax reform will only benefit the top 1%.
Please vote no against the #GrahamCassidyBill and protect the ACA. WV's need the ACA.
I just found out Repub's want to pay higher premiums & throw the disabled, poor & their nan & paps off healthcare!

Please vote NO on the devastating Graham-Cassidy bill. America deserves better. We are counting on you, Senator Capito. 
You said you "didn't go to Washington to hurt people."  Good goal. Please vote against Graham-Cassidy. We need you!
By supporting tax cuts for billionaires, you're supporting #GrahamCassidyMurderBill to fund it. #VOTENO #WeWantToLive #WV
WV - Tell Sen Capito to protect your healthcare funding & vote NO on Cassidy-Graham.
How Graham-Cassidy redistributes federal money

Shelley Moore Capito, taking away Medicaid from 564K West Virginians to give the Mercers and Koch brothers a tax break. Is that your legacy?

People do not deserve to die because they can't afford healthcare.

This Is A Fight @GOP Cannot Win @SenCapito !
They don't jackass!  That law was passed in 86!
Say NO to GOP repeal of Obama care for all of us in WV
As a nurse your support of the Graham Cassidy bill will hurt West Virginians as they seek healthcare.
Sorta out of touch, Senator Capito?
Tax reform is the last of our worries.
Healthcare or early retirement.  Two choices you should be focused on!
Undertand who you represent. we work for a living. We need help, not tax cuts for wealthy in hope they will create scraps for us to share.
Please vote against Graham/Cassidy healthcare bill that deprives millions of healthcare & removes protection for pre-existing conditions.
Hey, please focus on stopping the latest anti-health care bill. A bill that will hurt WV'ians. Tax cuts for the rich can wait.
Hog Wash!  You drank the Kool Aid again!
Trump's tax "plan" just more handouts for the rich...
Trump's tax "plan" is a handout for billionaires and corporations that would explode the deficit and set the middle-class back even further. 
STOP #GrahamCassidy !!!
Graham Cassidy: destroy rural care, drive up premiums & provide less coverage for fewer Americans.  It is a NO.  Senate can do better
Why is there nothing about Healthcare in this article? We need to know you care about the health and lives of West Virginians
The CBO just announced that the Graham-Cassidy is even worse than repeal without replacement. Bad for women, veterans, and elderly. VOTE NO!
Tell me ONE Mooore time how trickle down economics is so great. B.S.
Trickle down Shelley? Hasn't WV been "trickled"on enough?
This new repeal to ACA will hurt West Virginians and their families. Please remember - you did not go to Washington to hurt people.
Senator, Please stand up against #GrahamCassidyBill . Americans need healthcare!
It never has provided more jobs and it won't now, however, taking away the ACA will devastate our state!
ACA SAVED MY AUNT'S LIFE. MY 41 YR OLD FRIEND W/ BREAST CANCER IS TERRIFIED! WHAT IS WRONG WITH @GOP ?? WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS! VOTE NO!
Everybody call your senator no to trumpcare.
For once in your life, stand up for #WV, announce opposition to #GrahamCassidy now!

Under latest Repub 'healthcare' bill if you had an UNCOMPLICATED pregnancy in the past, your premium will go up 425%
Pro-birth, not pro-life https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/908725686311047168 …
Hold a town hall. Let's talk about Russia, sis. #TrumpRussia
BS
Vote no on Graham/Cassidy
4/ Massive funding cuts to states. States will either slash programs or raise taxes.
3/ Premiums go up for everyone. 20% in first year. Syrocket costs if you are 50+.
2/ Lifetime caps, annual caps, charging older people more - the greatest hits of Trumpcare - all back again in #GrahamCassidy
1/ #GrahamCassidy eliminates protections for people who are or ever have been sick. GONE. Insurers back to denying coverage for the sick.
If you're a Republican who says you're concerned w potential Medicaid cuts & u vote for #GrahamCassidy, you've been lying. It GUTS Medicaid
#GrahamCassidy = #Trumpcare plain and simple. Say NO!
#noGrahamCassidy (McCain may not be there to save the day this time. We're looking at you to do it!)
Nope! Cutting taxes on 1% & Corps does Zero2help most people!
ACA repeal will gut our state and there will be no need to worry about the taxes none of us will be able to pay when we are dead. SAY NO!
West Virginia would lose $554M, not to mention countless constituents losing coverage, lives. VOTE NO on GC!
@lisamurkowski @SenCapito @SenatorCollins Will Murkowski & Capito take healthcare high road or look out    for only their personal benefit?
@lisaMurkowski   Will Murkowski save healthcare or did Don the Con buy her off????
Tax cuts for the rich will do NOTHING for jobs. Do your RESEARCH
Now your on the right track
Senator, the numbers are awful for WV. And where's the CBO score? Vote no on #GrahamCassidy
FINALLY found Shelley Moore Capito to ask her about Cassidy-Graham.

She was noncommittal, said decision would come down to numbers for WV.
Please vote no on the Cassidy plan and protect the ACA, which is helping West Virginians! Millions will suffer if the Cassidy plan passes!
All you have to offer is the tired lie about the imaginary war on coal and the cruel failure of trickle down economics.
Shut your lying Medicaid face. You already turned your back once on OC repeal
Hey @SenCapito please actually help WV and vote "no" on #GrahamCassidyBill. Don't mislead us like you did last time. We're watching you.
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy. New name, same disastrous "health care" bill that will harm millions. #NoGrahamCassidy
If tax cuts benefit only the rich,  forget it. Your worship of the monied class will lead to a depression and misery for the middle class
Democrats should focus on what they CAN do, like finishing the book, "Healthcare and Welfare for Dummies". @Sen_JoeManchin @SenateDems
Don't cave on healthcare! We have faith in you!!
So would your active and open support of our President. Republicans like you drove him to work with Democrats.
Graham/Cassidy bill does not cover pre-existing. Insurers can mark up costs $$$$$$$$. If you are 50+ you will go bankrupt!  VOTE NO!
The Graham-Cassidy @SenateGOP "health care" bill IS Trumpcare, & it will rip health care away from millions of Americans. VOTE NO!
Sorry Shelley but your constituents are more concerned about you stopping #GrahamCassidy right now. Tax reform to benefit the rich can wait.
How will it bring back the coal jobs that trumpy promised? Can't believe nothing he says.
Giving the very rich tax cuts  & allowing insurance premiums to raise for people with preexisting illnesses will hurt thousands of WV folks.
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
. What are you doing about healthcare? Are you supporting @LindseyGrahamSC Bill Senator Capito??

I was honored to speak with you @refee00!! Thank you and you are truly a courageous #Whistleblower. I hope our interview goes viral!! https://twitter.com/refee00/status/899469441230139392 …
