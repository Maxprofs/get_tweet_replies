1. Reject all gun lobby money.
2. Pass meaningful gun legislation.

Save your #thoughtsandprayers.
Portland, Maine - thank you for playing NIMBY
Strangely, people all over the country don’t think other people should get shot by losers with gun fetishes, no matter where they live.
What can you tell me about hunting in the ultra rural state of West Virginia?
Well Melissa, as a Marine, I can tell you a semi automatic weapon should not be the weapon of choice for hunting, even in West Virginia.
I'll tell my 25 year old son he's no longer allowed to take his R25 hunting anymore a different Marine said so.
Good, he should learn to shoot, especially if he needs a semi-automatic rifle to do it. Send him my way, I'll teach him if I have to.
He only uses a single shot. He loved the gun. It's a .308
Stop taking money from the NRA and make a real change
An Oregonian! One with a potty mouth in his pinned tweet. Nice.
Your point?
She represents my state, buddy. You're acting like a political bot. Or is this your job: shill?
Not a political bot. Or working for anyone. I'm tired of watching people die, and lobbying influencing the lack of action taken.
Then tell people to quit converting to Islam and joining ISIS! Guess what!? They took credit an hour ago.
If that's even true,  doesn't mean politicians are free to do nothing about it.
You have NRA blood money on your hands
A mom from Colorado, how nice! Sorry to hear about the autism. I'm going to be a grandmother so I need my guns for defense and hunting. Thx!
You need automatic weapons with 90 round magazines to shoot a deer?
Automatic weapons are federally banned. Semiauto aren't. Twitter isn't a forum for the debate.
Time to immediately outlaw bump stocks. Then pass more strict gun laws. 33,000 Americans per year are killed by guns.
#GunControlNow
YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE!
U want words? Here let me helpU #GUN #Preventable #Regulation #leadership #WellRegulatedMilitia #LasVegasShooting curtesy #NRAGOP
Maybe less prayers and more action. Stop letting money rule over human beings lives.
Please immediately pass a ban on assault rifles and silencers
Instead of offering prayers, just be honest and tell them, "Thank you for your sacrifice on behalf of the 2nd amndt, and the NRA"
Shove your prayers! Enact gun control laws to protect those first responders you pray so hard for! And for 22,000 people just shot at!
I'm sick and tired hearing about prayers. Do something worthwhile like banning assault rifles and better gun control.
Thank you, Senator. Does this mean you will fight for #GunContolNow?
the only thing that can stop a bad guy with 19 guns is a senator with a conscience. but we know what senator graftito is all about.  
Your prayers are empty and useless. Stand up to the NRA and save American lives!
Come on, Shelley. I know you really DGAF (ask your kids) since you take money from the NRA. Take the $90k blood money and DO SOMETHING.
This 2A tragedy, once again, proudly brought to you by the @NRA and @GOP
Oh look! Another Left Coast Lib! NIMBY ugh
Your statement is hollow and barren. Platitudes you hope will assuage your guilt as you professional from the $ paid to you by killers.
How about you pray that you find a goddamn backbone and pass sensible gun laws so this stops happening.
Prayers and mourning don't help. Laws and regulations do. #SendBacktheBloodMoney
Not the response you were expecting huh? 
You have @nra blood money on your hands. Your words ring hollow.
Praying is not enough. Your acceptance of NRA $, vote against gun control, and helpless hand-wringing make you culpable. DO SOMETHING.
STOP PRAYING AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT GUN CONTROL!!!!!! Blood on EVERY Republican's hands!
I mourn your vote against banning gun sales to terrorists on no fly list days after Pulse nightclub shooting.
Once again, our leaders can only offer their prayers and platitudes. When will they do something to abate this gun violence
Thank you.  Thank God for the first responders off and on duty.  Praying for the loved ones.
Without gun control legislation your words are hollow. DO SOMETHING, DAMMIT!
Give back the $$$$ have you no conscience  ?
I hope you will support Sen. @SenFeinstein bill to ban "bump-fire" stocks. they have no purpose other than creating an illegal auto gun
Do something for those victims. Vote NO on the #shareact
I am one of your constituents, do you work for West Virginia or the NRA?
Your prayers are an abomination until you enact #guncontrol #gunlaws rhat prevent this kind of terrorism. Hypocrite!
You do not need to pray, it is too late for that. Action is called for, we the people want automatic weapon & arsenal control
Do something besides release a statement full of empty platitudes.
Don’t mourn act pass strong gun controls
And once you're done praying, how about you get to work on #guncontrol legislation to prevent the next tragedy?

#DoYourJob 
#LasVegasShooting 
#GunControlNow
So DO something. Vote NO on the SHARE act.
Another non-West Virginian kvetching
These tragedies are preventable. Pass robust gun legislation to keep our country safe.
Is it true you got > $95k in #nrabloodmoney? So you figured then that each victim in LV was worth $146. Better than @SenatorLankford's $9/ea
What did you spend the $90k on from the NRA?  A car?  Is it a nice one?
How about also doing something useful, like supporting common sense gun laws, to prevent this from happening in the future.
Sooooo what do we do now? Where do we go from here, Senator? #fuckthenra
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
How dare you sully the memory of those lost with your inaction. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
And just how much money$$$ will you get paid by the NRA for your lame statement? #guncontrol #NRATerrorism
#SendBackTheBloodMoney

.@SenCapito received $94,261+ in expenditures from @NRA. She sound send these blood $$ back AND *DO* SOMETHING TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE https://twitter.com/SenCapito/status/914856866332790787 …
Not a word about guns. Just like Sandy Hook. And you say NOTHING about the guns and gun culture. Why people hate DC. Time to go, Shelley.
Send back the NRA #blooddonation and work to fix this mess. #ThoughtsAndPrayersAreNotEnough  Oh, and Puerto Rico is still in crisis
#CHIP #CHIP #CHIP #CHIP #CHIP #CHIP #CHIP #CHIP #CHIP
Condolences won't stop gun violence, sensible gun control will. We need elected officials to listen to what WE want, not the NRA #actnow
Can you say #complicit? Without meaningful gun control legislation you will have blood on your hands.  Do something.
Stop praying and start doing something. 
Rather than sending thoughts and prayers actually do something.  You have the power, you lack the will.
Plan on giving the @NRA $$ back? Or will you buy yourself something pretty to ease your conscience? Just another hypocrite. Do something!
Hey @SenCapito — that was not a rhetorical question. What are you and your colleagues going to do to prevent the next 50+ shooting victims?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney you contributed to this shooting by taking the NRA’s money and doing NOTHING to work towards stricter gun laws.
My understanding is that you accepted $94,261 from the NRA.  This is blood money.  Thoughts and prayers don't bring back the lives lost.
This means nothing if you don’t support common sense background checks for guns and ammunition. You don’t mourn lives if you’re killing them
You took almost $95,000 from the NRA. Your prayers mean nothing.
Bullshit.
And what's going to happen now? Nothing, because the NRA owns both houses of Congress.
Is it true you've accepted nearly $95,000 from the NRA? How can you care for Americans when you're so beholden to special interests?
Donate the $95K you got from the NRA to families of victims. It'll mean more that your prayers.
Can’t have it both ways. You CANNOT support NRA and extend condolences. Turn away NRA monies. Work for safety.
I don't care what some staffer typed for you, I care what you do. #SendBackTheBloodMoney #GunControlNow
How much money did you take from the @NRA?
spare us your phony concern. Pass gun control. Don’t legalize silencers. Stop blindly following the NRA.
LEGISLATE, DON'T SEND PRAYERS
you have taken 95k in blood money from NRA - STOP enabling merchants of death. start there.
Thank you for your prayers. Now do something so we don’t have to mourn so often in the future. #DoYourJob
Words without action mean nothing. Please #SendBacktheBloodMoney from NRA, then pass effective gun violence legislation
Stop praying and do something about gun violence.
Words mean nothing. ACTION means EVERYTHING! 
@SenCapito is your BLOOD MONEY serving you well?
So I guess the money the NRA gave u, u r going to donate it back to the victims for funeral expenses and hospital bills
Stop praying and do something, NRA supporter #LasVegasShooting rethink guns ban, don't act surprised if automatic guns are madmen accessible
Your words mean nothing. You are complicit as long as your only actions are to take money from the NRA.
ACTION!
NOT words.
Back real gun control now and #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You are in a position to prevent these tragedies, but instead you accept NRA blood money and do nothing.
You are an accessory to mass murder: http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Shelley_Moore_Capito_Gun_Control.htm …
You NRA hack, stop taking money from them and do something about #GunControlNow
Your prayers are empty hypocrisy unless you use your power as a Senator to stop future massacres.  Fewer guns, less deadly guns.  Now.
Senator, with all due respect, we need more than prayers from our leaders right now. We need sensible gun laws that protect the lives of Americans, so tragedies like this stop happening. You've done the right thing before, please do it again.
EMPTY WORDS, EMPTY PRAYERS, EMPTY SOUL, ANOTHER NRA PUPPET  AND MONEY GRABBING DO NOTHING CONGRESSWOMAN.
We need something more.  All politicians ever offer are prayers and thoughts.  What are you actually going to DO in your position of power?
Give back the blood money

God’s reply to “thoughts and prayers” 
Ok #senatorcapitulator.  Ur anti-gun control & u broke ur word, voted 2 steal the victims healthcare 2 cut ur own taxes! No one believes u
Lame, insubstantial response. Stand up to the NRA.
You won't be losing sleep from that $95 K from the NRA. Why not do your job instead of praying? How about that? Don't just pretend to care.
Honey, you left off your address. How will the @nra know where to send your check?
You're a hipocrit and a phony. Lets talk about the $ you received from NRA and how you voted against gun restrictions. U R A Liar! #$$$$
Words do nothing. Give back NRA blood money and pass common sense gun legislation if you really care.
save us your #thoughtsandprayers, #SendBackTheBloodMoney and get to work on #GunControlNow
Your praying won't help much. Gun control will.
Tell us how you will vote for #GunContol how much money did you get from the NRA
Vote no on gun silencers and fight for stricter gun regulations. No one needs silencers or semi automatic weapons to go deer hunting.
Then do something besides take NRA money, you hypocrite.
How about more action and fewer words? These acts are preventable.
Stuff prayers. Put thoughts into action to stop this madness. Otherwise, you're a coward who values money and power over people's lives.
If you are truly saddened and weep for the innocent loss of life carried out by #DomesticTerrorist Stop taking money from the NRA.
Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
#GiveBacktheBloodMoney

let's trade all thoughts and prayers for the rest of eternity for some rational gun control and access to quality mental health care for all
.@SenCapito received $94,261+ in expenditures from @NRA. 
She should #SendBackTheBloodMoney 
AND *DO* SOMETHING TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE 
That's it? Can't wait till you're replaced.
NRA check in the mail!
You got 95 thousand+ dollars in expenditures from gun groups this year and voted against gun restrictions. YOU CAN HELP PREVENT THIS
What are you going to do to prevent future mass shootings?
You should be reminded every minute that your craven deference to the NRA makes you complicit in gun deaths.
I'll bet law enforcement would appreciate not having to run into a war zone in the first place. Will you work to pass sane gun regs?
You're statement means nothing unless you #SendBackTheBloodMoney you took from the NRA!!!

shelley capito got 95 thousand+ dollars in expenditures from gun groups this year and voted against gun restrictions https://twitter.com/sencapito/status/914856866332790787 …
Don't pretend this is last shooting. Don't pretend there is nothing you can do. 

Stand up for the next victims or stand down.
You voted against stronger gun legistlation. Stuff your thoughts and prayers you harpey. Do your goddamned job and stop taking 'donations'
If there was something the legislature could about this, some law they could pass. 

Or are you another pathetic tool of the lobbyists?
Blood on your hands. "shelley capito got 95 thousand+ dollars in expenditures from gun groups this year and voted against gun restrictions"
If prayer is an appropriate response to gunfire, go stand down range during target practice, praying away and let's see how well you do.
I'd like to know your statement about what you did with the $94K you received from the gun lobby.  Worth it?

.@SenCapito received $94,261+ in expenditures from @NRA. She sound send these blood $$ back AND *DO* SOMETHING TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE https://twitter.com/SenCapito/status/914856866332790787 …
so put your compassion into some stricter gun laws.
I'll believe you're sincere when you denounce the NRA, return their blood money, and vote for sensible gun control.
You offer your “prayers” That’s it?? How about some sensible gun legislation. Not taking NRA money. Not being apathetic and acting! #trythat
A more meaningful statement would be a promise to act for gun control now. Will you continue to be complicit? We are watching.
You received nearly $100,000 from the NRA. Have they bought you? We want to see action. Save your prayers. Pass sensible gun laws.
$94,261 from the NRA. WE SEE YOU.
How's about you return the $95K+ you received from the @NRA? Does that come with automatic thoughts & prayers? #bloodmoney @igorvolsky
And no mention of the 94k that the NRA paid you. Get that money i guess!

I pray for you. How do you sleep at night taking $ from the NRA
And frankly, this makes your stance on opioid addiction hypocritical. Death is death, no matter the means.
Is it time to talk about assault rifles w/high capacity magazines? Asking for 50+ innocent dead people. Also, are you for gun silencers?

You've taken almost $100,000 from the NRA. The blood of hundreds and hundreds of victims is on your hands. Have a nice Monday.
.@SenCapito Awesome statement. Now what LEGISLATION will you pass to prevent the next one??


You have over $94,000 worth of @NRA blood money on your hands that will NEVER wash off! #GUNCONTROLNOW
So you accepted @NRA blood money? Unless you donate all of it, you are to blame. #GunSense #LasVegas
Praying doesn't fix a damn thing! Pass reasonable gun control measures, and stop being a rubber stamp for the NRA!
Yes, what she said, @SenCapito & @Sen_JoeManchin.  Get to work on gun reform!
I don't want prayers from Congress, I have that from my church, what we need from you is laws, Stop taking NRA money and do your job
How about you send back the blood money the NRA gave you and stop serving up American citizens like a Christmas turkey to any nut with a gun
Do you just have a pre-typed form all ready to fill in the details on mass shootings in the US complete with standard BS prayers?
Nope. You took @NRA's money. This is completely disingenuous
You, @Sen_JoeManchin, & others in Congress must work together w/public health experts, law enforcement, etc. to pass sensible gun control!!'
Didn’t you vote to allow mentally ill people to own guns? Even semi-automatic weapons?  That makes you complicit. U have blood on your hands
Your prayers won't stop this from happening again. Especially when you continue to take money from the NRA
.@SenCapito received $94,261+ in expenditures from @NRA. *DO* SOMETHING TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE
Stand up to the NRA! Take meaningful action instead of taking money and looking the other way! #LasVegasShooting
GUN CONTROL AMERICANS WANT GUN CONTROL
This is your fault you have taken almost 100k from the NRA. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You took gun lobby money - your statement means nothing. Save your breath.
Please stand up to the NRA and their extreme agenda. We need common sense gun legislation. Start by voting no on silencer bill.
You took money from the @NRA to finance this murder. The blood is on your hands too.
How many more people have to die? No one needs machine guns. No one needs assault rifles. NO ONE. Stand up for our very lives! #rejectNRA
Hey Shelley...   do you think you can maybe NOT take $$ from the NRA and do something constructive to stop this?
.statwment meaningless as long as u take NRA $$ makes u complicit we need laws not cheap disingenuous #nosenate4uin18
Yet, your party supports the gun silencer bill.
What are you going to do about gun violence in this country?
How about common sense gun control to prevent our lessen future tragedies. The time is now. The NRA is the enemy of the people.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims' families and friends of this terrible terror attack! #LasVegasTerrorAttack
Thoughts/prayers meaningless w/o action! Start by getting colleagues to vote no on SHARE Act, which would deregulate silencers.
It is time to do something instead of just praying. How many innocent lives need to be lost before we make a change?
Again with the prayers. It does nothing to prevent these senseless tragedies! How will you vote this week on allowing silencers? How did you vote for gun rights for mentally ill? Non permit concealed carry?
Blood on your hands, Senator.
DO SOMETHING BESIDES HIDE BEHIND NRA IF YOU REALLY CARE
Stop doing something to lessen gun violence in this country. Looking for one concrete ex of something you will actually do.

Action, not words. #BanTheNRA
Senator, your statement is hollow until you denounce the NRA. In the meantime, wash that but of blood off your hands
#LessPrayingMoreDoing
Not one word from you about gun control. You are a puppet of the NRA.
Can we have a serious talk about gun control now?
Sure those condolences will mean a lot to victim families when this happens again and again because you and others are in the NRA's pocket.
Please do something about guns in America! Start by getting your colleagues to vote no on the SHARE Act, which would deregulate silencers.
Turn down all gun lobby money, push for common sense gun regulations, and these prayers might mean something. #GunControlNow
YOU can do something about these tragedies. #SendBackTheBloodMoney & let the @NRA know you value people over $$.

My statement on you working over the American working taxpayer and supporting the drug heads
