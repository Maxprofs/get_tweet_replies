You are ridiculous! Funds are going to be cut if you vote for the #GrahamCassidy bill. You know this. It should be an easy decision then!
Adult Stem Cells can be the best Heath care !
How would u have voted on #GrahamCassidyBill ?
Why doesn't your aides answer citizens calls? You supposedly work for WV so vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill! Don't betray WV.
Your staff isn't answering calls. Does this mean you are going to vote to eliminate health care in the state...again?
All I got was a receptionist that offered to take a message. Wouldn't put me through to any staffer. Capito works for US, she should listen.
All I get is an answering machine.
Exactly. Thinks we won't remember.
If history is any indication, if it dies she will claim she would have voted no but I don't believe her. She's a charlatan.
If you have a hoot about community healthcare, or any healthcare, u'd vote no on Graham Cassidy
Vote NO on @LindseyGrahamSC not good for WV r America we need Medicaid do the right thing this time don't cave
Vote No on G-C Bill.  Kasich calls McCain "conscience" of GOP. Where's your conscience?  Party or people? I think we already know.  Sadly.
Listen to West Virginians and Support Cassidy/Graham
Are you going to again cave to DonaldTheTerrible (who is not at risk of losing healthcare) or are you going to say NO! to @LindseyGrahamSC?
Another great way to ensure community health centers are able to provide care now & in the future would be to #VoteNo on Graham-Cassidy.
..That's great, but what's your stand on #GrahamCassidy? Loss of Medicaid hurts WVians of all ages - and all clinics.
We need affordable insurance!
Respectfully, voting against #GrahamCassidy would also be an excellent thing to do.
Then vote no on Graham-Cassidy...
Vote NO on graham-cassidy 

It's a terrible bill that will hurt the health of people in your state and America.
Do you know what would be a help to rural community health centers? You announcing your "NO" vote on #GrahamCassidy. #VoteNoGrahamCassidy
Vote no to Graham's bill on health care. 2018 will be critical for how u voted.  WV needs their health care. Vote no.
Please vote NO on Graham/Cassidy
Thank you. But please protect the thousands of West Virginians who depend on Medicaid. Vote no on #GrahamCassidy.
We heard you are supporting the work to stabilize insurance, thankyou very much Senator! Keep pushing for sensible smart ideas 
They will be closed if you vote for Graham Cassidy.  May want to rethink your commitment to the party.  #foodforthought
Healthcare is critical.  The promise was for repeal and replace with something better.  Where's the better?
Nursing homes are also at risk with Graham Cassidy cuts to Medicaid. And yes, there are cuts when you spread same money to more states.
Please vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill. West Virginia can’t afford to lose healthcare and seniors can’t afford to pay more.
Searching for your statement on the Graham-Cassidy bill, where same located? Vote "no".
Senator, PLEASE don't abandon West Virginians! Americans need your support! #NoRepeal #SaveACA #WeNeedHealthcare
Interesting you acknowledge the need for health care funding, but you have yet to disavow the horrible G-C bill that will cost WV billions!
.@SenCapito I don't want higher premiums & worse care. Protect care for people like me in WV #VoteNo #GrahamCassidy
No guarantees on gouging for pre-existing conditions.
Please vote no on Graham Cassidy. WHY IS EVERY HEALTH ORGANIZATION AGAINST ? Doctors, nurses, hospitals, insurers all against. VOTE NO.
Will you vote to save WVians w/pre-existing conditions from being priced out of coverage, hitting annual & lifetime limits? #GrahamCasiddy
Say  NO to Graham-Cassidy. People can't use the health centers if they don't have insurance. Represent the people, not your wallet.
If you really care about critical health status in WV Senator you will vote NO to Graham Cassidy.
Great but all women and kids need your NO vote on #CassidyGraham. Those health centers WILL CLOSE if this bill passes.
Remember you said you didn’t go to Washington to hurt people what do u think this bill will do people will die so I hope your vote is no
U don’t  want to be that vote that destroys America’s healthcare system no CBO score going in blindfolded is totally irresponsible
Please Vote NO to #GrahamCassidy
Please vote NO on #GrahamCassidy.  Let the bipartisan committee do its work.  This bill would mean death for hundreds of WVians.

Good call! Hope you also vote against GC. You didn't go to DC to hurt people, right?
Please make sure you vote No against that horrible Healthcare bill that will not help WVians!
CHCs are also #Navigators & do outreach for the #ACA so don't repeal it or you're undermining their jobs, people & the communities they help
How is our great state going to cope financially, if you vote with your PARTY on their cost slashing Healthcare policies?   Vote 4 WV'ers!!!

Not even kidding. Vote NO!
Hope u can help save the healthcare bill get it passed and then both sides can work together to make it better
Your recent actions don't imply that you care about the people of West Virginia having access to health care
Then #VoteNOGrahamCassidy so they can stay open.
Why would you request this if you are voting yes to repeal? That's like cutting off your own feet then asking for new shoes
Thank you, but the fact that it’s down to the deadline is an example of poor mgmt, and a lack of concern for the plight of the providers!
You know how you can help West Virginians? You shouldn't even have to think twice. Show you have a conscience and vote no for TrumpDontCare.

Please keep critical health benefits alive for WV and all of America -- vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
Hiding again, not taking calls?  Hoping McConnell will pull bill so can hide.  Spineless not to make a statement.  Worst quality possible.
Community health centers across the country will be devastated if #GrahamCasiddy is signed into law. Please vote no, senator.
Fake news
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy Be a leader for once
CAPITO, COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI HAVE ALL BEEN BRIBED.  THEY'LL ALL CAVE IN AND VOTE YES.

Says the guy from mountain men
#GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare

Please also vote #NoGrahamCassidy 
#KilltheBill
And what happens if Graham-Cassidy passes?  Would be horrible...the moneu to fight opioids is no longer included I believe.
Without affordable health care those clinics are useless.
This is great effort, but don't get away from that horrible Heath Care Bill your Colleagues have wrote up. Vote No on that..
CAPITO'S A SELL OUT.  HER VOTE HAS BEEN BOUGHT.
Then please vote NO for G/C. It will be devastating for the people of WV. Let's move forward not backwards with healthcare.@lisamurkowski
