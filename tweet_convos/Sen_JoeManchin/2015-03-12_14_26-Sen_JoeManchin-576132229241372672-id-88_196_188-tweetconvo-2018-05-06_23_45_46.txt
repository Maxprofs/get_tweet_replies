@Sen_JoeManchin glad to see you strongly oppose the Constitution of the United States of America... #turncoat
@JustinReese001 @Sen_JoeManchin when the Constitution was wrote, blacks and women couldn't vote. #outdated
@GBPackerFan80 what's your favorite bear arms? Grizzly? Polar? Mines Kodiak
@Sen_JoeManchin I know now Your a Obama Ass Kisser. You don't gave a Dam'n about WV
.@Sen_JoeManchin Let me teach you something. Anyone 18+ in WV can open carry without training why would they need it to wear a coat?
@EersNation @athomm77 @Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin Why in the Hell you need a class for conceal carry and you don't for open their isn't any difference except one's CONCEALED
@Sen_JoeManchin. I thank you for supporting gun safety. Now when are you going to support marriage equality for same-sex couples? #LGBT
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for your voice of reason regarding responsible gun ownership and common sense requirements for concealed carry.
.@Sen_JoeManchin are my 4 years in the Marine Corps worthless defending the Constitution? Your so-called #gunsense infringes my rights.
@EersNation @Sen_JoeManchin dang I didn't know you served. Thank you for serving!
@miketanzey I did. 01-05 as an Ammo Tech in the USMC.
@EersNation that's awsome. Thank you
@miketanzey No need to thank me. Im out now but still trying to make a difference.
@EersNation that's still good man. No matter how long you served its still helping defend our country to keep us free
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for your oppostion to SB347 and your common sense. Don't give up the fight for gun sense.
@Sen_JoeManchin wow, all I can think is wow. You are have surpassed Charles Manson as the worst West Virginian history. You should be banned
@Sen_JoeManchin If that's how you feel, I strongly oppose you ever winning another election in WV.
@Sen_JoeManchin Obama's done put the big black one to him and he Loved it. Can't you tell by the way he Walks Talks and his Lips
@Sen_JoeManchin #gunsense following the bloomberg $$ and not the WV constitution... again.
@Sen_JoeManchin @Everytown next law from manchin, ban ropes and cars. http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/24/suicides-account-for-most-gun-deaths/ …
@Sen_JoeManchin @MomsDemand How did he vote in the US Senate on the same issue? @Bradybuzz @shannonrwatts
@Sen_JoeManchin so were ALL considered guilty? What part of shall NOT be infringed do you NOT understand? Criminals carry anyway, law or not
@Sen_JoeManchin Sorry, Joe. I think you meant #guncontrol.
@CaidenCowger @Sen_JoeManchin do you think those two regulations should be removed, Caiden?
@Sen_JoeManchin Bloomberg Money spent against law abiding WV residents. ads on the internet, postcards in mailboxes
@s4pat @Sen_JoeManchin 

.@DLoesch help us tell .@MikeBloomberg to keep his money and minions out of our state!
@Sen_JoeManchin did @MikeBloomberg write that for you or just give you an outline #gunsense
@Sen_JoeManchin @MomsDemand  No one should carry any weapon without being properly trained, especially for CCW holders
   #evolvetogether
@Sen_JoeManchin hey senator you are in the wrong state to be holding that line; Mountaineers just don't take kindly to that treachery
@Sen_JoeManchin And what evidence led you to this position?  Surely you had your staff do some research and question what "Everybody knows"?
@Sen_JoeManchin when you have to have a piece of paper to carry a firearm that is an infringement of people's rights.Are you that stupid?
@Sen_JoeManchin Hey Joe if we want to hear from a Ass Hole We West Virginians will FART
@Sen_JoeManchin @NegronDoc Thank you, Senator, for having #gunsense! As you may have noticed #WV is going backwards!
@Sen_JoeManchin What stops a criminal from carrying concealed?Nothing
@Sen_JoeManchin you supported federal reciprocity for conceal carry without required training? I like you Joe but you're killing your future
@Sen_JoeManchin Keeping your promise to Bloomberg?!?
@athomm77 @Sen_JoeManchin Why yes, yes he is ..
@Sen_JoeManchin @cordlesslever so open carry without permits/training is safer? Not valid.
@ScottCaserta @Sen_JoeManchin Yes.  Especially for those of us who choose not to carry.  Also for law enforcement officers.
@cordlesslever if you choose not carry, you should hang with those who do ;)
@ScottCaserta I choose not to be afraid of everything.
@cordlesslever what life is about, choices. They should never be taken away.
@ScottCaserta You can make any choices you want, we don't need to make the state laws agree with your choices.
@cordlesslever wish it were that simple. Government continues removing "our choices". Oh no I didn't :/
@ScottCaserta It's not like they're holding a gun to your head.  No need to get up in arms.  
@Sen_JoeManchin do u really think bad guys try to get a permit??
@ledtear @Sen_JoeManchin do you really think "bad guys" were born "bad guys" ?
@DerekRCasteel @Sen_JoeManchin that makes no sense...
@ledtear @Sen_JoeManchin your reasoning of "bad guys" not needing one so you shouldn't doesn't make sense.
@DerekRCasteel @Sen_JoeManchin prevent anyone from concealing a gun - except for those who obey the laws...
@ledtear @Sen_JoeManchin let strict gun laws makes it easier for a normal person to BECOME a "bad guy"
@DerekRCasteel @Sen_JoeManchin what if they are carrying a hammer? Is this likely to make them a bad person?
@ledtear @Sen_JoeManchin well let's look up how many hammer related homicides there are compared to guns. See: Sociology.
@Sen_JoeManchin Did Bloomborg ask you to say this? How about requiring a permit to express your views outside your home?
@Sen_JoeManchin Obama is New Hitler Senator's Like Manchin are his Loyal Soldiers. So Down With Hitler.
@Sen_JoeManchin Vermont had it all along. Lowest gun murder rate. Another Manchin sellout to DC liberals
@Sen_JoeManchin  Layne Diehl must be a manchin Ass Kisser blow hard Dem don't you say people.
@Sen_JoeManchin  So that's what a Bloomberg handjob costs.
@Sen_JoeManchin 2nd amendment be damned. WV has very high % gun ownership, yet very low % gun crime, proving it's NOT the guns! #sellout
@Sen_JoeManchin "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed" You oppose the US Constitution?
@Sen_JoeManchin you're not a West Virginian. Stay in Washington where you belong.
@Sen_JoeManchin show us your permit to use Twitter. we can't have citizens tweeting W/O training & licenses. you might say something stupid.
@Sen_JoeManchin why do we have to pay and have a permit for the Second Amendment right. We don't need a permit for our 1st Amendment rights.
Solution is to incentivize the training you believe is necessary, @Sen_JoeManchin. Not to attack the rights of those you represent #gunsense
@Sen_JoeManchin you go ahead and "oppose" that bill..W.Virginians now know what a traitor you are.
@Sen_JoeManchin Most W.Virginians started teething on firearms. They have forgotten more than you know. #knowyourconstituency
@Sen_JoeManchin how much did Bloomie give you? What's the payoff?!  You are bought and paid for...and everyone now knows it.
@Sen_JoeManchin @demkeJN Joe needs to quit hanging with Bloomberg & those who attack WV, 1st Repeal of Cap & Trade, now 2nd Amendment!
.@Sen_JoeManchin Care to explain why open carry needs no permit while concealed should?
@Sen_JoeManchin @Everytown and this is why he won't ever hold office in WV again!
Where in the 2A are such requirements by government permitted?

@Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin Because you're a fraud when you say you suport #2A. You are a stone cold fraud.
@Sen_JoeManchin @Everytown I have CC and FFL Dealers license. There is hardly any training now in Ohio for CC. VERY unqualified CC people
@shannonrwatts @Sen_JoeManchin whatever it takes to get elected..
@Sen_JoeManchin Your job isn't to oppose local legislation, Asshole. Your job to rep your state at the national level.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you.
@Sen_JoeManchin @kharyp don't u know your right to life is trumped by some irresponsible idiots 2nd ammendment wet dreams @Senate_GOPs
@Sen_JoeManchin YES! Another gun owner with gunsense. Thank you Senator. #gunsense
@Sen_JoeManchin @momschange It's hard to believe we are even having this conversation.
@Sen_JoeManchin Great, because after AZ removed the permit requirement, our crime went down... But I'm sure you think AZ is better than WV.
@Sen_JoeManchin Now go get your treat from the gun control lobby like a good little lap dog. #ManchinHates2ndAmendment
@Sen_JoeManchin @Everytown When are you submitting the bill that requires felons too get training & background checks? #gunsense #URADumbass
Ah, snap! SCOTUS already said that's unconstitutional, @JMar254. Looks like we'll just have to defend ourselves. @Sen_JoeManchin @Everytown
@dr_evileo @Sen_JoeManchin @Everytown & https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales … says police department could not be sued under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for,   con't
@dr_evileo @Sen_JoeManchin @Everytown  con't. for failing to enforce a restraining order, that led to the   Con't
@dr_evileo @Sen_JoeManchin @Everytown Con't.  MURDER of the woman's three kids by her estranged husband.
@Sen_JoeManchin  Get dafuq out of my Congress.  Your job is to preserve and defend Constitution, not join forces w/ nutbags to ignore it.
@CrackaPrivilege @Sen_JoeManchin Exactly. Joe is just a tool for Napoleon Bloomberg, needs re-relection funds #2A #NRA #SupportThePolice
@Sen_JoeManchin No permit works fine for AZ. When we dropped ours nothing changed. No point in restricting Constitutional rights, for fear.
@Sen_JoeManchin Sellout. Keep poking the bear. Your gonna need more than "twee buwwets" #ElmerFudd Go move to NY or CA where your kind are
@Sen_JoeManchin Permit & training not required for OPEN CARRY, so please explain how wearing a coat changes everything for you.
.@Sen_JoeManchin Of course you do. Elections over. Do criminals need CCW permits? Asking for a friend.
.@Sen_JoeManchin maybe NewTown changed somethings but as of yet it has not changed the Constitution.
@Sen_JoeManchin you know who else had an A rating from a gun related group? #2A
@Sen_JoeManchin Who do you support for gun safety training/programs/classes for youth and adults?
@Sen_JoeManchin Yet people who open carry without permit shouldn't get training? Doesn't make sense. Constitutions -state and federal agree.
@Sen_JoeManchin you are not one of us anymore #MountaineerNation #CommonSense #NRA
@Sen_JoeManchin ..I agree Senator. It is already scary in the state now it will frighten you, if they pass the bill. FIGHT it please.?
@Sen_JoeManchin WV is an opn carry state. I cn carry a gun on my hip n walk down th st, but of it's chilly out n I wear a coat I nd trnng???
@kc8ysl @Sen_JoeManchin He is already done in WV and he knows it.
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you very much
@Sen_JoeManchin 1 of 2 things that we agree on now.
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you saying that.  Law enforcement really disappointed in wv legislature.  We can do better at exercising common sense.
@Sen_JoeManchin  once again, you show your loyalties to the anti gun groups.  You, Sir, are an example of politicians gone bad!
@Sen_JoeManchin Toeing the party line in DC instead of what's best for West Virginians again? Stay out of state politics. You fit in w/ DC.
@arpierson @Sen_JoeManchin ouch!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thankfully our reps heard the will of the people.
SB347 Passed the Senate 32--0-2 and Passed the House 71-29-0
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for your #gunsense
@Sen_JoeManchin 2nd amendment doesn't say you can bare arms with a permit and training... No infringement period
@CoalMiner_88 @Sen_JoeManchin Things it also doesn't say: bare arms. #Gunsense period.
