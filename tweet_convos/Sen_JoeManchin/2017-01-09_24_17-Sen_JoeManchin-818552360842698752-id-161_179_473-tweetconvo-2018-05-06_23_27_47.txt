Senator, what will you say when his idea of "leadership" strips them of their healthcare?
in the words of Ronald Reagan...shut up
so...you want me to "shut up" because I asked an elected official, who works for ME to answer a question about health care? GTFOH
and you think tweeting will help. Letter writing normally works better
I was totally just waiting for a random stranger to explain Twitter and letter writing to me. Thanks for being that person.
you're welcome
both of my grandfathers died of black lung. terrible death after years of illness. Coal= deadend
I see you have a very large vocabulary and command of the English language.....
Lol!
Your area needs retraining for clean energy  jobs.
so sad you betray America
The era for coal is over. Time for clean energy to save the planet. You can't  have it both ways.
Patriots all over this nation stand with coal miners, WV, & President Trump! Thank you Senator-
they will be dead from no healthcare for black lung. Awful.
when so much of you pop is old and addicted to opiates why should the US back a region that died long ago?
You're stuck in the past.
While stripping them of Insurance to help with Medical Cost for their Black Lung Disease, RIGHT Senator.
@Okie08 @realDonaldTrump I want to see Pikeville strong again!
@DJTforCatholics @realDonaldTrump you might want to run your joy past the natural gas industry.
JoeManchin @realDonaldTrump
@wvgazettemail realDonaldTrump
Senator Manchin deserves DT folk America's absolute RESPECT for his Bi-Partisan efforts, KUDOS!!!
Trump is not showing true leadership. He tweets insecure, maniacal insanity daily. He also lies daily #notmyprez
says the man that will do anything to preserve his daughter's wealth, at the expense of at risk children.
Give it up.He lied to you.It's not coming back.Machines work harder, longer & cheaper. #facts
Perhaps you could admit mining is not viable and work on new industry for mining communities? #DoSomething
I love West Virginia and Donald Trump
will he keep his word???
coal mining is dead and deadly. mining relies on automation. be real. solar and wind create REAL jobs
Ugh!  That is disgusting.
The coal jobs aren't coming back. Cheap natural gas and smog in China doomed the industry. Be honest.
Kiss Ass! Plus you're ok daughter makes $$$ off of children w/ allergies. When was your lobotomy done? Where did Joe go?
Seriously, you are the worst. SWITCH PARTIES!

Who will pay for their healthcare when their lungs turn black?
.@Sen_JoeManchin i know u r up for re-election in 2018 but must u sell ur soul 2 the baseless djt msg of hate, bullying? How does that feel?
Joe, you are too smart yo stay w/ Dems party. They have left you and me, mid America to the left coast.
just join the GOP already. DJT cares nothing about the miners. He's already got their votes.
U mean they don't need #SS & #Medicare?
Please senator hear our voices help us train for new jobs forget coal its not coming back green energy is the future.
The coal industry is dying and your taking down WV with it. We need to invest in new opportunities to save our state.
You're days in the Senate are numbered. Working with the traitor @realDonaldTrump is a political death sentence. #WePayYou
You have "Sucker" written all over you.
will u quit sucking up to this bigot!??  U make me sick!  
U claim ur a Democrat!  ACT LIKE ONE!  Sheesh!  U don't work with unapologetic hateful miscreants like him!
For all you dunderheads a new system has been developed where coal exhaust is scrubbed.
Manchin has always been the normal one..The only normal one but he's got it,
Hey Joe where ya goin with that shovel In your Hand, Gonna wack Pelosi Obama caught them messin My coal miner fiends/
A "True Leader" would not lie to them, would help them retrain for modern economy.
Joe, you are a D. Kiss'n up to DJT won't win you election. Get a backbone and tell your voters the truth.
FUCK YOU BOTH! 
Any questions?
If you want to fight for coal miners, fight to get them better jobs, healthcare & a future for their kids!
Dumping ACA & crippling unions doesn't help miners & their families, it helps mine owners.
You're a Conman!
You're not a Democrat & true progressives can't wait to primary you.
is this some kind of JOKE??
You are either lying or delusional.
you are insane.
he is going to take their health care and cut social services welcome to Don's world
.@Sen_JoeManchin are you drunk? @realDonaldTrump
Dying industry taking the miners w/black lung w/it
he's not doing a damn thing, but you continue to show your true colors
I wonder how thrilled the Senator is that  put Wilbur "Sago Mine" Ross in his cabinet.
Coal is dying. Move on.
I would feel sorry for the miners but I think they let hatred & ignorance rule over common sense, so no. Too bad for them.
anyone fighting FOR the coal industry is like someone fighting to put lead in the water like flynt
Manchin is a Pathetic Excuse for a Senator. Trump doesn't care about Miners or anybody else.
coal mining is a terrible job. why would you want to promote that? what's next? asbestos insulation?
Senator, we, your constituents know the real score here. What are you saying?  Please don't run for office again
u r foolish 2,believe coziness w djt will be reelection tool.  We r watching u&gathering ground troops to throw u out 2018
Also fighting to rebuild the horse and buggy industry?
God bless you sir
Will work 4 the conman man @realDonaldTrump  &
#MAGA work Again
it time 2 focus on we the people 
REPEAL & REPLACE OBAMACARE
You also want to get rid of a whole industries worth of jobs while you are at it with legalization
you're  a loser Manchin &I hope you get booted for siding with a nitwit.Of course u r a teapub (no dem)
when they lose health care and social security I think they will start to see they were lied to
spoken like a True Republican Joe! You're counterproductive!
@wvpublic What did you have to give Consol in exchange for handing your son-in-law a cushy job at Fairmont Supply? #magaNOT
why don't you just switch over to Republican!
How have you not switched party affiliations yet? In no universe are you a democrat and you never have been.
u r a decent man, don't ruin ur legacy by shamelessly standing with a @realDonaldTrump train wreck. #howhistoryremembersyou
Seriously? Black lung? Stripped country? Idiotic
you're delusional
Kind of sad that Republicans will selectively make exceptions to their own draconian agenda. Coal is done.
Coal Miners need to stop looking for a handout and adapt to a changing economy. Broaden their skill set.
Hey Joe pls I ask to help #MAGA work with Trump I hate it when it's my way only Politicians should look up to you not afraid
Keep up good work Joe. If he supports #MinersProtectionAct you have stick with him!  No more fence riding.
he will say whatever to garner support. He doesn't support MPA. Few Republicans do
You are pathetic truly and don't deserve to call yourself a democrat.
Hopeful news for thousands of retired coal miners.
please don't take that man's side
true leadership and Trump don't go together...
thats because Trump is for the people and @POTUS is for Hollywood.
How is he helping miners by cutting ACA & funding for BLD? Really Joe Switch party affiliation. Jobs r gone
.@Sen_JoeManchin shame on you for being an accomplice to the Russian puppet!If Osama would've eleced him would you still be ok w/it? #BLOTUS
Clinging to Coal is what has kept WV 48/49/50 in every economic category my entire life.   We need forward leadership in WV
You are just keeping the lie alive. Please switch to Republican already.
.@Sen_JoeManchin by siding with @realDonaldTrump you're revealing yourself as a #collaborator. WV voters will remember.
,, because natural gas has taken the market, because automation in mines. Sure whatever you say
stop pandering to miners and tell them the truth about coal.
Cough #Cough #BlackLung disease until the #ACA is repealed. Too bad fellas.
still lyin to the miners that coal jobs will return #CheapNaturalGas #Automation #NoDemand4coal #retrain
Love seeing bipartisan efforts.
when is your "Bring back the horse & buggy!" campaign starting up? Dead industries don't come back. Sad
coal is still here. We're struggling but it will never boom again. They made false promises.
is this 1960. Coal is almost dead folks.
Day drinking shouldn’t be a thing for senators.
Coal is a dying industry and all you're doing is prolonging its death knell @realDonaldTrump
...really...are you fucking high??
Wake the fuck up.
You mean fight for air pollution,global warming,miners' deaths in mines?Look at what coal has done to China
Oh yeah...
*sniff sniff* 
Joe Manchin looking out for his Political Ass, if it helps constituents..so what

Just a reminder of why we're poor, and what leadership we actually need:
Eastern KY destroyed fifty years ago via strip/regular mining, has never come back.
by cutting their blacklung treatment & shutting down redevelopement.  The problem should sort itself. 
turncoat

Who you selling coal to? Home depot? Lowe's? Kingsford?
How's your daughter, CEO of pharmacy co that holds patients who need life-saving EpiPen hostage by increasing its price sevenfold?
thank you we need all th help we can get
We desperately need to help coal communities, but take care that pols are actually helping
TRAITOR JOE , !!!!!!!! .
You'd be serving them better by educating them that mining is dying & aiding them to find something else.@realDonaldTrump
Some WV dems are trying to do that: https://goo.gl/fKUFs2  Not @Sen_JoeManchin. He gets paid not to do that.
sad part is that was Hillary plan. Those voters were 'scared' by retraining.
how come DJT was silent about healthcare extension you were fighting for a few weeks ago?
resign
Are you two gonna put the final nail in their coffins?
.@Sen_JoeManchin, you do realize that there coal mining deadly? Right? https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-172/pdfs/2011-172.pdf …
His constituents do. But he gets paid not to notice.
Yep
.@Sen_JoeManchin, coal isn't the answer but there's lots of wind power in WV. Imagine building factories for blades and other components?
You are not helping mining families by clinging to a dead past. Solar & wind are WV's future.
Yup. Resource extraction=poverty. Resource transformation=wealth.
Whom is joining who?
Coal is not coming back. Serve your constituents better by being honest with them and help them transition to other jobs.
Agree with u 100%.Should help these persons changeovr 2 service positions
.
.
Fighting to hurt them?
.
.
Manchin is not rep. of WV dems, no matter what he says.
so now help him MAGA
grovel, grovel, grovel.
The Democrat party is the one who has trashed miners and tried to put them out of business. Despicable.
in WV our democrats have fought very hard to keep mine safety laws. Rs have cut safety laws!
have you considered your constituents who depend on the ACA?
because coal is the new "green energy"?
that is why he is taking their health care away in gratitude.
