Senator, why not switch parties? You just don't fit the democratic platform anymore.
This is why FreedomParty calls on Sen Manchin to lead the Democrat Party!
u, sir, r a sell out democrat! How much did ur soul get u?
pragmatic, sell out same difference! Look at bs around WH! Better to stand on HONOR
Thank you @Sen_JoeManchin for being the only prominent Democrat to work with Trump. @foxandfriends @POTUS
*sigh* I just have no more words for this DINO! Please let a strong Dem primary against him.
a strong progressive would wipe the floor with #JoeMannequin
Trump business doesn't pay his bills and files bankruptcy. Wake up!
sellout!!!!
#JoeMannequin is a coal cuck without an original thought in his head. Worse than sellout
Fox News and voting yes for Sessions...?? You just nailed your career in the coffin- U chump!
Joe I hope you talk more about getting our miners #BACKS to work. You represent them. Do us proud.
You spend more time defending GOP then wht 'your party' stands for. Today you called yourself an (I). Very well then LEAVE!
listen Joey joe...from one joe to another. Stop kissing Donald's overly large ass.
Seriously, why is there a 'D' in front of your name? You looked like a giddy schoolgirl cheering on #FakePresident

#ManchinTRAITOR to Democrats

Are you a closet Republican Manchin? We're beginning to worry. No to Clean Air and Water?
@BreitbartNews JOE: R U switching parties? UR disloyalty is seen. Fox&Breitbart? U should be ashamed. U R not a D.
Democrats will work to defeat you.

Still giving @Sen_JoeManchin a chance; however, have a tally going and that tally is tied to @realDonaldTrump.

@realDonaldTrump America needs more DEMS like @Sen_JoeManchin. What a good and decent person! @SenJohnMcCain should TAKE HEED
America needs more principled Conservatives like @SenJohnMcCain. @Sen_JoeManchin should TAKE HEED. ...See how that works?

working for our Veterans 
$125 B UNACCOUNTED FOR UNDER OBAMA..where's the "special investigation" to why & to whom this go to?
thank you for actually working WITH this administration
The Senator's initial comment about SMEAR MERCHANT Chuck (CHUCKY) Schumer is total BS.
I am happy to see at least 1 democrat working for Americans
Sen Joe is what an elected official should, bipartisan, he puts his people first, wish he was in Va
Shameless fence rider and self/all things Manchin promoter.
glad to see you actually fighting for all Americans and not just the dem party.
How's about a trade. Joe Manchin for Susan Collins?
who's taking odds on potus prevaricating & invoking election/EC results? Be Very Very Wary
dems could use more like you, keep up the good work.
after this stop on to Breitbart??  You're a joke.
#BROADBAND4WV
Please switch parties Joe and be done with it!
We need clean water,the Affordable Care Act, a president that doesn't blame his inability on others.
Like Hillary and the DNC blaming everyone including RUSSIA for the loss? Like that?
#Dino
