No comment on Trump's Muslim ban? Shameful
how about actually paying attention to the issues at hand instead of burying your head in the sand?
Nice murder of that totally unsuspecting animal. I hope your proud just like any TYRANT supporter should be.
really? This is what you care about right now? You better speak up, senator! You and Capito will NOT be reelected.
put freeze onall present landowners taxes. Substantially raise land taxes onall new transactions frm outofsta
congrad
You're a fraudster who is GOP masquerading as a democrat. #VOTEMANCHINOUT
I hear you'll be voting for Tillerson. Where's your spine? .
Good to know nothing important was happening. Your priorities are not with WV or our nation Senator #muslimban
disgusting
With everything happened right now, THIS is what you decide to tweet about. As a WV, I'm appalled.
glad you're paying attention.
what is your position on the Muslim ban?
Don't you think there are more important matters to be tweeting and supporting than hunting?
great job on the animal killing! What are your thoughts on humans?
Seriously, U tweeted about hunting while your colleagues debated an executive order that caused mahem in the US
Disgusting!
Are you going to continue to pretend to be a @TheDemocrats like so many other Democrats do?
So great that in the middle of a crisis precipitated by @POTUS you are glorifying killing.
Silence is the coward's refuge. Refusal to speak out against Trump's unconstitutional ban does not absolve you.
Why are you tweeting about this instead o answering the phone, and defending the constiution?
in light of #MuslimBan why are u voting yes on Jeff Sessions? People R watching, & taking notes 4 next election
you seem to get it.If the other dems don't stop the nonsense more dem seats will be gone. Push Schumer he doesn't get it
coward
Great! So why are you voting for a racist AG?
coward.
While citizens are illegally detained in the US, you post this shit? Say goodbye to reelection.
Senator, do you really think it is appropriate to be silent about immigration right now? Cowardly, man.
Congratulations indeed! Wonder if he has any immigrants in his family... Why the silence, Senator?#MuslimBan
Senator, your silence about the #MuslimBan is deafening. Many would appreciate hearing your thoughts.
Speak up and speak out about Trump's immigration policy and the destruction of our foundational values, man!
Seriously? Tweeting about hunting rather than engaging with the #MuslimBan? Please share your thoughts on the subject.
I believe you are the only dem that has not come out against the Muslim ban. Time to make a statement
Cant believe that u support this disgusting sport and the fact u have not said a single word about #MuslimBan
We will remember your weakness in the face of travesty. You are the ONLY Democratic senator to NOT speak out in opposition of the #MuslimBan
Senator, we're waiting to hear from you on Trump's #MuslimBan as the last Dem. Senator. Isn't it of any priority to you?
so glad there are more important things than refugees to speak out on
silence means you are complicit   Thinking maybe you could spend more time in real issues related to your job???
glad you find time to tweet about this while u stayed silent on the ban? This will be remembered come time for re-election.
wow, he still hasn't commented on this?
You seriously have said NOTHING about the events this weekend?  So glad the buck stops with you...NOT!
I couldn't be more embarrassed to have you and @SenCapito representing me and my state. You are cowards backing a racist.
Did you forget what party you belong to?
I'm disappointed you felt this was worth taking about and not the #MuslimBan Your priorities seem wrong
Gross. Ur congratulating him 4 murdering a living being. Where are u on the #MuslimBan? #ResistTrump #PresidentSteveBannon
You will have a lot of time to hunt the big bucks come 2018.
Too busy straddling the fence? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hSGjyWJZIQJpGz4V2ftX_qioCgBtL59oJkkhx146nFE/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0 â€¦
your silence shows how little you think of your constituents
oh yes Joe I am glad you were on top of this
You silence in regards to recent Executive Orders is cowardly.
Take a f-ing stand against this #MuslimBan instead of sharing bs like this when the country is crumbling!
Other DNC senators speaking out against EO!  WHERE ARE YOU???? Do you think WVians don't care? Big mistake! #NoBanNoWall
Your silence on the #MuslimBan is deafening. We will remember.
your silence speaks volumes #NoBanNoWall #RefugeesWelcome
U have not made statement about banning Muslims. Therefore ur in support of rounding up &locking up citizens.
are you kidding me?
.@Sen_JoeManchin  Doesn't killing the biggest & strongest while leaving the young & weak alive go against your core values?
WV's Democrats desperately need a strong voice in the federal government. Be that voice! Now is your time!
another innocent LIFE taken and you're proud of it. Do men still need to hunt to be a MAN.....little men!
Seriously? How about a statement on the #MuslimBan ?
will you give a statement against trump's muslim ban?
 Nice buck...
posts like this are why West Virginians are seen as ignorant. Protests at every major airport but LOOK A DEER.
We will remember your silence on Election Day
Pls focus on the important issues. Improve ACA, NO NO NO on Devos, fight against Trump's silencing scientists.
I think we should all remember how silent and cowardly @Sen_JoeManchin has been today.  I'm ashamed
Glad you're focused on the important news. Never mind Trump setting fire to the constitution before our very eyes.
.@Sen_JoeManchin where the line that Trump has to cross for you to do something? We all know he'll cross it! How many lives will it cost?!
Senator, as long as it seems you have some free time, could you also speak out in opposition to the immoral refugee ban?
I like trumps muslim ban.  He campaigned on it.   you knew i was a snake before you let me in!
Sad when senator shuns a WV woman that turned to him for help when being harassed by Manchins male associates.
glad to see you are focusing on what's important these days...
you take the time to talk about this but not #ACA or #WomensMarch or #MuslimBan or any other actually relevant things. #smh
This is totally more important than standing up to the Trump administration. Good job. 
SAD!
Why tweet about this? To distract from you caving to Trump?
Is Logan one of our bow only counties?
