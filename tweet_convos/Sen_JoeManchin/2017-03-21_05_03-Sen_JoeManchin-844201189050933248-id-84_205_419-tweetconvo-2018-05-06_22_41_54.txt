You already a republican. DINO.
he's friends with 45 and his family Benfits
@Sen_JoeManchin Joe voted to confirm Sen Jeff Sessions, I'm sure your voters would like an explanation for that doozy.
@Sen_JoeManchin I hope you do not ever go there Joe. Stand for the people Joe
And he does, though....
Or vote to confirm Gorsuch to SCOTUS.
@Sen_JoeManchin - Every time you start to escape from HRC debacle you put your foot in your mouth.
That Democrat President did everything possible to screw over the human beings in your state. That's the bottom line! Can't fix stupid!
is The Mold. If if you have to defend that you are a democrats, chance are you are faking it. Action matters sir 
By the way thanks for supporting Trumps former lawyer as embassador welcome to WW3. Authoritarians to power.
That is exactly why we ask you not to vote for Gorsuch.  His record shows he favors corporations over people.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you @Sen_JoeManchin for changing your mind on the Trump/Russian allegations. We need your conscience!
ask him to explain his cabinet votes then.
Not a fan of the guy but he nails it here.
by supporting Gorsuch you just did put corporations before people
Manchin made the case why he Should follow his #GOP heart-He could start a grassroots effort 2 Restore #GOP to it's better roots
@Sen_JoeManchin Show us, Joe. Filibuster Gorsuch. Slam #trumpryancare #SaveOurCare
So, he wants cover of being a Dem so he can vote with Repubs??
His behavior points to it.
He votes his conscience & what he believes is in the best interest of Constituents.
Example of his conscience vs political gain?
His votes on Scott Pruitt (I dislike) vs Berry DeVos
He believed (wrongly in my opinion) Pruitt EPA would be better Constituents.
FOR HIS constituents, sorry
Pruitt has long history of being against regs,but that is short-sighted for WVA where coal isn't king. He shd educ. Constit
@Sen_JoeManchin what are human beings but a collection of correlated bottom lines - your statement is nonsensical political speak
Manchin does no credit to the Dems.  Constituents should evaluate his voting record and decide if he's the right choice for them.
It was the REPUBLICANS that freed the slaves. DEMOCRATS created the KKK.   Today's Republicans still care about people, Senator.  Ask Trey.
Thats literally exactly what your doing with your coal mining town that is destroyin the planet. your solution is to kill themselves better?
@Sen_JoeManchin What a joke!!! He is a whatever works for HIM. What works for WV never crosses his mind. #draintheswamp
@Sen_JoeManchin got stay behind Joe or we'll lose his seat to perhaps our sleazy AG!
@Sen_JoeManchin joe must go get a real Republican in his place
@MalcolmNance he does that already
Senator, you are patting yourself on the back when WV is in the worst shape it's been in our lifetimes. @CapehartJ @Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin have you seen the classless circus you surround yourself with now ?
You're better than this Sen. Manchin.
It is the Democrats fault for allowing him to use them as a cover. His actions speak to who he really is and what he stands for.
@Sen_JoeManchin The democrats took all the coal mining jobs away;the republicans brought them back.Who helped more?
@Sen_JoeManchin Joe Manchin falls right in line with heartless "bottom line" GOP.  That's why Dems don't want to claim him.
well said
I believe you are referring to Planned Parenthood, not a Republican.
Really? I don't buy it That is bcs he did absolutely Nothing to help the Sandy Hook Parents #Newton

@Sen_JoeManchin Somebody primary this slime ball.
How about being honest regarding USA situations N stand for America
West Virginia voters need to wake up- replace Manchin with a real progressive - looking forward to a much better future
Can't wait to hear this. Manchin annoys me. I always ask why he doesn't just become a Repub already. Does he even caucus w/Dems?
then he needs to stop voting with the republicans. Actions speak louder than words
Repeal and Replace Joe Machine who's stated He does care it he loses his job. Replace give someone else a chance.#Resistance
guess that sums it up beautifully...NO HEART has the GOP
He votes more consistently GOP than most GOP. He can tell himself whatever excuses he wants, but you don't have to print them.
Sorry, you already do. Your daughter and the Epipen, for starters.
u mean Confederate don't u
Best explanation of conservatives
now he's changing his position.  Flip Flop
@MalcolmNance He says now that Russian collusion and impeachment is in the air.
He needs to stop acting like one!
@MalcolmNance he votes mostly R anyway- he may as well switch parties
@But
CapehartJ @MalcolmNance but then he wouldn't get all the air time, free campaign ad
true
that is what you do - and what you have done all along.  Just change parties already.
oh like the EpiPen lady? He should talk to her.
Obvious if behavior and actions mean anything.
You might be a Republican if you hate all entitlements except those that benefit you and your political campaign contributors.
....and that tells you all you ever need to know about Republicans.  Wow...the callousness is frightening.
@MalcolmNance he comfortably does this as a democrat.
What??
Money before people? @GOP ideas are so bizarre I can't even understand what they're saying.#CountryOverParty @Sen_JoeManchin
That's about right. The ends justify the means, no matter what
@MalcolmNance @CynthiaBuckwalt Your a republican
wow, news headline, republicans are too far to the right for Joe Machin.
@MalcolmNance It's who they are.
When I said this every rt winger on twitter jumped me...To all the pres trumpov is a LIAR.
@MalcolmNance damn.
I thought he was already doing that. lol
Which you do. That's why you should run representing who you really are a nasty, NRA loving, racist, mean spirited person. Try truth.
SHOCKING!
When they tell you who they are, believe them.
