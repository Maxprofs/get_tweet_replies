@Sen_JoeManchin Hope you like being in the minority. Dems are losing my vote in 2016. Guess now U will vote w/Reps on Iran deal.
@TaylorCsmss @Sen_JoeManchin I pray more people will vote based on what their constituents want instead of by party.
@dblozik @Sen_JoeManchin Me too... And as a constituent I vote to keep funding Planned Parenthood.... #StandwithPP
@TaylorCsmss @Sen_JoeManchin I guess Senator Manchin listened to a different group of constituents then, huh?
@dblozik @Sen_JoeManchin Appears he did. Oh well, makes it easy to decide who to vote for in 2016.....
@TaylorCsmss @Sen_JoeManchin Not voting for him based on 1 issue? WV has bigger issues with losing coal jobs thanks to #WarOnCoal SMH!!!
@dblozik @Sen_JoeManchin Yes on this 1 issue. Having ability as a woman to make my own medical decisions abt my body is high priority to me!
@TaylorCsmss @Sen_JoeManchin Roe vs Wade protects your "right" to get an abortion. ACA provides all the same things PP does & more.
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for standing for Life. The videos were clear that a dish full of baby parts was picked through to be sold.
@Sen_JoeManchin @whmsouth The videos speak for themselves. What more needs to be said? #DefundPlannedParenthood
@Sen_JoeManchin Thanks! You do have a heart!
@Sen_JoeManchin Then you should have had the facts before you voted against Planned Parenthood!  Get your nose out of the GOP's ass!
@Sen_JoeManchin @Bound4LIFE #PPSellsBabyParts #DefundPlannedParenthood
@IvethRocio @Sen_JoeManchin imbeciles.

@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for your vote
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you
@Sen_JoeManchin that's one thing Obama supports. Where's your outrage on Obama's treasonous actions on every other subject?
@Sen_JoeManchin http://www.politicususa.com/2015/08/04/msnbc-joe-scarborough-edited-video-attack-elizabeth-warren.html … #traitor
@Sen_JoeManchin if you actually took time to research what #PlannedParenthood you wouldnt have betrayed millions of women incl. constituents
@Sen_JoeManchin Planned Parenthood videos have been proven as hoaxes! When was the last law passed that affected what u could do w/ur body?
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you sir for your yea vote to #DefundPlannedParenthood
@Sen_JoeManchin You Know Damn Well Senator, You Protest Way Too Much.....   Showing you're hand.
What I love about Senator Joe Manchin is he is a true Republican!!!!

@Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you Senator!  Keep fighting to #DefundPlannedParenthood
.@Sen_JoeManchin Politicians are crooks...Now, time to cut off all your funds until you prove otherwise! #DINO #PlannedParenthood
@Sen_JoeManchin You're hurting America. #IgnoranceIsBliss
@Sen_JoeManchin Unacceptable You are interested is maintaining your job then protecting the women you represent. #DINO
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for voting like you did. I am voting for you next election...senator...gov...dog catcher
@Sen_JoeManchin No. Why should taxpayer money be used to support Planned Parenthood AT ALL?. #DefundPlannedParenthood
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for your stand.  Humans killing humans for convenience is always wrong.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you, Senator Manchin. I admire your principles and courage. We must defund this abomination. God bless you!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you!!
@Sen_JoeManchin I was going to write you on this vote, until i saw where you are from. I guess we should be glad that you're not on the dole
@Sen_JoeManchin Get real. The tapes were heavily edited and tissue for stem cell research is important. No federal dollars go to abortion!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for standing up for our unborn children.
@Sen_JoeManchin you voted how the majority of WVians would want you to vote.
If you're not a WVian hop off he represents us!
Thanks Senator
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for voting today for Life.
“@Sen_JoeManchin: Until allegations are answered/resolved, I do not believe taxpayer money should be used to fund PP"

Thank you Joe!
@Sen_JoeManchin @SenDonnelly Fun logic! Let's also execute people and afterwards determine if they've ever murdered! #PlannedParenthood
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you
@Sen_JoeManchin what happened to "innocent until proven guilty"?  Why deny so many women access to affordable healthcare?
@Sen_JoeManchin @SenDonnelly Instead, let's defund your salaries until you can recognize fraudulent videos. #PlannedParenthood
@Sen_JoeManchin Kudos on the "planned parenthood" vote. They have no soul.
@Sen_JoeManchin The most ridiculous part is that the left makes this about choice. Abortion in 1st trimester is choice. Criminal after that.
@Sen_JoeManchin @SBAList #PPSellsBabyParts #DefundPlannedParenthood
.@Sen_JoeManchin Your partisan hackiness is pathetic. You know this is a vote that endangers women.
@Sen_JoeManchin Keep speaking out. If PP is going to do this crap, then get the $ privately. DISGUSTING your party funds from our taxes.
@Sen_JoeManchin you are a good man Joe! WV is very lucky to have you. THANK YOU for having a conscience. INVESTIGATE #PlannedParenthood!!
@Sen_JoeManchin Unequivocally 4 Women's InalienableRight 2 Dominion&Control of Her Body!PP Vids Trouble Me 2 But Plz Don't Cut Women'sHealth
@Sen_JoeManchin Shame on you for voting against women's health & rights! Gov't should stay out of women's doctors' offices.  No PP=abortions
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for standing up for humanity.  This women respects you for having a conscience!  #DefundPP #WomenBetrayed
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you Senator for the courage of your conviction.
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you!
@Sen_JoeManchin It would be nice if you were a Democrat
@Sen_JoeManchin @SenDonnelly - You should be ashamed of yourselves. @PPact #NotGoingBackwards #WarOnWomen
@Sen_JoeManchin @PPact @SenateDems @TheDemocrats Democrats, DO NOT support Manchin! Joe, Please leave our party NOW! What an idiot!
@Sen_JoeManchin GOOD  MAN!!! GOD BLESS YOU
@Sen_JoeManchin You're 100% wrong in this Senator.
@Sen_JoeManchin It is time for you to leave the Democratic Party, since you have no sense of the truth and no commitment to women.
@Sen_JoeManchin SHAME ON YOU MR. MANCHIN....DO YOU HATE ALL WOMEN....
@Sen_JoeManchin Watch the fucking video, you useless fuckwit!! The truth IS there. God, you're worthless POS.Go suck some poison coal & STFU
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for taking a stand against ppfa's barbarism..
@Sen_JoeManchin SHAME ON YOU....WE WILL NOT FORGET THIS...
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you Senator Manchin!
@Sen_JoeManchin  Thank you, Senator.
@Sen_JoeManchin Ridiculous! How about research BEFORE defunding.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you.
@Sen_JoeManchin I'm glad to see that there are still some Democrats with a conscience. Further investigation of the allegations is in order.
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for speaking for WVa
@Sen_JoeManchin Disappointed that a doctored right-wing video is driving policy decisions in DC. #WomenDeserveBetter #standwithPP
@Sen_JoeManchin What questions? That they help millions of women in this country get healthcare? You are a big an asshole as the Republicans
@Sen_JoeManchin Shame 4 believing fabricated videos & taking away critical healthcare 4 women & girls. #PlannedParenthood @UniteWomenOrg
@Sen_JoeManchin Maybe the decision was already made, you've just finally starting listening to the people you represent. Listen more often.
@Sen_JoeManchin good for you. Thank you.
@Sen_JoeManchin Very disappointed that this is your stance. PP provides so much more than abortion. Shame on you #StandwithPP
@Sen_JoeManchin Shame on you Senator! Shame on you! 1 in 5 American Women will receive care from PP in their life.
@Sen_JoeManchin ever been to the planned parenthood website? Nothing to do with women's health care. I get health care. never needed PP
@Sen_JoeManchin what did ppl think abortion was? of course they could sell parts. You can murder an unborn baby you can do ANYTHING.
@Sen_JoeManchin Planned Parenthood gets $ from corporations,$ from abortions, and $ from the tax payers not to mention body parts.
@Sen_JoeManchin one of Planned Parenthood ads. frankly sir they are just plain evil. there's no health care for women
@Sen_JoeManchin Kudos to u for stepping across the aisle and doing the right thing 
#BabiesBeforePolotics
#DefundPP
@Sen_JoeManchin in cases of rape/incest? We give the innocent the death penalty? I don't think so Sen Machin
@Sen_JoeManchin not one dime of tax payer money should have been going to this organization (PP)anyway.
@Sen_JoeManchin proud of you for standing up for what is right. Hope they can get a high enough vote to over ride a veto. #MANOFCONSCIENCE
@Sen_JoeManchin Hat is so absolutely off to you Senator! Thank you so much for standing against such evil. You have my utmost respect!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you.
@Sen_JoeManchin @KARAVIJ Stick with it Senator, influence your colleagues to agree. We're all watching.
@Sen_JoeManchin Ty 4 standing up 4 what is right. Regardless of ones stand on abortion, it is clear that PP needs to answer for allegations
@Sen_JoeManchin Allegations?  You cannot be serious.  Any honest person knows that this was a hit job by Operation Rescue, the murderers.
.@Sen_JoeManchin West Virginia women deserve better representation. #PlannedParenthood #Healthcare
@Sen_JoeManchin Don't allow yourself to be manipulated. There is no crime here and you should know better. Support @PPact Support women.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you, sir. 
#DefundPP 
#DefundPlannedParenthood
@Sen_JoeManchin you are a disgrace to the Democratic party, you should switch and join your buddy Shelly
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you!!!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you, senator.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for your honest and principled stand on this issue. Human rights is not something we can afford to be wrong on.
@Sen_JoeManchin You, sir, are alright.
@Sen_JoeManchin 
WOMEN LOVE #PLANNEDPARENTHOOD
Why don't you trust WOMEN???

Pls change your political party. Thx!
@Sen_JoeManchin So much for the presumption of innocence, Senator.  Shame on you!
@RainforestMoon @socallks @Sen_JoeManchin  in my pocket, a list of all the Repub. Pres. Candidates who have Not taken their cousin to prom.
@Frenchysfuquads @RainforestMoon @Sen_JoeManchin Can't believe that doofus is intelligent.
@Sen_JoeManchin always vote for life @bostonrandy
@Sen_JoeManchin I agree with your view! I am proud of u for standing up for those precious unborn babies! How many Einstein have they killed
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for voting to defund PP. I saw the video with that tiny hand. I wondered what terrible pain that baby went thru.
@Sen_JoeManchin "I represent West Virginia, what do u expect me to say."
@Sen_JoeManchin UR on the right side of this Senator to DEFUND PP. Fund ACA Health Centers.  PP Zealots should read up on founder Sanger
@Sen_JoeManchin planned Parenthood is a moneymaking corporation their doors will not close without our funding.@AlvedaCKing  #DefundPP
@Lg4Lg @binggreen @Sen_JoeManchin @AlvedaCKing Taxpayers shouldn't be funding it at all--what section of the Constitution permits it?
@Sen_JoeManchin 
Thank you!
Thank you @Sen_JoeManchin. You're a true JFK Democrat. I left that party after they turned to the extreme far Left. They need more like you!
@ChapmanGOP Americans applaud common sense. @ggg217 @Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you senator for standing up against the CRIMINAL @PPact and for life! This $$ will be well used in real women clinics.
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you
.@Sen_JoeManchin Outrageous reaction to #GOP lies. Edited video + most of @PPFA work is for birthcontrol + health screening. #StandwithPP
@Sen_JoeManchin attaboy!!
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for having the decency and courage to stand up against your party for what is correct!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you, Senator!
@Sen_JoeManchin The allegations have been resolved.. do your homework senator
@Sen_JoeManchin  Planned Parenthood was cleared of any wrongdoing.. a cheap ploy to defund and you fell for it.  Idiot
@Sen_JoeManchin I will not donate funds to Planned Parenthood. I will donate funds to your next Democratic opponent.
@Sen_JoeManchin we do not agree on much, but thank you for taking a moderate stance on this issue and requiring deeper inquiry into this
@Sen_JoeManchin Ask McConnell if he didnt vote to let PP use parts for research!! The gop voted on this in the 90s. We need RESEARCH!
@Sen_JoeManchin Disgusted that you have defected & joined the #GOPWarOnWomen. #DINO #p2

@Sen_JoeManchin THANK you Senator Manchin for your work today on  #humanrights #DefundPP
.@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for not letting party politics sway you. This is a troubling situation.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you!
@Sen_JoeManchin allegations have no connection to programs crucial to the health of our nation. support @PPact stop defund VOTE NO on 1881.
@Sen_JoeManchin   #OnlineDating Single  girls and  guys waiting for Love  .  To meet desired partner. http://bit.ly/1LKXuU9 
@Sen_JoeManchin The allegations are trumped up garbage.  You should be smarter than this. What now for those who won't be able to get CARE?
@Sen_JoeManchin 

THANK YOU!!!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you. #DefundPlannedParenthoodNOW #PPSellsBabyBodyParts Defund them PERMANENTLY!
@Sen_JoeManchin thanks! I've always been pro choice. I can't support what they are actually doing. Enough is enough.
@Sen_JoeManchin Your buddy Obama is destroyed coal families' lives. WTF??? Are you enemy of WV?
@Sen_JoeManchin Pretty hard to defend a lady who wants a Lamborghini - You know she has to spend ill gotten gains in a not for profit, right
@sen_joemanchin DINO
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank-you Senator, for standing up to those without a voice! #DefundPP
@Sen_JoeManchin Thankyou for giving voice to these suffering babies who have No ability to say WE WANT AND CHOOSE LIFE!
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you
@Sen_JoeManchin "Say it ain't so Joe!" Tell me you are not falling for the "baby parts" rhetoric? Are you against Stem Cell research too?
@Sen_JoeManchin you're the worst
@mindy @Sen_JoeManchin absolutely THE worst.
@Sen_JoeManchin WTF are you doing?? Defunding @PPact is an GOP attack on minority females.
@Sen_JoeManchin translation: Koch told me to say that bc they own me.
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for your continued pro-life record.  I am proud to call you my Senator!
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for your vote!!! Taxpayer's money should not go to organizations who tiptoe around the law.
@Sen_JoeManchin they are resolved. 

http://www.salon.com/2015/08/03/wing_nut_conspiracy_theorists_have_done_it_again_the_truth_about_the_planned_parenthood_hoax_revealed/ …

Way to vote against women's health.
@Sen_JoeManchin Hmm...why r u a Democrat???
@Sen_JoeManchin, not good. Don't jump on the bandwagon against women. Investigate fairly, not by biased organization, but don't defund.
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you Senator! God bless you, sir!
@Sen_JoeManchin You need to do your research instead of just listening to fox news
@Sen_JoeManchin Planned Parenthood helps many women. The allegations are another James O'Keefe ploy. Please support Planned Parenthood.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you.
@Sen_JoeManchin Or would your constituents object to not being able to obtain healthcare?
@Jenny_Trout @Sen_JoeManchin Hundreds of community clinics can use this funding, probably better, without the horror in those videos. Thanks
@Sen_JoeManchin Defund every hospital in your state, as they can legally donate under the same laws.
@Sen_JoeManchin These tapes are as fraudulent as the people that made them. This is another 'Acorn". Don't help r's do this. Women need it.
@Sen_JoeManchin @MiaoReport What if the allegations prove true?  Then how are you going to feel?
@Sen_JoeManchin They serve women in areas that private Dr.s won't go. There are as many medical deserts as there are food deserts.
@Sen_JoeManchin Sir, you should know that tax money does not pay for abortions at Planned Parenthood.They do much more than abortion.
@Sen_JoeManchin I stand with Planned Parenthood. Never again will I cast a vote for you.
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for standing!
@Sen_JoeManchin   THANK YOU!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you, senator! :-)
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you!!!!!
@Sen_JoeManchin how about Gov. Mike Pence saying it's BS and PP did nothing wrong????  Prove enough????idiot
@Sen_JoeManchin Why are you against women's health care and medical research? A knee-jerk reaction that will hurt many.
@Sen_JoeManchin 
Thanks for not turning your back on the American women and the unborn.
@WhoraJones Because they don't go elsewhere.  There are more providers here in Broward County than PP. OH wait, they don't butcher children
@Sen_JoeManchin thank u for doing the right thing.
@Sen_JoeManchin THANK YOU!
@Sen_JoeManchin // THANK YOU Senator! #DefundPlannedParenthood
Absolutely disgusted by @Sen_JoeManchin. I hope his constituents vote him out in the next election.
@Sen_JoeManchin THANK U JOE FOR STANDING UP FOR  WRONGDOING
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you! This is a morally reprehensible organization.
@Sen_JoeManchin thank you for taking such a prudent and compassionate position regarding the barbarity of #PlannedParenthood #DefundPP
