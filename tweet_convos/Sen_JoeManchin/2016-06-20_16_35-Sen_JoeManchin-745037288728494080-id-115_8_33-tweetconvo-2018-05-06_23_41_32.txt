3 days Senator? 3 days? Is that the importance you give to the safety of innocent lives? You are a shame to our Country.
so you stand united with terrorists. Got it.
so proud of you Sen M
You chose your own self interests over people you serve. It's highly insulting! You lost my respect & my vote. Shame on you!
You also took 11K from the @NRA. Don't pat yourself on the back. WV deserves better. #deleteyouraccount
due process is killing u huh?
constitutional rights have reasonable restrictions by law.  Victims of gun massacres and their loved ones say shame on you.
disappointed as a former West Virginian.
is the right for "an uncle to buy his nephew a weapon" really more sacred than our safety??? What a joke.
You have blood on your hands & this has nothing to do with the 2nd amendment.  A disgrace to the Dem party.  Vote him out.
can Obama still keep the Mexican drug cartels well armed? #fast&furious
due process is a right, as is gun ownership. If you don't like it, move to Cuba
SHAMEFUL COWARD. The blood of the next gun victims is on your hands, Sen. What a disappointment you are
Remember Sandy Hook, remember Orlando. #nextoneonyou #killerenabler #nragoon
for all the victims of gun violence and gun massacres in this country...and for their loved ones who weep...Shame on you.
.@Sen_JoeManchin wow. I am so deeply disappointed in you and how you represented West Virginia. Speechless.
SHAME ON YOU FOR VOTING AGAINST GUN SAFETY IN AMERICA
You are really delusional if you think you stopped terrorists? Have you no decency?
you made a statement on a tv news about legally buying guns on the internet. Would you please advise me on how this is done
background checks don't violate anyone's rights 
No, no u didn't. Terrorists can still buy guns online & at gun shows. GOP says its ok for ISIS to have guns!
A gun bought online it through w dealer at a show still needs to be transferred through a licensed FFL. Facts.
Pathetic.
you spelled treason wrong...
#enough of the NRA talking points.  Get some #gunsense.  Americans need protecting from guns not the other way round.
this is not what I voted for. Why are background checks so terrible and "overreaching" ?
name another right that I have to petition the government to exercise?
very disappointing. had hoped for better from you.
You voted for the amendments that do nothing, and against actual change. Disgraceful.
Why do you call yourself a Democrat? you are soooooo far up the NRA ass you can't see the light of day
@Sen_JoeManchin
Tremendous act of cowardice on your part. More interested in holding office than preventing tragedies #shameful
I'm just hoping that I'll still have due process when your people come to arrest me
Shame on @Sen_JoeManchin for not voting for the background checks amendment. Your inaction is killing Americans. #OrlandoShooting
voted AGAINST sensible gun control because of reasoning you can only see as kissing ass towards big money #CorruptCongress
IF you are not voted out, expect to hear from me after every mass shooting You are complicit. #NRA #orlandostrong #newtown
Your opposition to Sen. Murphy's amendment was shameful and harmful to our country.
oh no. An uncle wouldn't be able to gift his nephew a gun. You're absolutely pathetic and blood is on your hands.
WV votes overwhelmingly for @BernieSanders so U back Hillary? Now this? Do U EVR talk 2 actual WVians? #ManchinsShame
#shame #nra #DoYourJob
You repaid the #NRA is what you did Senator.You hide behind 2nd Amendment while our children are gunned down.Shame on you!
I appreciate your honest approach. Is it fair to be concerned with the potential of a Lois Lerner "No Fly, No Buy" Czar?
you make me ashamed to be from West Virginia
Liar. Who needs your statement when we can read your vote of 'No'? That's all that mattered.
Which one did you vote for?    Seems that nothing got done - am I missing something?
Liar. You voted with the terrorists and the NRA. The only Democrat to do so. West Virginia must be a terrible place.
How much does a Senate vote go for nowadays? Disappointed in you, Senator. YOU KILL thousands of people every year.
when will American lives be more important to you than your @NRA rating?  Shame on you.
disappointed in u. What will it take? How many have to die? #ENOUGH Im a Dem & have NEVER voted for u. Today Im reminded why
Sorry, Uncle So-and-So, guns should not be gifts. They are deadly weapons and should be treated as such. Get a clue.
PREVENT universal background checks? Way to be part of the problem. I trusted you to do the right thing. You let me down.
WHAT A JOKE! Enjoy your @NRA $
Thank you for your terrorist watch list vote. I hope you will open your mind & reconsider your stance on background checks.
.@Sen_JoeManchin SHAME ON YOU.  Worse than shame, you NRA puppet.  #Enough
Disgusting.
You're despicable.
.@Sen_JoeManchin Not every nephew is fit to own a weapon of war. You put the gun lobby above American lives. #DisarmHate2016 Hate
No, you betrayed Sandy Hook families.Guess that was just all show back then.You Lost my support today...
so how much did that terrorist organization @NRA put in your pocket? #traitor #theirbloodisonyourhands
Weak! Don't couch this in 2nd Amendment B.S. You're pandering. Shame. Shame. Shame. Remember Sandy Hook? We do #ShameonWVday
Coward!
Your statement is full of NRA talking point distortions. Thought you were one of the good guys. So, so disappointing.
@ericlewis0 @Sen_JoeManchin No, you voted to keep it easy for terrorists to get killing machines
Will u ever stop tqking NRA blood money? After a WV Columbine, Sandy Hook, Pulse? Good Senators don't NEED NRA blood money.
NO! You voted to keep your job while people are being killed!
COWARD
#spineless
Gutless!
shame on you.
I am absolutely appalled and disgusted. represent your constituents and not the damn NRA. no excuse. shameful.
you've lost my vote...cowardly vote on your part.
Furthermore, you've lost my future vote over this.
Senator Manchin I'm highly disappointed in your vote. How bout protecting people (& schoolkids) from nuts w/assault weapons?
you are an embarrassment. #Shame
That's a lot of words to say "I voted against due process." #dueprocess #resignnow #NoFlyNoBuy
How do you know someone is law-abiding without a #backgroundcheck? Stand up to the @NRA!
. @Sen_JoeManchin No, today you failed to keep your constituents safe. WV deserves better. Represent us, not the NRA.
obviously, you FAILED!! Just become a republican and bow down to the NRA, FRAUD!
why are you against the #14thamendment and against #dueprocess ? Where is the due process to be on or taken off #noflylist?
disappointed.
YOU voted with Republicans. Time for a challenger who cares about people, not guns and NRA. #SHAME
These three need to explain themselves #gunsense Expect rot from rotten party but these?

@sen_joemanchin 
@senatorheitkamp 
@senatortester
I am blatantly disgusted by these Senators right now. Enjoy the blood on your hands.
Ick.
Corrupt
stop only equating terrorism with radical Islam...because that's clearly not the case in our country. #DisarmHate
disappointed in your position re: background checks; 2nd amend doesn't obviate gov't right to regulate who gets a gun + how
How much does NRA give/owe you? Spineless.
he sold his vote for only $1,000. He's pathetic.
