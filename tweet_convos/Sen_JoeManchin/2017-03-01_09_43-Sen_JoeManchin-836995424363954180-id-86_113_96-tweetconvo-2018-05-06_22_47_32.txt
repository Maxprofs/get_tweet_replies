Once again, the Senate’s failure to act is putting these men & women’s whole livelihood at risk.
I have been working with everyone & from every angle in order to prevent our miners from losing their healthcare and retirement benefits.
I will keep working to find a solution that is worthy of them. I refuse to let the people who powered our nation for a generation down.
yet you have no problem with @realdonaldtrump poisoning water of WV residents.
@jeffl76 @Sen_JoeManchin Jen join @IndivisibleTeam if u haven't already, got a chapter in ur area. Good luck! 
done & done!!! Manchin should be primaried as well.
You, go girl!! 
women like u inspire me!!!!
wow no Healthcare AND no clean drinking water!  You and your buddy @realDonaldTrump sold us out
Face it; you sold your soul.
@TZZToday @Sen_JoeManchin Next election WV, next election.
1 more year, if you want reelected Joe, we better see some results. #2018
just a start on the 15 million who will lose it under wealthcare/tRumpcare
Can we bring NEW technology to West Va instead of clinging to coal?
my father is one of them my uncles my whole family & where I'm from this is horrible plz help them
This is terrible. I'm calling my NY senators and telling them to work with Sen. Joe and get this fixed.
thank you so much buddy so appreciate it 
why not ask bff @realDonaldTrump 4 help to get Congress 2 act? Oh yes, b/c he doesn't care.
CORRECT! he doesn't care that the Dems have their panties in a bunch. Obstruct their ass out of office they will.
fix it!
And, that is on your head!!
Id suggest you dems get on the wagon and get shit fixed or you Sen. Manchin will be receiving your own letter of termination
ask your constituents to point to where on the doll did Barack Obama hurt them so that they had to vote for Dolt 45?
@LoriSums and these are the people that voted for trump - IDIOTS !!!
and some in the this nation can no longer pay premiums due to the magic of ACA...IT IS CRIMINAL what @POTUS44 & Dems did.
you'll see criminal when tRump and the GOP are done with their "improvements"
@carolinagirl63 The question is why? Is it because of a failed ACA that nobody read before voting on it? Please be honest.
better find a new job, faux Democrat, Chump sympathizer get PRIMARY'd
you mean the same coal miners who voted for Trump, got sold out by Trump. How shocking?
@carolinagirl63 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump -@NancyPelosi -WOW & Democrats don't think OBAMACARE failed?! Very sad.
Obama got them healthcare, and  @realDonaldTrump is ending it. Read better & turn off Fox.
@100prayingwomen Horrible!
so do something about it.
and cozying up to the GOP will help them how?
Manchin IS the GOP
sounds like Obamacare failed them too. Come to the GOP. Be a hero
How this is so hard. You have members of both parties that want to help right? My senator, @SenWarren is on board
Since you'll be hlding Trump's hand today in Virginia, maybe u could or should ask him why? You are a Republican now right?
west virginia needs to get rid of this guy.if u dont u will get screwed big time buy him if he wins reelection. Warning
this is so wrong hope Trump can fix
#realDonaldTrump this is Obama's doing here we go again the blame game
If retired coal miners are losing company Health Ins, why not accept Medicaid or Medicare? I'm not sure theres a problem.
I have faith between Sen Manchin and POTUS will find a solution. 
I know Medicare Ins covers all ppl  w/ no earned income.
Obamacare still promising great things like losing Health Insurance for 22k coal miners. The Dems say Obamacare is working.
What can be done?
35% of Americans didn't know ACA was Obamacare
then why do you consistently vote the trump agenda. You are voting for the people causing this mess we call our government.
you're a TRAITOR! We're coming for your seat!
is a Chump lackey, both lying to their coal constituents... coal is DEAD. and there's no such thing as clean coal
you epitomize everything wrong with politics.
been working with everyone?  How about the caucus trying to save the ACA?  You're just in it for the money.  #epipen
Tell your Dem colleagues a problem exists....it's real.
Stop whining and fix it.
how did that happen, Joe?
Bunch of crap if you ask me
Save the ACA! Everyone needs healthcare!
Didn't ur state overwhelmingly vote 4 Trump? DT told them that he's going to repeal ACA? don't remember hearing u back then
You all knew what's coming when you sleep with the devil and sell your soul. I guess u won't come back in 2018. Good!
I'm sure they all voted for Trump. Since your an enabler you should be OK with this no?
we didn't all vote for 45-we aren't behind the turncoat Manchin #WeWillReplaceYou
So do you consider this criminal as well Joe?
what the hell did you expect? He is also poisoning the water with coal ash.
Now more than ever this country needs your voice  of reason to work with @potus to thwart uncooperative GOP & Sen Schumer
Perhaps if they had a Senator who was not a Republican disguised as a Democrat, this tragedy could have been avoided.
Who is able to get this indefinitely extended to have more time to find them a solution?
@JudyWoods8 Yet he stood with the republican party while feeding his constituents a load of BS he's a Disgrace !
@JudyWoods8 Turn coat joe with the crocodile tears knew this was coming knew that the coal industry never stood a chance
So, why didn't your buddy, Donald, tell good old boy Mitch to let this one go by? Because, he doesn't care about our state.
@Ladybug014 Trump and fam have no real jobs new job is fleecing of Americans monies and benefits
that's not right 
Oh well. That's what they overwhelmingly voted for. @Sen_JoeManchin
Gee much thanks to you and your republican friends.
Obama was the reason these people got black lungs disease benefits money every month and health care
@Karoli Maybe you should have clapped louder last night.
@Karoli That is awful. Too bad the House, Senate and White House are controlled by people who don't care.
.@Sen_JoeManchin @Karoli remind me who controls the senate again?
Commander Marmalade TOLD them he would do it, and they voted for him anyhow..0 sympathy for their repercussions now
This is who the coal workers voted for unfortunately. Should have seen this coming.
@Karoli where is the bigly Trump replacement.  He was going to save us ASAP.
why have you backed Obama last 8 yrs! He set out to kill coal and he nearly has time for you to become a republican!
Good.  Serves them right for their stupidity.
what are these ppl to live on then?
Truly sorry for them, but why don't you just call your BFF Trump -  maybe he can help you out!
@Karoli I'm sure they're sure that #SoCalledPresident cares. Has removed regs against mines dumping waste into water..?
@Karoli THEY ALL VOTED FOR TRUMP YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW
Gee, maybe they'll regret that vote, huh? No one lied to them. They did this knowing what he said he'd do.
that's not right, you have some widows, that's all they get to live on. Try getting some of Congress to take a paycut.
Enjoy your waning political career. Traitor.
#BernieWouldHaveWon West Virginia. #UniversalHealthCare
Keep supporting trump and the @gop
What can we do to help?
Then support @BernieSanders in effort for #MedicareForAll
Just in time, as they begin drinking Coal Waste in their Water supply #Trump said He saved their Jobs but can't work if Sick
#JoeMannequin is a good little coal cuck that does what he is told. Or he loves bathing in Coal Waste?
