What? How is someone's reality distorted by birth control?

Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy. Birth control prevents pregnancy. They are not synonyms.
Keep up.

The problem w/these shootings is Due Process?... What an incredibly stupid remark from a Senator.

Unhealthy.
I wasn't able to watch so seriously need to confirm.
Okay, just.. Please tell me you didn't say Due process is what's killing people -.-

Horrifying! Now Due Process, a constitutional right, is inconvenient?
I guess our civil/CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS are deleted! Just tellus your a commie!!
"Due process is killing us"......damn that pesky Constitution, right senator?
After Joe got slammed for being pro Trump he has done a 180! #trumpbasher
Lack of due process has seen many innocents killed, you fucking shill. #RecallManchin
That freaking "due process" says Senator who is supposed to uphold the Constitution
we saw your promotion of fascism..."due process is killing us"?! you're fukn sick @Sen_JoeManchin @Morning_Joe @morningmika @JoeNBC @MSNBC
"Due Process is killing us?" You are a Senator?
Any OTHER Constitutional Amendments you'd like to do away with, @Sen_JoeManchin? @Morning_Joe @morningmika @JoeNBC @MSNBC
He'd probably consider the first TEN a start.
RIP your career.
not your best showing today.
if you really believe that due process is what's killing us, you, sir, are the problem. You need to resign
all this does is expose Liberal #GOP  who traditionally are on the fence anyways
You don't like "due process? 
Delete your senate seat!
You have a problem with due process?
They all have a problem with due process.
Thank you for trying to forward sensible law #enough
You are a sellout Joey.
Can't stand to watch those two-faced hypocrites spouting their ridicule
@robreiner @Morning_Joe @morningmika @JoeNBC @morningmika TRIED 2 end interivew before getting 2 you! But Manchin prevailed!
Man please, no one trying to get with these hate mongers.
Never let a crisis go to waste! Always about advancing the leftist cause. Always!
Thank you for trying to move forward with action and protect Americans.
Sen Manchin is a leader. Standing up for what's right and explaining to those that may not agree. @Morning_Joe @MSNBC
Great points! We need more senators like you, Sir. #commonsenseplease
Trump is afraid to be POTUS. That's why the con artist acts the way he does.
He does it because it works. It's only June
Is that the ex congressman that had a young girl die in his office? Wink, wink!
