@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for wanting to choose a real doctor who actually cares abt Americans health than a Political Hack 4 his agenda
@daynutrition @Sen_JoeManchin Wait - a guy with a Yale MD who did his residency at the Brigham and Women's Hospital isn't a real doctor?
@Cale_Miller @Sen_JoeManchin The Syrian dictator who gasses his own people is a Doctor. Ft hood Muslim terrorist who Killed 4 Hate a doctor
@daynutrition @Sen_JoeManchin Yes they are.  And your point is what, exactly?  Your strawmen are obscuring my view.
@Cale_Miller @Sen_JoeManchin That Obama's surgeon general nothing more than a Democrat Operatves, nothing more. Collects a paycheck!
@daynutrition @Sen_JoeManchin I collect a paycheck.  Does that make me a "Democrat Operatives"?  Gee, I hope not.
@Cale_Miller @Sen_JoeManchin do you work for unionized Fed Gov? Or do you work in private sector? Tax exempt Unions push Democrat agenda
@daynutrition @Sen_JoeManchin And that relates to the Surgeon General how?
Fairly certain Dr. Murthy isn't in a union.
@Sen_JoeManchin Bow down to your NRA overlords! He has stated the truth, why would you call it activism?
@MarkAWebster1 I guess by "American" I guess you mean white, his parents moved here from England when he was 3.
@MarkAWebster1 LOL yeah....
@Sen_JoeManchin Gun violence isn't politics, it's a public health emergency. How many more people have to die before you give a damn?
.@Sen_JoeManchin We are disappointed in you, Senator Manchin. The business of the Surgeon General is 2 advise us, not to please your donors
@delong @Sen_JoeManchin It's to advise us on health, not to determine our rights.  I hope you can see the difference
@MoltarRocks did anybody invite you here?
@delong Let's see.  Twitter is a public social media service.  What you tweet becomes public.  I don't need a stinking invitation.
@MoltarRocks you may not know this, but if you include “@delong” in your tweets, it automatically brings them to my attention. Please don’t.
@delong Actually, I do know and it was intentional.  If you don't like to receive replies, don't tweet.  Have a nice day.
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel Bought and paid for by NRA. You're pathetic.
@AlfredSandy @Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel why is this making you angry? Support our Constitution. All not part
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel why dont ya go fucking Republican already!
@TopGeekNJ @Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel you are a liberal, your name calling gave you away. Educate yourself you can slam people with facts
.@Sen_JoeManchin doesn't vote for Vivek Murthy but supports Eviron 'l disaster #KeystoneXL - Democrat or energy company stooge? #ifitquacks
@Sen_JoeManchin Shame on you. WVirg will still vote for GOP. Ask MLandrieu or MPryor.Senate confirms Surg Gen despite gun group opposition.
@Sen_JoeManchin These leftists hate you and, more importantly, West Virginia.
@Sen_JoeManchin <<<DINO. Tool of the NRA.
@Sen_JoeManchin  Keep it up, Senator, and you're gonna fuck around and make me think you're an all right guy.
@Sen_JoeManchin U are a well intentioned man but u made a bad decision. WVirginia will still vote for a Republican not you.2014 proved that.
@Sen_JoeManchin because of your apparent fear of the @NRA I can no longer support you even though I am a registered Democrat.
@Sen_JoeManchin You're an idiot.
@Sen_JoeManchin So you're saying correlating guns with gunshot related injuries constitutes a political statement...
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel why are you a Democrat again?
@TheLocalCrank @Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel   Joe stick to your principles Murthy has one qualification. He supported Obama
@_6161127996811 @Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel and ya know he's a doctor with years of experience. Oh and now he's the surgeon general
Gun violence is a public health matter. Fact. @Sen_JoeManchin
@Gus_802 @Sen_JoeManchin Love photo of doctor fighting to save gunshot victim in OR w/caption,So,NRA,tell me how guns aren't a health risk.
@Sen_JoeManchin There is a difference between "unable" & unwilling.
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel Wow, someone in the Senate not being able to do something. Thanks for the heads up.
@Sen_JoeManchin Bullets > Public Health. WV must be so proud of it's 'Democrat' senator.
@Sen_JoeManchin You were right, Senator. Gun ownership is none of the Doctor's business.
.@Sen_JoeManchin So… You can't vote for him because the #NRA won't let you! This seems a far worse thing than ANYTHING the Dr. did!
Based on the hate you received, it was not an easy choice, but it was the correct choice. @Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin If someone gets shot they go to a hospital. Either you are too stupid to understand that or you are a whore owned by the NRA
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel You, Sir, are an evil, but cowardly, idiot. The NRA owns you.
@Sen_JoeManchin We all know why Joe. You owe the NRA. It's all over now. You can poke your head back up.
@Sen_JoeManchin On behalf of the 52% of Americans who favor gun rights over gun control, I thank you for your Constitutional vote.
@Sen_JoeManchin @Kerryepp YOUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER JOE !
IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY IF IT DID.
YOU ARE A FRAUD !
.@Sen_JoeManchin Shame on you. Your craven capitulation to firearms industry lobbyists is disgraceful.
@Sen_JoeManchin Completely bought & paid for by @NRA @Heritage @alec
@Sen_JoeManchin I see members of "The most open minded & accepting of others views" party payed you a visit today, good times! #2Aallday
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you for standing on principles and in defense of individual liberty.
@Sen_JoeManchin And @TheDemocrats threaten ur kids. We need another gun-grab loon in gov't lk we need more death threats by gun grab loons.
@Sen_JoeManchin Remember this joke was Governor when those poor guys lost their lives in that WV COAL MINE, he supports wholeheartedly
@Sen_JoeManchin Good for you @Kerryepp
@Sen_JoeManchin West Virginia is a really unhealthy state. Wonder why.
@Sen_JoeManchin Agreed. Any chance you'll join the Republican Party in January? #tcot #pjnet
@Sen_JoeManchin You are a LIAR and a Slimy SOB.  I don't know who will challenge you. but they will get my $ and support.
@Sen_JoeManchin @pathomas626 Murthy is unfit.  This photo from @suziique03 says it all:
@neurodebris hahaha
@Sen_JoeManchin pathetic - running from the NRA, surprised
Soulless, corrupt and pathetic  RT @Sen_JoeManchin: I'm unable to vote for Dr. Vivek Murthy’s confirmation as America's next Surgeon General
Bought and paid for by the NRA  RT @Sen_JoeManchin: I'm unable to vote for Dr. Vivek Murthy’s confirmation as America's next Surgeon General
@Sen_JoeManchin you sir are a bad joke
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel In other words, the NRA scares the shit out of me, and courage is not my long suit.
So @Sen_JoeManchin looks like the gun manufactures have their boot on your neck, we'll remember when you up for re-election #gunsense
When you say stuff like that @tazcat2011 you really can't expect to be taken seriously
MT “@Sen_JoeManchin: The NRA won't let me vote for Dr. Vivek Murthy’s confirmation as America's next Surgeon General.”
@Sen_JoeManchin @SunnyJL52 Joe ' I'm on every side of every issue' Manchin
As long as he's on the correct side, and this time he is, so be it. @FWButlerDVM @Sen_JoeManchin
Gun safety doesn't equal political activism. @Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin So your previous push for sensible gun laws was just posturing? Happy to know.
@Sen_JoeManchin I think the word is "coward." Grow a sack!
@Sen_JoeManchin  Pathetic!!!
@NormaValentini @dthomicide @Sen_JoeManchin If he doesn't think guns are a health issue for a dr and not a political one he need to visit ER
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel Dude, republicans still aren't going to vote for you.
.@Sen_JoeManchin Public health views are, unavoidably, also political views.
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel Pills KILL.... http://ssristories.org/old/index1.php  Guns only SHOOT. http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=H04 … but no one says a word. WHY?
@Sen_JoeManchin Also how is this a political stance? NRA are the lobbyists making this political in first place. Your logic is lacking.
Thank you! Trust is eroding every day, don't need SG to be activist selling us ideology! @Sen_JoeManchin @Civic_Thoughts
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel thought he was better than this.
@Sen_JoeManchin yet another politician in the pocket of the NRA
@Sen_JoeManchin Come out of the closet already. Everyone knows.  It's the worst kept secret in DC.  Admit you are a Republican.  #DINO
@Sen_JoeManchin because your NRA bosses silence you.
@Sen_JoeManchin Doing the NRA's bidding? Shame on you.
.@Sen_JoeManchin @jrovner Politics is the process of resolving complex issues in a civil society. The Surgeon General must participate.
@Sen_JoeManchin You're useless.
@Sen_JoeManchin Coward.
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel / is this all for the gun lobby? You are a DINO. I hope people get smart and vote you out #guncontrol
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel Gun violence is a sign of a healthy society.  Got it, Senator.
@Cale_Miller @carmenvellon @Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel Yes it is, Senator, in Nazi Germany!
I think you're wrong, @Sen_JoeManchin - it's a legitimate public health concern, just like eg drunk driving, despite also being political
@Sen_JoeManchin  Coward.
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel there's the cowardice I expect from our elected officials. 40,000 dead/year = not a public health issue
@Sen_JoeManchin  you're a man of very strong convictiohahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
.@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you! @elwasson
@Sen_JoeManchin so the NRA is more important than those who get killed by guns. Got it.
@rowast someone got "killed by guns?" my guns don't even twitch w/o help.  @Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel ISo saying that bullets kill people is political activism? Ugh you are spineless and just an awful man.
@Sen_JoeManchin Disappointing but not surprising. Hopefully the majority of the Senate will prevail.
@theonlyadult @sen_joemanchin Hold on now…he might mean "I'm unable to vote for him because I'm trapped under a large, heavy object"?
2/n @Sen_JoeManchin Surgeon Generals need to follow the science, not what “the public believes.” U wouldn’t tell your own doctor to shut up
@TomLevenson does Dr. Murthy still have the votes?
@HoldenDCat dunno. Haven’t been following closely.
@Sen_JoeManchin @Obomination1 Gun Control is not the responsibility of an Attorney General nothing to do with it this guy is a radical
1/2 @Sen_JoeManchin Here’s straight talk: guns do pose a public health challenge (I’d say threat, but I don’t want to scare the children)
.@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel That’s some vintage BS. U vote agin Murthy because the public “may not believe”? That’s a test anyone wld. fail
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel We wouldn't want any government official to bear the taint of political belief
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel are u doing everything for the black voters in your state do u meet with the black churches in your state
@Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel YOU ARE A WORTHLESS GOP PIECE OF SHIT.....WE Dem's DON'T RECOGNIZE you as a Dem
@Sen_JoeManchin @daveweigel Boo. Boo. Boo. Boo. Clearly putting corporate lobbying above caring about people.
@sen_joemanchin @daveweigel  DINO!!!!!
