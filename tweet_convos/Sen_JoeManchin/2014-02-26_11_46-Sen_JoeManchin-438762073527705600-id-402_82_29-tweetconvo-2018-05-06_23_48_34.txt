@Sen_JoeManchin Glad to see you protecting the public interest, not servicing #Bitcoin VCs and speculators like @BenLawsky & @SenatorCarper!
@nikolay how does that serve the public interest?
@ChrisPacia @Sen_JoeManchin Protects them from loss, theft, and fraud with no recourse. #Bitcoin
@nikolay @ChrisPacia No recourse? Isn't that what the police and FBI are for? It's easier to track bitcoins than cash, no?
@TheRealAltcoin @ChrisPacia Good luck getting your #Bitcoin back from hackers all over the world!
@nikolay @TheRealAltcoin @ChrisPacia Let me know when you can reverse ECDSA-256 and get me the secret key... I'm sure the NSA would love it
@sutekidayo @TheRealAltcoin @ChrisPacia #Bitcoin is not Quantum Safe, sorry.
@Sen_JoeManchin coincidence?  Bitcoin is for the people and a game changer.  It will save the 99%ers BILLIONS in garbage fees bty the banks!
@Sen_JoeManchin @ThePetroDollar This guy doesn't even know what economics is, go back grazing cows in WV
Why, is no one giving you a cut? RT @Sen_JoeManchin Click here to read the letter I have sent to federal regulators seeking a ban on Bitcoin
@Sen_JoeManchin a new and disruptive technology is emerging!  BAN IT!
.@Sen_JoeManchin you're a piece of shit.
@ChrisPacia @Sen_JoeManchin Chris Pacia, even if true, that's not productive at all. Please represent opposing views in a mature manner.
.@pmarreck @Sen_JoeManchin why should I be mature when the asshole wants to cut off my livelihood and drive my invmnts down to 0? Fuck him!
@ChrisPacia @Sen_JoeManchin Because he's a Senator with (superficially) rational intentions (protection), that's why. Intelligent debate pls
@pmarreck @ChrisPacia @Sen_JoeManchin You can't have intelligent debates with morons.
@Sen_JoeManchin Go to hell. 

You don't get to disenfranchise a worthy innovation and claim a moral high ground at the same time.
@Sen_JoeManchin your facts are beyond laughable and wrong.  I would love to have a discussion with you concerning Bitcoin.
@Sen_JoeManchin  Senator Joe Manchin is bought and paid for by J.P. Morgan

@Sen_JoeManchin Check out the response. :) http://read.bi/MzxmCZ 
@Sen_JoeManchin How much funding from @JPMorgan have you received in your career?
@Sen_JoeManchin Manchin was the sole Democrat to vote against a provision to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
@Sen_JoeManchin Joe Manchin, financially supported by @Chase Bank and other banks, spreads #lies about #bitcoin:
@Sen_JoeManchin Loves freedom. As long as that freedom is bought and sold with greenbacks. Asshat.
@Sen_JoeManchin @BitcoinBolt good luck senator joe manchin but you have no chance of banning bitcoin #hittheshowers #gofkurself
@Sen_JoeManchin Your BTC crusade: 8 JPMorgan Chase & Co    $30,550 $15,550 $15,000
@Sen_JoeManchin - Control freak senators like you are disruptive, maybe we should ban you not bitcoin
@Sen_JoeManchin how would you ban the use of something as a means of trade? I can trade dirt for goods if someone will take it. But not BTC?
@Sen_JoeManchin @BitcoinBolt but they cannot find:-)
@Sen_JoeManchin The US Dollar is the number one criminal currency. Cash$ is annoymous without any public ledger.Should it be banned?
@Sen_JoeManchin “clear ends of Bitcoin for either transacting in illegal goods & services or speculative gambling make me weary of its use.”
@Sen_JoeManchin criticized in the press for using taxpayer funds to purchase 17 flat screen TVs for the Governors Mansion
@Sen_JoeManchin The good Senator received campaign funds from JP Morgan.Hmmmm?His letter was an embarrassment.I will campaign against him
@Sen_JoeManchin I will be starting the fundraisers to elect your opponent #bitcoin
@Sen_JoeManchin you just proved your ignorance and incompetence to the millions of people who understand #bitcoin better then you
@Sen_JoeManchin You're so proud of that letter. However, you have no idea what you're talking about. You should probably just resign now.
Trying not to be rude here, @Sen_JoeManchin, but consider speaking to @aantonop or @pmarca to actually learn about what you write about.
@Sen_JoeManchin We use @Bitcoin to escape government control. You people are monsters.
@Sen_JoeManchin Your BTC crusade: 8 JPMorgan Chase & Co    $30,550 $15,550 $15,000
@Sen_JoeManchin Any currency is used for illegal purposes, that does not make it a reason to ban it.
@Sen_JoeManchin he voiced his displeasure with MTV's reality show Buckwild and addressed the network's president requesting it be cancelled.
@Sen_JoeManchin Manchin violated Blankenship's 1st Amend rights by threatening increased gov scrutiny due to his political activities.
@Sen_JoeManchin You deleted my earlier tweets you crook. As a reminder I called you ignorant and incompetent.
@Sen_JoeManchin  Joe, fix the economy and don't worry about BTC. When you guys help the economy we can talk BTC. Deal?
@GuglielmoChris @Sen_JoeManchin How about not even then? This is none of their business.
@Sen_JoeManchin @cheddarchezz USD is regulated and still used, quite widely, for illegal things.
@BOSSJEDIZOHAN @Sen_JoeManchin it's not like HSBC laundered billions to the Mexican cartel or anything.
@cheddarchezz @BOSSJEDIZOHAN @Sen_JoeManchin are you going to shut them down or imprison those involved? Oh wait...
@Onetallnerd @cheddarchezz @Sen_JoeManchin People like to forget the mortgage crash was because of USD and stupid lending.
@Sen_JoeManchin Remember when Bitcoin crashed the economy in 2008? No? How about a ban on credit default swaps?
“@Sen_JoeManchin: Click here to read the letter I have sent to federal regulators seeking a ban on Bitcoin: http://1.usa.gov/ODo1f6 ” fuck off
@Sen_JoeManchin Is this because you are not very smart?  BTC is actually providing fiscal stimulus.
Dejar @Sen_JoeManchin  You clearly don't understand that Bitcoin is not anonymous at all, there's a public ledger. Letter is missinforming.
@Sen_JoeManchin You would have also tried to have banned the world wide web if you were a senator in the 90's? Please have some more vision.
@Sen_JoeManchin I took the liberty of correcting a few typos in your letter http://www.scribd.com/doc/209600688/Corrected-Letter-From-Senator-Joe-Manchin …
@Sen_JoeManchin Senator, I'm with the Bitcoin Association - are you willing and open minded to discuss or debate the issue of Bitcoin?
@brucefenton @Sen_JoeManchin until Mr's Manchin's personal interests are not involved, im predicting he wont be open minded to discuss it
@Sen_JoeManchin This Foolishness is not going to get you ReElected.  Your Dangerous to the future of our Country. Don't stifle innovation
@Sen_JoeManchin you ignorant shithead. #Bitcoin is unstoppable. Are you going to try to #ban email too? #Derp http://imgur.com/l0pzRif  #crypto
@Sen_JoeManchin you should also seek to ban cash, as it is widely used by criminal organisations and for illicit activities. Cash is evil!
@Sen_JoeManchin gaming consoles were banned in China for 14 years - why didn't you seek to have them banned in the US?
@Sen_JoeManchin @davemcclure maybe the senator is worries it will clog up those interweb pipes #dullard
@Sen_JoeManchin Wow, would-be tyranny and full-blown idiocy, smooshed into only 140 characters. My hat is off to you, sir.
@Sen_JoeManchin Lots of useful technologies can also be used for illicit purposes... doesn't mean they should be banned.
@Sen_JoeManchin wow. You really need to inform yourself before taking a stance.
@Sen_JoeManchin ban stupidity then we can be rid of your useless prattling #bitcoin #tlot
@Sen_JoeManchin I propose we ban Joe Manchin. What an idiot.
@Sen_JoeManchin God save us from useless politicians trying to save us!
@Sen_JoeManchin Sad to see so much passion against something your clearly to do understand. How about focusing this passion on W VA issues?
We need to call for a ban on @Sen_JoeManchin. He is Highly Disruptive to new ideas and New Technology. He is destroying our Economy!
@Sen_JoeManchin FOR Suppressing pro-consumer & pro-small bz innovation in financial services to increase choices, lower fees, sell globally.
@Sen_JoeManchin FOR maintaining high credit-card fees for much of American economy, reducing standard of living for many Americans
@Sen_JoeManchin Looks Like We Have Another Member of the Senate in the Pockets of the Big Banks.
“@Sen_JoeManchin: Click here to read the letter I have sent to federal regulators seeking a ban on Bitcoin: http://1.usa.gov/ODo1f6 ” < !
@Sen_JoeManchin you should ban fiat cash too, as most drugs are purchased with it! And unlike Bitcoin, cash is 100% anonymous.
@Sen_JoeManchin So no ones given you a fat envelope full of #bitcoin? Tread lightly, we are vast, cunning and the future.
Hello @Sen_JoeManchin, when was the last time your tweets got 166 replies, 80 retweets and 27 favorites?! #bitcoin
@Sen_JoeManchin How does Bitcoin threaten the US economy exactly?  It's not clear from your letter.
@Sen_JoeManchin Senator Joe Manchin is bought and paid for by J.P. Morgan
@Sen_JoeManchin it was probably written for him by JPMorgan Chase & Co one of his funders $30,550 for the full list http://www.coindesk.com/us-senator-bitcoin-ban-letter-federal-regulators/ …
@Sen_JoeManchin I applaud your forward looking stance and urge you to consider a full ban of the Internet, it's clearly bad for the States.
@Sen_JoeManchin please ban everyone over the age of 60. They're crusty. #banbitcoin
@Sen_JoeManchin  Greetings our banking sector spokesperson.   Its always fun to see who is doing their bidding.
@Sen_JoeManchin case with drug cartels you dipshit. You had no idea what you're talking about, I never even heard of you until today. Nerd
@Sen_JoeManchin American dollars are unstable. You say they are regulated but when was the last audit? You forget HSBC & their $ laundering
@Sen_JoeManchin What is wrong with you? How could you be this incorrect? I didn't even know who you were before someone reposted your crap.
@Sen_JoeManchin including drug trafficking and $ laundering. Gee, Joe. That sounds a lot like Dollars. Euros. Yen. They all do that. Ban em!
@Sen_JoeManchin @BryceWeiner lets have handguns but not coins based on math. 'Murica!
@Sen_JoeManchin says that Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is unregulated and unstable, and has been used in illicit activity (1/2).
@Sen_JoeManchin I used to respect you even through I disagree with you. Now you want to take away my money. I insist you with draw that.
@Sen_JoeManchin Suggestions: Get some bitcoins and try spending them... such a simple action might reveal their value to you.
@Sen_JoeManchin how does someone with such a small mind (small mindedness) end up in the senate? Innovation is good fella!
.@Sen_JoeManchin This request is short-sighted at best. Please educate yourself first. #Cash is far better for money laundering than #BTC.
@Sen_JoeManchin How exactly do you plan to enforce this ban? I don't think you've really thought this through.
@Sen_JoeManchin You are motivated by and are working for @Chase ...not the American People
@Sen_JoeManchin When almost every point of yours is wrong or cherry picked, one has to wonder if you'd ban human ingenuity if you could.
@Sen_JoeManchin I heard about this other anonymous and irreversible payment method call "cash"... can you ban that too?
lol, @Sen_JoeManchin wants to ban #Bitcoin. http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/internet-guffaws-at-senators-quixotic-proposal-to-ban-bitcoin/ … … #SeriesOfTubes
@Sen_JoeManchin It'll be amusing to watch them try. Can they also ban moronism? Also, please ban irrelevant and pathetic government people.
@Sen_JoeManchin they will ban fuck wits from becomming politicians before they ban bitcoins u rerarded moron... wtf how can u be so retarded
@Sen_JoeManchin our lives would be much better if all the politicians in Washington kept their ignorance to themselves #tlot #tcot #bitcoin
@Sen_JoeManchin Perhaps you should focus on getting the internet infrastructure in your own state up to modern standards.
@Sen_JoeManchin Food feeds criminals and terrorists, We must ban food to protect consumers from it.
@Sen_JoeManchin Stay out of crypto you bought and paid for politician.
@Sen_JoeManchin Great Job Joe- Jamie sends his regards ( nice wad of green-backs for you in manilla envelope behind lobby toilet  1st floor)
@Sen_JoeManchin Don't ban Bitcoin. Not that you could. Fix it. Make it safer for investors and businesses. See: #ethereum
@spasinsky @ethereumreport @Sen_JoeManchin Fix what? If it ain't broke you can't fix it.
@cryptofabz @ethereumreport @Sen_JoeManchin There are still a few things to work out. Features. Applications. Exchange regulations. Etc.
@Sen_JoeManchin #Bitcoin is not a currency. It's a decentralized protocol with a currency built on top of it, with room for so much more!
.@Sen_JoeManchin However, I will assume that you are well-intentioned. I strongly urge you to explore the possibilities of #Bitcoin.
.@Sen_JoeManchin haha wow. Banning #Bitcoin is virtually impossible. The opinions of your letter are insulting to those who elected you.
@Sen_JoeManchin If you don't think #Bitcoin (or whatever replaces it) is the future of money, then you just don't understand it yet!
@Sen_JoeManchin you seem to be confused.  China and Thailand have not banned Bitcoin. They both have thriving bitcoin ecosystems in fact.
@Sen_JoeManchin @christinelu Politics over people, create laws with-out understanding the impact, technology or benefit time to #retirejoe
@Sen_JoeManchin You are afraid that Bitcoin is unstable but you support a currency saddled with $17,000,000,000,000 in debt, ROTFLOL at you
@Sen_JoeManchin You're right #BTC's disruptive enough to make ppl like you irrelevant.Wish the same success your ilk had banning #bittorrent
@Sen_JoeManchin It is transparent that ur BTC document has been drafted out of ignorance or in response to lobbyist funding.  Please revise.
.@Sen_JoeManchin please get your facts right before proposing a law against something you know very little about.
@Sen_JoeManchin SUCH FAULTY LOGIC DEBATE ME LIVE ON TV
@Sen_JoeManchin can we ban you? #BTC
@Sen_JoeManchin It is a good thing drugs are not bought with dollars, those would be illegal too. And the NYSE for it's volatility
@Sen_JoeManchin it's sound like u know nothing about #bitcoin :(how old are you:?) we'll the future is going to pass you by pretty soon Sir!
@Sen_JoeManchin Will you send them letter if we Bitcoiners brib.. I mean donate to you like JP Morgan did? #bitcoin #cryptocurrency
@Sen_JoeManchin Pathetic. Go get a legitimate job: one that doesn't involve coercion and force. #bitcoindoesntneedyourpermission
@Sen_JoeManchin You need to do more Homework on Bitcoin.
@Sen_JoeManchin In regards to Bitcoin sir, you have no idea what you are talking about. Bitcoin works just fine without a ban or regulation
@Sen_JoeManchin #Bitcoin is freedom, you are a want to be tyrant. Please disclose what interest paid you how much money to send this letter?
@Sen_JoeManchin You ignorant cuss
@Sen_JoeManchin The senator has been bought and paid for by J.P. Morgan.
@Sen_JoeManchin First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.
@Sen_JoeManchin You also deleted my earlier tweets you crook.
@Sen_JoeManchin just to let you know, for reasons like this, I'm not voting for you when you're up for re-election
.@Sen_JoeManchin Senator: Bitcoin can do a lot of good. Western Union costs the world's poor 5-10% fees to send money home. Bitcoin: <1% fee
@Sen_JoeManchin Please educate yourself and allow this enormous breakthrough in #Bitcoin a chance to breath and create ECONOMIC GROWTH!
@Sen_JoeManchin Such Intelligence.... Much WOW!!!! Your arguments re #Bitcoin are inept & logically inadequate. READ: http://bit.ly/1ftt6A4 
@Sen_JoeManchin  you probably wanted to ban the internet too
#BanAllTheThings!!!  “@Sen_JoeManchin: Click here to read the letter I have sent to federal regulators seeking a ban on Bitcoin
.@Sen_JoeManchin you do realize that federal reserve dollars are used by criminals too, correct?
@Sen_JoeManchin Why stop there? Ban electric horses, the telegraph, and TCP/IP.  Also, unicorns, rainbows, and things that are blue.
if you were worried about money laundering and criminal activity you would be better off trying to regulate it.  @Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin stop trying to limit your citizens' freedom to do as they please with their money. Are you not American? #bitcoin  #freedom
@Sen_JoeManchin Who do I need to send a letter to in order to ban you?
@Sen_JoeManchin you're a dumb controlling fuck
@Sen_JoeManchin I've called the police. I'm now calling the DC police to have them arrest you for threats against #Bitcoin Users & Investors
@Sen_JoeManchin I will see you in court. You are going to be charged with Hate Speech, Discrimination & Terroristic Threats against #Bitcoin
@Sen_JoeManchin I'm calling the local sheriff to file a police report against you. You are discriminating against peoples first amendment
I call for @Sen_JoeManchin to be arrested for his hate speech against all people who believe in Bitcoin, The Blockchain & Satoshi #BTCrights
@Sen_JoeManchin You are remarkably out of touch. Crookedness I've come to expect but this is actual idiocy. You have lost my vote.
@Sen_JoeManchin You are going to be impeached, arrested, sued & deported for violation US Law, Civil Rights & You are spreading Hate Speech.
@Sen_JoeManchin the fact is Bitcoin is NOT used for anything illegal you moron. @Gyft @BitPay @Coinbase & @Coinkite have shown its use.
@Sen_JoeManchin how many dinners & lunches have you had with @HSBC & @JPMorgan? You are a traitor to all American Business & all us citizens
@Sen_JoeManchin How much cocaine, weed & alcohol have you purchased with the US Dollar? You must provide a drug piss test, you sound high.
@Sen_JoeManchin Please read this http://samuelrpatterson.com/a-response-to-senator-manchins-call-to-ban-bitcoin/ …
Im writing a letter to have @Sen_JoeManchin impeached & arrested for violation of Senate Banking Rules, Bill Or Rights & The Constitution
As the first S-Corp in California, Where Bitcoin is now Legal Tender, @BitcoinKinetics publicly condemns @Sen_JoeManchin & asked to impeach
@BitcoinKinetics @Sen_JoeManchin I say bitcoin is lucky to have him as a detractor. Actually he gives btc credibility with his silliness.
@Makingpengos @BitcoinKinetics  I hadn't thought of it like that. Great perspective.
@Sen_JoeManchin you are an American Idiot. My company makes all machines accept Bitcoin. Bitcoin can never be banned you bank owned loser.
@Sen_JoeManchin I've bought way more drugs with cash than I have with Bitcoin. Maybe you should ban cash instead.
@Sen_JoeManchin your position on bitcoin is terrible. Why not Ban US dollars because illicit use? Federal reserve banking as its harmful?
Hey @Sen_JoeManchin Where is the letter you sent to put HSBC executives in prison? #hypocrite
@Sen_JoeManchin Here is some bitcoin background for you to consider:
@Sen_JoeManchin Coinality will donate 1 #Bitcoin (~$585) to a charity of your choice to do an #AMA on #Reddit -
@Sen_JoeManchin @YourAnonNews You're letting our home state down, Sen. Manchin.
@TeaWithCarl @Sen_JoeManchin the internet allows for terrorists to communicate faster and anon.. Should the internet be banned now?
@Sen_JoeManchin censures #bitcoin. He has also collected $174,300 in political contributions from commercial banks.
@PerianneDC @Sen_JoeManchin Typical politician. They're either weak, or easily bribable.
@Sen_JoeManchin Looks like you own Bitcoins now :) 
http://www.tippercoin.com/#/profile/Sen_JoeManchin …
@Sen_JoeManchin We will be sending large donations in the form of Bitcoin to your 2016 opponent who ever it is!
I clicked that, @Sen_JoeManchin, and I wonder how you feel about other currencies used to buy illicit things. Heard of the US Dollar?
@Sen_JoeManchin  "You get fucked by one system, you create another one."
@Sen_JoeManchin Uninformed reaction to action of a small subset of the Bitcoin community.  http://ledracapital.com/blog/2014/2/17/bitcoin-series-19-bizarre-shadowy-paper-based-payment-system-being-rolled-out-worldwide …
@Sen_JoeManchin His banking buddies robbed and broke the people of this country and this is one reason why this coin was created.
@Sen_JoeManchin After you ban BitCoin can you please ban twerking?
@Sen_JoeManchin Bottom line..."Thats who pulls Joe's strings, threaten energy or banking and hes going to come after you"
@Sen_JoeManchin 18 JPMorgan Chase & Co $30,550 $15,550 $15,000 19 Chesapeake Energy $28,900 $11,400 $17,500 THATS ENOUGH LIST JUST GOES ON!

@Sen_JoeManchin Here's some info for everyone! Retweet this! "Yes he is not only on the banking committee but also on the energy committee.
@Sen_JoeManchin Senator, please read this letter in response to your calls to ban #Bitcoin. Thank you for your time.
@SamuelPatt Excellent, Sam. Far nicer than my desire to callout the senator as so stupid he poses an imminent danger to himself and others.
@sylvandb Thank you.
@Sen_JoeManchin You do realise that those bribes you've taken to be a puppet will be worthless in a few years?! 
Don't care? You will!
@Sen_JoeManchin Let's ban the internet while we're at it. Cash too, that'll help protect hard working americans for sure!
Dumbass “@Sen_JoeManchin: Click here to read the letter I have sent to federal regulators seeking a ban on Bitcoin: http://1.usa.gov/ODo1f6 ”
@Sen_JoeManchin I think your focus needs to be shutting down the illegal service providers & not the currency used to purchase said services
@Sen_JoeManchin Tell all your bankster friends bribing you to hate on #bitcoin we said hi, and that #bitcoin is TOO BIG TO FAIL.
@Sen_JoeManchin Which bank is paying you to hate on #bitcoin? We all know that before the bribe showed up you didn't know #bitcoin existed.
@Sen_JoeManchin #bitcoin is bigger than you, bigger than congress, bigger than the United States.  You're out of your depth. I'd retract.
.@Sen_JoeManchin how about we use bitcoin to crowd fund your 2016 opponent.
@Sen_JoeManchin There's clearly no aptitude test for being a member of Congress.  I've never read such an unintelligible thing in my life.
@Sen_JoeManchin #bitcoin can you please stay out of economics, because you clearly speak without educating yourself first.  You sound dumb.
@Sen_JoeManchin Are you going to ban cash?  crime is committed with cash every day.  #bitcoin is more traceable than cash.  You're clueless.
@Sen_JoeManchin #bitcoin cannot be shut off.  There is no headquarters.  #bitcoin is not a business.  #bitcoin is not for you to ban.
@Sen_JoeManchin #bitcoin is here to stay. Be on the right side of history, support this amazing new technology. Clearly you need education
@Sen_JoeManchin #bitcoin is for good.  You sound like you're a shill for the big banks.  SHOCKER! you HAVE received big bank contributions.
@Sen_JoeManchin I am against your stance on Bitcoin, but I'd be happy to send you some Bitcoins if you consider changing your stance.
@Sen_JoeManchin It would be great if OUR legislators actually made an attempt to educate themselves before passing laws.
@Sen_JoeManchin I do not agree with you on your stance with Bitcoin, Bitcoin is Money 2.0, there is much more risk with credit cards online
@Sen_JoeManchin where is the petition to ban polititians?
@Sen_JoeManchin you can't ban bitcoin any more than you can ban JPG images
@Sen_JoeManchin you're an embarrassment to the entire state of WV. Retire before you do more harm
@Sen_JoeManchin You sound a lot like the skeptics of going off the gold standard. #bitcoin
@Sen_JoeManchin @YourAnonNews BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@Sen_JoeManchin Your views on bitcoin are just like your views on climate change.  Willful ignorance due to corporate allegiances.
@Sen_JoeManchin
@Sen_JoeManchin It appears your letter was written in the heat of the moment.  BTC is legal in Thailand& China.  Please do an AMA on Reddit.
.@Sen_JoeManchin if you were honest about being tough on illicit activity, you and your ilk would never allow "Too Big To Fail."
@Sen_JoeManchin Sad and misinformed. BTC is not anonymous. It is pseudonymous. Your points also reflect USD. Remember the bank bail-outs?
