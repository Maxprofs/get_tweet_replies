what a shame Your fellow Democrats don't feel the same way.  They do nothing but disparage hard working miners
You don't disparage miners you just want to eliminate their jobs and put them into poverty SHM
Not a little hyperbolic are you? Air and water are cleaner today than they were 50 years ago.
Trump just eliminated the reg that keeps coal mining from polluting our streams!
Save ACA for EVERY American, not just the mine workers in West Virginia!
I have a novel ideas Pay for your own health coverage instead of leaching off government
like big pharma and wall st do
I know it's hard but please think before you tweet, you make no sense at all.
voting to kill EPA is clearing road for polluters.  not a difficult connection
Just couldn't connect you linkage between Phara and Wall St with doing away with the EPA. Made No sense
Then why did you put them right back into the mines that are killing them? Better jobs like clean energy best!
Mining isn't a job you do 'cause U love the work. You do it 'cause U love TO work. Clean jobs now!
How would you know that? Have you been a coal miner?
.@MineWorkers @MikoAdaya @Sen_JoeManchin And i know the needs of miners are diff from the needs of Barons.
And pollute the streams with filth from coal mining companies!!!!
good luck, Repuglicans don't like people"living" off the government, rather they die and let rich be rich
Instead of fighting to save unhealthy coal industry, U should be working to bring renewable energy 2 your state
Health benefits should include safe drinking water as a right! No on Pruitt! #WaterIsLife #pollutingPruitt
.@elisleeing @Sen_JoeManchin @MineWorkers He voted yes on Pruitt because https://goo.gl/XG94T8.He  doesn't care abt miners.Cares abt Barons
how about protecting their financial security and environment by bringing in jobs outside coal?
He doesn't care about that, just wants to help his donors
Will you protect the water near the mines?
He won't.They just repealed Stream Protection Rule.He thinks we don't know
@lshi7175 @MineWorkers one of the few Dems that cares about the people
U should be working to bring clean renewable energy to your state - mining benefits no one but the mine owners
You're enabling the most INSANE president and you're part of the problem. 
#VoteOut2018
Yes. He thinks you don't know about this:
why do they need health benefits if you are voting in an EPA director who will kill them?
.@takeoutcreative @Sen_JoeManchin @MineWorkers Because he wants to look good without doing good. https://goo.gl/XG94T8  #wvpol
yup. @Sen_JoeManchin sold his #soul and the @MineWorkers to the #devil. #Pruitt
http://www.ecowatch.com/solar-job-growth-2197574131.html … why not give miners healthcare? Or even renewable fuels jobs tht won't kill their kids?
I agree. Yet he is unwilling to oppose his donors.
Bernie can't save you from our principles. We will not stop our protests, and we will NOT let you continue to screw us over.
.@EWuebbels @Sen_JoeManchin  Right on. Manchin just cares abt donors.
IF YOU VOTE FOR PRUITT YOU'RE POLITICAL CAREER IS OVER. WE WILL VOTE YOU OUT
.@lifeisgreatinpc @Sen_JoeManchin @MineWorkers  Lawsie, I hope so.
you're working hard to get your daughter out of the #Epipen mess. #CrossingPartyLines #District25701 #VoteYouOut
Everyone will need their health benefits after your boy EPA Scott Pruitt destroys the environment.
2- @Sen_JoeManchin exists in the same fake bubble of the DemElites that have destroyed the middle class protecting corporate interests & $$$
carbon trapped in ice shows we r making the planet uninhabitable  http://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/ … GOP will kill us all
Not just the GOP. Manchin and his ilk take a big part.
it's great ur running + addrssing misconceptions abt @EPA, WVs can vote 2transform 2 green econ @Sen_JoeManchin @MineWorkers
How about the rest of us, Joe? Work to protect the ACA!
.@AmyEphemera @Sen_JoeManchin He doesn't care about any of us.
Single payer system
3- @Sen_JoeManchin controlled opposition wont work again. Voters r tired of the lies & vacant promises of the Dems who smile but serve $$$.
.@KaseyJRogers @Sen_JoeManchin YES WE ARE. Thank you. Because we know this:
Water is cleaner NOW because of EPA http://regulations.Now  you want to kill the regulations and people of WV.
You sold out the people of WV and the US by voting for a billionaire who knows nothing about public education.
Protect the owners' right to contaminate, then they won't NEED health benefits. Cancer will take care of that.
- how about protecting their air and water? Jobs mean nothing if u are being poisoned and choked on poison air. Shame on u.
too bad you didn't care about protecting ALL West Virginia's health and safety when you voted for Pruitt.
reality check trying to save an outdated energy source. Killing EPA bad for everyone
how about you retrain them for jobs that don't kill them
How about protecting their lives with a decent EPA Commissioner?
.@sjcarl @Sen_JoeManchin @MineWorkers Do you think he doesn't know the diff between miners &Barons--or doesn't care?
Coal miners are also the sickest group of Americans. That's because breathing in all that dust is safe-right?
It safely makes his donors lots of profits.
if you really cared about your people - you'd close mines and give them clean energy jobs #shameful #lastterm
A pension's not worth a damn when you have black lung.  Some things are worth more than your "job" Senator.
Why don't you fight to retrain them so they don't have to do the hardest job :/
Please.@Sen_JoeManchin You care NOTHING about their health (or anyone's) or you wouldn't have voted to confirm Pruitt as head of the EPA.
How about finding them a healthier way to make a living?
VOTE NO FOR PRUITT
If you want to help your miners vote no to Pruitt. He doesn't care about health.
YES. Because here are the cold calculations they don't want miners to know.
good on you and well done, but why did you vote for sessions and now Pruitt??
Yes, fight for coal miners, but don't forget to fight for clean air, water & land too! Vote no on #scottpruitt!
.@kincaid323 @Sen_JoeManchin @MineWorkers Of course he didn't vote no on Pruitt. He doesn't care about protecting us.
how about our land/water/air?  Coal is not healthy for workers or America. Clean & safe energy 4 employment.
join trump to MAGA and get your Americans back to work again
Do you really believe the honest, hard working Americans who voted for you have faith in you anymore-dream on!
you see... This is why you LIE!
Hahahaha yeah right! You DO NOT care about mine workers. You care about YOUR pockets. Stop lying!  @Sen_JoeManchin @MineWorkers
please vote no on Pruitt for the safety and health of all!
and allowing the poisoning of west virginia streams will help anyone's health how? @Sen_JoeManchin @MineWorkers

then why does not the democrat and rhinos support coal production instead of shutting production??
Those of us who are NOT mine workers are hard working,too.  Support us, also!
Please vote against Scott Pruitt. Do you want our beautiful clean streams to become orange again? Keep WV beautiful. Vote no
.@vickiemwv @Sen_JoeManchin As you now know, he voted for Pruitt. And here's why: he doesn't care about us. https://goo.gl/XG94T8  #wvpol
miners protection act cannot be postponed, this is very important! Go Joe!!!
sounds like you need to talk to one of Repub BFFs like say McConnell who is holding this up.
@Oma8612 @MineWorkers Wish You Would have Voted for Price!
I don't believe you after watching your voting for despicable cabinet nominees.  And vote for guns for mental.
Here's why he votes that way. Money (surprised, right?)
5- @Sen_JoeManchin The only difference between the Dems and Repubs is... Oh, wait! There is no difference. Good luck at your townhall.
wth deregulation they need good health care and who will pay to clean the water for the Mine workers children?
d Your action-voting Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary-says otherwise. What will you DO to protect miners/workers?
1- @Sen_JoeManchin thinks Protestors anger should just b directed at the GOP yet he & other NeoLib Dems rubber stamp 45s cabinet? Get a clue
Do you support an investigation into Russia and #45?
