My hometown is the Clarksburg Bridgeport area. 
I'm in Morgantown. Born and raised!!
Morgantown and Bridgeport have been rated 2 of the best places to live n WV. Ruby is a great hospital.
I prefer Mon General. Lol
they sure can use the help #wvstrong
the Richwood band is a small single a school band but they have more members than most bands  they love their bands in richwood
This WV born girl between the tears & heartbreak says bless you!! #wvstrong
The devastation in the southern part of the state is beyond anything we've seen. We First Responders are exhausted #wvstrong
we need lots of help. Several schools are affected and many students and student/athletes futures are in question:(
@BradPaisley
@YouTube Thank U 4 telling the truth
a benefit show in Nashville could help, you could easily fill up the TPAC or Opry house
why not have it in his home state of WV..where the damage really is?
more artist around Nashville to come out
Brad came home to do a benefit show yrs ago when OH River flooded his home area
heading down Sunday with a load of stuff. My hometown was hit hard

Pulling in the big guns, huh? @BradPaisley - This team is definitely not afraid to get a little mud on the tires.

I sympathize with people of West Virginia.
even though u like me no longer live there it is still HOME
my hometown in Greenbrier County is basically gone from all the flooding. It is such a tragedy and so heartbreaking to see.
