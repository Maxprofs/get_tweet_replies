I am a White male long-time Dem who voted for Trump-Pence and proud of it, you're an outstanding man
You are a good man  Mr Pence I am proud to call you my VP You and Mr Trump are the prefect match
Friend
R Case.
Someone needs to tell Trump what a sleeze Assange is..he's not a hotbed of truth
The Senator is a true Patriot and an honest man. I just hope Chucky hasn't sent him out as the sacrificial lamb.
@TeamTrump is he the Sen whose daughter is a CEO of a pharmaceutical co that hikes prices of a life saving drug?
Manchin. You are a traitor. How can you support a racist for Attorney General. #TraitorTrump
Two men that really care about America.  Looking forward to a productive year ahead.
I would poss vote 4 Joe M in future if he were on NC ballot. Nice man
Joe don't let us down and support our second amendment.  In my community I need protection....
He needs to become a Republican.


refreshing to see a democrat being respectful and reaching out.
Stop touching your penis
losers
gold to see you are doing all the reaching out that Trump should be doing.
Mr. Man chin is the same old Socialist #Dem. Redistribution of wealth is all #Obamacare is about. NOT #HC!
@MAMASLAVV @Sen_JoeManchin Love you Mr. Vice President. Ohhhhh that sounds good !!!
He knew!!
good luck if he willing to work with you
I think we see total partisan guy. But who could blame him? . .anyone not fitting the Trumpian genome?
Kiss it! Kiss the #MAGA ring! @Sen_JoeManchin

I look forward to having him cross the aisle
only if he is on the trump train
I really like @Sen_JoeManchin. He's a moderate Dem willing to work w GOP for betterment of country. He put country above party
need to get #PaulRyan to move faster! #summer is not acceptable! #healthcare
he won't budge! Remember black lung benefits in WVA big part of ACA/ OBAMACARE! You lose again!
can we talk about gay republicans who are in the closet & how we can get them out in the open for electrocution?
Manchin is a progressive and very deceitful, be wary.
Glad to hear a politician say he is was sent there by the people to work together for all the people.
Mr. Pence, please leave our social security and Medicare alone. The elderly struggle already.
Wow 2 people I've never heard of talking about sports
you sat down with Pence but you didn't meet with the President and fellow Dems? Hard being a Democrat from WV?
V.P Pence. please , we expats, who vote en masse, need tax break. Not fair , expensive,and only US does this .
oh yea nice removing ethics committee ur not Christians you only hate and kill Americans remember the Iraq war?
U killed Americans in Iraq, bankrupt the country, increased terror from killing Americans in Iraq. Shame
: Joe you're making we hillbillies very happy. Cooperation is the key to Making America Great Again.
Give you any free epipens?
Are u & @realDonaldTrump going to help me @TerriZezza or do I just speak to talk to myself. We are poor!
Good luck with that...When he votes with Conservatives, then I will believe it.....
Talk him into moving away from the dark side
you both get impeached as traitors.  Go live with your buddy Putin & leave the USA alone
Mike you are a traitor as is Donald. Oh and 50 electoral votes illegal and so yuo 2 are not our Pres & VP.  Hope
@bbnfan89 @Sen_JoeManchin I don't trust Manchin.
"You can Keep Obamacare,  if you want to keep Obamacare". .see if anyone wil! Possible way to transition?
Might I suggest Toby Keith to perform at the inauguration?  Very patriotic!
U R a GR8 example of how Amer ppl expect Govt 2 work: ie together not as obstructionists! Keep up the good work
i hope you tell the globalist pupets ryan mccain gram and mconnell . They need to get in line and follow andhelp
He is a gentleman
I like the bi-partisan spirit with Senator Manchin

He just needs to come on over
Thank you Joe Manchin for putting Americans first!
You Are The #AntiChrist
One dino, doubt you will find 7 more and you need 7 to push your hate on America.
Manchin wants to make sure his constituents see this.
this is what is needed. Forget party work together for the American people
Interesting how the security briefings to Obama and PE Trump are on 2 separate days, why not together? Same info or not?
A good meeting about selling out coal miners health care
Good to know. #MAGA

Was pu$$y grabbing on top of the list? Hey, if you want to waste time and look good, call a meeting.
Immediately after the wasted time meeting call a press conference and brag about each other. Forget meeting.

@TeamTrump do not work with Dems. Crush them. Radical vile filth cesspool. We must defeat them so they never rise again
@OldLinePatriot @Sen_JoeManchin 10 Blue-dog Democrats working with Trump could change America for the better....So exciting!
Sen. Manchin needs to come on over to the Republican Party- His state spoke loud & clear for Trump/Pence!
RT @mike_pence: Had a good meeting this afternoon with @Sen_JoeManchin. I look forward to working with him in the future. https://t.co/tspZ…
GOOD     HAPPY   TO   READ
definitely a Dem we can respect. Looking forward to it!
you are evil!
@vlynn2016 @Sen_JoeManchin I am very impressed w/you VP Pence as I watched your press conference today. Thank God you're chosen
Senator Manchin seems level-headed to me and someone we can work with for the benefit of the American people!
His reward for not attending Obama meeting today.  Instead he meets with the conversion therapy VP

Makes me even more proud to be a West Virginia native!!! 
Finally, one with his own brain
Already proving yourself a loyal member of the team, Comrade!
Come on over, Joe. Join the movement.....!
THEIRSAVIDEOGOINGAROUNDOFA WHITEKIDWHOGOTKIDNAPPEDIN CHICAGOBYBLACKTHUGS&TORTUREDHIM~HES A TRUMPSTER HELP HIM!!
#POTUS and #DNC politicizing intel community. Misrepresenting long term espionage activity as single act against election.
Don't trust Manchin he would put his mother under the bus to further his political ambitions
Have you asked, does he look forward to working with you?
traitor
The voters are watching you
not if we have anything to do with it.
I am so happy to hear that Senator Manchin is a very unique man All can learn from him and from his experiences.

@TeamTrump @Sen_JoeManchin.   Don't turn your back Mr VP
How does a man likeU support &work closely with a man like Trump.In his position words matter&He'sTerrorizingUSA
Repeal Medicare and my Medicare premium goes up! AARP members and I are going to be fighting mad!..
Good for you.
it would be great to have Cruz as Supreme Court Judge... No one would expect him!!! He is mainstream He is qualified
I'm sure you'll make a very good president. I mean VICE president. Does Don meet with anyone?@Sen_JoeManchin
@mlong42947 you are rejected and resisted. Only getting started
Love Mike Pence, great asset!
Can we change the calendar to January 20 tomorrow?  The long tedious wait is gruesome already.

He is one of the few level headed DEMS so far.
@Queen4ever7 @Sen_JoeManchin ...seriously.....
....  Is he saying the Gov. Will be working with or in the White House???? Either?? Hear bad of Joe....u know more .
he is hoping to get Joe on board about repealing & replacing Obamacare
you should quit your job.
Your knees will thank you.
what are your plans to fix the trucking industry mainly the fmcsa disaster
You should persuade him to switch to Republican.
Don't trust turncoat Joe,he's about as trustworthy as Hillary Clinton is honest...
Ugh, McCain
The SAME SWAMP. The establishment owned by the donor class and establishment. Nothing changed
Joe sure let the people of w.va. DOWN
we love you Mike Pence you were awesome on the Hill today and Ryan knew where you and the President Elect stand
You're Trumps puppet!  You can't disagree with him because your father didn't raise you to be a real man!
Hands off my Obamacare! When you pay for your insurance and not the taxpayers, we can talk!
Repeal ACA without a replacement? Deprive 59M Americans of insurance because you can’t agree on something better? CRIMINAL.
Pence- u have so much class!
Good on ya, Pence! Keep up the good work! Serious changes need to happen in your first term. I wish you well.
http://therightscoop.com/mark-levin-donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-cannot-let-chuck-schumer-play-god-audio/ …
Did you talk about more coal & less gay people? Remember your oath to serve ALL Americans.
Come on over to the GOP!
He can be a good ali for y'all
Barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen is the way you like to see women eh Pence? #Sexist #Arrogant
you are awesome!  This is what Americans want.  Both sides working together and getting good things done.
i really wonder about Joe !! Dems must prove they are Trust Worthy Same as All Republicans !! One Law at a Time ! Change Culture
We are going to make SO MUCH MON-AY!! #moneydrop
This looks like the love child of Assange and Trump.
#DeadSexy
He should caucus with the Republicans.

So I guess all these so-called human rights activists & journalists are okay with the "opposition" denying Syrians in Damascus water supply.
