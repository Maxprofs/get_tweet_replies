Member Jesus Walks Kanye?
It was a "curse" to him, nor a privilege! Too bad he didn't have the "privilege" of being a kid from Fort Greene, BK or Detroit. Oh the choices we make... 
Take me with you!
Apparel has an embarrassing carbon footprint. Free think on that. 
Kayne.. Your mind is beautiful keep spitting. Homie.

Lol gtfoh
Please focus your message. Get out from under your opioid fog. If your message is abt free thought & love then pharmaceuticals are imprisoning your mind. I hope people view the entire TMZ video because it really shows you trying:almost as if you’re trying to speak w/out sound.

The breakthrough not the breakdown! Kanye the GOAT!!!

Kanye you are a legend 
hi kanye

Kanye is just like Thanos. They both mean well and probably have pure intentions. BUT the way they are going about getting what they want accomplished is the issue #IfSlaveryWasAChoice #InfinityWar
Virgil does not approve of this twitter usage!
nawww, it's his eyes - his mind - that's open! #KanyeIsRight
Kanye is a good person just like his ancestors who were enslaved. He is being used by the conservatives to be manipulated and enslaved and betrayed again just like at the start of this country.
I love you brother keep spitting that truth

You need inner peace!
. @kanyewest @RealCandaceO RT this video to your followers. this ex KGB agent perfectly describes how to subvert a nation and how many generations it takes. perfectly explains how we've all been brainwashed.

Please don't let anyone stop you

FASHION ICON
Wassup ye when the album gone drop?
Where’s the good old kanye? I’ll even take bad old kanye of Pablo days.
Old Pablo days? Lol that was two years ago and he was saying the same stuff. He’s just being more persistent about it being known.
I'll still take that Kanye from 2 years ago...
...but he is the exact same as he was then. What has changed?
Your hiring?
You're *
I meant to say you lol omg who cares
Ye a good man
That’s correct.
Rather anyone is right or wrong in your EYES...
Be KIND to each other.We all have completely different SOULS inside of us...
Why can’t that be a LOVING thing..#NONE of us get things right! 
We bang all around on this PLANET disrespectful to one another..LOVE IS POWER
When are you going to design cock socks for your daddy Caitlin?

Super cold

Listen to my new song "Purple Hearts" ft lilnappyboi  follow my IG : mightyjoeee if you like it                                                      https://soundcloud.com/oey242/purple-hearts-ft-lil-nappy-boi-prod-by-xtravulous …
Possibly album of the year... 

If timbaland, just blaze, kanye west and dr dre got together to produce an album it'd sound like this...


https://soundcloud.com/toyhollow/old-ways …
1. US ~800,000 Black slaves

2. South America ~9,000,000 Black slaves

3. Africa 1,000,000+ WHITE slaves (Barbary Slave Trade)

4. Southern states fell into the common world system

5. Process wasnt easy, but Black & White VISIONARIES ended slavery in US using the #Constitution!
Please don’t let anyone stop you 
At the next trump rally we’re going to see everyone dressed in Yeezy..
It's problematic to me that he gained so many "fans" by demonizing black people. Making false and disengenuous comments. These people don't love him. They love what he currently stands for.
You pay the cost to be the boss
Dems gone nuts.
The Democrats' latest Russian agent? @KanyeWest. 
https://twitter.com/funder/status/991775864475017216 …
@funder is calling @kanyewest a Russian spy.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkF9B3a41QhcbhvOsHA0uGQ … better rapper than kanye
What is the point of this video?
L. Courtney, cant be bought anymore he has opened up Yeezy ..and he already markets his own album labels etc. Kanye cant be bought and he is trying to show the black people that if u work hard u can accomplish things and he is also revitalizing an area in a black community.
I believe that and it makes me very happy. But I couldn't figure out the video. I must have missed its importance.
You got people worshipping you now that you're "here". While those of us who supported you when you were here in real life with the rest of us are perplexed. Love is love. So we still love you. I guess we just feel like some "1st wives club" stuff.
You HAVE to know that the life you currently live, while perhaps broadening your perspective, isn't enjoyed by most of us. You don't have to STAY where you come from, but don't forget, either.
Many of us travel, and then we come home. Vacationing into the life of a millionaire isn't the type of travel we can afford. It's more of us than of you. Don't discount us and our experiences. The REAL world of commoners is actually where it's at.
It wasn’t a choice back then....   But because of the, “ Willy Lynch Doctrine “, we as a people have that enslaved mindset pass down through the generations. Kanye should elaborate on it !!!!!

Potato viseo for potato people wearing potato clothes calling it fashion. 
Kanye, I love seeing who you really are! I have never listed to your music before. Now I can't wait to buy your new album! So glad that you were able to #MKGA & in doing so will help #MAGA & that trickle effect will #MTWG too. Thanks for participating in #TheGreatAwakening 
@kanyewest kept  his opinions to himself until AFTER THE ELECTION-WE ALL KNOW THE IMPACT HE COULVE HAD IF HE SPOKE BEFORE! #KANYEWEST DID #NOT AFFECT OUTCOME #64MILLION NOT VOTING @Ava doc DID! Kanye has a right to his opinion! YOU NEED TO RESEACH ALL FACTORS IN TRUMP WIN.

I love you Kanye 
You are too switched on for society. An absolute genius & master artist.' This world needs you right now'
seek help Kellyanne Kanye you're in a dark place and Candice Owens only got her platform b/c Republicans want to turn any Black person they can into making blacks the problems.
Be humble


H

can you pleaseeee let Shia help out with the creative direction and styling pleasseeeeeeee
Can I model for your brand 
@kanyewest 

The struggle is real. I love the direction your headed. If your truly always inspiring to learn and searching for wisdom check out Penny Kelly Author of The Robes. Unless you already have. Much love and respect.
You used to be a grate artist but now you just a lacky with a whack ass album that might not even sell. You used to stand for something now you stand for nothing. When the real you shows up let me know okay.
It's a tshirt. You are holding up a t-shirt.
