Wanna swing by my thesis presentation on geosimulating infectious disease outbreaks next week at @HarvardGSD ?
Only 40 plays away from hitting my goal this month, give some of my tunes a few spins and help your boy out:

Are you on bath salts?
I think he's on week one of a new anti depressant or something. Luckily all those bad ideas will die on the vine once the medication evens out  
For those wondering what Sci-Arc is:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California_Institute_of_Architecture …

And Ashley Morgan Hastings is a masters of architecture student there.
Kanye has a love for architecture. According to Joe Perez, former lead art director at DONDA, the Cruel Summer album cover was inspired by architecture.
I like some of the Kanye songs, but what the fuck does he know about Architecture?!
Yeah, i know. He also loves interior design and stuff like that. He's a national treasure when it comes to good taste.
OWNED!
How come that tweet is not in Obama timeline? Did you do a little underhanded photoshopping? 
My brother @ryan_baum graduated from Sci-Arc last Sept. He made a comedy for his THESIS 
Clever! But why does Darby refer to it as “Shulman’s house”?
I have a nano filtration tech that saves reverse osmosis plants time (filters) and money. We can even make lithium from etc from frack water waste. 

My inventor is the shit and has the most valient heart. 

;) Keep up your awesome work 
He is releasing his bullet proof box design for classrooms, open source.

If I may be so bold to say, we should really link up. 

I've been searching world saving techs my whole life. I'm really proud of you for speaking up these days. It gives my heart hope.

Cheers to the fam

Yeah we are going to need that shit when your buddy’s regulation cutting ruins our fresh water
SIMPLE THING YOU CAN DO TODAY TO MAKE THE WORLD A MUCH BETTER PLACE FOR MILLIONS:  Just go away. Along with your wife and her ilk.  Spare humanity from ever having to hear your names, see your faces, backsides, breasts.

Take away democrat and it'd be even more accurate
Not really its well known democrats are more wealthier on average due to back door deals and corrupt policies.  Nancy polosi. Is a prime example worth 100 m as a senator. Hmmm
Lots of water out there ah?  
Bro let’s go in on a patent I’m workin on
Check out Water Starved World about Israel's desalination history, amazing read

stop with the monkey emoji yeezy enough is enough smdh man you fell off
I love that the monkey emoji is what’s getting to you here hahahahaha
I was in work there couldn't reply but damn they've ruined him k8

Desalination is the only answer to fresh water sustainability. Period.
Israel, look into it.
respect  for you gone....
Bitch you been around 40 years and you just learned about desalination?

A lot of people care I'm sorry
I meant no one cares what he says because he is..well..
Why is he a piece of shit? Because he has different opinions?...

Bro that’s why you touch little kids that get candy at corner stores.
Desalination is huge. Too expensive at the moment but as a species we are going to need it to survive! #TheFuture
Israel gets 55% of its water from desalination.
Thats great Kanye. Hows the tuition there my son who is working as a roofer apprentice (2years down- 2 to go) He wants to get contractor license But his real desire is to go to architecture school
Israel has been using it. In California we need to get our plants running to detour droughts.
It also will fuck this planet up for your kids’ kids. So maybe you should focus on something more beneficial, like renewable energy.
I'm working on solar desalination project to tackle scarcity of water in South Africa and other developing countries in Africa, and the world.
@kanyewest , Thank you For all the love you’ve Impacted on Millions
You didn’t know what desalination is?

Desalination could end water problems for all of CA, but @JerryBrownGov would rather spend $1B on a train that will have ZERO benefit on the state!!
If it were REALLY worked,  world wide clean water would be available to millions. Hope you get behind it
Israel has done it for years.

If you have someone who speaks Russian at your office to translate this, that would be great. Id love to bring this to the world.... PS almost everything has already been invented, it's up to the people to materialize it into existence.

Study more about desalination and go to Israel learn more about their technology, it's amazing!
False prophets

So .... This !!!! EXACTLY why Ye is with Trump all the way !!! Barry is such an ass hole for this ! @kanyewest keep doing what your doing. Expose it all!!! #GreatAwakening #MAGA #DragonEnergy https://twitter.com/shadesofslaylor/status/820458623503626241 …

Very power hungry and expensive process though making water management perhaps still the better alternative. Depending on where it's for - a very high use of fossil fuel, nuclear, electricity, thermal or wind is required.
Kanye, you’re such a brown nosing POS. One would say, you’re a Poopity scoop,. Scoop di-di whoop! Whoopty scoopty poop! Poopy scoopty scoopty whoop. Whoop di-di scoop, whoop poop! Poop di-di, scoop whoop? Poop! Poop! #FuckKanye
US Navy have these on their ships, I use to operate and service them, best water a person can drink, from very salty ocean water to clear cold water. California was to start these on the coast, what happened? Money
Have you even spent time with your newborn?
Buying your music Kanye supporting you. We are Conservatives here. Just do the right thing. Go Trump!
@sciarc lol

THE BEST KANYE #REVISTAQ

@AndyDaMags You see Ye yesterday?
Wanna play fortnite
When Kanye tweets nonsense BOOOM 20K likes 1k RTs but bcuz i tweet sense i get none.
Microscopic plastic particles end up in the salt due to pollution
My brother just graduated from there. Check out his thesis video:

Hmu reliable plug and quality loud gas gas
Maybe visit holocaust memorials too.  Some very important lessons there that you need to know about.
Huge money to be made with fresh water running out and population exploding.
desalination WATER CAN'T be used long for REGULAR HUMAN CONSUMPTION because it lacks OLIGO ELEMENTS contained in normal water NECESSARY for the HUMAN BODY, and this lack can cause severe illnesses to man
All those “oligo elements” can be added back in post-purification, plenty of current brands of bottled water have minerals added to them. Also if you’re relying on your drinking water to deliver trace elements, you’ve got one fucked up diet man

@BenLake99 why’s he using that emoji ffs

The United Arab Emirates leads the way in providing clean water from the sea.  The desert blooms and cities grow. The future of mankind depend on this technology!
Trumpzi Nuremberg Rally in Michigan 

Any Hispanics in the room?  
Trumpzi: Crowd Boos (at the mere mention of the word Hispanic)

tRump: Naw I didn't think so.
Trumpzis: cheers, applaud and whistle like animals.

tRump then says Kanye gets it?  Kanye do you get it ?

KANYE2020

When u tryna hit and she is tired 
Kanye is a god. Y'all haters are trash
Stop tweeting and see a doctor
I'm headed to Cambodia to start an Aquaponics and decentralized urban farming project
Research Singapore's use of desalinization. They implemented a three step plan for their water consumption needs and desalinization accounts for 25% of there water demand. One of the best in the world.
Kanye come to Israel. You'll be amazed
Are we done w periods and using space now
@BarackObama
George Bush doesn't care about black people

I went to school there! Our work is dope!! Welcome!
Dang I used to live across the street from there
okay i love you Ye but please never use that emoji again
Check out the desalination plants in Santa Barbara & I think another in Carlsbad or San Diego area.
You should get together with @SecretaryCarson  (HUD) and @POTUS @realDonaldTrump... come up with a plan to combat  Chicago crime/murders, drugs, gangs to help the helpless in the intercity...Detroit's intercity (families) too. Just saying.

You need to get out more. Desalination is ancient technology.
De-salt-ing water is an important part of survivability and #water #sustainabiliy, #Future, as we all know. Keyword #Domain Desalinizing•com for sale. 11 yrs old. PM #desalnization #waterpurity #salt #filters #domains #domainsforsale
You just learned about desalination?  Speed up dude.  Life is going to pass you by.

Desalination uses a TON of energy and the salt byproduct is extremely concentrated and actually bad to release into the ocean. If they could find a better way to deal with the brine then desalination makes more sense
Kanye will solve flints problems
Desalination will get even better in the future...been thinking about how to dramatically improve it for two years. Can be used a lot more if one key problem is solved.
Follow @PyrocynicalTV @kanyewest
@sciarc is beyond a spectator position. Break down and rebuild again
#KanyeWestIsOverParty
We need the same knowledge in Africa @kanyewest
Would be great if it were cost effective.
https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/news/ocean-desalination-no-solution-water-shortages … but I'm certainly no expert
Gotta check that out. I've been into that field a long time - and starved for it. New technologies are rising out of flu-over country as we write.
You honestly act as though you’ve never been outside it never read a book. Like bubble boy who has finally emerged from his bubble enclave. @Rosie @TomArnold @chelseahandler @SarahKSilverman
They should have taught that to you in school

what is you hobby?
$5 says you’ve already thought about how to extract gold from the salty waters of your little megalomaniac body
I said hi to you I was in the gray long sleeve :)
You are soooo presidential already!
Bar.
Wake me up when desalination becomes economically viable.

I can teach you about desalinization
But what would you do for the Soul Stone?

scoping out a GOOD Water deal?
Government waited too long to get desalinization in Cape Town!
Plz just stop!

You are clearly having a manic, delusional episode and need help. I pray your family cares enough to take care of you.
All in Disney and amazon.
You could also learn how to use punctuation;)

Kanye still isn't welcomed to Wakanda.
I've always wondered if one could construct houses out of artificial seashell by using vats filled with salt water fortified with calcium. Inside the vat you'd have a metal screen that you pass electricity through. The chemicals bond to the screen during electrolysis.
Outside of a few chemicals and metal screens there wouldn't be many building materials, also naturally water resistant. You could make everything curved so houses on coastlines can survive hurricane force winds.
Learn about Chan Thomas hypothesis on @CIA website. Global cataclysms. Los Angeles will be buried. New York will be buried. Everything gone.
Yes of course.

KANYE I LOVE YOU  you’re the greatest, out here spreading positive thoughts.
Desalination = the solution to this world’s water crisis

You...JUST... learned about desalination? Sad

Where’s the song you were gonna drop with Travis and uzi???
All yall “FREE THINKERS” I want yall to wear a bernie sanders shirt and keep that same energy. Being so”Free” and all.
You would think our governor Brown would have invested in desalination plants instead of the fantasy choo choo!!

Wow, Kanye! Your last dozen Tweets are the most wonderful, inspiring things I have read in a lotta years. You have your finger on the heartbeat of American. I just hope you are reaching many others as deeply as you are reaching me.
Spoiler alert. Kanye has no idea what desalination entails in the long term. Removing salt from ocean water isn’t a new concept you fool.
I like what I hear! @realDonaldTrump

Worked in Puerto Rico with a foundation that bought and gave it to some community’s that needed clean fresh water after the hurricane. Great stuff 
Would love to get your take on my nieces art—Crazy sci-fi graphics
We don’t need desalination we need the zero point energy
Kanye, Conservatives & Independents are your friends. You'll find freedom, acceptance, amazing diversity and kindness with these folks. They won't stab u in the back & they're not wing-nuts. Take care.
Hey I’m a big fan please reply I support trump too
Hey I’m a big fan

It’s the future. Replace oil platforms with wind powered desalinization plants!
Overheard at Sci-Arc: “Kanye West doesn’t care about black people” t-shirt is all the rage and sold out..
Desalination causes its own problems. Check out Mike Strizki.
