Rather than taking screenshots, can't you just download the photos from Dropbox and post on Twitter? I mean geez
Then how will you know he has an iPhone x

A look at all of the things Donald Trump has accomplished as president!

“Dear @KanyeWest make sure you @ me next time pus...” 
Is this the table where Aslan was slain?

Is this where the wyppol kept you and had you strapped watching some shit on TV?
You spoke your views. Some call you an uncle tom. I call you independent. You won't be brainwashed or fall for the media masses. That is why I respect you. #Standwithkanye
Is thus your closet ??? If so it’s badass !!!

are these photos are concept art? Getting mixed meanings out of them. Beautiful, balanced, but cold and empty.

Bro like for real send me my fucking shoes. Speak to who ever is in charge of the shipping and who ever is in charge of your costumer service because it’s terrible. No great company should have a shitty costumer service
@kanyewest Serious question. Do you really believe in @realDonaldTrump, or are you trying to reclassify your ethnicity thinking that white is where it's at? Do you believe that being black and wealthy is the same as being white and wealthy?
Dear Mr. West you have completely sold out! I will no longer support ANYTHING you do. Expect your next album to go double plastic Thomas!!
Now that’s a closet! Yes, please

I'm just here for the comments 

I never thought I would see another black person, let alone a rapper, that embraced minimalist design. To often, is loud and flashy styles the norm of show business; a form of compensation to distract from ones lack of talent. These photos... they do the opposite. Bravissimo!
My book is a good book to put on that table.
