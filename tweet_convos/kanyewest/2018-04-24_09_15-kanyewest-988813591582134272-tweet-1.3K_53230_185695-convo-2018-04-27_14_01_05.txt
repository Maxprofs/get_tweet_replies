I think I am a God too.
When I was younger I thought writing online posts in irregular caps creates different impact.

But what if you're a masters student?
The Student will always be greater
Aren't we all.
Yeah sure
#ReallyTho let’s talk about that un capitalized “n”. The conviction wasn’t there on this one. You typed something, deleted, and re-typed. 
Twisdom
Once a rapper, now a stupid.
Let me drop some wisdom on you Sir Kanye, The fear of the Lord (The I AM) is the beginning of Knowledge; but fools Despise Wisdom and Instruction. Proverbs 1:7. I love the book of Provebs, Made my son read it growing up!
Where do I send my resume to ..... keep in mind I’m a school teacher will that be a problem?
So whenever you come crashing down to earth, and you realize that you are not Special, nor Superior, and that all you have is simply thanks to your Geographic Luck you might be able to realize that as soon as you Feel Superior, you automatically become the Inferior.
I am Glad that yo are making so much money, and becoming so popular within your uneducated  citizens of planet Earth Followers.

TELL ME WHAT TO DO SO I CAN WORK FOR YOU!!!!
Cool, read this then.
It must be great to be a black conservative. You can label yourself an iconoclast when all you are is contrarian. You can say that you’re a “free thinker” when all you are is lonely. I wrote for @RollingStone about @kanyewest falling into the sunken place. https://rol.st/2Hpu6M3 
I really am an eternal student ..
25 years of my life to date, dedicated to studies
I think we all dont know anything about life, even those who have been through a lot and are 80 today, every day we learn new things, but all this to move on to a new phase of our lives, people are selfish because they think they know everything and refuse to learn new things
such as learning to accept people as they are, no matter the color, nationality, sexuality, the only thing that matters is the heart of that person
I am a master Kanye.
after all to be a great teacher, you must be a brilliant student! 
THEN WHO THE FUCK TEACHES US
Don’t study hard, learn hard 
But you're a master for me  because I'm learning alot from you 
No @LaurenJauregui keep him away from us, HE LIKES TRUMP
Yoooo
love you

I strongly dislike you!!!!! @kanyewest
This dark pit you find yourself in is rife with traps and pitfalls.
Don't scramble toward freedom, but concentrate on one small toehold at a time.
Never a student, always a master.
Your Massa apparently is Trump, given your kind words. Enjoy that sunken place. Signed, A former fan.
Always Teste
I say if you are the most successful person in the room... Then you're in the wrong room.... There is always more to learn and room to grow..
Never stop learning
Tell these niggas watch the throne they ain't hip
