Good for u I’m glad Nike did not pick this to be their slides
Hahaha Nike did that to the AF1. Check it out on their site. It’s terrifying.
Girl the audacity talking about Nike and you have a Nike sweater on
Lol hey. I love Nike. Just not their latest idea 
They are unique.
Of course they are lol.
Did trump take over your twitter ?
What
Dead not you him
 @Nike why couldn’t you just give the man what he wanted
Because they don't need him!
@Nike @nikestore @Jumpman23 
KANYE IS COMPARING HIS UGLY SHOES TO NIKE/JORDANS REALLY?
Haha
Yeezy is a collection of pricey torn clothes  you expect Nike, which is more for athletes to join you Wow. 
Trying to be President must be messin with your brain.
That’s why Mr OVO is coming over 
Still loving the adidas I got in Chicago. Amazing stitching design keeps me intact after so much abuse. Please release high top leather Yeezy’s. @kanyewest it’s so needed.
Lmao  didn't know John the Baptist wore Adidas
All right that burn was freaking lit. I’m giving that one to you
Lmao 
Maybe an Adidas boycott is in order
Well now we know who to blame. Fuck you, @adidas for letting Yeezy be Yeezy. Now see what you've done? Sometbody needs to be curtailing Yeezy from being Yeezy. He's just WAY too Yeezy.
Nike let Jordan do whatever he wants, I guess you are not at that level yet.  Sorry to tell you the truth, I am still your fan tho.
Did you see the Nike Yeezy’s?
He did the right thing going to Addidas.
Nope, but  you 
I sampled this tweet into a beat.
Whoever you are , you’re the !
Never will I buy anything of his brand.  Atleast Jordan got a backbone
They are the same parent company, fool!
Thanks for not partnering up with the #sweatshop company @Nike!
do you need a polymer and fiber engineer? I can get you my resume.
@idehne
That’s cause Nike is far superior
You’ve blown my mind the last few days. Got 100k to blow my bank account?
@Nike what is wrong with you
You actually think this dude sells more shoes than MJ?
Yet Nike took over in less than 4 months, adidas is a dying brand butttt
Lmao retros and off white isn't taking over.
Yet those retros and offwhite are the most talked about sneakers right now. Nike will continue to drop these retros and I’ll keep reselling them 
it's called hype and it's died down you can see people are tired of off white they ran them into the ground I though Nike did good with the Air 270 they need to build off of that.
Same problem with record lebels. They always have a way of changing your music from the original plan to what they think the public wants to hear
Own mad pairs of Ultra Boost and every other sneaker but have never despite my countless attempts been able to get a pair of Yeezy’s. I’m to the point I don’t even want to try no more .
Too pricey dude. Won't last

wtf is wrong with you n trump speaking of yourselves in thurd person optics you look sound like an idiot
Adidas<Jordan
@kirbey_leigh ooooooooooo
BADDD BOIIIIIIIIII
killllll em hahaha
Your right Kanye. Now talk them into letting u design the new udub unis #washingtonhuskies
pay ATTENTION to Logos. when a corp spends 1M to change it- red flag. this one too...related to Saturn/Square/number 3, Letter M... 3M, Home Depot (square), sculpture/NYC/downtown plaza off brdway/liberty st.
That’s what artists need, a free creative outlet

@c0nal
Love Adidas shoes  all I buy anymore
@Awaleed00 THE SHADE
Zzz zzz  Mad Burn @Nike
yeah your right they just couldn't do it
A dig on them!!!!
Honesty is key
James Harden supports this msg.
Nike is the move yall. Nike’s clothes are waaaaay better than Adidas’ just the feeling of the quality and stuff u know. And now with the nike epic react nothing can’t beat nike
So you mean buy Adidas, or....
Honey no. Nike all the way
No offense Nike for Athletes you fashion kid
BECAUSE NIKE IS BETTER
“Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away”
yeezy sucks!!!
Why bring Nike into ur shit.
Omg the shade
nike é ruim msm,vo ter que te dar razão
Go build a wall around @nike . you can ask @realDonaldTrump. For advise on how build it and finance it.
Probably going to make NIKE fund it like trump wants Mexico to fund the wall ridiculous hahah
Hahaha
In Chicago in 2 weeks 100% getting a pair or two
Full support of the brand!
Congrats
I love how everyone here thinks Kanye actually designed Yeezy, he litteraly just put his name on them lol
I actually already wear Addidas but this is intelligent propaganda
It shld take more to be president than just being a popular figure-- like, perhaps, an MBA. USA is a huge conglomerate that needs an experienced business person at its helm.
That's because Nike is bigger and better... It's like Neymar at PSG or at Barca... At PSG he does whatever the fuck he wants because they're shite
Nike makes absolutely horrible shoes man... every pair of shows I own other than hikers and shit are all Adidas. Very good footwear.
Attitude. Point blank. YEEZUS!
Tweet like Trump your boss. 
Absolutely
It’s why we buy only Nike in our house
The Cortez wtfyta

So you can't talk about something without putting something else down? First with Trump and Obama and now this? Your yeezy shit look like trash that's why it "could've never happened at Nike".
oh, didn't know...ok
Nike: Shot received, we promise to retaliate.
Kanye just admit it . You’re just mad at Nike cuz you can’t be Nike partners
@NickSmith_92 Nike would have ruined everything
This is shade I’m loving for
Has would be the proper tense.
Ok besides that you said you had a basketball shoe but what about some football cleats??!
That's because Addidas are the shit!
@nickrodriguezo7
Yea cuz nike wouldnt allow such a nasty looking thing to go on sale
Can you get Yeezy cleats for the Washington Huskies next year; that would be badass!
Because they wanted you to make good shoes instead?
No because they wanted to save money on the expensive mid and outsoles he wanted to design
@nike
people don't realize how quickly the #jordan #market is going down now that the resale market is dried up and shoes are sitting on shelves.  opposite for adidas obvi, well played sir

/ @kanyewest
Indonesian workers producing Adidas are subject to forced overtime, physical abuse & poverty wages
That was in 2000......

Let's check a dozen years later....
@kanyewest
Maybe you'd like to tell the 2 800 workers (owed $1.8M in wages) how well your overpriced shoes sell
@kanyewest
We get it! Now release more yeezys so everyone can buy them!
Thank God, I hate Adidas. Their designs are pathetic
Yeezy yeezy yeezy jumped over jump man
You right... Nike has standards!
Politics. Shout out to the people who ACTUALLY work in the fashion industry. Yeezy will be a short lived brand, we all know this.
It's been around for a lil while
Fashion is all politics, and he has the ability to have control unlike many other designers out there.
Tell Adidas  to increase production #s for all yeezy releases!
they have been, Yeezy acquisition is cheaper than ever
@remetentede762
I see you ain't @ @nikestore to let em know how you was goin at they head...
Either way, your shoes are made by exploited workers who are payed below the minimum wage and work excessive hours in an environment that fails to provide safe working conditions. But hey, you do you...
They have no choice but to let yeezy be yeezy, everything else they make is trash, you saved them, raf, AW, Pharrell, even Jeremy Scott saved adidas 
You have the best sweatshops in Asian to make your shoes.
@chlobits  it's over bro
I can't even remember the last time I bought a pair of #Adidas

However, I'm online about to buy another pair of #Nike 
Shoot, i wish i could get a pair of either or lol. Them jawns hard to get. Keep being great tho!
@jenriqueem 
oh shi
#Adidas ROCKS!!🖒
The universe is listening, shhh
Who the hell is Yeezy??
Yeah cause adidas needed it Nike didn't
sleezy's a BUM !!!!
burn @kieferREVINa
Then Adidas it is. My next shoe
revamp the red october’s with adidas
yeah bro but michael jordan kobe and lebron have nike sorry bro but top that oh nike don’t over charge people is that why you thought nike wasnt for you?
Cause Nike too smart but ok lmao
Sucks to admit cuz I love Nike but Kenya runs wherever he goes adidas on top
ALL DAY I DREAM ABOUT SHANKING YEEZY.
You’re making me regret my tattoo now 
Shudve regretted it the moment you got it
Yet you’re most famous/expensive shoes came from Nike, sorry they not gonna let you drop Walmart boots
@beth_gonzalezzz mark will be bare chuffed if he sees this 
Gotta say, I do love my Yeezy
You wish you could still wear a pair of air max 1’s or Jordan 1’s. Don’t front.
Cuz @nikestore is better... Adidas is whack!
So show the paper  work that proves u make more than Jordan... #fakenews #moneylies
He might not have to pay the same costs as Jordan so maybe he does make more in recent years
GAVE LEBRON A MILLY NOT TO RUN AWAY
@Nike vai deixar???
Cause Nike Don't want to be associated with ugly walmart looking shoes!!!
You can buy Nikes at Walmart
I think you're confused Nike with Fubu bruh.
Nah.
Nike has the best shoe tho
they ain’t no Jordans
Shittiest sneakers since the start..
direct !
Fuck Nike
Maybe you didn’t actually need nike . Your music is epic anyways
MARK PARKER
What about the Red October? 
Trump fan who prefers a European company to an American one 
The irony
Fuck @adidas bih it’s still swooshgang or die
Then Nike it is!
That's why your shoes are trash!
Savage!
cause you ain’t no athlete nigga get it straight thru yo head !
Nike obsession alert*
just keep losing followers
@nickshredscott
Adidas forever reyis haklısın
@kanyewest you’ve lost all credibility man, a tRUMPer, imagine that. Sycophant.
smh
@ChrilleElgaard
Hvor er det godt at det ikke var Nike
If nike/jb cared about the consumer the company would be even more successful. They rely heavily on the fading popularity of Michael Jordan and their also fading monopoly/ chokehold they have(soon to be had) on sneaker culture
Nike does not listen to consumers it is run by a tight nit clique
Nike Napoleon minded Ye.
Put them back on the Map in a serious Way
@Nike stays top anyway... swoosh all the way

Because Nike sells nice shoes not that shit you put out
What’s a Yeezy and is there a vaccine. Asking for a friend
Kanye, cut a deal with Jordan brand, I know that you know that you would make Jordan 1000000000x better you from the city
@franckyzy14
Lol. He even tweets like @realDonaldTrump
is trump ghostwriting your tweets now or did you two just fail the same PR course?
Omg I thought same thing! Literally sounds like his brother from another mother lol! To egoistic narcissistic beings 
they let Yeezy be Yeezy by giving you some dope ass silhouettes and some more creative freedom with colorways- 500's are yung-1's, 350's are tubulars, Calabasas are powerphases with gold print, the list goes on
This is a good thing though!
Probably the reason Drake has left nike is he wants to have the creative freedom that @adidas provides
Yeezy outta pocket today giving NO fucks.
@business_wars , I just remembered the  first episode of @Nike vs @adidasUS , where Kanye said this at a concert.
That's a diss to Eminem!
Don't play yourself Nike.
Nike Yeezys were the best ones you ever made.
I need to get my hands on a pair Kanye.. be a homie (translucent 10.5 men’s and while I have your attention a 7.5 in women’s would be great too)
Calla cuchi
Adidas is trash!!! 
NIKE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ADIDAS
What about at sketchers?
WE REVIEWED THE ADIDAS YEEZY POWERPHASE @shootyourshottv
Call for Rehab Kanye. Lol
Nike dont want no ugly ass shoes bro
Tell d rose ankles how great Adidas is

In the future “remember when ppl used to wear Nikes?”
Nike flip flops >>>>>> Yeezys
I worked at WHQ during Kanye’s design tenure. Sorry, NKE wasn’t a failing brand & didn’t want to relenquish all control to someone that didn’t respect the process. Being diff& a diva in a respected FW company doesn’t work. It’s called a Collab, not here’s your own brand..
And sure is STRANGE how much the Boost looked like the Roshe. Glad@you had inspo bro
I would’ve never been able to rock yeezys in this video !

BULLISH ON ADIDAS
But how come they let Virgil do his thing?
cos virgil only put a fucking zip tie on the shoes?
The let him do whatever he wanted to do with 10 silhouettes. And if you think all he did was add zip ties your crazy.
fr!!!
Calmes toi zin avec Nike
Let me be part of the design team!
I love nike better tho 
@MATTYBROWNE94 shade

We need the 1050s!!
But workers in sweatshops produce their products...

Explain.
you can say anything as long as you don't disrespect Nike
aah  this days you're talking too much
Too bad Nike’s net worth is more than double of Adidas
Europeans are better !!!
