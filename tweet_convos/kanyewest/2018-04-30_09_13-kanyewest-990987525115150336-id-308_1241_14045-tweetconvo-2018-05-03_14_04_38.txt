The general public can not afford your shoes.  They are great but out of reach for most of us
whoa I’m getting that

Kanyes' words about Trump and other things got me checking out hip hop  and rap. Now I really like them.
You’re late guy
What different does it make when you make a discovery? As long as you eventually discover one more thing to make life better.
That’s fair. You’re still late. Welcome to the amazing world that is hip hop. Enjoy it
Uh, those are shoes. Not love.

Kanye West made it clear he supports Donald Trump.

Kanye doesn't care about black people.

This might be Consequence? The two were friends for a long time before a falling out after Consequence signed with GOOD Music then left.
It's definitely Consequence. That beef was a long time ago and they have been friends again ever since
I was looking for updates but the most recent article I could find was 2013! Thanks!
They’ve been pictured together for the last several years. Definitely pre Pablo era

Kanye West called Emma Gonzalez his “hero.”
That’s sad..because he was actually starting to make sense for a minute. 
Why would Emma be his hero? She bullied a kid until he lost his mind, killed 17 people, & then blamed it all on the NRA.What part of that is heroic?
Your the black celebrity that they are using to try to divide the black vote , so come Nov election they will have a better chance #jackass
Yea we do Kanye yes we do
Kanye - can you please show me some love and send me some Yeezys?
Show him some money
Nah, I’m just showing him love
Can I get a pair size 10
English please.
For the Blacks-------that's criticizing Kanye West for having his own political views

You all really need to LEARN black history

Dr. King worked with Republican Richard Nixon

Muhammad Ali endorsed Ronald Reagan

Here's proof http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/8062044/1/ …
You are acting weird.... Go see a doctor.
Yo.....I need these
It’s the tribe called quest collab with vans, I wonder if we’re gonna sell out now
Look what they do to each other in Africa. Libyan Muslim gangs mutilate, sell and eat their own brothers. And the left has the gall to say we oppress black people in America? Makes me sick. OBAMA DID NOTHING TO HELP THESE PEOPLE. YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
I see you  I hear  #TELEPATHY

While President Trump meets with the Nigerian President at the White House, he should ask him to explain to America how Muslim Libyan gangs in Africa enslave their Nigerian brothers, harvest their organs and roast them like kebabs for dinner.
