the alt right not gonna love this
Stop playing sides. It's getting old.
He's independent, he agrees w/ both sides on different things
How can you like Emma and MAGA at the same time?
But, MAGA is pro-NRA
Once they take our guns, they can take our freedom.

Look like to head got stuck in a fence for 3 weeks

#FreePablo

.Emma wants black men disarmed while the police have a monopoly on violence.

Pro-black???
The racism doesn't help.
I sent you my poopy-di scoop answer me
gotchu
This is epic trolling, I am in awe
Britney Spears did it first
Is he trolling or cracking under pressure? It's too hard to tell.
Just because he supports Trump doesn’t mean he should be against protesting against school shootings  stupid Conservative
Their protest is not Against school shootings. There is no one that is For school shootings. Their protest is for banning guns.
Okay, either way, Mark didn’t have to come at Kanye for supporting Emma’s protest against guns/school shootings (whatever she is protested doesn’t matter in my argument). All I’m saying is that Kanye can be against the 2nd amenment and support Trump
I think it would be interesting to see Kanye sit down on a show like @RubinReport and actually have a conversation about his ideas and what he believes in. What is it about Trump that he likes? Or @RealCandaceO Or @EmmaGonzalezUSA.
Agreed. He’d probably start the Kanye Party haha


@realDonaldTrump lies again and brags that the size of his election night rally was 32,000 instead of 4,200... Lol! y'all eat that sh*t up like it's truth. Kanye ask Trump for the phone number Trump used to call @DonaldJTrumpJr before that meeting with the spy Veselnitskaya?

Unless it is earned, the power is given voluntarily and is based on pursuit of harmony, peace and prosperity. Ghandi would have been a problem for you?
I’m just making fun of Kirk for being a dumbass dude
How did you make fun of him exactly?
uhh because he said the line wrong lol
if he's gonna quote him maybe he shouldn't butcher the line like an old man out of touch with the youth
I love how y'all are triggered over a snapchat
Kanye is this what your album is going to look like????
Or is it gonna be like this???

cadbury egg ily

Oliver North: "ISIS would
not #exist except for the
#Obama administration's
failures & bad decisions" 
Just fuck my shieet up
She inspires me to raise my children and not rely on the state to institute it's values in place of mine or our constitutions. I do appreciate her passion.
She’s being used by a political machine, but it seems like she really does want what’s best, she’s just completely lost regarding what truly is best. If she’s open-minded, she’ll figure it out eventually.
You still support a racist, dude
I think Kanye was replaced with whatever Zucc is
Y’all look identical
Is that your #CaBaldLook 
If you’re in a dark place, I’m here for you
Kanye please bring back the bear for the album cover. 
No, the surgeon that did surgery for his mom is the album cover
Everything that kanye's been doing makes me feel that this wont be a good album... then again, it may just be kanye being kanye
how? its just to generate publicity for the album like when he said bill cosby innocent right before tlop. the album wont be bad
I personally didn't like tlop. But yeah, I do see your point. Im willing to give it a listen lmao
@emmarosespags
Who blinks first?
You beat me!
I am engorged with venom and victory


dont act like that wasnt cringey u know that was cringey venom headass

The conservatives after following you cause the MAGA post

Poop, Did Dee, Scoop, Woop
why is this nigga kanye just naturally funny 
I must say, you look much better with a shaved head than a chick does on their best day.
inspired by when I got mumps**
Ur welcome
Any MAGA people lashing out just because Kanye is inspired by a teenager who stands up for what she believes in (regardless of what you believe) is not in support of free thinking or higher consciousness.
I haven’t really seen it much (but that’s just me); the most I’ve seen are “agree to disagree” type of statements
His previous tweet had a bunch, which is the one I probably should've replied to, but it's the same person he's referring to, so... 
I see. Personally, even I if I don’t agree w/ it, the important thing is that Kanye is thinking for himself & not allowing others to control his thoughts. I’m not too surprised if Kanye has some views on some things that some conservatives will not agree w/
We can also learn a lot from those we disagree with. At the very least we will have better understandings of each other, even if we still strongly disagree.
That's true. Perfection is a myth, and it's impossible to find someone that you agree with on everything. The quicker that is understood, the easier it is to accept differences in opinion.
Emma savagely shades Kanye Trump!
Savagely?  She was inspired to name her own hero.  #clickbait is well and alive and it loves @kanyewest
LMAOOOO conservatives now after following you and praising you:
Alt right when they see Kanye praising Trump then praising Emma a day later
I saw this and instantly thought “whoopity scoop”


You funny as hell dude
@HardwickKelsey
alright
I'm still trying to figure out why ppl are calling Kanye a Republican. He already said he isn't republican or democratic. He values things on both side. He's an independent.
@emmaleestaples3
Kanye and i have gotten extremely close lately so you aren’t wrong 

You ugly bruh, like your shoes . 

It's true marra 
Where yo ears go?
Can’t hear the haters if you have no ears
Trufe
Bruh where yo ear at?
@emmarose_33
He looks like a poorly rendered GTA San Andreas Character.

God bless you Kanye:) Bless Mr. Kanye and his family. Bless TRUMP & Team TRUMP and the Marine's and military and all of their families. Bless all the victims of unspeakable horrors

We the people are with you till the end.

Why Are you inspired by a girl who is trying to take our second amendment away she believes and taking away our guns she wants us to be like England or Australia or Germany during the second world war where they had no guns and that’s why the Jews
were all killed They had no way to fight back          Kanye We need our First Amendment we need our Second Amendment and the rest of them they are there for a purpose the founders of this country would not have put them in the Bill of Rights if we were not supposed to have them
