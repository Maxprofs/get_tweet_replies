¿Es instrumental o ahora rapeas balbuceos, carnal?
Te doy tiempo para que entiendas lo que hizo aquí
Explique por favor, ya comienzo a ruquear.
Este tipo “Ebro” ha estado hablando mucho de kanye en HOT 97 y pues a kanye no se le ocurrió mejor idea que regalarle una canción digna de él y sus conclusiones 
Resumidamente es una broma
Independientemente de eso me acabo de dar cuenta que sacó esto 
No planeo rapear versos que incluyen a Trump
Me siento igual, ya perdimos por completo al kanye de “Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all”
Idk these beat is fire and I'm just crackingup after a minute or two the mumble that came out and we fell for it lmfao
That’s the point I think he saying new “mumble” rap is being saved by the beats
It's true. Well he's definitely good at getting ppls attention for the new album lol
I think #Kanye is just Clowning us watch.  He's gonna have everyone buggin out and laughing over #LiftYourself then the day his new LP drops he's going to hit us with the real single. He knows how to keep People talking about him + People are still talking about him and Trump 
He is trolling Ebro, he said he is gon drop it for him lol (check his earloer tweets)
Who exactly is Ebro?
radio host i think @oldmanebro
@kareemslick probably the question that everyone is asking: WHOTF is Ebro? 
We dont even know that guy .
#WhoIsEbro 
Me rn
Lmao!!! But don’t act like the average rapper ain’t spitting out the same lyrical poopity scoop all day . At least the beat was fire  
Every conservative who jumped on the @kanyewest train and called him a genius.  #LiftYourself

When Ye said “Wooptidi woop”
OH NO KANYE WHAT ARE YOU DOING
Scoop dat poop
I’m not sure how to feel about this
It's fuckin hilarious
Hell yea it is
Lift_Yourself.FLP
A severe lack of SCOOPITY POOP
Jolly good show Mr West. Majorie and I will be singing this one as we follow our beagle across the lawn, ready to retrieve and dispose of his morning motions.
Although it must be said that your political allegiances seem rather off kilter, or as my grandson Perry would say ‘Whack’.
Niggas on genius trying to annotate this
I’m crying because someone sat there and mastered this
how i felt listening to this
I got the uncensored verse
Everyone: Yo I hate Kanye, I’m not going to listen to his music anymore.

Kanye: *drops a “song”*

Everyone:
This proves that with enough blind devotion, fans can distort reality to find meaning in anything. What a dangerous time to be alive
When Kanye said, 

“Scoopidy whoop, doopidy scoop whoop.” 

  ...I felt that
Daaaaamnn!!
Kanye was inspired by Big Shaq 
scoop deedee poop remix

imaging re-tweeting your own tweet
This is what my final projects for class look like when I do them last minute too.





@MichaelDapaah literally the second verse is just inspired by mans not hot ffs 
Oh I see!
Bro this shit had me dying laughing 

I knew it sounded familiar 
Kanye U R going 2 have dog  owners rockin’ this on them walks. Poop  a scoop anthem. 
Amanda, you gotta listen to this. He’s such an idiot LMFAO straight bars 
You didn’t even tag me, I husgotta randomly saw this on my TL lol but okay
Just randomly* wtf lmao
?*
me: i only cry at deep emotional lyrics

kanye: poopy di scoop woop diddy scoop poop

me:
@cathal_m_c poopity
scoop poop
put the fucking phone away for 5 minutes and spend some time with your kids ffs
Next Level bruh
That new 2Pac flow
damn bro this sucks
bring icarly to brazil
Lift Yourself decoded: is for everyone that wants to write Kanye off. Ye saying here go take this and make your case and stop pretending you actually care about him while simultaneously hating on him. Ebro and company
wack
When the verse kicked in
#Covfefe 17' = #PoopidyScoop 18'
@scott_crops @liamfarrell99 @Ledricks_ @bradley_cronin listen to his verse on this shit 
What have I just heard 
you CLOWN you did us dirty 
Please use the beat tho
Things change after you have kids including your material for creativity. Moms everywhere will be blastin this and feeling power as they reflect on the last Poopity Scoop Mess their toddler made.
Bruh we could have sponsored this song 
Am I the only one think Yeezy was trolling??Kanye on the phone with Donald rn like
Laugh of the morning

Lol  this is either the SMARTEST, FUNNIEST OR DUMBEST SONG IVE EVER HEARD LOL ALL THE DAY CARE SPOTS GONNA BE BUMPING THIS WHOPITY SCOOP POOPOOPITY POOP LOL


As a fellow parent—I can settle this right now. The bars are just random words that make his kids laugh. The happiness in his house lifts him. Solved. Right @kanyewest?
Funniest moment of my month (year?) but seriously the beat is fantastic
did Saint write that firE verse ?!?
I think it’s straight torch
15 years of being a fan and that ends now.
I feel like he was trolling because he said he had bars for ebro lmao
Bro this nigga
lmao i can tell his trolling because of you listen to ye vs the people he defending himself for being crazy 
He’s a trump supporter and really tried to shit on Obama. I think this the kind of music I’m expecting to hear now. Bro has really lost it
I think this song is a balance of him supporting what he likes about trump while acknowledging everybody else’s thoughts. I think he’s still mad at Obama’s for calling him an asshole lmao.
Lol that’s what you got outta poppity scoop?
lmao no i was talking about ye vs the people. the poopity scoop shit just make me more excited for all these albums he’s producing  the verse is trolling
@Edlose16 please luister dit helemaal 
Bruhhhh
Lyrical genius
Hopelijk nieuwe album zo
I can’t handle that 
@Michael_oo03
Bars 
Lmaoooooo you wildin
I #TWEETED YOU AND #DICAPRIO BOTH BEFORE #ELECTION ASKING FOR HELP.

Kanye just trolled everyone with his new song lift yourself! Lol The man is a real genius!
That moment when Mr. Krabs requests Kanye.
Ye vs the people really spoke the realest bars I’ve heard yet. You just earned my respect Kanye. You are a true leader of progression.
How can I download your new scoopity poopity song?
Didn’t like your music until after hearing this

Be humble
@Kon_Uh omg... thoughts?
Most lyrical song yet!!
so deep man
Looolll
When Kanye said “Poopy-di scoop, scoop-diddy-whoop. Whoop-di-scoop-di-poop. Poop-di-scoopty. Poop. Poop....”

I felt that
WOOP DEE DEE SCOOP POOP!!!?????!?!?!!
Couldnt agree more Mr. Yeezy. @Buick
Found a good pic of you and @realDonaldTrump
I hate you
I want that 2 minutes of my life back

I can’t with him...this is ridiculous!!
Me and Vic was so gassed about this we’ve been pure mugged off
Poopidy scoop
Started dancing to the beat then he comes out like poopidy scoop

Scoop de di poop
Will you cop on seriously
What the fuck are you playing at?
Dude I just heard your new album. SCOOPIDEEPOOP?!?!??!? REALLY

You ight bro
   ity scoop!! Really? Wtf 
Kim: put out the song I wrote
Ye: which one
Kim: the one about our lives since we had kids
Ye: “WHOOP DE SCOOP DE POOP”
~When you rap on the toilet~

I don't know if Kanye ready for crypto scene memes yet.
"life in the fast lane" is different then life on the blockchain!
@chandansandhu55 u need to listen to the whole thing he literally says “whoop de scoop de poop” 
I LITERALLY JUST DID AND I STARTED LAUGHING OUT SO LOUD   I couldn’t even SO THIS IS WHAT RAP HAS STOOPED DOWN TO talking about number 2
HAHAHAHAHAH same here man i couldnt stop laughing either  and mhm these rappers r running out of things to talk bout 


Kanye has more Grammys than all these rappers, so he can drop bs like this and it doesn’t matter. He lost his mother for to the rap game, what left he has to prove 
@ivanna_avila para que escuches musica de verdad
Follow me back maldito
Different...
Ive never been so confused in my whole life
pooptie scoop
Whoopdidity scoop poop 
@prayforpotato96 @AWanderingGhost @milkxkookies083 please listen at the end when the poop stuff starts it’s wild
Lol thanks for the recommendation 
Woopty scoopty ! @MinouClark why is this song so #onbrand 4u
Omg I’ve been jamming to it since it dropped!!!!
@WombatWib bro this is almost exactly what we have been talking about wanting to hear from a popular artist. Just an artist saying nonsense
Finally!

@Joshua_Hillier
“Lift Yourself” is Kanye’s version of Rickrolling. Once again, the Internet wins. More specifically, http://kanyewest.com  

Do the knowledge, people! 
They slow. 
thank you for showing me that song @_P_Roy i cried multiple times. what a great message.
Song of our generation
Ok, now I'm convinced you've been fucking with everybody
You mean interplay with the #MoronInChief may be a shameless ploy to gain attention for his upcoming album?  #shocked
@anthonyeaster96
He’s hates black people believe what you want
Im going to Woopdidty scoop your ass so we could chill @QueeeennBee

@chanel_1225 i’m just out of words
@thekatejenkins please tell me you have listened to this
I have no idea what to think.
You ever see the movie get out? That.
Wtf is this
A man in camo revs his engine on his ford pick up as he spits dip out his window and onto his own truck... reminds me of home 

Addicting, awesome beats, AND FUNNY AS SHIT!!!! You can’t NOT laugh when you listen to this. Laughter in life is IMPORTANT.

WICK WICK WACK
Ok this is the biggest troll...

YEEEERRRROOOO

GTFO WITH THIS .. wot de fook m8
I Wanna Hold Ur Tiny Hands Trump..kanyewest.comedy
This made my day! Thank you Kanye!
Delete this
Why u gotta be such a bumass tho



@Anna_Gentile13 something ain’t right bruh

i swear mf gonna think this shit a banger . watch
@TitoLFC @LeviHuser @StellarSkelly  fucking 
Bro you dropped the ball 
@briangetslowe @bengen70 @VivaDubs @RobertONeal44 @LactoseRunny
When @kanyewest said “Poopy-di scoop Scoop-diddy-whoop Whoop-di-scoop-di-poop Poop-di-scoopty
Scoopty-whoop Whoopity-scoop, whoop-poop! Poop-diddy, whoop-scoop Poop, poop Scoop-diddy-whoop Whoop-diddy-scoop Whoop-diddy-scoop, poop”, I felt that.
How am I supposed to “lift myself” with this

Wtf is this
@EGoldlink this fools swagger jacking your steez! (You gotta listen to the whole thing vats)
Damn I didn’t realize he was talking about my ideas when he admitted to stealing peoples ideas and not giving them credit. Wild.

let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.
I miss the old Kanye
Rumour has it he preferred the old Matt
Used to be my motto
@alexleddick97 The first part of the day that I get on Twitter and this is what happens
Dead
Other than Kanye naturally saying “Lift Yourself with me” he has a song file on that link. Have you heard that song file that plays when you click the link??
@nys4_ listen to this and tell me what tf happened to Ye
Haha I heard, he's a free thinker
i mean to each his own, or in his terms "Skippity-boop" 
@ahennessy123 You hear this? The man’s a genius!! 
I waited 3 minutes for that verse like 
Hahaha funniest thing ever boy! “SCOOPIDY POOP”
Sounds like @kanyewest took inspiration from @MichaelDapaah's Mans Not Hot.
Honestly im in tears  #londonting
@DaddyBus00 FIREEEE ASSSS BEATT
That’s Kanye West alright
Also he dropped another song on Apple Music
BETTTTT
*How Lift Yourself was written*                  Kim: Ok Saint stay still so I can change your diaper and Whoopidee scoop that poop.                                                 Kanye: Genius
Genius
@MrAlbertC23
https://youtu.be/5y1cMCur1vc 
Come on @kanyewest boost your gains
This song inspired me to lift my body up and go scoop my dogs poop
Genius! @kanyewest Kanye just protested hip hop music today. Beats aren't real music, connecting with your audience is.
@stuartbrown164
Whatever the odds were at, that in my life I would look up “Kanye West Whoop Scoop Poop” on google, just cashed.
Can you drop this song with a real verse coz it’s hard af, or just leave the scoopdy poop that’s also goof
Needa drop on Apple Music so i can bump to it w/o having to keep going on Twitter!!
Bars written by Saint West #liftyourself
EXACTLY @KANYE WEST
Thanks @Tip

This description of free thought still makes no sense . Most people widely acknowledge the multiplicity of identity. You’ve still chosen to align yourself in essence with an individual who has certain political beliefs - this isn’t free. It’s just an unlikely alliance. 
Free @KodakBlack1k
I'm crying now
@haymackerwin @__cassandraaaa
This is fucking gold
@nellyx21
Please drop this on streaming platforms
Can’t wait to see the people talking shit on you blast your music and act like they were supporters.
He lost all his ghosts writers so he got @realDonaldTrump to write this for him @LavarTheBaller
How you bout to steal my flow bih?
I CANT BREATHE @LavarTheBaller
THIS NEXT VERSE THOUGH, IS BARS:
@Wxll_
My almost 12 month old endorses the track. #winner #theyarethefuture #weloveyouKanye #thankyoudawg #oklahomafam
As a true fan of not only your music but your artistry as a whole I am extremely disappointed and will no longer let your antics derail me, my thoughts, nor my perception. Enjoy your life but brace when that wave hit the shore.
Kill yourself
What the fuck?
dad what is this
@ChloeShev
Scoop poop
Kanye.. come on man.
I already scoopideepoop from my cat’s litter box, but thanks for the reminder 

I love seeing the happiness in Kanye eyes 
Everything Trump influences turns to poop.

Can’t lie this shit had me like
it's so dope!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please release this song on spotify and apple music
