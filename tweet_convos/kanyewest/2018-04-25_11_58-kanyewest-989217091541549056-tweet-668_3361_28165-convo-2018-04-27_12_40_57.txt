Why don't you try emailing him? Make sure you use your gmail!
If that wasn't clear enough @kanyewest stopping making our eyes bleed with the tweets 
If you don't want to see his tweets why follow him?

What's happening with Kanye West? Is he suffering from depression?
I think Kanye is having some sort of breakdown b/c keeps tweeting something nonsensical every 5 mins or so...it's disturbing 2 me.
Shit now he's going to gain more weight

Where did I attack him?? I think you need to consult your dictionary!

Just call him and ask if you can ‘pick his brains’ over a Dunkin Doe Doe.

He ain’t got the answers
Love going straight to the source.  Violence in Chicago being addressed is a powerful topic
You're SPOT ON @Plaid_Page & his @Google w/ @Apple/@Shazam & 12 more relevant but DESTITUTE #music & lyric ID services KEEP #musicbiz in the open for grabs by freeloaders!

I hope that none of these people take your meetings. It’s time for you to be relegated to the dustbin of history. Another sad story of a disturbed genius and wasted talent.
No you don't. You need to get yourself together. #killyourheroes
I don't have a problem with you loving Trump.  I do have a trouble with you supporting music execs that promote the n-word & killing Black people.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdrLF7gOgiM …
@lyorcohen won't promote 1 song about degrading or killing Jews,
but it's open season on Black people.Why?
You should meet with Apu from the Quick-E-Mart

What you need to do is create something new. Gather some talent and create something that is not engulfed with liberal ideology & hate. create a neutral platform.
Ask @Joe_Gatto, he may be able to point you in the right direction. Or maybe not.
