Skip to the comments lol
Lmfaoo that girl looks nothing like kylie first of all 

i was gonna say his birthday is the 30th not the 29th but i forgot kanye is in the future already
astro
Yoour brother.
When john kerry did it "he was a flip flopper that couldnt make up his mind"

Trump does it and his defenders call it "growth"
Yeah when one is years apart that tends to happen
One of John Kerry's flip flops was war in iraq... in 1991 he was against war in iraq in 2002 he voted for war in iraq this was used in an ad and called him flip flopping on issues.  That was a decade apart.

Try again.
Okay and? So you're saying you're a hypocrite then because they're going to use the exact same tactic that you apparently don't like? Was it Donald Trump that gave John Kerry shit or was it just standard Republicans, the same ones who hate Trump?
I cant see anything hes done well.  The tax plan is good for me but bad for the country... id love to hear what you think he did good.

Trump brought in some new voters i think 20% of his voters were new.  But 80% were people who vote gop in every previous election.
Sure. The tax plan, it's not bad for the country it's only bad if we go below 2.5% gdp and if we never reduce spending. Neil Gorsuch. Peace with NK. The thousands of deregulations. The wall. Removing Obamas executive orders. Enforcing immigration law. Destroying ISIS, etc
We'll never reduce spending the military budget alone guarantees that, we've been at peace with NK.  I dont see his moves as making the korea situation better.  The daca order i disagree with as you know libertarians are for open borders.

False prophets
@lulekphilip this scares the shit out of me

Kanye would you like to feature on my LP coming  this year when the most high God in his time

you can’t bring a baby on a rollercoaster, kanye
Says who, Josh? That baby might be insanely tall for their age.
This is all analogy! Travis is in a roller coaster now with baby and the girl. He is playing your minds again. You are all asleep
Were you guys the ones who found Inception deep and meaingful?
@OrdinaryTrav Kanye remembered your birthday. Well, he was a few months off but its the thought that counts. I also have no idea who these clay people are or why they're on a rollercoaster. Is that your kid??
I’m honestly praying for you lmao
Like “hold on tight. Bumpy ride ahead”

KEEP ASCENDING
Those doll thingys look weird asf.
That suppose to be a fish on Travis’s Head?
Maybe his chain flying back???
I think he was actually talking about the... "Hair"
The little silver thing behind his head? That's his chain
The guy even says "-on Travis' Head?" Not behind is head you actually can't see that wow
Miswording maybe? He's probably talking about the silver thing
Maybe, I'm just going off of what he said
