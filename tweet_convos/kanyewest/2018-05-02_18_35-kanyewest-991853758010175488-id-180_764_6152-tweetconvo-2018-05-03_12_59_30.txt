Kanye what's goin on there big guy?

I'm not saying Kanye West is involved at all in the #TrumpRussia scandal.

But I AM saying he has Russian ties, and was there right after the 2016 election. https://www.vogue.com/article/kanye-west-gosha-rubchinskiy-moscow-russia ‚Ä¶
He‚Äôs a Russian troll bot now like the rest of us
Yep.
The Democrats' latest Russian agent? @KanyeWest.

I can‚Äôt even afford to watch this video
This is Amina Blue, who Kanye has called his muse.  

5 things about here: http://www.entitymag.com/amina-blue-kanye-west/ ‚Ä¶
Ye has so much clout that when he got fat, rather than dieting or exercising, he convinced the whole fashion world that massive, oversized, flubber-hiding sweatsuits your recently divorced uncle crashed dinners in circa '96, were now chic. That's power man.




Read truth Ye!!!! Thank you!!! @kanyewest

yo @REALMusicFAM @LilMissTNM @TFBTWEETDJ @ThatLadyRayne @LadyRayneInvest oh screw it The Whole #MusicFAM Make sure you guys make a meme for Ed if he comes down the a timeline ;)
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye Called "I miss The Old Kanye? Man, that'd be so Kanye 
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye.
People claiming Kanye said Slavery was a choice
Only prove everything he said was right

they operating on EMOTION - not truth or reality

Thats not what he said- if they listened they would know
but they all emotion no thought
Kanye has said that he wants people to choose with their feelings, to get out of their heads ... so emotions are cool in his reality.

All this ugly expensive clothes, tell me how your changing the world again?
I hope the album is finished

not all heroes wear capes.

Wasn‚Äôt it called ‚ÄúWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?‚Äù
Yes, Michael, this speech is also known by that title. You are a student of history‚Ä¶
I'm sure it's probably been the same for you, but every dressing room I've ever been in when I was on stage, was coed and weird...
Mostly acting...I was in a few bands when I was younger...Funny thing, I truly feel the Lord protected me from the real pit of vipers.

Every time I tried to go further, something would stop me from going further.

I was offered a theater scholarship to ASU, 2 events stopped me.
Ready and willing to do whatever he has planned.üïÜ

I just saw this video testimony of @JimmyCaviezel , Powerful is an understatement.

Why man
attention
That badu 
Ah good, Kanye got one of the ban shee fairies on fillum at last. Now we have the proof!

‚ÄúWake up Mr West...!!!‚Äù <cue drums> 
Up your meds
What are we looking at here? What's left of your fan base?

Daz put a Crip hit out on you Kanye because of your Donald Trump comments
Kanye is a good person just like his ancestors who were enslaved. He is being used by the conservatives to be manipulated and enslaved and betrayed again just like at the start of this country.

Pretentiousness
hi just throwing this out but I'm 6'0 34-25-37

I don't get what that video is about.  Like at all.
At this point I believe he's particularly retarded, no other explanation.
Sure that's fair.  I was legit confused and super uncomfortable.  It was like watching a horror movie or when people mix all the flavors at soda machines.

Love these behind the scenes clips!  Shows how much hard work behind the camera it takes to create images that show your product beautifully in front of it.
Sweet... Derelicte!  It's such a good look.
You have it right!! You got the courage to step forward. Behind you 100 percent!!
Looks like clothing for homeless people
I HATE KANYE AND THE KARDASHIANS ANYWAY SO THIS IS EASY...
BOYCOTT ADIDAS.
BOYCOTT KANYE.
BOYCOTT KARDASHIANS.
THEY SUCK...

Ppl say THEY believe in God but do they, @HarveyLevinTMZ said the brain is more powerful than the heart Guess what, God controls our heart and our heart is love and Harvey doesnt love everyone but he is gay and he know hes breaking Gods rule
@RealCandaceO have to realize, ppl are Programmed to love negativity  the fake news, tmz, wendy, facebook etc. Im not sure how to change that. Too much good news will lose ppl attention.
