Kanye is so great! Such a genius! Our generation's Disney and Jobs!!
Rich kid Perez talking down to a self made man.
Actually not rich kid, bankruptcy kid.... 
My bad, thought he was a real Hilton. Well he’s never gonna get outta debt stalking Kanye.
Nope.  Took the name to get attention, he did years ago, kinda washed up now.  Trying hard, that’s why he’s on Kanye’s tweets so hard.
MAGA
I love Kanye
You wish you had a women like that.
Of course i do
Okay so we’re posting our Dms. Here’s one of my most meaningless.
Are you ok?
Hell no, this lady is bat-shit crazy.
Looking forward to the conversation. But realizing I should have followed @johnlegend ‘s lead and mentioned my book “Tears We Cannot Stop” 
Just please don't give the ignorance of kanye more of a platform that it clearly doesn't deserve. We can't all be out to sell books and records. We gotta be better than this...

Kanye and Ray J should do a track together called “It’s all Good in the Big Booty Hood”
Don't let this distract you from the fact that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
@Aspec526 @gfish15 @j13fox  "LOVE"
Would like to see @kanyewest  listen to Thomas Sowell & Walter Williams

Nigga. We know what's going on, we're not stupid. The fact of the matter is, you're aligning yourself with the devil.

What is wrong with Ebro? How could he be so disrespectful to Candace? Why are he and Rosenberg spokesmen for the black experience when they aren't even black?

Omara is a beast, very entertaing to watch as he shredded the DA
Ok great

Remember. The best way to make a point to a wealthy person. No matter how wealthy or powerful they are: their money. #boycott
This guy is sick,all this is stemming from that car accident.
Here comes the smear job.
GOT ANY MORE INTELLIGENT DIALOGS @ TODAY? 
Its good they document your craze  which  is confused for freedom of thought

I would like you on the @FTESWL breh. How can I get in touch with Elana Radin?
Why is he posting all of he’s DM’s, at least post a song or album cover to go with them. 
Have a terrific day buddy you deserve it

The quintessential “resting racist-face.” Frances Fox Piven (Columbia  University socialist) looking at Thomas Sowell, after Sowell insisted  black people do not have a welfare-state mentality. Watch the video,  it’s great. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QxO49Ycx0 …

I think we have an interesting investment opportunity for you. Will you give us any kind of contact on you?
And the doors are opened! Go Kanye! God bless you.  Tell Kim not to worry about you. You have truth on your side!
Record it yourself, the grass is full of gentile snakes
Who cares what you think is going on. You're obviously high

My friend, I really do think Christ is tugging you and moving you into the direction he wants you to go. If you do not know Jesus Christ as yet, seek Him out and you will surely find Him
No
Ok great
"Kanye West is a very creative young man...But we also think that sometimes West talks out of turn and perhaps he needs some assistance in helping him to formulate some of his thoughts."
--@RepMaxineWaters
Yall love crazy I see.
"your evolution" what evolution are you looking at. Who is drinking the funny coolaid?
Set conditions. You know the media... They'll remix the hell out of your words - you won't recognize the interview by the time they're done with it.

Ok great

Ok!
@MichaelEDyson @kanyewest real recognize real.  Thank you for taking the time to hear the brother Kanye further.
Let's hang and share a thought....
Assume this is @MichaelEDyson
Looking forward to that
You are a terrible texter
can you help me out bro ?

Can I have you cell number so that I can text you and star on your conversation hall of fame? I need guidance:) You can just dm me the number, thanks. Love


When are you meeting with @RealCandace maybe @cvpayne or @REALStaceyDash ?
"Ok great"
#BoycottKanye Won’t be reading or watching.
Reach out to Walter E. Williams. The man is BRILLIANT!!!
I’m loving KANYE
ok great
what do u think imagery of YOUR brain looks like when YOU hear/read the word YOU? I'M betting it lights up like a Christmas tree
ok great
Ok great
Watch out Kanye.  You have now become a target.  Record any interview and document it so you have an actual record, and they can't misquote you or take things out of context.

You are about to find out what it is like to be on the outside.
Michael Eric Dyson trying to get paid off crazy Kanye too? No shame anywhere these days
Lennon
@MichaelEDyson is that you? 
Andas bien doricrazy mano
@johnlegend @cthagod @realDonaldTrump
"evolution" is a funny way to spell catastrophic failure
I need a 3 hour documentary
Honestly @KimKardashian you need to get this guy into an adult daycare kind of set up. He needs a nap and cookie.
I began following #CandaceOwens over a year ago after the blatant theft of the nomination from Sen. Sanders. during the primary.  Not a conservative, but sure as hell will never vote Democrat again.  You do you #Kanye! There are more of us than the left thinks! #FreeThinkers 
Ok great
I would be so honored if you would tweet my text message Kanye life would not be the same without you :)peoples love u because you are REAL human 
Don't know what reporter is wanting to do a cover story but if they are part of mainstream media then I have this advice:

WATCH OUT FOR THE SPIN CYCLE, KANYE!
We share the same birthday #june8
@KanyePodcast I’m guessing this is the author Michael Eric Dyson. professor of Sociology at Georgetown University.
Thats cool, Follow @PyrocynicalTV
