Kim need to take your Twitter away again

If that’s the case you are going to have a very difficult time with reality. Good luck with that.
Read a book. Go to a museum. Big world out there son.
Pretty sure I was talking to that guy. Must be on his way to the library.
As far as I know Eugene Kim is the CEO of Yeezy.
Warton. is that were trump went to school?
“Went to school.” But yes.
Yet u didn't correct the "were" that should be "where" 
The grammar wasn’t important to me. Just that Trump didn’t really go to Wharton.
What TF are you doing wrong with your life that you need lawyers on hand full time?
Im sure he has most of his money coming in through a corp, he makes millions per year, hes a business, adding yeezy(clothing) as another biz on top of that, some businesses like to have in house legal. Nothing strange about it.
But he made it sound like the lawyers would double as an entourage. Lol. Like, he'd need them beside him at the mall, or wherever he goes to tell people how cool he is.
No he didn’t 


I’m just gonna shoot my shot. Hire me. I specialized in entertainment law. I will not only work for Yeezy full time, I will sleep at the office and be available 24/7 especially for every 3 am conference call.
I mean...it’s ultimately inevitable. I will be working with you. Whether it’s in the future or now. I’d rather us cut out the middle man and get to it.
Can I manage your family office for you?
When the office opens each day, the surround sound will quietly fade in “Good Morning.”
