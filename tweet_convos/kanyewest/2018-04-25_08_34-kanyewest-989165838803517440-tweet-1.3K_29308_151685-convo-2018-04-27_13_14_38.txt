@TheRealAlexGrow me and Kanye

Guey, ya callate. Buy a journal or something
Kanye shut up
Censorship
Shut up!
What’s wrong with diversity of ideas?
Nothing
Then there is no need for you to try to keep me quite, essentially censoring me as well.
Yea....but still, shut up
Why though?
We’ve established that it would be unnecessary, yet you still insist.
Ok looks like im doing it too
I’ve always done that..
I keep my emojis on the Apu and Carl skin tone 
You mean LEGO minifig color.
Bart predicts the future though, y’all. This is deep even for Kanye.  @mikedeestro  knows.

booooo
this is something me and ye can agree on lmao
I use the darkest emojis  even though I ain't dark skinned, I do it for the culture
as far as i’m concerned this is a direct reply to my earlier comment and you just forgot to @ me

Emojis now are changed to Bart Simpson color
Smart man
imma keep it real with you chief ...
Mine all black as fuck
Ok

Oops, my clapping hands weren't Bart-ing!  better
I never really got the reason for emojis in the first place, I'm an old school "smiley" kind of guy, so can't get the color thing neither; but if people like them or represent them, why not?! I don't really care enough for that kind of things... Simpsons yellow is good for me :)
