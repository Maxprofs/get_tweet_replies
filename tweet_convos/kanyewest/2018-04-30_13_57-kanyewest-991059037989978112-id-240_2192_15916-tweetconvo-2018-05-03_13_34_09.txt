You're not Lennon.
Dude
I contacted an old co-worker, wished him and his family well, and told him "I love you." Last time we spoke we were in an argument. My message sparked a lengthy, heartfelt conversation and we are on good terms again. All I had to do was reach out and show some love.

#KanyeEffect
Vibrationally speaking the word LOVE has a much higher vibration than HATE. Keeping vibrations high leads to happiness whereas low vibrations leads to despair. The choice is yours! Has the time come? Are WE fed up of all the HATE? Shall WE change? #WWG1WGA! YOU make a difference!


ok
@sobcow everytime
ONE LOVE
You've ALWAYS been a game changer , real , honest, open, saying what EVERY OTHER ARTIST was & is afraid to say since 2 Pac to John Lennon.

THANK U for always inspiring me from College Dropout, Late Registration , 808S , Beautiful Fantasy , YEEZUS to PABLO. That I could be MYSELF

Shot yo clown ass up you like the butler from Django
Keep fighting the good fight, for decades many have been mislead,doing the good thing is always hardest. The young,the poor and mislead need strong leaders to show them a better path and that things don't have to be this way. Peace

If you found out a politician in our government was a pedophile would you arrest him/her even if they were a Democrat like you or a Republican like you?

I hope you don’t let Maxine Waters get away with saying you spoke out of turn and should think what you say before you speak. That woman is clueless and says the craziest garbage and has no right to tell anyone they have no right to speak.
Love is the highest word of all words! what good is anything without love! be fruitful and thankful it's a good plan
IM THE HOTTEST RAPPER! HOTTER THAN A SKILLET! BRUH!
@Khroen knows what's up. Been saying "Much Love before it was cool." We love your T-Shirt btw Khroen.
Love these tweets. I love the fact that you keep an open mind, & that love is the prevailing force which gives you the ability to embrace our President .
Thank you 4 your
"WISDOM"................Continue with your "Favor"..............
I like to feel LOVE !  Words are just words if there's no passion behind what's being said. Am I right? LOVE can go a long way when it's True. Xo
LOVE that!
The tone of every word you say is infused with love, like herbal tea. The herbal tea of @kanyewest
@_ThePaddy_

Yeah I texted my sis yesterday to see how she was, she didn't respond, but I'm trying to connect with her more
I love you Kanye. Everyone needs love.
Through speech it may be saying simply the word love at the end of a phone call or just saying much love. TYPE BEAT
NAV TYPE BEAT 
Ok Kanye
LOVE

That's true. I remember having rapper friends who would end the call with "love". And I was like thinking love is respect. So we don't have to agree on everything or anything even, but the hate in life solves nothing and is part of the fear paradigm system that wears on people.
@ahaemoji what about bye 11 times
Kim does not give you love enough. She loves money moves
I'll tell you Kayne, that would be nice to hear.  When you lose your family at a young age & on your own, you just don't hear those words.  When you are an orphan, many just don't send love your way, so I send it their way. Maybe one day someone out there will wish me love too.
Much love to you Cindy! #muchlove
Oh my gosh thank you!! I will take your act of kindness with me for the rest of my life and carry it in my heart.  Someone sent love my way & I haven't had that in a really long time. Most of my life actually, so thanks!! Thank you so much!!
What has trump done for the blacks?
what did you done 4 them?
What has kanye done?? Tf you do black panther? Scram!!
#distraction
When you don't have to worry about meals shelter or paying bills, you think different. The more those primary factors secure the more your mind is free. It's just that simple. Ye's ideas are a function of luxurious living.
We LOVE u Brother

Always end....love you
@kanyewest the amount of hate directed towards you is still energy to feed you. The love you’re creating is beyond the normalcy. I love you. I thought I was the only who thought like you. We are rare but we are powerful.
World Love is a great undertaking.
The ability to undertake it is provided by the blood of your brothers that fought the World wars.

I mean look at what these ppl doing to bill cosby and r kelly, these ppl are playing God, these same ppl probably have dead bodies in their backyard. Are we gonna take down every man for any abuse reflected on women
We took this approach back in the day, before the politicos with their currency of resentment. Love is the only way, but it would put a lot of mongers out of business.

Truly the son of a schoolteacher -- she must have been one of the best! Everyone needs to feel cherished, cared for.
You are delusional bro.  Seriously.  Please seek some mental help.  You need it.  John Legend schooled you, but you're too stupid to recognize it.
#kanyalifematters

We fear because we don't want to loose what we love.  Some would say not to love as much as to avoid fear.  But if we love with all of our soul and it is lost, in our grief we will discover that the purpose of love is not to keep it for ourselves, but to give it away.  #love

Figures that poverty pimp doesn't believe in free speech (except for you to agree with her)
Get some help soon, you are making enemies everywhere

If being myself and thinking for myself risks having the world hate me, then I'd rather the world hate me for thinking freely than it loving me for thinking one-sided
I'd rather the world hate me for being myself, than it loving me for being…
Hey @kanyewest , notice how it's only those living by liberal ideology telling you to keep your mouth shut?  Say it loud and say it clear.  You can listen as well as you hear.  Don't be forced silent by those afraid to hear what you are saying.
Number 1 Rule. TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED. NO ONE WANTS TO BE HURT OR LOVE ONES TO BE HURT. THE WAY TO HEALING IS UNDERSTANDING, ACCEPTING WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT, AND HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.
Need u bro @kan
Call Jay
Love is the highest words of all words! what good is anything without love!
say it, or feel it ?
I have been saying, “Nothing but Love” or simply, “NBL” since Will Smith’s role in Independence Day...
Or send love out
In silent intention

@bryancallen @BrendanSchaub One Love 
Through politics, love is leaving people free to live their lives, free to make choices, free to own themselves and the consequences...

Not sure where the change in your vocals and heart came from but I'm liking the new You. Speaking truths.

Since @kanyewest's tweets have apparently made this topic unavoidable, some thoughts on the history of the parties' switch on civil rights.
Where's the end of this sentence?

Are you in favor of congressional term limits?

What?
I wish you would fall in love with a flip phone
For the gang
I've told my kids for years, "I love you completely and I completely love you". They now tell their kids. I end my letters to them with those words. #LoveIsAllWeNeed

Agape

So Did You Do That With Jay Z 
Did that to my boss today now I'm fired. Thanks @kanyewest
My husband, CA native, use to find it weird that I always ended my conversations with "Love ya, take care" with friends & family even if we may have been arguing. I'm from SC. His fam mems rarely tell their children they  them but always talk about who they hate-- theyre libs.

Woop di poopi di scoop
Just saying.......
I have always told my family and friends I love you in person or on phone and text.
Changing Frequency
Much love, ye
.
End every message thread of the day with the word love.

The people Obama focused on MOST while in office were gays. Now, the irony is the same people who would say 'I should be able to love who I want', want to deny YOU the right to even SPEAK TO a conservative...isn't that interesting? #LiberalHypocrisy
there are good and bad people on both sides, but I am glad that you aren't giving in and sticking close to your morals. Your friends shouldn't care who you support, they should just support you like you do them.
I would LOVE for you to help my female charity. Show UK women much love 
1 John 4:8 
Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
Peace 
As I keep up my charitable acts of giving hope to others I need you to Help me help the homeless. Purchase my 1st book All proceeds go directly to a homeless shelter picked at random.
#MuchLove
In the words of Terry Tibbs ‘much love’
Don't let your "so-called" woke friends rewrite history.  These are the facts.
Sinking like a river leads astray, 
An arrow blowing through my golden hair! 
I hear the sound of me and you hooray, 
Sing a song about the love affair. 

#AI #ArtificialIntellligence #Poetry
Been watching Barbarella?
*yawn* *waiting on Drake's album*
Much Love to you Kanye!!
Start a March for the people that have been to afraid to voice what they support.
I've done this all my life and taught my children to say "I love you" as we part ways or end a conversation on a phone call or texting. 
You never know if it'll be the last time you see your loved family, or friends. 
Showing acts of LOVE to your neighbor 
not just saying it.
Seriously @kanyewest , I don’t feel comfortable saying it. Can it just be through more positive actions and treating people with respect?
““Put me like a seal on your heart, Like a seal on your arm; For love is as strong as death, Jealousy is as severe and cruel as Sheol (the place of the dead). Its flashes are flashes of fire, [A most vehement flame] the very flame of the LORD!”
SONG OF SOLOMON 8:6 AMP
You are annoying!
Love is a verb. Show it.
The shoppe down the street is run by a really nice Syrian man who always says " Peace and love to you"  whenever you leave. Even if you dont buy anything.
Much love mr @kanyewest 
Like the 1990s?

“Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination.”
Voltaire
Duh people already do this. What planet do you live on? Kardashian’s vapid planet. You ain’t that deep broh
Listen in as MarquesAnderson and  Jen Lemen talk about love, trust, technology and how A.I. might be a map we can hack back to our original blueprints.
Thank you Kanye. One love bro let’s keeping passing it around. Peace be with everyone and love and respect flow through the air. Positive vibes all day. Thanks Kanye !
Much love Kayne

The chosen through self-sacrifice enlightened with the light of truth shines bright in these days of darkness since druids mystics of Yahweh 
The Democratic Party has kept Black people enslaved for decades by not ending every phone call with the word “love”. Wake up sheeple!
