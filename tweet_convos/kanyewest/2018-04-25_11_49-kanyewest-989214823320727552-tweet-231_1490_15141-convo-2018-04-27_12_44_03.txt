Oh so that’s the trick. I understand now.
Hey Kanye! Because you know how live music is important... I created WYKER to match concerts and festivals with friends. Because live music is better with friends, WYKER implements in its app the 1st social matching algorithm on live music events. Available for NY events!

So what drugs were you doing when you convinced yourself Yeezy will hit a billion dollars this year? Asking for a friend
We have 160 positions to fill by the end of the year. Yeezy will hit a billion dollars this year. It is the 2nd fastest growing company in history. It is a unicorn on its way to becoming a decacorn.
Hmm, Trump School of Economics I see?
Yet trump attended one of the best business schools in the world and has already proved himself in the world of real estate.
He inherited money that he blew, got into a school fleeing the draft because of daddy's money.
And let us not forget him cheating and lying through NY RE including not paying contractors for work performed.  He's a POS.
Hey there is a lot of stuff about stuff that I don't like but you cannot deny that the guy is pretty proficient in the world of business for him to become so successful.
*stuff about trump that I don't like
god accounting is going to haunt me for the rest of my life
HI Mr West, gone through your posts to find 1 with less than 10k comms.Just want congratulate you on your awakening.. I'm an independent journalist & single mum in the UK. I got sacked from my radio show partly cos I think UK needs a Trump. So would you come on my new radio show

I have some extra capacity - can get a turn going with the analyst team. Sounds like a promising lead.
Normally I’d be open to letting another analyst take a pitch off my hands but this deal would be 
Karl, I just got my pro-rated half year bonus and don't have time for your bs. You're talking to a post-mba associate here, so pls start working on the turn. I'm out of pocket after 8pm tonight, but let's look to give Bart a draft in the am.

Invest in me. I believe I am 100% the best investment you could ever make

You should strategically invest in crypto-currency.  There's a ton you could accomplish in the space, along with they money that could be made.  It's the next step in technology which needs to be a part of your roadmap if you expect to take over fashion industry.

Can you guys strategically invest in @WrestlingSheet? We'll only hire free thinkers.
How about strategically investing with platforms that don’t compromise our first amendment rights and try to sway people’s opinions. Like Bitchute, http://Gab.ai , etc...Move away from the liberal left Silicon Valley...

I wonder if he even reads a quarter of these comments. Who da fuck is he even talking to?! He probably has his speech to text on and actually talking to someone 
Neither you, the crazy black conservative woman or @realDonaldTrump are free thinkers. It’s insane to support people who are outwardly hostile to black progress. You need to read to understand how we got here
Kanye I don't get it. You been here for hours with us but you have @KimKardashian waiting for you. Get outta here go have some fun.

If anyone does Ye justice this show is one of them, seriously anyone who thinks LOP is “disjointed” should at least listen to ONE episode and realize there’s so much thst goes unaccredited for and unappreciated.
