YASSSS QUEEN!! You beautiful sometimes complicated Queen 
Thanks, Britni! Give us a shout out if you never need any help! We're here for you.
I just love you.
The feeling is mutual. 
*Screen shots for when feeling down*
Let Twitter give me a blue checkmark. I'd be sending Britni sweet nothings all day. I want the same love, I'm formula free.
Cant do. I keep track of all my crypto on it
The never ending library of bulldog pics is astounding.
Most of them are selfies
Omg he’s talking about blockchain
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIT U
I’m not a performer. But what I can give to the world is help with their finances. @msexcel is a tool I LIVE by. I love it. So sometimes I don’t want to work, but if I do work, I want to help ppl. Excel helps me with that. I wish I was rich, but mybe I’d still help with excel
Hearing this made our day! What is your favorite feature in Excel?
I'm going to say linking, because I only have to type something somewhere ONCE and then it will go any and everywhere it want it to.
We love that, too! Do you work with Excel every day?
Yes, I work with Excel every day & have since the 80s. Accounting nerd. Never gonna give it up.
collab with russ
If you don’t delete this jawn rfn....
WHY DO PEOPLE HATE RUSS?
because he acts like because he produces his own beats he is somehow physically superior to everyone
Well doesn’t that kinda make him a better creator then most I fucking hate him too but most these bums nowadays don’t even write the lyrics
producing your own beats is something to be respected but there's so many examples of self produced rappers that are miles better than him lmfao. I hate his cocky attitude and his "im so special producer mans xDDDDD" shitposts especially
YOU DONT DESERVE HER
Kanye no it’s called a FMECA and it’s 3000 entries of how my spacecraft can fail and how we detect and / or prevent it and it’s years of my life

Someone needs to tell him that the files are IN the COMPUTER.

Google sheets is better
I do a lot of my life and work planing in Google Sheets. It’s amazing
It’s terrific
But then google knows everything you do.
They already know anyway

Kanye is subtweeting you, @TianaTheFirst
I don’t know if I’ve ever identified more with a tweet in my life
Like print it out and burn it? Or burn my whole computer? Or burn it to disc? Dude, you have to be more specific.

Nas Album Done

Wow, this tweet went viral. I made it, guys
I would lose my job if I did that, but thanks for the super cool tip

My sensitivity analysis shows: no @msexcel = no job. Therefore i won't be able to afford a pair of Yeezy! So, no... Just filter or pivot some tables and that might do the trick.
Do I print it out and then burn it, or just burn the whole laptop? Am #askKanye #confusedDotWest #MSExcel

@sean_r_wes
@mariamkoslay
@kanyewest does have a point! @msexcel, you are a little bit old fashioned  Event planners that use spread sheets, just like us, have seen our productivity fall! Thats why we created @tamehq  We had a good run though #808s #heartbreak

It's in my computer, Kanye.
By the way, if you did n't get this tweet, he is not talking about excel, he's talking about the banks vs blockchain !
