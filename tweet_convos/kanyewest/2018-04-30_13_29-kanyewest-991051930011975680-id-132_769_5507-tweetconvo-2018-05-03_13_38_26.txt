Here's an idea for a contest. First one to find a real Indian who was actually offended by Apu wins. Go.
Found one. Several, in fact.
Several? Woah. Hey everyone, we better remove a classic character in one of the most beloved shows of all-time to appease several weak-minded Indians who can't take a joke.

What about sending money to Chicago???
You're bumming me out dude, this is sad, just stop.

Thanks! You can get it here!
Words are great things. You can untie people with words or separate them; you can create love or animosity.
Kanye is pissed. ROYALLY PISSED

@Exxposure
Every character in the Simpsons is a stereotype... That's why it's funny.

@harikondabolu

Apu is a cultural icon that through humor has lessened the distance and created a warm feeling about the culture. If we are completely incapable of laughing at ourselves and our stereotypical nature then we submit to racist beliefs.
like if you’d vote for kanye
You know you are a spoiled country when your grieve is a cartoon character. Here is an idea, how about helping some of those homeless in California. How about cleaning the trash on the streets? Or helping the addicts laying all over the BART tunnels.

I’m Indian and my dad is from India. He loves Apu he even has picture of him in his office. My whole family who is from India loves the Simpsons and Apu. It’s stupid that Indian Americans are trying to get rid of him. The Simpsons makes fun of every culture.
APU SCREENWRITING CONTEST TYPE BEAT
Spurs announce that Gregg Popovich's wife, Erin, passed away today. TYPE BEAT 


Hello mr west
Boi what
what happened to resist the mob kanye? now you are into full PC enforcement on the simpsons? -_-
you're not getting it. he's showing love to everybody, even those you disagree with
its a contradiction. freedom of thought and writing off a character on a cartoon because people are offended DO NOT go hand in hand because love. I think you don't get it. Apu thing is about self-interest not love. Nobody talking about willie, homer, or the loads of other STs
For someone who rants on about being an artist and being able to speak his mind seems you don't share that sentiment for other artists. The Simpsons and Apu have been around forever and now you wanna call "racism"? Looks like stupidity is a CHOICE to!
Thanks for posting this
We as Gemini's try and help for a reason, because we really care but ppl will not see that at all. Can u believe John F Kennedy and Bush was a Gemini, keep fighting for what  u LOVE but use others to present some messages
The Simpsons portrays everyone as stereotypes, even Canada. I think they've done this for every country now. We should be able to look past this, unwind, and just enjoy the show.
how much more can i love you man

finally. my chance as an Indian-American has come.
Ummm the Jury is tainted. AKA reverse discrimination sucks.....
@patesmouth

Thousands of POC suffering from hunger, crime, lack of education, housing and health care and you want to spend your money saving Apu.  Why don't you just issue a clothing line that reads  "No Longer Relevant"?
The comedian's mother is the hero of his documentary. Love her.
Can u keep tweeting this ,got some ideas
@rabipelaoponte2 try it out dawg
 that’s dope
@AlaniPoe
Where’s the audition for ‘Kids Sees Ghosts’ ?
Don’t support PC culture. Or do.
Apu alrdy a Spring Field legend. He does much better than most of the other @TheSimpsons characters.  It’s a reminder to us all. 1 st generation immigrants come to this country work hard to provide for loved ones.
@harikondabolu !!!!!
@harikondabolu have you seen this
The Simpsons is art. Respect Matt as a great artist.

Watch your tweets bro if you get out of control your hear about it on CNN  act your age it’s more becoming of your position..
@kanye, wrong direction.  This contest is divisive.
When your life is so good you want to change a character of the Simpsons when there is bigger fish to fry. Just don't watch the Simpsons or at least create your own cartoon. Stop forcing change, it has to come naturally or it fails.
You di realest king
This is going to be important on your journey.
why cant we just keep apu

Wouldn’t it be better to create your own IP to better craft the message you want to tell instead of using the Simpsons canon?
Kanye....it was the REPUBLICAN controlled congress in the 60's that introduced and passed all the civil rights laws that decade. Don't let your ignorant and deluded friend @johnlegend fool you. He has ZERO clue what he's talking about.
