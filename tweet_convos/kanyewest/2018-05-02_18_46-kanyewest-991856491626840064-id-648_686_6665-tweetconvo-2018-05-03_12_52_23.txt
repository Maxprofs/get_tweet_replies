If you are hurt by Kaney’s recent actions... https://goo.gl/q5SJn2 
Dirty game P. Just business though, right? Or, would you actually LIKE to see a man who's in the process of repairing himself be broken again? Good luck with that P, I think Ye's well prepared
I never said to boycott him. I was just sharing INFORMATION (in Kanye's voice, his own words). xoxo
My reading comprehension is fine. You clearly stated "If you are hurt by Kaney’s recent actions..." while "sharing information" which leads to action. Hegelian dialectic (problem>reaction>solution) laid out in plain sight. You'da been better off not defending yourself, 2 obvious
Yes. I clearly didn't say anyone should. CLEARLY. xoxo
Tits out for Kanye

We could all sit here and argue about who thinks like a slave, who's racist or not...but real, actual slaves are the children stuck in pedo rings/cults.  They know they are slaves, it's us adults who don't believe it's happening. Here's some numbers for you.  Speak UP!!!
You are absent of thought and style 
Spam!
More love and less hate bro.
What a con man you are. Made your press, say anything for attention, time to bring out the products. Hope no one wastes their money.
I mean.... "what a sell out" and no, his newfound fans won't be buying their new "tokens" music or clothes
Been a fan since Through the Wire and I 100% agree with his exploration of "forbidden" subjects and taboos. Y'all are enslaved to group think. Unshackle yourself.
1. I do not group think
2. I've never been shackled
3. I am Armenian and my history is survival. And fighting the ones denying our Genocide to this day
4. If anyone from our community disgraced our history this way, there wouldn't be any talk of exploration

Yesss flood your Twitter & keep ignoring the fact that you need HELP!!! If this whole plot is to sell merch, music, etc shame on you 
GET HELP @kanyewest

...... you do know the same line was said by Killmonger in Black Panther? Right! And it is a choice because they could stop breathing but choose to endure! So that’s is the choice. Just like VICTIMHOOD!
My boyfriend broke up with me because I follow you.
Then your ex bf is pretty stupid and petty
Der!
You sir are awake! Just watched entire TMZ interview. You will expose pop culture in the same way Trump exposed the media. #FreeThought #Kanye

That'll be 300 Bucks, please.

You, by contrast, sound like a pleasure.
Not all lessons have to be complicated. You just choose how to receive the message. Everything in the dark comes to the light and y’all just have to realize some things in society need to be spoken about publicly or they will continue to happen in the shadows  #KanyeLogic is real
I watched a clip of The View and all of the women were saying they didn't understand a word Kanye was saying in his interview at TMZ. They are not open or ready for Worldwide peace. K is coming from a place of love and trying to break through to people that are closed off.
#Love
K is coming from a world of smug narcissists that say bullshit without actual fact. Yes, the set mindset of blacks to be Dems could be considered entrapping but not slavery. Slavery is not something that one may considers optional, as it is sometimes people's whole lives.
Wow....disrespected....#SAD

#slaverywasachoice and what he meant by this was that how can the black population have outnumbered the masters but, we did nothing to overpower them. #Kanye isn’t crazy y’all just acting out of fear And stupidity to respond back to him and trying to be funny for the media.
My god, to observe that level of stupid is painful! Did nothing to over power them? Ru 4 real? Read a history book or two or even better use google. You will learn that there was many a resistance, many an effort to break free. not afraid of what Kanye says, just disappointed.

Make the impossible possible, even if they don’t think it’s logical. Always listening to your artistry and I appreciate the music that was always delivered. Thanks. By the way, Flashing Lights my number 1 song next to Power.
"We have the resources to make this a peaceful world" ok I'm feeling love now. Just having a conversation what are you afraid of?
Yo, nice work!
OK, I get it, but stop being so impulsive with your words, stop, think and act.  You lost money and disgrace black people in three seconds.  Please get off the drugs, pills, etc.  don't get caught up in the Hollywood white rich hype of being thin.  Stay strong and stay vocal

your mission may be accomplished. If you wanted to get to the root of an important issue in America such as slavery, and get the whole country having no choice but to talk about it and hopefully confront it, by saying it was a choice then your mission is accomplished!
