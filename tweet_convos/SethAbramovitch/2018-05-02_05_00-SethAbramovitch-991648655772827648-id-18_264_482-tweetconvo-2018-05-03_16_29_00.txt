Adam Driver is such a phenomenal actor.
Spike sounds excited.... Adam Driver must have jumped at the chance to work with him. I know I would. Looking forward to seeing this at some point.
Omg I’m so hyped for that movie

Hard pass.
Agent Orange.  Good one. Way to denigrate somebody based on the color of their skin. You’re not only a lifelong PUNK, you’re a HYPOCRITE.
Not Cannes lol... ( CanYa's )

one movie I will skip. I’ve had enough with his hypocrisy over the years.
Driver has worked with Eastwood, Jarmusch, Scorsese, Spielberg, the Coens, Soderbergh, Gilliam, Baumbach, Abrams and Spike - lucky bastard
Another rich Hollywood liberal against Trump .
In love with  Adam  Driver

Well bless his heart! God loves all people! We all bleed the same! And change starts in God's house not the white house! God bless you!
