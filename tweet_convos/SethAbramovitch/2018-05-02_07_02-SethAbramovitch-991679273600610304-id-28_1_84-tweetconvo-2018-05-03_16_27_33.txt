This will be your legacy.
I'm fine with that.
Me trying to stop you from creating a furious global debate over snacks.
Frank you were here first, and had the best #takes
Officially internet famous. You've made it.
I will not forget you.
what hath you wrought
Part man, part Chartbeat
lol
OMG mazel tov, being featured in the DM is the best, the commenters are unhinged. I see one has already called you "A MOUTHPIECE for the MOVIE INDUSTRY". They said I looked like "a junkie Kate Moss" years ago and it still brings me glee
I feel like "junkie Kate Moss" is high praise.
could not agree more!!!!
wait till Drudge gets a whiff of this.
I compromise - bring my own alcohol but pay the cinema $$$ for my mixer.
That is a super adorable pic of you
Your lawn is so huge now
Furious global debate! Furious!  
If you need the guys who set up Salman Rushdie's security after the fatwah, I'll hook you up.
It’s a great pic.
Wow! You’re famous!!
Singlehandedly buttressing the “gay Jewish liberal media coastal elite” trope. Mazel, friend!
Congratulations!
LOL
ages ago, a moviegoer brought in chinese food that not only was loud to open and to eat, but smelled.  later the same person passed out and snored even louder than the food opening was.  everyone in the theater started laughing
I still believe in you, even if you are Doritosist
OMG
Amazing
"Criticism pouring in from around the world" haha
“Although many argued that this is a myth.”  Amazing
Finally, some appropriately focused outrage!
Abramye
This is amazing.
YOU'VE MADE IT! 
you're right. this is a stupid conversation. good job being the one to kick it off.
I do bring in my own soda.  I have at times brought in my own popcorn.  I can afford to buy coke and popcorn.  I can  buy a bag of popping corn for what it costs to buy a bucket of pop corn.
