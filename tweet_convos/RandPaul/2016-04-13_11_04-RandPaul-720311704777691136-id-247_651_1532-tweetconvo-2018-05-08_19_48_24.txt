S.Amdt.3518, improves and expands access to the FFDO program by: Adding an additional 5 training facilities throughout the United States.
Retaining the training requirements, but allows for three days of classroom work to be completed online.
Improving the carriage requirements and allows the FFDO to make reasonable efforts to keep their firearm concealed when in public.
Allowing FFDOs to utilize the Known Crewmember Check system when reporting for flights.
Call your senators now and tell them you support expanding access to the FFDO program!
@RandPaul that's a stupid idea and you're stupid for pushing it.
@rjcc @RandPaul please give us a reason instead of calling something stupid #ignorance
@FredwardJohn @rjcc @RandPaul guns and planes aren't a good combo. 

Pilots aren't law enforcement

There hasn't been a hijacking in years
@Das_Gimps @rjcc @RandPaul what... Have you been living under a rock?
@FredwardJohn @rjcc @RandPaul name the last successful hijacking that's happened in the US.
@Das_Gimps @rjcc @RandPaul there are hijackings all over the world should we just relax because none have happened here?
@FredwardJohn @rjcc @RandPaul how are our pilots here going to stop hijackings on the other side of the world? Do a fly by shooting?
@Das_Gimps @rjcc @RandPaul are you that dense?
@RandPaul carrying arms on a flight won't work at all Sir
@malikanura876 @RandPaul hows that
@FredwardJohn @RandPaul when security at ground level can't do their job how can carrying guns help in the cockpit? It's a security issue
@malikanura876 @RandPaul I think you just missed the obvious in your statement.
@FredwardJohn @RandPaul so they will take their wars up 2d sky wth the passengers on board! Not bad well great ideas not that I hv to concur
@malikanura876 @RandPaul their wars? You ok? Go sit down before you hurt yourself
@RandPaul
@RandPaul pilot would be final defense
@RandPaul @alllibertynews great idea! Wait - who flies the plane while they're doing that?
@mikejjamieson @alllibertynews @RandPaul Autopilot.
@R_Love317 @alllibertynews @RandPaul yeah, book me on that hijacked autopilot flight.
@mikejjamieson @alllibertynews @RandPaul I'm not sure terrorists share hijacking plans ahead of time. Lemme check on that and get back to u
@RandPaul @Murphyms73 Great idea ,maybe pilot can shoot everybody before they crash the plane
@RandPaul #I SUPPORT RAND 100%
@RandPaul Depends what you're arming them with. Guns aren't a good idea in a pressurized tube, over 35,000ft above the ground.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews i'm with air marshalls, pilots be drunk and coke'd up, not a good idea
@RandPaul I would never support such stupid legislation. Guns on airplanes is as ridiculous as guns in schools or anywhere else. @NRA SUCKUP
@iHarry @alllibertynews @RandPaul @NRA Nobody in Congress Will EVER support the 2nd Amendment for Fear of their Own Stealing from us & Lies
@RealClass @alllibertynews @RandPaul @NRA Thanks for the senseless babbling! I had a great laugh.
@iHarry @alllibertynews @RandPaul @NRA Oh he's the dude Selling the Drugs up the street Hopkins probably, Hi as a kite, ignorant Socialist
@RandPaul my husband is a pilot and thinks this amendment is very beneficial. When is the vote?
@RandPaul @alllibertynews I'd rather law said they MUST notify the public if their flight crews are NOT armed.
. @RandPaul
@RandPaul How about box cutters instead?
@milestougeaux ok...my 67th birthday was this past Sunday.... Where is my song??
@tchhist39
@milestougeaux Love it!! Thanks Eber!
@RandPaul So when the pilot and copilot die in retaliation to a hijacking, who's left to fly the plane? Also, data:
@RandPaul do we not already have air Marshalls? gop wants guns every where except of course government buildings.
@chardown @alllibertynews @RandPaul There should be tasers on every flight.
@RandPaul  I sure shall but gotta screen those pilots also too fullest extend to put that much trust in the pilot as long as he not mental
@harleygrl3465 @RandPaul who determines whether someone is "mental" or not. Not the government I hope
@adlangston75 @RandPaul  The states whom hire all pilots no gov control on that issue state level professionals durin theyre schoolin
@harleygrl3465 @RandPaul seems like if they are sane enough to fly a plane, they are sane enough to have a gun
@adlangston75 @RandPaul  But I havent flown and wont till they all startdoin theyre jobs and make usall safe again which I doubt greed reins
@harleygrl3465 @RandPaul I've decided that I will no longer live in fear. I just live my life & pray for the best.
@RandPaul thank you kindly Sir!  Your hard work and dedication is appreciated! Air Marshals are stretched so thin-great line of defense!
@RandPaul @CANARYorg good amendment!
@RandPaul no
@RandPaul that's great until an unstable drunk pilot decides he's had enough shoots the co-pilot and crashes the plane.
@RandPaul the god complex for pilots is almost worse than doctors. Bad idea this, Dr. Paul. You've been had by the wrong lobbyist.
@RandPaul Ok Rand, that's a little far. I don't think we need firearms being discharged in a pressurized cabin miles in the air.
@RandPaul are you f—ing serious?!? Hell no.
@RandPaul You Americans are crazy. How large an object do you think will fit through a bullet hole in a plane at altitude? Adult size?
@RandPaul  No. How much did the #NRA pay you for this one?
@RandPaul Make sure you make pilots watch Hunt for Red October first. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt0sH1C_XBc … #mostthings #dontreactwell #tobullets
@RandPaul or just everyone. Eliminating tsa, save time and headaches
@RandPaul remember that JetBlue pilot from NYC a few years back? Good thing he didn't have a gun. #stopIt
@RandPaul All my airline industry friends think you were literally high when you thought that up, FWIW
@RandPaul No.
@RandPaul Great except in case like German pilot who crashed plane...or pilot arrested for being drunk...good and bad points.
@RandPaul some of you people are really dumb. A huge number of pilots carry guns already, and you would never even know.
@RandPaul @PJStrikeForce Pilots are already armed. Well, some are. Others want nothing to do with it.
@RandPaul Will you introduce, back, & relentlessly fight for an Amendment for Congressional term limits? If not, fight for a national vote!
@RandPaul that doesn't make a lot of sense considering the cockpit door is sealed during an attack and their ore Marshals on board
@RandPaul @alllibertynews What about let the normal people have guns? This is one of those #libertarianish moments...
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Donald Trump Exposes Rush Limbaugh https://youtu.be/93Yum5mPoSo 
@RandPaul uhm, we have air Marshalls trained for that shit, so I'm good.
@RandPaul Guns in airplanes is the stupidest idea for you yet! Maybe a stungun, or anything that wont make a hole in the plane! Good Lord!
@RandPaul Isn't there already a program for that?   @RestoreHistory
@RandPaul why not assign a police officer for each plane?
@RandPaul I tried to like you... What's next matches on the Hindenburg....
@RandPaul and this airline pilot thanks you!
@RandPaul @WoffordN Well, I hope the idewa was to arm them with pepper spray!
@RandPaul They won't listen.
.@RandPaul Has something recently happened that requires us to arm our pilots?
@RandPaul sorry, I disagree.  Passengers now know their lives depend on action.  No one will ever let 9/11 happen again.
@RandPaul But what happens when they exit the sealed cockpit? That's a risk no? How do you shoot in a crowded space 30k up in air?
@RandPaul I'd love to. I just don't think patty Murray has enough support from folks like me. Useless. Tried over n over. Just 1 voice!
@SenatorShaheen and @KellyAyotte please step across the aisle and support this bill with 
@RandPaul 
#LiveFreeOrDie but I Vote
@RandPaul  Rand knows what he doin America lets trust Rand he has all oyr best intentions in mind always please call urge n recall thxs.#SWR
@RandPaul I would prefer to have an armed crewman on a flight I was on. Not enough Air Marshalls.
@MichaelSmith024 I thought I read somewhere they were phasing the Air Marshall program out, or maybe hiring freeze,I disremember.@RandPaul
@TheTimothyForkl I would not doubt that. @RandPaul
@RandPaul sorry, I live in nanny state Cali where the bulk of my "peers" feel an incompetent waste should be our senatorial representation..
@RandPaul ....really??
@RandPaul @CalFreedomMom fly the plane land then shoot
@randpaul That is a ridiculously dumb idea even by GOP standards. How about reforming air security so it’s not just intrusive theatre?
@ACMESalesRep @RandPaul We will go ahead and put this potentially explosive tube of toothpaste over here in this trash can behind me...
@RandPaul I suggest restraining all passengers in their seats at the beginning of the flight.
@RandPaul When you find a gun that can kill the terrorist on the other side of 30 people, let us know. Quit living in Rambo fantasy land.
@RandPaul we need you to save our constitution and our country
@RandPaul love the idea. But what's different than what's in place now?
@RandPaul I see a couple of problems with this. 1) pilot shoots copilot and then crashes plane 2) to help passengers, he must unlock door.
@RandPaul I want them flying the plane.
@RandPaul no thanks
@RandPaul aren't they locked in the cockpit for a reason? Don't we want them to fly the plane instead? And keep them away from the threat?
@RandPaul So, did you ask anybody that knows anything about gunfighting if this was a good idea and ignored their reply, or is this all you?
@RandPaul I'm a pilot and I know pilots can be pretty busy. I do NOT want pilots trying to fly the approach with a gun in one hand!
@RandPaul No thanks.
@RandPaul This is the dumbest series of words I've ever read.
@RandPaul @Jeff257
@RandPaul You need to decide if you prefer being a Dr. or Sen. & quit the one w/job title you don't/won't use, son.
@RandPaul What an absolutely awful idea.
@RandPaul You're insane.
@RandPaul Fuck the NRA
@RandPaul Do you ever get tired of being wrong?
@RandPaul I'm a big supporter of yours. But this is just dumb. Come on man, I'd rather train all pilots in Krav maga. Let's disarm and fight
@RandPaul That's one way terrorists can trick them into opening the cockpit door.
.@RandPaul A gun belonging to the pilot of a US Airways plane went off as the  aircraft was on approach... http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-airways-pilots-gun-fires-in-cockpit/ …
@RandPaul are you trying to out crazy @realDonaldTrump you're one crazy #SoB
@RandPaul Arm them with what? You do know that firing a gun on a plane could be disastrous, right?
@RandPaul Make sure they set the autopilot before going all OK Corral on the badass motherf***ers #Dumbideas
@RandPaul @PatDollard why aren't we making bills and enforcing laws that send home illegal aliens and terrorists?
@WilliamMoney10 @PatDollard @RandPaul we are loser
@donald_t_rump @PatDollard @RandPaul no we are not loser, gov. Is the loser. The sellouts are the losers. Those that are prepared prevail.
@WilliamMoney10 @PatDollard @RandPaul that's exactly what a loser would say.
@donald_t_rump @PatDollard @RandPaul you must be the expert then.
@RandPaul although important, was that was the most pressing issue you could think of? Inequality? Infrastructure?...#priorities
@RandPaul I just called to urge an examination of your brain injury.
@RandPaul we already got air marshalls mate
@RandPaul so while flying they'll be fighting off terrorists? Sounds like a busy pilot. Ridiculous.
@lollitheatheist @RandPaul you know what I mean. Besides, the airborne isn't know for its marksmanship in handguns.
@lollitheatheist @RandPaul Air Force.
@RandPaul You expect the pilot to run back and shoot attackers? Who's flying the plane? The pilot will introduce a gun into passenger cabin?
@RandPaul Love you Dr. Paul, but couldn't an attacker gain access to this and become more dangerous? What about accidental discharge?
@RandPaul I think it makes a lot more sense to arm the pilots with tazers or rubber bullet guns. No need to risk shooting open the cabin.
@RandPaul We just secured the cockpit doors to keep hijackers out. Now you want to arm the pilots and unlock the doors to help? Bad idea.
@RandPaul I respect you but I don't think this goes far enough. All passengers should be armed
@RandPaul  Paul's idea isn't going to be so genius when a pilot loses his mind and shoots up a plane--- he'll blame Obama
@RandPaul  So, you went from just a little bit crazy to full moron mode, right?
@RandPaul
@RandPaul That sounds like a very bad idea
@RandPaul are you fucking high or something?
@RandPaul this is seven layers of stupid. I would hope the goal of air safety would be to have less people with weapons on board.
@RandPaul pretty sure having pilots leave their secure, impenetrable cockpit during a hijacking is like THE thing you don't want them to do.
@RandPaul id rather have a marshall
@RandPaul Sen. Paul let's also arm passengers; N whenever there is shootout at 30K feet will call it "a Randian anarchy" woohoo
@RandPaul uhhhhh..... No thanks!
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz 
Support this!!
@RandPaul airplanes are pressurized. So nah that's a bad
So you want pilots to leave the cockpit, which would require unlocking the door, allowing terrorists to force their way in. @RandPaul
@RandPaul When you don't do your actual job, you have time for this shit.
@RandPaul couldn't we arm pilots with snakes instead?
@RandPaul PSA: don't take acid when watching Tombstone
@RandPaul I feel like I've said this to you before, but this is breathtakingly stupid.
@RandPaul After a pilot locked the cabin doors and crashed his plane killing all on board, this isn't a great idea.
@RandPaul Repeal NFA
@RandPaul @mariannecope Yeah, but make sure you add a caveat *only sober pilots need apply
@RandPaul I found your book in the half off discount bin at the dollar store. Do you think the free market works?
@RandPaul the, there are said number of air Marshalls ploy will be used against you. But they can't say arming pilots is bad. 747 is aweapon
@RandPaul Because any indiscriminate firing of guns in a pressurized cabin is intelligent. Think before you speak please.
@RandPaul Who will be flying the plane, when the pilots are playing John McClane?
@RandPaul @iamDavidWiley Why not allow passengers to be armed, as protected by the 2nd Amendment?
@Agent_Orange76 @RandPaul Armed with what? Nothing that can cause explosive decompression hopefully
Otherwise, yes
@iamDavidWiley @RandPaul Explosive decompression never stopped the air marshals from carrying guns.
@iamDavidWiley @RandPaul Any close-quarters weapon would be better than nothing, and still protected under the 2nd Amendment.
@Agent_Orange76 @RandPaul
Those are no more dangerous on a plane than a city street
@Agent_Orange76 @RandPaul
Also disband the TSA
They're useless and engaged in rights violations
@RandPaul pilots cant even stay sober, and you want to give them guns? How dumb are you? No wonder your campaign failed.
@RandPaul 
@RandPaul Dumb, keep them in the cockpit flying.
.@RandPaul shooting holes in a pressurized container a couple miles above the earth sounds like a swell idea!
.@RandPaul wait, here's a better idea: give every passenger a gun when they board! What could go wrong?
@RandPaul Well they need to give pilots a breath test each flight before they hand a gun to them. Too many drunk pilots! Trump!
@RandPaul your stupidest idea to date
@RandPaul Not satisfied with mass shootings on American soil now you want them in the air too, just go away already, edgit..
i introduced an amendment that would compel airline pilots to fuck terrorists to death so they can defend passengers from attack, @RandPaul.
@RandPaul shooting a gun on an airplane, what could go wrong???
Pilots firing guns in airplanes full of people 30K feet above the ocean? Brilliant, @RandPaul. What could go wrong?
I introduced an amendment that would arm airline pilots so they can defend passengers from attack. Call your senators now and urge support!
@OwlWithAGuitar @RandPaul I mean it's not like we relatively recently had a pilot purposefully crash a jetliner, either.
@RandPaul and all airline pilots are sane? Did you forget the #germanwings suicide pilot?
@RandPaul For what? A gun battle in the cockpit?
@RandPaul Wouldn't the only direction they can shoot be towards the passengers?
@RandPaul @JohnCornyn get onboard (pun intended) with this one Senator of mine.
@RandPaul 
Cause i really want guns going off on planes...
.@RandPaul Snakes on a Plane wasn't real
@RandPaul Because firing a gun on an airplane makes so much sense!
@RandPaul  Um, you do know what would happen if a bullet breaches the fuselage, right?
@RandPaul Back benching it I see.
@RandPaul @SenTomCotton everyone deserves the right of protection #USsenate
@RandPaul If pilots wanted to kill you, there's a much easier method called "crashing." Sorry everybody is dumb.
@RandPaul lol
@RandPaul Great, now terrorist don't even need to bring their own weapons past security, and they know exactly where one is.
@RandPaul Oh yeah, a faster than sound projectile in a pressurised cannister is always a good move...idiot.
@RandPaul Sounds more like a Jason Statham movie pitch than a policy proposal
@RandPaul This can't go wrong at all!
Right @RandPaul let guns on planes again, what could possibly go wrong? - just make sure the pilot is Harrison Ford.
@RandPaul why not this! You know potus has a armoured like car right; Why not a armoured DOOR that not even stewards can enter HUMMMM
@RandPaul nothing could possibli go wrong
@RandPaul I'd rather they just flew the plane. 
Ooh! I know! Maybe we could create a job: "federal air marshal" to help. Oh wait...
@Edenza @RandPaul we cannot afford to put an air Marshall on every flight.
@raddie725 It is the job of an air marshal. The job of a pilot is to fly a plane, not work security. This is pandering nonsense. @RandPaul
@Edenza @RandPaul pilot does more than fly, he is in charge of the plane and may need to defend it from terrorism
@raddie725 @RandPaul No he doesn't. He needs to fly the plane. Not only is this proposed legislation silly, so is this argument.
@Edenza @RandPaul agree to disagree
@RandPaul have you not seen Goldfinger?
@RandPaul will do. However one of our senators, Bob Casey, rarely listens to constituents. He listens to Obama.
Every security review since 9/11 said to secure and isolate the cockpit.  You want them to come out guns blazing?
 @RandPaul
@RandPaul They should also be trained by Ra's al Ghul in advanced fighting techniques. It's about the mind.
@pourmecoffee @RandPaul Airline pilots should also have Num Chuk skills like Bruce Lee.
@RandPaul Uhhh. . . shouldn't they be flying the plane?
@RandPaul Make sure they get proper training on how to use a firearm
@RandPaul What a stupid idea
@RandPaul How much did the @NRA pay you to file such a stupid amendment?
@RandPaul Didn't a co-pilot fly an air plane into a mountain? So that's great let's arm them now so they can hijack planes.
@RandPaul A better idea would be to have snakes on the plane but train them to only attack hijackers / terrorists. Huge deterrent too.
@RandPaul That's not their job and would endanger the lives of everyone on board should they be incapacitated.
@RandPaul sounds like an awful idea. Sorry. Pre screenings of passangers and FAMS should be enough to protect people, pilots aren't cops.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews this seems like an @NRA idea just before convention in Kentucky. Coincidence?  #panderandshill
@RandPaul are pilots going to be grounded for a period to get gun training? For shooting? In a plane?
@RandPaul We don't need more big government cramming their guns down our throats.
@RandPaul Turning pressurised airliners at 38.000 feet into the Wild West is incredibly stupid. I'm sure airline pilots will believe so.
@RandPaul I like the sound of this @realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk
@RandPaul wasn't this a big idea in 2002? Wasn't it decided then that it was unsafe for pilots, who are humans and can screw up to have guns
@RandPaul Give guns guns. Help the legal guns protect themselves from being bought and sold on the black market. It's the right thing to do.
.@RandPaul you do know what happens when you shoot a gun on a plane, right?
@Ethan_Booker @RandPaul "Awesome hijinks! I saw Spy! Well, my wife made me." Rand, presumably.
Shouldn't the pilots be busy flying the damn plane? @RandPaul
.@RandPaul why don't we ,make thee whole plane out of gunns
@RandPaul who would fly the plane during this wild west saloon in the sky shootout?
.@RandPaul what could go wrong?

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germanwings-crash-black-box-confirms-andreas-lubitz-deliberately-crashed-plane-10153991.html …
@RandPaul Just pass a law that let's everyone carry pocket knives on planes. Solves the issue better.
@randpaul give them ninja stars
