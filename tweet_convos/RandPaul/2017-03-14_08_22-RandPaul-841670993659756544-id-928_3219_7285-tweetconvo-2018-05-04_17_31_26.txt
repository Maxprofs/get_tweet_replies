hi
@CMM123 @DailySignal OH and BTW!  The legislature and the executive branches need to ABOLISH the 9th & 4th circuit judges!
You can do so much better than just repeal. That is the lazy and boring way out of national problem. Be open and be creative.
You were saying....
don't replace it. Just repeal it.
We gave GOP The House, Senate, AND Presidency
If refuse 2 lift healthcare tax now, they will never lift it
@RandPaul
We Must Keep Our Promise to Fully Repeal Obamacare http://bit.ly/2njdStk 
Everyone supports full repeal of Obamacare, it's already passed.
Win w/ the repeal, then sell replace
@realdDonaldTrump @StephenBannon #MAGA
Repeal Obamacare immediately,then take our time make sure we get healthcare reform right

NO NO
NO REFORM-NO REPLACE
Let INS CO operate across State lines creating compatison
Then GET Fed GOV out of HEALTH CARE
@hectormorenco @DailySignal 

Get rid of ryan
We have the program, no cost to state and all that u and ur friends are seekiing. read them and call me we can do it all
I think Ryan is a paid person by the pharma industry. Like his wife was. It is called prostitu....
@LouDobbs @seanhannity check out Dr's in Kansas they have something that is working and has been working!! Co Op company!!
Can you explain more about KS Docs? I'd love to see what you're talking about!
Sean has interviewed Dr's from Kansas you'd have to research it! He has them on all the time
no links? Cmon now.
you don't want to search! Quit being LAZY!
good idea, rotten execution. shot yourself and us in the foot. Now its your problem. better find a solution b4 its too late
@SmoochPanda you had 8 yrs.. what's the delay you thought #JebBush or #EvanMcMullin would be the President..
We were promised Full repeal, we awarded the house, the senate and the executive. Anything short makes no sense. No excuses
May ALL true Republican nonRINOs rise up and Repeal & Replace Ryan as Leader ASAP otherwise our country will NOT move forward!
@biperpich561 @RandPaul We need to burn up phones to #Congress demanding he step down...we don't trust him.. tweet Ryan #GO!
I emailed u several emails that explain my groups investigation into the pending ACA and I hope u read the emails
Sorry. Meant to say too many conservatives'll stop the current idiotic bill.
We cannot get everything the way we want. We needed to compromise.
yes completely repeal Obamacare care!no more excuses!
@SRGullickson @DailySignal: More #fakepolitics by Ryan. REPEAL #Obamacare & do real world things to make #healthcare affordable.
ONLY IF YOU PROVIDE SAME COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE! We want what you have from the government! No exceptions, no excuses or bye bye!
then do your job Rand instead of whining & complaining about this RINO Plan.Find a solution; be a mission thinker
Rand has a plan that already passed but Obama vetoed. Now we need Paul Ryan to move the bill along again.
They never any intention of making good on the items they threw in that bill.. bunch of hucksters
Agree 100%. It's a, if not THE, major reason President Trump is in the White House. Crypto-Democrat Ryan needs to go.
didn't happen, won't happen. Now what?
Everyone in government should be on same health care plan as we are not free rides
All money save can give American free health care
Rep Brady is all Chamber and a past Chamber agent and employee and no one should be listening to Rep Brady.
@CMM123 @DailySignal Ya'll can get this done!  This is YOUR chance!!!
No we need repeal and replace as our Americans who are in need of Healthcare cannot be left without healthcare for long.
the chamber of commerce has all of DC following them in everything and all they cant is socialistic medicine in the US
Only IF the "RINO" party wants 2 retain its majority! I doubt they'll be able 2 manage it. Too many real conservatives'll stop it.
@CMM123 @DailySignal Please do!  Show unification at all costs and debate behind closed doors!  Show NO WEAKNESS to liberals!!!
I think Paul Ryan is trumps enemy! I hope u, and trump work together on this! It needs to be taken away for Ryan and handed to u!
@biperpich561 @RandPaul We don't call him #Traitor Ryan for no reason....
Dems will win congress back if GOP passes Rinocare. They ran on REPEAL of Obamacare, not modification.
Dems'll win Congress back no matter what u Repugnican thieves do. U really think we'll let u destroy our country 4 $$?
Guess you forgot to vote.
Not that it's any of your business, but, no, I did not forget to vote. R u happy with the outcome?
Love you Sen. Paul  thank you for standing strong We trust you We the people do not trust Soros shill @SpeakerRyan #DumpRyan
@SRGullickson @DailySignal Drop the 14.6 M refuvees & theyll go home & well ha e Billion$ to build that wall!
YES but it must be done on MY plan..MINE MINE MINE MINE RYANCARE
@SpeakerRyan 
becuz cheeseheads re-elect me
yes you would repeal but I'm not happy about replacing it. @nomoresocialprograms
: Totally repeal Obama Care. It was designed to end up a One Payer system, as is Ryan's.

And w/o "automatically enrolled" methods of Statists like @SpeakerRyan, equivalent to mandate on States! #teaparty
POTUS Don't trust Ryan!
@2braptuedbyJC77 yep!
Every civilised country should have a national health service.
Fully agree, not politcally expedient.That is what won the election for @POTUS to do the PPLs will @SpeakerRyan out of touch w/PPL
**SMARTEST THING THEYVE SAID IN DAYS**
@JBaker31826004 @DailySignal 

Then start with
Repealing
Ryan

His heart belongs
To OBAMA
we want full repeal not #ryancare from RINO @SpeakerRyan
It's called #Trumpcare.  The Great Orange Landlord is holding rallies to support it.
Already, Trump's promises are unraveling and with him the entire Right. Truth Bias. Jobs for robots do not cut it.
You're going to have to do something without letting that Paul Ryan plan to go through.
get it together Rand Paul, you greatly lost against Trump in primaries, DO NOT STICK US WITH OBAMACARE!!!
I stand strong with Rand Paul on health care
@RandPaul is one of only a handful in congress I trust. @SpeakerRyan is one of the many I don't trust. Trump must sort it all out. Fast!
Maybe they're all too busy screwing interns because they have too much time off of work? Keep up the good fight Rand!
@LouDobbs Keep your Promises!
You're not fooling anyone. We know you're a true puppet.
your plan makes no sense Keep Obama care and make additional changes to continue to improve it
because screwing people is the most important thing, right?
@Julie4Trump Ryan must go
Keep pluggn Rand. Only a doctor can fix this
@MaryAKoontz @DailySignal keeping fighting Rand..we are standing with you..
@LouDobbs @DailySignal YOU'RE FIRED
one more thing to remember
We trust Rand, not Ryan.
@FreedomWorks @DailySignal Go get-em Paul
by that I mean RandPaul
Why? Works great for me and millions of others, and is better than nothing -- which is what repubs have done for care
I hope you make some major changes concerning substance abuse and mental health services. Don't cut payment for these
Senator, could U & Ryan get together & get this health care straightened up or you'll both need a job in 2018!
Yes. Full repeal now
@LouDobbs Abdoluely, I for one want to see it totally repealed and replaced.
I would like to know one thing about the new health care. Will Congress be mandated to be covered by it or not.
@Lrihendry @DailySignal Enough already...U MUST ALL STICK TOGETHER
Ins brokers and agents know what they need in a policy to sell it. Competitive value ins policy with good commission structure.
Sometimes the upstairs exceutives are very smart about overall operations.The brokers and agents in the field know what will sell
McCain went nutty on you today...Is he alright? Because...wow!
WENT??
John McCain BEEN NUTTY 

@Amyloukingery @RandPaul
i agree.

Stop BS'ing America and, Just do it!
Repeal. The federal gov't has no constitutional authority to get involved in our health care.
Keep the heat on. Ryan's alternative is not what we want. It is not why we voted Republican.
Replacement would be nice but repeal is mandatory. Our Nation can not afford this.
@LouDobbs If NOcare's replacement has to be improved over time, Rand Paul's initial proposal is a much better start.
That's what us Conservatives voted for Congress to do!  Nothing short of that is acceptable and we shall remember if you don't!
@JTS_1957 Heck yea! @SpeakerRyan
@BossyCowgurl84 Yeah...y'all better.
Thank You Mr Paul!! 

then repeal the goddamned Obamacare bill and do your f#cking job before we find someone else to do it for you!!!
except he is. Perhaps the only member of the GOP working on a workable replacement
I wonder what compromising photos TPTB have on Ryan ?
...
I have lost faith in all RHINOs and Ryan leads the pack. Libertarian is the only way. Too many corrupt Dems too.
@truth_pray I've not always agreed with your positions on issues but on this one I'm with you 100%! 
start all over again healthcare bill not accepted Ryan the traitor is trying to pass his own way
Can we have the bill read on the floor of congress before voting.  So we know what is in it BEFORE it is passed.
Get it done.  We need that integrity.  And do a great job talking about it to the nation.  We can't have it misrepresented.
@Lrihendry whose the psycho looking lady behind the globalist?
@Lrihendry @DailySignal no where in constitution of United States has promise healthcare #wethepeople
Yes you better!!
Go get Em @RandPaul #WeThePeople With you! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Need to have #RandPaul and Family for Dinner @WhiteHouse
That's what they said they were gonna do !
you are proving that the Republican congress isn't  up to the task and cannot get together on a key bill.  Letting Dems win again?
You are correct. Keep your promise. @POTUS  promised also. The hell with open borders Ryan.
hold their feet to the fire. Write congress & representstives
Just make sure you don't act stupidly. There can't be a "gap" & you can't just pitch what's not in the bill.
only if all 100 senators give up theirs!!! And the 435 congressional leaders give up theirs!!!  535 idiots 
We might need to do it in stages because of political realities.
@WillisShepherd @DailySignal Speaker Ryan and all Republicans, you let Americans down on this, we will show you the door 2018!
You also must keep promise to providing better option for the American people.
rand Paul - needs to go home and remember his coal miners are back to work, and stop whining like a two year old
how did he get voted in he is such a cry baby
AMEN! Thank God you are with us!
"If you like your teeth, you can keep your teeth"
Typical Republican Elites, they have ignored their promises  for over 40 yrs, time to clean house. E-mail your reps
You must also meet your moral obligation to provide for real access to affordable quality healthcare.#NoTrumpCare.
You can do it !!
let it fail just like the guy who created it
You plan will ensure that the GOP HOLD ON POWER WILL BE VERY SHORT LIVED. Check out how the other countries do it. No lobbyists?
then quit talking and start doing something
Ryan aint kept a promise in 8 yrs.Do the usa favor and step down.Get back to golf n meca with yo buddy bama. 
Senator please don't screw this up.
As long as I don't have to have it, and can remain uninsured, I'm good.
#DumpRyan
I am with you and the others that understand that Paul Ryan IS Not delivering the truth about His plan. To much PRIDE!
need to get it right to have insurence and not be able to use it worthless do right or do nothing you own it after
Yes we should, But we should never trust Paul Ryan, He is Obama's Trojan Horse Leftover. & Paid by Soros.
Rand Paul plan best choice. Wake up Congress!!!!!!!!!

And keep a watch on Paul Ryan!  Not trustworthy
#DoYourJob No more waiting! Stop talking about the bad and make it #GOOD Work with @SpeakerRyan to make #RyanCare better now!
@World4Trump @DailySignal You are going to have to stand up to Ryan and convince President Trump that he is not to be trusted!
will you fully repeal @SpeakerRyan as well?
work together, make it better. How about we get your benefits?
Paul Ryan took money from HRC his asshole needs to go ! No healthcare bill!
@Erosunique u should be speaker
I'm with Senator Paul!
Those who don't keep this promise will be voted out!
WHY is Ryan trying to keep Obo's ACA ?
Does it have anything to do with something he promised Obama ?
I smell a RAT hiding as RINO
@LouDobbs #Trumpcare
You guys cried for 8 years about the ACA but never had a plan. You have your chance but you've already screwed it up!
Seems like things were better the way they were before Obamacare...
@NetworksManager Agreed.
@PrimmSherryrp Tell Spkr we don't want RinoRyanCare#repealreplace#termlimits#draintheswamp
Yes! Exactly!
This isn't a GAME Senator~millions of people RELY on you guys to do the right thing! Stop playing politics~ppl are hurting
Paul Ryan i don't trust you at all your like a snake . Your setting Our President to Fail  . Get Out
hold the line on Repealing and Replacing Obamacare!
the fix is simple. It's called the public option
No Paul Ryan your supposed to do what's best for the American people. This plan is NOT good.
#RepealRyan
can we please fire Paul RINO Ryan?
, yes, but a great plan, work together and fight for the people, quit being idiots and selfish
and stay out of our business! #repealobamacare
Repeal all government involvement in health care leave it to the states
I'm behind you senator Rand Paul!
So figure out how to integrate your ideas with what is on the table - we can not afford Republican in fighting!
@texmexranch @DailySignal Promise was repeal Obamacare & simultaneously replace it so that everybody can afford healthcare.
Any way to encourage Paul Ryan to retire?
Yes let's Make America sick again
Ryan doesn't want 2 give up government controlled healthcare, he's still trying to get over Hillary losing the election.
you have no heart. Looser.
repeal yes replace no. Force drug companies to sell drugs to Americans for the same price they sell in other countries.
@WilliamSteedley @DailySignal 
Republicans get it done The Control in House Senate dont blow it we Voted Trump in Expect Results
@WilliamSteedley @DailySignal
This has to be done in his 1st 100 days Help make it HAPPEN ..PLEASE..You have the Power Do it
@WilliamSteedley @DailySignal 
Need to back our PRESIDENT 1st Tell Ryan where  to go Need HEALTHCARE 2 go thruSting Tax Cuts
TrumpSupporter agreeing w/ you.
Having worked in Corp., SmallBus, & Govt., allow FreeEnterpr 2 resolve GovtHealthCare
@SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump   Have been on the train since day 1 and I  agree Sen Paul
@LouDobbs @DailySignal #Repeal @SpeakerRyan Get him gone.
@NetworksManager  Agree.
Some were helped by Obamacare & I worry for them, but for me a some others I know, Obamacare is quite painful.
Appears GOP concept too weak to fly. Senate must pull out a winner//
Don't forget YOUR POOR, in and underinsured people of Kentucky!
yes sir.. 
However that is not what you intend to do
FULLY REPEAL TRUMPCARE. BARBARIC DESTRUCTION OF USA HEALTH
you can tell when someone has not came up with the idea themselves and just regurgitates what they hear. So sad
start by getting Ryan the hell out of the speakers job. Damn chicken s--t traitor.
PAUL RYAN DID NOT ENDORSE TRUMP, WHAT A FOOL!!!
PROMISE TO SLAUGHTER USA CITIZENS
you will have to explain that to me.
Yes. Do it. Whatever it takes.
we must replace at the same time to keep some kind of continuity for people
Keep Ryan honest Rand
@newtgingrich Just do 100% best bill w/ buying insur across state lines etc, let Dems vote it down, THEN use reconciliation
Add to the plan, politicians and gov workers must use this plan instead of the plan they have. The new HC plan will have a whole new look.
