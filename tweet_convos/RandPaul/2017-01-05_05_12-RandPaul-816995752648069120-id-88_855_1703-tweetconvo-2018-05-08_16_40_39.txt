Hopefully the Pentagon and DFAS next?
a guy can dream
@DeMarshDuncan 
Its True Congress has NO good reason to not swiftly pass this Bill but Libs will make Theirs the new Party of NO
Glad to see you at least realize Rs were the Party of No. Don't complain when it comes back to bite you.
I do? Mmm where was I? I do know when Dems hold Majority of Sen including Senate Lead....
I Lso know Dems like name call...
You always send DMs to comment back? You have freedom of speech. Use it in public.
Please support Jeff Sessions for Attorney General.#ConfirmSessions
end the Federal Reserve. Reinstate the U.S. Mint and Gold Standard. Open the mines
By fed, he means what? Not sarcasm, does anyone really know?
Interesting,.. and who would watch the foxes watching the hen house? http://reason.com/blog/2016/05/06/rand-paul-will-endorse-donald-trump-the …
@Rep_Of_NoFear @Rare 
I hope so!
@alllibertynews @Rare FED is doing what they R 'posed 2 do! Try Audit, U will see what happens - Political suicide !
I hope all your bills are obstructed !  You are not a team player.   News Flash -  YOU LOST!
his time is coming. Hide and watch
Please hold your breath while you wait!
looks like I won't have to, lol :)
the fed should be independent from partisan politics. This bill allows congress to have direct oversight of the most important /2
the senators claims that the federal reserve acts in secret are completely unfounded and his bill is just a political ploy to
continue undermining our American economic institutions just like his father.
Please let this happen, please let this happen, please...
@HMFWIC @Rare 
You do realize-if the truth comes out all hell will break loose
at this point, I'm past due ready for some Hell raisin'.
Kinda busted up, but I'm good for one more.
@alllibertynews How about "audit corporate welfare payments"?  Why not start where a large chunk of our tax dollars go?
@louisvillemayor 

The Federal Reserve Note is simply an imposter. Back US Treasury Dollars with Gold.

Thank you for re-introducing this bill!
Not going to happen Rand, secrets are too dark. US Treasury ESF in collusion w Fed now controls mkts #BanksRDigitalSlaughterHouses
End the Fed+replace it with a resource based economy that ends monopolies 1,industrial hemp to replace fossil fuels,clean water
I like what you're seeing, boss.
Not gonna happen, though.
[appropriate Pepe insert]
@MLebarno @Rare   YES YES YES!!!!
@anti_globalists  Hey Congress let's get to it, do it no STALLING
No
What people? Most have no idea what the Feds even do. It's just a politician talking point, with all due respect.
This and Term limits both need to be enacted.  #AuditTheFed
come at them with facts
Show them what the outcome would be without the fed an IRS
I agree with you.
, American people demanded unwise changes in Nov vote. Fed audit bill will only politicize money supply as now affects SCOTUS.
All of you and @realDonaldTrump need to contact Reagan's top agent about this @eagleonetowanta
the #AuditTheFed bill doesn't create more transparency but instead opens up an economic institution to blatant political pressure.
#AuditTheFed What a GREAT IDEA! @MyMittie @sidbickley
@BillFrezza @Rare To bad your BFF, McConnell, won't let it come to a vote.
No one knows what audit the Fed means
The excuse: If Toto pulls back the curtain, the people might catch on to fact that the Fed is a fake.  Then what?
Way to go gentlemen. This is long over due.
have a meeting w Trump. He appears to have an open mind. Time will tell...
hope congress agrees
truth is I trust the professionals at the Fed more than the politicians in Congress
The Fed is a criminal enterprise that has been given limitless power w zero oversight except by shadow govt that runs everything
I support your bill go
@SenShelby most definitely needs to be done.
You need to indict the leaders of the Fed for treason.  100 years of manipulating the economy and making poor people is enough.
Come on now. Trump won't #AuditTheFed. Look at his cabinet full of Wall St insiders. Do you think they want the fed audited?
#AuditTheFed. #StandWithRand
You should be careful, days after JFK announced his plan for the Fed, he could not go though with it.
.@RandPaul @Rare Don't let colleagues off hook for 1st vote doing away with ethics Cmte-they seem 2 have short memories-bad sign
desperately needed if there is any chance of correcting the course of "Titanic" American Federal Government #conventionofstates
kind of cute how you're talking about the FED but not the Pentagon, they paying you now too Paul?
can we audit the PEOTUS?
Audit!  Someone should be accountable.
The unfortunate thing is, once you look down that rabbit hole you will find our economy is a house of Cards. #Collapse
Drain The Swamp
Accountability in our government is very important.
@DaveBartonUSA @Rare @realDonaldTrump show us your TAXES
It will likely take more than Auditors to Audit the Fed. It'll take scores of Justice Department folks to follow the trails.
Volcker audited the UN in 2004. Found fraud waste nepotism incompetence bribery: Not one Senator said anything. Audit FED??
Do it' fulfill a dream of your father. @RonPaul
In time I think you and Trump are going to find each other... You're both looking for the same thing, different paths...
.....He realized the  Rothschilds' maxim: "Let us control the money of a country and we care not who makes its laws."
....William Pitt: "Let the American people go into their debt-funding...their boasted independence will be a mere phantom."
T. C. Daniel before the Congress in 1911 (whether financiers were restricting trade by domination of the money supply) said:
Catch the thieves Rand.Send em all straight to prison
We would also like for every elected official at every level to receive an IRS audit every year, made public to voters.
Rename #AuditTheFed as #FeedNoTheFed .
Audit the Fed right into the Potomac.
@realDonaldTrump  It would be THE greatest accomplishment in 200+ years
keep up the good work!

You misspelled abolish.
#EndTheFed #StillRanding
Thanks Sens! You two are the Obi Wan to our country's Leia. #onlyhope
About time! Nice job, Congressman.
Great Idea they have been doing just what they want and we the people have been ignored please support the audit
