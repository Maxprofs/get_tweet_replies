@rcpvideo 
What do you call putting Trump before country?
She didn't lie to Congress and you know it.
Stop being a Trump
You're right. She lied to Congress AND the American people.
@alllibertynews @matahin @RandPaul @rcpvideo betrayed not only the public trust but the national trust
All of her "lies" are not proven. And you supprting a proven liar and cheater
I have to bring into question what your idea of proof is. History IS proof.
History of allegations is not prove.
Trump is a proven liar and cheater
Are you reading from the script you were provided with?
You are good at a cussing people of things. Just like Trump
:)
I like you Rand but if this is true why isn't anyone doing anything?  Are republicans all talk?
trumps that the six months ago on Hannity that he will prosecute when he becomes president
not voting him regardless he talks out both sides of his mouth.
no he does not you're just not use 2 DT not being politically correct! And he doesn't lie wait until the debate
trump doesn't even want to be president. He even said one guy could be ahead of foreign and domestic affairs.
what exactly would Trump be doing then?
trump cutting middle tax  stop way spending Close the borders get rid of Obama care which is killing us in jobs HC nothing
ACA is creating jobs...
@CatBollar why is it so hard for the other idiot senators and congressmen see the truth SHE BROKE THE LAW PERIOD Keep the faith
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @CatBollar BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE SECURITY CLEARENCE TO VIEW THE DOCUMENTS.
BUT HILLARYS LAWYERS DID???
it's amazing how many excuses they can use from doing what's right now we give Hillary another clearance to get briefings
Mr. Paul, you are greatness! You set the trap and she walked right into it. #ShesNotabovethelaw
well said!!
The list of patriots is far 2 long for a tweet, but I thank @GovChristie for being one of the 1rst to back #Trump
Agree...
.@RandPaul  Of *course* she lied. Here's hoping Karma gets busy real soon.
@rcpvideo what do you "intend" to do about it??
@rcpvideo @jasoninthehouse @JamesComeyFBI We know Comey her intent was not to get caught.
Oh but #TRump can lie all day long! LOL. This is why you are a loser for a loser.
Our elected reps do not demand government accountability strong enough. Make #FBI and #justicedept DO THEIR JOBS OR INDICT THEM!
@Eccentrie Then please, as law makers, please do the job we are paying you for.
@4joachim But when the Govn't is above the law. What are we to do?
yes,
so entrenched
what are we to do?
term limits would have helped yrs ago.
Let's give ALL gov employees soldier's pay
@jec678 @RandPaul
@akjc77 @rcpvideo but the FBI said they are. The FBI said anyone else would be charged, just she won't be.
@alllibertynews Randyville!
@alllibertynews @rcpvideo It should be a felony for Congress to lie to us, equal justice under the law and all.... Jus sayin
Then you best get on the #trumptrain before it's too late and we are forced to hear clinton lies forever once she selects judge
@EntheosShines Then I liked to know why she is still campaigning & not facing a trial right now????
@GregScheinert  Hillary Clinton is an international criminal.  Take her down.
@alllibertynews @rcpvideo Oh really now. So why are Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and last but not least C Rice NOT ALL LOCKED UP.
So do something about it. Congress should ACT unless POTUS/CLINTON blackmailed each one on both sides. Such a spineless congress!
What difference does it make, if @TheJusticeDept is corrupt as hell & AG Lynch excuses it!
Someone needs to file charges that stick, with Obama's corruption, Hillary remains protected.
@GregScheinert maybe it should also be a felony for Congress to lie to us?
Thank you
.@randpaul .@alllibertynews It's NOT our 'De Jure' Congress! QUO WARRANTO!? http://teamlawforum.net/viewtopic.php 
@Trumparama it will be worse if she is POTUS!
prove it. Actually do something for a change or shut up.
Kind of funny that it's a felony to lie to a group of career politicians (i.e. professional liars)
and the stupid that vote 4 her is so disgusting
@rcpvideo #LockHerUp
too bad no one in congress has BALLS Rand
@HopeReeder @rcpvideo @wisgop @VA_GOP @PAGOP #Florida #Ohio #PA #IN #VA #TX #CA #NC #MI #SC #KY #MO #LA #CO.
@alllibertynews Screw congress,she lied to the American people.it's an insult. that's all you've got on her,with all she's done
they are above the law, look at what they get away with, and with the help of Obama and lynch
it all really went to hell after clapper lied w/impunity. as soon as anyone gets away with it the floodgates are open. #wittingly
@Italians4Trump What is the plain then just to call her back and ask questions with not out coming result?
@BigDuhie1955 IS there ANYTHING hilLIAR HASN'T LIED ABOUT?
Actually, no one is above the law.  Don't ever let someone get away with saying anyone is. Apply the law equally!
right...
@Italians4Trump @rcpvideo WELL DO SOMETHING THAT'S WHY WE ELECTED YOU PEOPLE!!!
@Al_Baldasaro @rcpvideo next step please, grand jury
@Italians4Trump what is the penalty for perjury in front of Congress?
The Republican establishment can and does as they salute #HeilClinton!
How convenient the crooked FBI didn't record or put her under oath when they had her.
TIME 2 HOLD CLINTON'S ACCOUNTABLE 
starting byforced removal as a presidential candidate and a prompt trial started on her TREASON @RandPaul
@TBK1955 #StandAndDeliver ! #RAND ! who told you to #StandDown to @realDonaldTrump ? You are both #Patriots right?
@rcpvideo   Then do something, Rand Paul.  If anyone can have her pay for her Treasonous actions right now , you can. #lockherup.
So a life sentence
@lor65 please get her
GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS...ALL 
We the People disgusted with GOP for funding BHO's/Killary's treasonous activity for 8yrs & doing nothing! Spineless @johncitysq
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @johncitysq She has been lining her own pockets for decades, not just 8 yrs. Disgusting nonetheless
Then do something about it thats why you are there
finally. someone with cajones.
Thank you
@terryk333 Yet FBI director said move on
Millions of Americans are behind Donald Trump and Dr. Rand Paul. What are we waiting for before applying Federal law !
@rcpvideo.   Lock them up
@JayS2629 Panetta complicit with Clinton now tells us to move on.  More reason to question these bozo's!
@breeze_call Then by all means Rand...press some charges. Let's get on with it.
@alllibertynews if it is against the law have her ass arrested
there is no evidence that she lied to congress, most of those GOP in congress are crooked idiots themselves.
“@RandPaul: It’s a felony to lie to Congress...Scranton PA http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/08/12/rand_paul_cia_annex_in_benghazi_shipped_arms_from_libya_to_syria.html …”
Lying Democrats laugh at toothless Congress
@Fuhrious520 We can't say it but the press and liberals seem quite comfortable with it! Don't be a sheep or low info voters! Watch

@RandPaul @mypaplumber
.@jasoninthehouse: Did Hillary Clinton give non-cleared people access to classified info?

Comey: Yes
We hear this over and over - no actions are taken - it's empty
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @rcpvideo ..yes Sen Paul, like the interview but put some action behind those words!!
OMG Senator I love you for saying that..
@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP
IMPEACH @LorettaLynch @JamesComeyFBI @BarackObama NOW
@Pax1sw @rcpvideo who will bring the charges? Will you Rand Paul? Or just more empty rhetoric?
Congressional hearings out th wazoo, by golly! We need MORE bread & circuses. Someone might even fiddle.
@JONEEFRY but yet you are letting the Clinton's Above the Law! DO something !
@RantReaper She is NOT alone sir, she's protected because others are complicit. Maybe John McCain & Lindsey Graham should be ?'d..
Congress should file charges against her.
@rcpvideo Take it up w/MSM, see if you can change the conversation& perhaps you can end Hillary's1 way conversation w/America.
thank you Dr Rand Paul for speaking out
Five years is not nearly long enough for Killary & Bill Clinton  https://youtu.be/pUNJRV1IkvA  @RandPaul
@rcpvideo We all already know that Killary lied and heroes died. BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR IS GOING TO BE DONE. Throw Obama in too!
@veganvecoh @rcpvideo I am liking you more and more go get this evil killary.
@reg1776 @rcpvideo Five years is not enough! Clintons have murdered a young man w DNC he was to testifythey deserve life in Prison
We have ZERO faith in any of you on that hill at this point. All you politicians do is bullshit us. You blew the super majority.
@hectormorenco @rcpvideo So what are you going to do about it? Vote Trump
wish more elected officials felt like you sir
he has worked entire life for fair government for the people would have been in president race if not put on sec stage debate
A voice of reason Rand Paul is well aware that clinton foundation needs to be investigated he will not stand for corruption gov
You are a big lyer you lie every day
@RandPaul @Buildthewallcha
@EversFam They sure seem to be. What are we doing about it?
@USAHipster @rcpvideo then do something Rand.
why we have to clean house across the board - collusion is deep between the parties especially elites #TrumpPence16 
Who the hell is saying? Not us.
@rcpvideo 
The CIA Annex was in Benghazi for one purpose ! Move the stinger missiles to Turkey.
Told to do so by Hillary. Illegal.
on Fox news = a liar on a network that plays a news outlet on TV @rcpvideo @mycn2
that was my thought...where are our Senators? They need to do something about this administration
Excellent Presidential candidate
Yes, but.   Who's going to enforce the LAW?
:
So far Congress Committee hasn't been able to charge Hillary for any crimes so far. She can't be that smart to avoid prosecution
@rcpvideo if the DOJ won't pursue charges we don't have many other options
@angelena4Cs @rcpvideo oh....ok...then arrest her already then.....wtf you waiting on...all you politicians do is talk no action
@rcpvideo
You have to start getting mean and nasty, or else this isn't going anywhere.
Or perhaps that is what you really want?
FBI didn't swear HRC in so she lie an talk around in circles  just like she did in congress but she was under oath then
where these weapons used to kill our ambassador and seals no wonder she didn't want to answer calls for help
I will support you as President in four years. I am voting for Trump this time around.
what has NATO accomplish ?
@rcpvideo #hillaryforprison
when does it end MrPaul ? It hurts my heart this lawlessness  it  is not the way we grew up so sad to see it.  all the way to WH
@rcpvideo Randolph Bourne Instt shows http://bit.ly/2beib2L  ISIS re-energized by Libyan arms caches, flown via Turkey.
was Libyan invasion a front to boost ISIS? Can Hillary be questioned by Congress again?
so then why the hell isn't somebody in congress doing something about it?  Can you please answer that question?
@KamVTV Its simple stop talking and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Americans are tired of hearing what needs to be done. We need action.
@rcpvideo The moving of weapons to Syria is well documented.Shipments via Benghazi noted,on that fateful night.Reason 4 the deaths
Based on vague assertion by 3rd party that HRC "may" have lied, you think she deserves prison time w/o there having been a trial?
@darkvoid1794 so glad you cannot be elected.
thanks for asking if I'm dumb.  I don't think so.  We just have a different opinion.  Name calling is not for me.
Rand, it is a felony to do ANYTHING
What's pathetic is that these activities by the Clintons are never prosecuted!!  PATHETIC!!!
Singing a different tune now? #lockherup #CrookedHillary #MAGA  #ImpeachObama #PrayforIsrael #PrayforUSA
@rcpvideo @NeilTurner_ @realDonaldTrump @MikeBates

@freethnker2 @rcpvideo What's laws is the media breaking outright lying to the public? FCC is ignoring the complaints!
I BEG YOU TO GET HER PROSECUTED. YOU NEED TO BE THE ONE TO SAVE AMERICANS FROM HER. PLEASE HELP US!!!
Afraid to be seen as politically incorrect? Then there's the corrupt among them, all of which seem to be Dems?
@DMashak @rcpvideo I believe all the executive, legislative, judicial branch's are above. The constitutional rule of law is dead
...Senator Rand, on the other side of the coin, is it a Felony when Congress lies to us? Just sayin' ... it happens.
You can if you own the DOJ and are beyond prosecution!

When are the Klintons going to be held accountable?
Better do it soon... The democrats will need a replacement.
Could be Bernies' in!
BUT it's NOT going to happen!
He makes the establishment poop in their pants!
@spradlinok @rcpvideo Indict them!!
Thank you! Proud to call you MY Senator!
He and @tedcruz are a model for Republican leadership.
Sorry - @tedcruz behavior ruled him out for me.
@joybellesshadow Amen!!  Mr. Paul, you hit that nail on the head!
That is why the attack happened , to cover up prove of her gun running.
Need to get a lawyer outside of congress. Dems lie to much and get a free pass. She cannot be the President she is corrupt
What Org needs 'our funding' to initiate multiple suits against individuals & specific Federal Departments?

Cite Details Pls.
republicans lie constantly. You'll have to join another party if you want anyone with an IQ above 12 to believe you.
While, here in GB, lying to Parliament is cheered & admired by our lazy, greed–obsessed #polisites.
@alllibertynews At what point does deliberate MSM, DNC troll truth dissembling become complicity in a crime?
WHY didn't Trey bring the hammer down on Hillary? Is he protecting Boehner? TAKE SOMEONE DOWN & YOU'LL BE RE-ELECTED
@PJStrikeForce @rcpvideo Martha lied to FBI-SAME MAN @HillaryClinton lied to @realDonaldTrump @NeilTurner_
@ccpicciano @rcpvideo someone do something
yes, anyone
The MUSLIM Sissy Service, I mean #Secretservice , should tell the #FBImWithHer Director Cummy and Loretta,    to get a job.
I re-tweeted this story years ago.  Nobody believed it.
I mean clearly we *can* because that's what we *did*. Sad.
So do something besides talk!
oh but they are proving it and journalism is dead in the US of A.
so what are you gonna do about it then? cc @PJStrikeForce
@PolitiBunny and your point?  What’s going to be done about it?  Probably nothing because politically not a good move…just sayin
Hillucifer isn't losing any sleep
Sen.Rand Paul says that Hillary Clinton deserves five years in prison for lying to Congress, He Should Know He Lies@@
So, drop all accusations and let's have peaceful transition of power. All this accusation would have made sense b4 primaries
For now , If anything like indictment happens to Hillary, it ll be seen as making Trump win. Vise versa. Do you agree ?
@rcpvideo The Clintons are above the law.
@majorgarrett69 So are you going to charge her for perjury?  Ball is in your court....
you are exactly right. Why won't people wake up
@tonyzump To establish the ISIS?
@rcpvideo 
Republicans: all talk no action!
She  under influence Psychotronic Should never been appointed @evidenceofharm @berkeleyprc
we do need to hold the Clintons accountable.
Rand, you should get off your high horse.  Everyone knows all politicians lie all the time including you. Stop deceiving yourself.
Were you this concerned w/ Bush, Cheney & Rice for lying to congress & starting a war...what is that death toll
@rcpvideo how can we get action? That's one of the reasons so many if us are on the #TRUMPTRAIN. Sent folks to DC  got no action.
@stopcollusion @rcpvideo this is the most corrupt government I have seen in my whole life time
@ronanmanly you all piss in the same pot unfortunately
agreed she shud b in jail with her criminal activity
If @realDonaldTrump drops out, any chance you'll replace him?
@Theoxiphos @rcpvideo Sen Paul if nothing else this is 1 item I think you & #Trump could collaborate:CORRUPTION of HC/AG/DOJ/FBI !
Bill put the FIX in with visit to Lynch, 4 days later it goes away, and no foundation investigation, it is exactly like it looks!!
Add another to the clinton bodycount?
http://yournewswire.com/man-who-leaked-clintons-medical-records-found-dead/ …
@rcpvideo 
Rand, save us.  Get behind Gary Johnson.  There's too much at stake.
This is serious folks! We need to be proactive and voice our rage! Indict her, try her and prosecute her and if guilty lock her up
