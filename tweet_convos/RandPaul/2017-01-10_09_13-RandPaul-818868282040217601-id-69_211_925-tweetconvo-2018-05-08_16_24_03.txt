I agree w/u on this, but hope we dont leave ACA in place bcuz of party infighting. There should've been a plan already!
Several R's have plans.  If Lee/Cruz/Sasse are on board with how GOP is handling this Rand is playing spoiler
If they have plan, why havent they put 2gether enuf votes yet? It sounds squishy to me, & Im on their side!
Enough votes on what?
I know Trump is single-payer, but if Congress passes Repeal & he won't sign his goose is cooked.
They can end Ocare w/ 51 votes via reconciliation in budget process but need 60 votes for replacement.
Nobody is going to repeal Ocare tomorrow and have it disappear tomorrow; they repeal w/firm sunset date.
That gives them leverage to get 60 votes for replacement & is what @RandPaul is apparently missing. @BretBaier
also would like to suggest splitting Medicaid. Make it social security - elderly, Medicaid - disabled unable to  1/2
Don't understand your statement; Medicaid is for the poor; Medicare is for the elderly.
my problem with Medicaid is that people are living off of it. meant to help get back on feet not lifestyle
also congress seems to repeatedly take from the elderly who worked to give to those who don't want to.
Some of people on Medicaid are low income working people; they have the hardest lost. I salute the >>
>the person who for whatever reason cannot really earn a living wage & yet works hard. >
I agree with you on that person. I know a person like that. Unfortunately too many are the just live off
which is why I want the program looked at to be more supplemental and less live off of
Bret is on at 6pm ET, 5pm CT and 3pm PT. Or is he sitting in for @TuckerCarlson at 7pm ET?
Bret doing two hours this week.
Thanks.
BTW, @TuckerCarlson is now on at 9 & Martha is going to have a 7 show for 1st hundred days of Trump admin.
Right but not this week. I gotcha. Thanks.
please work with #drbencarson too. I liked a lot of his plan.
Why? Can't you find something better to do with your time?
No solution for those w/ Lyme. $14k/yr health ins. $16K/yr out of pocket for tx not covered, $7k tax deduction.

You mean your plan to replace ACA???
If your plan doesn't kill ACA "tax" penalty, then ANY Repeal & Replace will still be a mandated plan. We don't want it!
I was wondering what the details are. Thanks for sharing this info.
Single payer, pretty please?
Cough cough
don't need a replacement.  people can go out And get insurance like they did before Obamacare .
why do you GO on there?!
being an adult,setting the campaign aside & working for real solutions for the American people gives me American pride @BretBaier
I appreciate your ideas & desire to implement an improvement, but the discussed won't work well. 18 years experience
Take my ACA away and I'll be moving in with you to take care of me. I like breakfast promptly at 7am!
I want to know is it strictly private market based and will the real cost driver, tort reform, be addressed.
Repeal it first then worry about replacing #Obamacare! Bad policy must go! @RandPaul @BretBaier
will there be a link with furthur information to come?
Will watch
I hope it finds way to insure people without people having to pay increased premiums.
that's a dumb idea. You should tweet your ideas and then throw an exclamation in at the end like NICE! or NOT!
Hope you bring real free markets back into our healthcare instead of statist technocratic tinkering
why not do something to help America and instead of hurting it. For once
gov.t get out of our healthcare. Full repeal and pass law or just read constitution. Make illegal for gov to run h c.
And please don't Block me I'm a voter in your district. I just don't vote for you.
We r white-collar workers whose kids were never covered for dental & eye, till the last few years. Don't take that away
If everyone is "mandated" to have healthcare, why do we need county hospitals and fee waivers?  Just saying.
Dont. Fuck. This. Up.
I never had #Obamacare but I never had healthcare either. When I fall off my skateboard, am I fucked?
If Sasse/Cruz/Lee are on board with GOP plan Rand is playing spoiler. Several R's have replacement plans.

Congress can use budget reconciliation to repeal Obamacare. Here's how: 
I would...but have no TV.  Good luck on your plan.  I believe that you can pull off a good one!
Awesome. You are my favorite republican in the Senate
I hope you come up with a real better solution, not just an excuse claim!
http://4.Insurance  pools? We already have those - thanks
3.Let insurance companies sell the aforementioned crappy policies across state lines
2. Health savings accounts. People who can’t afford rent and food are going to save money for their healthcare?
1.Let insurance companies sell crappy policies that only cover catastrophic care at 80% - if you’re lucky
#Boycott the #inauguration of the USA dictator @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump @ResistanceParty
is there somewhere where I can read about your plan?
good luck with that.  I always thought you cared about us little guys. Oops
Very encouraging Senator!!
Doc, you absolutely NEED to be involved with this.
Rand, you would have a lot more credibility for doing an honorable thing if you stated this on a mainstream network.

I'm reading some of it now I hope it is a good plan
Forced participation in any health care system and a penalty tax for non-participation is unconstitutional.
care for selves, & temp aid, helps people get back on their feet, but is temporary as people can't live off of forever
