The announcement is going to be YUGE. Don't miss it...
Wow, many many people tell me the announcement is the best announcement anyone has ever seen. So much winning...
But today please help me with my EOQ moneybomb http://randpaul.com/donate . Deadline is midnight!
@RandPaul money for what??
@CurtisCal @RandPaul Senate re-election campaign
@RandPaul If it's Cruz or Trump I can no longer respect you are a serious fighter for liberty.
@RandPaul I hope it is for Ted Cruz? Rump will be a total disaster
@RandPaul @EddyElfenbein #RonPaul2016?
@RandPaul #ChooseCruz We would welcome your support.
@RandPaul @DLoesch Is "endorsement " a euphemism for penis? Is he going to pull down his pants & show everyone his weenie?
@RandPaul @DLoesch Feel the Bern?
@RandPaul There is only one Libertarian candidate in the Race, that is @GovGaryJohnson #VoteGaryJohnson #GaryJohnson2016 #3rdParty
@NMSportster @alllibertynews @RandPaul @GovGaryJohnson He hasn't won the nomination yet
@adlangston75 @alllibertynews @RandPaul @GovGaryJohnson He will :).
@NMSportster @alllibertynews @RandPaul @GovGaryJohnson I agree it is likely. At least LP@is on ballot in all 50 states needs 2 B in debates
@adlangston75 @alllibertynews @RandPaul @GovGaryJohnson Exactly right. Hopefully @MonmouthPoll keeps Johnson in Regular Polling!
@NMSportster @alllibertynews @RandPaul @GovGaryJohnson @MonmouthPoll he is polling nationally at 11% with limited coverage.
@RandPaul based on this tweet I'm sure it isn't any of the three Republican nominees.
@RandPaul It is going to be April Fools Day.
@RandPaul @la_mater are you going to have confetti?
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE @RandPaul is that ok?
@RandPaul @biglittlechris I will be holding my breath until then, said noone
@RandPaul I hope it's @AP4LP!!!  #NeverTrump Go #LibertarianParty!
@starlasworld It might also be Kasich
@liberrevolution I was thinking that- a waste IMO- we need him now badly! #AP4LP
@RandPaul please don't say ANYTHING on April Fools Day. It's too confusing.
@UndefinedTerm @RandPaul National inquirer has an even bigger scandal. Aliens r controlling Big Foot! #DEPORTBIGFOOT
@RandPaul ...preemptive April Fools endorsement of ?????
Pls don't give the trumpkins a  attack! LOL
@alllibertynews @RandPaul awe another trumpanzee troll account... How cute just an egg head with no followers
let's take a look at who the troll follows
@RandPaul Trump!!! Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
@RandPaul April Fools!
@RandPaul @GovGaryJohnson would seem to be more in line with the libertarian philosophy you espouse, but I'm guessing Cruz.
@RandPaul - for the love of America please DON'T let it be @realDonaldTrump!!!
@palmerp85 @alllibertynews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump it's ganna be #stillranding
@RandPaul @ItsKolbs who you think it's gonna be??
@trex121 @RandPaul I have no idea... What do you think?
@ItsKolbs @RandPaul as much as I would like to say @GovGaryJohnson, due to the libertarian ideas they represent. It'll most likely be Cruz.
@trex121 @RandPaul @GovGaryJohnson Think I'm gonna have to agree with you there
@ItsKolbs @RandPaul that might piss me off, considering how much I like Rand. However, it won't change my vote
@trex121 @RandPaul it would be unfortunate but not a deal breaker
@RandPaul trump
@RandPaul It better be #Trump
@RandPaul who cares
@RandPaul hey isn't this the guy who got bern by @BernieSanders ?
@RandPaul
@RandPaul @CateTX If you're a true conservative, there should be no question. If you're vying for a job, like Carson, I'll be disillusioned.
@RandPaul your joke sucks rand
@RandPaul I'll #vote for you!
@RandPaul @DLoesch You're pressuring KFC into keeping Nashville Hot Chicken?
@RandPaul why the bait?
@RandPaul @alllibertynews iF IT'S not Sen.Sanders , take the day off as your statement is Moot .
@RandPaul #ChooseCruz #TusTED @TedCruz
@RandPaul April fools? Or are you going to come out with and endorsement?
@RandPaul I hope you finally come out in support of @tedcruz !
@RandPaul Cruz!!
@RandPaul @JSMart97
@52849I @RandPaul you better be endorsing a libertarian party candidate or I'll be sad
@JSMart97 @RandPaul I actually would be okay with a sanders endorsement at this point.  Bipartisanship is neat
@52849I @RandPaul you can be bipartisan and not endorse the guy. For him to endorse a Democrat would be political suicide
@JOBoomr @RandPaul: But you follow his feed? Hmmm
@RandPaul  Cruz or Sanders?
@RandPaul #FeelTheBern ?
@RandPaul please be April fools joke. If it has to be anyone, 3rd party! You did say though that u would not endorse!
@RandPaul whoever he says he's going to say April fools at the end
@RandPaul @mariannecope Please don't endorse the Donald, I will lose all respect for you.
@projectmayhem78 it was an april fools joke :)
@RandPaul it's April fools day
@RandPaul tomorrow is April fools day.....
@RandPaul

@RandPaul We're listening.....
@RandPaul After watching Christie grovel, I hope its not DT. Just sayin.  I like you to much to see you put up with that.
@RandPaul April Fool's joke, right?
@RandPaul please say you are running 3rd party!!
@RandPaul Hahahaha I love you Rand! This is hilarious.
@RandPaul @Shaughn_A April Fools
@FoghornBLeghorn I was advised to check out his TL....dude has a pretty good sense of humor 
@RandPaul:I hope its G.Johnson RP! Otherwise anyone left on the GOP side would be highly disappointing and frankly, I'd lose some respect...
@RandPaul @BetheHuntington April Fool.
@RandPaul Rubio.
@RandPaul another looser
@bakeer59 @RandPaul #spellcheck #troll
@RandPaul you are getting a hair transplant????
@RandPaul He's obviously endorsing Gary Johnson
@RandPaul I have a ton of respect for you. please don't sell out like Carson did and totally endorse what you campaigned against.
@RandPaul Gary Johnson?
@RandPaul IF THERE IS A RIOT,HAPPENING SOMEWHERE EVERYDAY, WILL B A REASON FOR OBAMA TO CALL MARTIAL LAW! NEVER LEAVE OFC! EVER!!
@RandPaul @GovGaryJohnson or @AP4LP
@RandPaul Get back in the race!!
@RandPaul Bernie? You and he share similar ideology. Be revolutionary, endorse by policy, not party line
@RandPaul What? U had a testicle transplant and will now actually act like you want to win the next election
@RandPaul @GovGaryJohnson?
@RandPaul oh Goody smh
@RandPaul @JimmyPrinceton April fools day.
Who will @RandPaul endorse tomorrow? Hundreds of votes hang in the balance.
@RandPaul @peddoc63 you're getting gay married?
@RandPaul Like if you are prepared to unfollow if Rand endorses Creepy Cruz.
@RandPaul OMG, if you endorse the idiot, my remaining faith in humanity will forever be snuffed out
@RandPaul @JayS2629 Stand if its not for  TRUMP keep it to yourself
@RandPaul Who are you? Should I know you? Should I care?
@randpaul I doubt he endorses any of the current candidates.  I am hoping for a snarky #aprilfools joke like only he can.  #StandWithRand
@RandPaul Manlet.
@RandPaul waiting ....
@RandPaul I'm on the edge of my seat !!! NOT ! Bernie Sanders  ? If it's not Trump you've just picked a loser

@RandPaul This better not be a set up to some april fools joke..
@RandPaul if it's Ted Cruz...I'm through with you Dr Paul. #trump2016
@RandPaul if you pull for Trump, I'll know that @realDonaldTrump is paying for endorsements: 1st Dr.Carson then Dr.Paul. #ConstitutionMuch?

@RandPaul don'the tell me Rand, let me guess.  You're endorsing Ted Cruz right?
@RandPaul Choose wisely.
