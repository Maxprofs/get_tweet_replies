@theBTWprince @RandPaul "Booh hoo i blame wall street and the top 1% for everything"
@RandPaul @BettyeBear  That's already being done! Wonder if I'll get a refund this year? Oh no I don't have many kids to claim w/ no daddy!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders's highest marginal tax rate is same as great communist Ronald Reagan
@RandPaul It's not your #DemTownHall so shut your hole and pay your taxes and make sure all the people who sponsor you pay theirs too! Loser
@RandPaul  The tax rates on the rich have dropped incredibly low compared to say 50 years ago. Were taxed well over 60% and were still rich!
@Syl6716 @RandPaul dont brag how pathetic
@RandPaul @youngfreeboy AMEN
@RandPaul @freedomtex  @RandPaul  Would you ever consider being VP?
@RandPaul @alllibertynews The sentiment is appreciated & agree w/lower taxes, premise is flawed. We don't need the gov to take care of us.
@RandPaul obama has to take all what he doz
@RandPaul If U were serious about taking taking care of people you'd b checking on UR constituents n UR home state after the winter storm!
@RandPaul, Much rather pay 2.2% than the damned near 15% I pay now. Going broke to Aetna and I'm only 44. My insurance > my mortgage!
@RandPaul Yes, Senator, but what do you think of the new #XFiles?
@RandPaul Instead we'll bankrupt then with health care costs that result in crippling debt for middle class.
@RandPaul Amen
@RandPaul Even to lower all of our bills? That doesn't make much sense?#FeelTheBern #BernieSanders
@RandPaul Right, Dying a metaphorical death by taxes is way worse than LITERALLY DYING from lack of healthcare. Get a clue
@RandPaul @trutherbotruby what does it matter? No one has any money to tax
@Catballou @RandPaul oh snap!
@RandPaul ...then demand ur @gop stop allowing #ALEC to run state legislatures.
@RandPaul He's mostly talking about taxing the 1% tax scofflaws like you, Rand!
@RandPaul the electorate is smarter than you think it is. Nice try. We can math
@RandPaul Exactly.  The guy is nuts
@RandPaul Stop trying to win this. You are a sad, hopeless little man who won't see reason. You harm America.
@RandPaul You do realize that only people with $150k incomes are getting taxed more?
@RandPaul this coming from the guy who said the ACA was worse than slavery. No one cares what you have to say.
@RandPaul I agree with the concept, but we have nowhere near the highest tax rates
@RandPaul
@RandPaul and after death too!
@RandPaul  so Bernie just said if you work for an insurance co you are evil so vote for me so I can eliminate your job?
@RandPaul do you have another venue for getting the money to pay for your big fat military that repubs like so much?
@RandPaul Right on @RandPaul
@RandPaul #presidentsanders16 Im fine with paying more,lets go after wallstreet as well - i could use a bail out!!#DemTownHall #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul no let's let Corp America bleed them dry
@RandPaul you're right. Let's just tax the huge corporations that have been getting away with not paying their fair share for decades
@RandPaul If I am paying $10k to Blue Cross or $5k to govt, I care about the $5k vacation I can take now! Not taxing to death.Taxing 4 life!
@RandPaul tax rate was 0% under Reagan. Let us pray
@RandPaul it's a vicious circle....let the chaff go....
@RandPaul only the people who can afford it will be heavily taxed. Can you really argue a billionaire shouldn't pay substantial taxes?
@RandPaul I'm sorry you are insecure with the fact that your six figure salary makes you so much money, you get to throw in a little extra
@RandPaul 37th rated healthcare system has proven your insurance scam system very well. #GoHome
@RandPaul
@RandPaul how can anyone be opposed to people/corporations paying their fair share of taxes??
@RandPaul @noduhsebass rand pauls tax plan is the only one that puts us at a surplus get your facts from the source
@RandPaul I know you're not stupid. You can do the math Paul.
.@RandPaul We will always pay taxes and I much rather pay for healthcare for the country than two wars. I #FeelTheBern #WeAreBernie
@RandPaul If we are serious about taking care of the american people then please stop tweeting Dr. Paul.
Want smaller government @RandPaul? Quit.
@RandPaul Give them healthcare for all then!
@RandPaul great idea. Let's tax Wall Street, stop the offshoring of corporate assets, and provide single payer or universal health instead!
@RandPaul please stop the corporate welfare!
@RandPaul What the Morons for Bernie don't understand is that Corporations DO NOT PAY TAXES. They pass them down to the Working Folks!
@RandPaul says the guy who wants to eliminate Social Security, Medicare, and Roe vs. Wade #hypocrite
@RandPaul what about taxing that percentage of people who collectively make up that small percentage of super rich?
@RandPaul we need to quit acting like raising taxes on the wealthy will affect us who don't make the 500k or more a year
Preach. RT @RandPaul If we are serious about taking care of the american people let's not tax them to death. #DemTownHall
@RandPaul Let's let a private for-profit corporation decide how much we should pay for health care instead!
@RandPaul you are fear mongering! he wants to tax the ppl making over 2  million..basically getting rid of the trick down BS that didnt work
@RandPaul He wants to tax people to death, and then blame Wall Street for taking all of the money. #DemTownHall
@RandPaul Even whispering taxes for the middle class is a death sentence to the White House.
@RandPaul people don't realize his policy is a Trojan hoarse
@RandPaul He's big in taxing everyone to death, that's for sure. #DemTownHall
@RandPaul yeah! Let's just kill them by making sure they can't afford health care.
@RandPaul is a savage with these tweets lol
@RandPaul he's speaking Spanish now!
@RandPaul Spending boosts the economy
@RandPaul he's not taxing everyone listen he is taxing the top 1% I know I don't make 250k a year so I am fine with him taxing those 1%
@RandPaul If we are serious about changing this country, we need term limits, NO MORE CAREER POLITICIANS
@RandPaul Nobody is talking about that, Rand.
@RandPaul I second that
@RandPaul finally some one who gets it
@RandPaul  What about Obama Insisted on Indefinite Detentions of American Citizens! NDAA http://youtu.be/V7Anf59cOr0 
@RandPaul Let's not let them get screwed over by massive Corp & lobbyists either. At least this way the people get something out of it.
@RandPaul and let's not give all the money to planned parenthood. I can't believe ppl take Bernie seriously.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Bernie. Lol https://youtu.be/KCVF6MS3tLo
