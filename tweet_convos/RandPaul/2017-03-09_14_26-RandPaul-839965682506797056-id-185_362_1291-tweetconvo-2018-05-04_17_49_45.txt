Great idea Rand...let's rip our own party to shreds for our own ego. How's about behind closed door negotiating?
keep up the fight Rand. More than u know are with you.
Please, I'm counting on you to make peopole understand.
Go get 'em, Rand. You're on the right side of history. Glad some men will still stand up and champion liberty.
I'm curious abt this. It seems that health care, being inelastic, is better as a public service than market. Even more free?
THIS is a broad, broad topic. One large concern is the proper functioning of prices as signals of how to allocate scare goods.
In any event, the GOP plan, in my view, is far worse than the ACA it seeks to replace.
I'd be open to huge expansion of Medicaid if market forces were otherwise allowed to keep healthcare market healthy.
But as far as the inelasticity goes, the same is true of, e.g., gasoline. It's very inelastic.
One could also argue that - say - MRIs are actually pretty responsive to price. Many times, physicians push these for profit.
yeah let's repeal the coal restrictions Rand Paul. No more Kentucky Bourbon....water too polluted
