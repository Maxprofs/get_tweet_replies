so, then you think Powell should be indicted, too? Last I checked he doesn't have any of his emails
@Allen_Clifton @RandPaul
she was grossly negligent and they list how she broke the law! They just aren't charging her! DUMBASS
actually they pointed out bad judgments but specifically said they found no evidence she broke the law.
no no, they found nothing that a prosecutor could supposedly use in court which is BULLSHIT
uh huh. So they tell you something factual, but because you don't like the facts, you call it bullshit - hilarious.
only when you make up "facts"
@RandPaul
Never heard of that but if it is true it only proves more that politicians are above the law
heres something else for ya to think about
No it isn't. The non-scandal of the rest is BS!
I never saw this sorry
but I don't know about Colin Powell but it appears to me that Hillary sold US secrets
I wouldn't be surprised if every politician was crooked but Hillary is the current spotlight
By definition, theyre all crooked. Just think: they voluntarily joined the fight against citizens.
@TIME
very creative. It shows you have some sense(of humor). but still a worthless effort to depict circumstances
says the Hillary supporter
@TIME #corrupt
Watergate was about bombing of Cambodia for reelection, got twisted into domestic affair coz less painful
When you the rule of law stuff, get ready for lies
@TIME   #StandWithRand
@GOP All You #GOP need to suk it up and get bhind OUR candidate
@Smaulgld  i think, seeing Clinton & then the cops just shooting folks in the streets now? the rule of actual law is gone in US...
and bernie is satisifed that a process was held and will endorse hillary
which is damn shame, we are doomed to serious bank slavery & more forever wars then
Law is meaningless since Hillary set free
Law is just the elite's tool2 destroy us
Constitution a permit2murder babies in the womb
@vikkideiter @realDonaldTrump I totally agree. 'One nation, under God, with Liberty & justice for all.' Need t clean up corruption

@RandPaul

@TIME indeed so true!!
Yes Sir. We've been taught all our lives that ignorance of  aw is no defense. Yet, we are asked to believe it is. @RandPaul @leeleemunster

That's why I am going to hold my nose and vote for Trump.  We can't let this evil woman ever attain the presidency.
Our country died today. I’m saddened by the partisan glee and I’m left with zero faith in our governmental institutions.
cry cry cry your so hurt. check your hippocricy.
There are people in jail for far lesser crimes where the stakes were much lower.
There are pple in jail for NO crimes! That's  what the "justice" system is for!
@OldNuc @TIME Romanian hacker Guccifer found dead in jail cell. 
http://linkis.com/christiantimesnewspaper.com/Po8fa …
Boy, last week guy about to testify against Hillary shows up dead and now this?

@alllibertynews @TIME I think Hillary "pistol whipped" a thug in a Little Rock strip mall when Bill was governor; another cover-up
@alllibertynews @TIME I personally hope Clinton will be elected pres: 1st to get sued for treason! That would be good 4 country.
.@RandPaul Then step up to the plate and get @realDonaldTrump elected POTUS. The alternative chills me to the bone. #NeverEverHillary
the amarican justice system isn't worth a poop thanks the you lawmakers.
sour grapes! like every repub law maker you degrade America with your lies and bombast.
THAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT you report to us
@DebAlwaystrump clinton is the epitome of corruption
@AZPatriot01
Dr.Paul!
Join Donald Trump!
Trump/Paul 2016!
@DawnMariefhl Gee yah think???
@wturner988 all we keep hearing from @GOP about Clinton being guilty is talk WE KNOW SHES GUILTY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OR STFU
@TIME  We are not a nation anymore. We are not America anymore. America is gone.  Obama ,congress and the supreme court ended it .
@DineshDSouza no kidding! Why should I obey any law when the leaders of this country make a mockery out of them.To top it off DOJ
@realDonaldTrump
NEVER have WE had a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE more QUALIFIED for #PRISON than @HillaryClinton !! #TeamTrumpPA 
*******
@DineshDSouza Excuse me, Sen Paul, WHEN have U GOP elites fought Obama as viciously as U have TRUMP! - TRAITORS ALL !
@Hawkfanhefe360 Add 2 recent assassinations by police and yes,I'd say people are done with these clowns #DoubletheGuards #GameOver
@DineshDSouza she and a lot of others behind her are forcibly manipulating the citizens of this beautiful and awesome USA.
@DineshDSouza It confirms what we already knew about the Govt. and its application of justice. it is totally corrupt.
@DineshDSouza Amen!!
Americans must now live in fear of their government, the socialist are in full control & will protect the governing elite
@DineshDSouza You are right, this is a sad day for America
@DineshDSouza The indictment will have to come at the Presidential Election box by the masses...no one else will do anything.
@DineshDSouza true but she is. Comey chose politics above the law
@_jrsupple
@mmmoonie glad some senators are calling this what it is/was-an act of hypocrisy & partiality. Lawlessness at it's worst. #DropOut
Kudos @RandPaul for pointing out loss of #RuleofLaw with #FBIComey #Clintonemail @mmmoonie http://goo.gl/0PJGhP 
Please help make sure @HillaryClinton 's Security Clearances are immediately withdrawn.
@prugtiv Do something besides yacking you useless dog.  Try fixing the problem.We gave you the majority in both houses we get this
.@RandPaul would be a good VP option. Hope he attends RNC. @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump @ericbolling @DanaPerino #TheFive
COME RAND PAUL SUPPORT TRUMP N GET THIS COUNTRY back no matter@ what
@TIME that is an understatement
@vivelafra We have loss faith in the SCOTUS,the FBI,EPA,IRS,Congress, the WH.  Is there anything left ?
@geowashburn What justice system?
@Charles07527697 Not just the Justice system its clear most want a top to bottom house cleaning!
@Westxgal WHEN WILL YOU FACE THE FACTS THERE ARE NO
 LAWS PER SAY JUST SOME ATTORNEY'S INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE LAWS ARE.
WRONG saying American's faith is degraded. It's been gone a while. America's "royalty" don't get equal treatment. #nojustice
@TIME eric garner was killed for selling cigarettes illegallyand Clinton (done far worse) skates. https://youtu.be/YHIUve8V2zo 
@BET
@TIME http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/08/24/spy.timeline/index.html?_s=PM:US …
@nevergiveup2004 Comey spent most of his conference telling how she broke the law, then last 2 min on why he wouldn't indict her.
Exactly ! How could they compare the situation to another case anyway ? Further proof no rules apply to Clinton's
Anyone else would have faced indictment even if you exclude the server & attempt avoid FOIA.
It's pretty disgusting .
@TIME I would think it is an ethical issue and not a legal issue.
@TIME
Senator Paul would have more credibility on issue if he hadn't circumvented law to run for 2 offices at same time!
@TIME you're above the AMA.
Imagine if powerful white men got as upset about an innocent black man being shot as you do over improper use of email? #injustice
@TIME that's oversimplification. The FBI never said anything we didn't know.
@TIME  I am sure glad that the FBI will never prosecute me for "carelessly" smoking this joint. Maybe I'll stop paying taxes too.
@TIME They don't even cull their own herd. They created this mess and now they want to cry about it?
@TIME Degrades our faith in the US justice system? Please. Americans lost faith in that a long time ago. We now count down to war.
@TIME James R Clapper needs to strip HRC of any & all intelligence clearance She have proven to be careless with National Security
Don't tell Americans @FBI COMEY is aboveboard after his sellout performance @HillaryClinton is guilty but not accountable!
then do something
@TIME HrC is not above the law. They spend $Mils getting dirt on adversaries to spew when imperiled. Remember Ken Starr treated?
You sir should ask for Comeys resignation effective today The FBI is tarnished forever because of his lack moral fortitude

Agree. Someone could also set up his/her private server and harms Americans through predatory practices, exclusion, discrimanation
Why didn't Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld go to jail after lying about WMDs? GOP justice was just as bad.
sir no one is going to make a stand without leadership. It's time for YOU to do something other than talk and tweet/ make a stand!
@TIME
@TIME @realDonaldTrump DR. PAUL, WHN THE CORRUPT PPL N CHARGE OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM R REPLACED, FAITH WILL B RESTORED.
VOTES COUNT
@TIME I can't have less faith in any of the three branches right now. You all are supposed to inspire faith and trust. FAIL.
Libertarians don't even believe people should have to get drivers licenses
Rand is right. When it's a Republican we don't look into but a Democrat we do...shame on you Rand.....http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/03/07/state-dept-concludes-past-secretaries-of-state/209044 …

F-Fucking B-Bunch of I-Imbeciles.
@Veteran4Trump @TIME Money Talks No rule of (ha ha) law it's a bigger joke today
@grannygethealth If I didn't know the finality of the Lord's justice I could not stand all the injustice. They cannot lie to Him!
SHES NOT ABOVE THE LAW. SHE DID NOTHING WRONG AND NOTHING REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATES HAVEN'T DONE IN THE PAST.
Let's check your emails now, shall we?  Can you withstand the scrutiny you've given her? I doubt it. #GOPWaaahhh!!!
@TIME would you have us vote for #trump? I could never in good conscience do that. We have been given an impossible choice.
Law-101:"crime""intent"/"act KNOWING HARM IS LIKELY" (legally reckless). "Negligence"reasonable to say "should've known"damages
One day there will be a reckoning & people will be looking for US politicians like the bourgeoisie looked for French aristocracy.
@Mattiesbff monarchy's don't have Laws that apply too them they get too create  them or supersede them
@Catheri89173742 @TIME 
Very good article.
@freedomtex  It's been this way since Whitewater, the temporary advantage of being in league with Lucifer.
if she were Republican I am sure you would be singing a different tune
.@RandPaul further proof we need #Trump. #CrookedHillary is unfit to be POTUS. She is a sell out. #BreakTheFoundation
@hughhewitt
@TIME @LouDobbs
This is another example of the corrupt, incompetent, rigged system @realDonaldTrump has spoken about for a year.
limited knowledge of #MensRea & the rule of law is clear. Cases you cite evidenced intent to break US laws but not @HillaryClinton
@Sweetatertot he should be the VP bid. I want him as President. Bernie would seal the deal for trump. Trump would offer more!
@Veteran4Trump Exactly!
America is in an uproar! just look at the anger on social media! I was at the post office today the anger towards DC Gov't is sick
This is bad. The world now has more reasons to hate.
@Veteran4Trump Yeah, like what you think counts.
You guys should be calling for an emergency meeting demanding resignations; prosecutions; hearings!
I concur .
what in the hell are you going to do about it @RandPaul ? stand by and let America FALL?
Someone has to do something senator! This is complete lunacy! Where is our Government in this? Take Action
Former State Department Diplomat says Hillary Clinton should lose TOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCE after FBI's decision
@Veteran4Trump thank you for speaking out!
@DavidA7808 you've got that right indeed. Now we are lawless.
@TIME With all due respect, Get your head out of your ass! Remember Bush/Cheney? Wmd? $6 trillion? You know nothing of justice!
you hypocrite, where was your outrage when Colin Powell did it?
Please tell me the Senate can do something about this. For once - DO SOMETHING!!
amen!!
@willsmidt6464 Rand Paul. Vice President!
@willsmidt6464 We don't need "Rule of Law" in our Banana Republic We enjoy our servitude just like it is.
the  of justice are being tested & checked right now. I believe we will come out of this w/ #Justice & #Liberty Ringing True 
God knows who hacked her and will blackmail her if elected
@Het32000 Thank you, Sen. Paul. I am so disheartened. This is the worst day I have ever been through after fighting for my country
@ZBanshee i kinda wish rand would have run libertarian, I would have voted for him over #trump
@TIME 
I agree completely!
Comfort: G_d is in control and He is a just Father.
Yeah but anyone who has studied the Clintons past or Obamas knew this was coming . All democrats , n half of republicans corrupt
@painlessmd should tell you how little 'juice' trump actually has, which would fail in DC. bullying with $ his whole life is over.
@Portosj81J @TIME Do all Americans get a get out of jail free card now or does that only apply to illegal aliens?
@Darren32895836 #SystemIsRigged
This is what we the people have been saying, the filthy clinton's once again poke their finger in our eye.  Sick at heart.
@Darren32895836 Where does this lead us? An @FBI & DOJ =100% Political Hacks: Comey, Lynch: One and the same!
@TIME The Clinton's ars a disgrace.
@Sweetatertot @TIME 
Yes but all bad comes good this'll wake up people
#Trump2016
@TIME don't understand why he was allowed to rule this case he was appointed by Obama should have been someone imparcial
Just because it doesn't go your way doesn't mean there's a failure in the rule of law.
@Seanchuckle Oh, I lost faith in the American Justice System when OJ was found not guilty.
@tweet4upatriots 
http://educate-yourself.org/cn/agenda21explained18may14.shtml …
@TIME @DutyAffiliates @DutyCigarettes #spdc " Two Thumbs Up " !
@ptkay GOP and DEMS stop being pussys and wake up!! Get together and do the right thing
@saveusrepublic2 Dr Paul, how can we recall Mr Comey?
Very disheartening. Leaves one to believe all that we've stood strong and fought for is gone.
@Sarah__Reynolds Y'all should have known, Anything that has the Republican stink on it was never going to be true or take her down
None of U should! But U all take your turns now don't you? U are ALL part of a corrupt system and U like it that way!
.@RandPaul Oh wow, I forgot this guy existed!! 
The last time I RT'd @RandPaul, I lost over 300 followers, @CassandraRules. And it was on sunsetting the PATRIOT Act, for God's sake!
It's a 'group think' thing.  You show any signs of individuality of thought...must be ignored or, destroyed
@Sarah__Reynolds horseshit
well that and Mexican (read: Hoosier) judges ... Get a better candidate. ANYONE else would beat Clinton. Your guy's a lunatic.
@chaelch how about you do the work we sent you to Washington to do and stop with these meaningless investigations.
right tho? The dude that boasts about how against taxes and wasteful spending he is.
exactly Mr. Kay
@chaelch so basically because you didn't get the result you wanted she's above the law..maybe there really isn't a case to be won
How many more times does @RandPaul have to get it right before you people get it?
Faith in the US justice system is gone my friend. Today will be looked back on as the day American had enough of the #Corruption
@JaredWyand @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump Criminal clinton gets away with crimes.  Ppl speak out. RINO Ryan cries about a shape.
#Diversity is not the rule of law.
#Diversity is a code word for #Whitegenocide.
@Portosj81J @TIME what degrades our faith is she or others do this and all we hear is talk out of Washington Time After Time
Due to James Comey I lost all faith I had in our Gov. both sides are as corrupt as the day is long. I pray Trump wins in November.
The justice system has become a tool for selective enforcement with no accountability. So it naturally grows worse.
@Winkler6Winkler @TIME if Obama can bend the law........
@hughhewitt The only correct interpretation of the law is that which furthers GOP political goals.
