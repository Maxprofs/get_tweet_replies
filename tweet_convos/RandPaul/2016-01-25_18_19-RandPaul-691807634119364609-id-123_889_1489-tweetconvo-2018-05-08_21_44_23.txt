@ggbootsrock @RandPaul lol what?
@ggbootsrock living expenses? I was more amused by the claim that it ends incentive to compete
@ggbootsrock because there is already free public high schools and competition seems just fine
@RandPaul @GCobbJr ...because not all colleges are public? Why was that a serious question?
@TK94127 I think paying for both would be difficult to say the least. What's your take?
@GCobbJr 1) defense is 57 pct of budget. Both of these are rounding errors. 2) value of loans to for-profit low-grad inst. for vets > either
@TK94127 agreed. Given climate right now cuts 2 'defense' budget = cuts 2 actual defense 2 voters. Don't think those $s r going anywhere 
@GCobbJr one less F35, which is already outmoded and will never work would pay for more than both, right? Sad...
@FreeAmerican100 @RandPaul 
And we'll be Greece.
@RandPaul Because as you well know thousands of college students are paying high rates on student loans, they need to refi, if you cared...
@RandPaul @
Private college and grad school ma dude..
@RandPaul He views it as an ideal. More subsidized loans can logically lead into free public school
@RandPaul @ckm9698 Garbage in, Garbage out. They wont need to pay the loans if they are forgiven.
@RandPaul ... a sure way to destroy what is working ... gov't control
@RandPaul Student housing, meals, etc.; all of those pesky necessities of life one needs while attending college.
@RandPaul Because he the economic understanding of a 7 year old
@RandPaul right
@RandPaul @alllibertynews It's a process because it's not like it can happen in day one.
@randpaul Similarly,Bernie said he wants a Single Payer H/C System, AND he would give Planned Parenthood MORE money. #Serious #Question
@RandPaul For private colleges, and people who CURRENTLY have massive debt. Serious answer.
@RandPaul private school, graduate school etc.
@RandPaul @brian8556utube private colleges.
@KCeltics830 @RandPaul As your reason or that he wants private colleges free?
@brian8556utube @KCeltics830 @RandPaul people seem to conflate public college and private college. He's talking public college.
@RandPaul I have a question. What's being the product of nepotism's contribution to mediocrity like?
@SCWTA that is absolutely hilarious
@RandPaul if you listen he has said: to refinance the people who are out of college and strapped with high-rate student loans.  *Answered*
@RandPaul He can't have it both ways.
@RandPaul @FayeOpal I assume there may be private schools as well that the free school law would not affect, and unsubsidized loans are evil
@RandPaul @freedomtex He knows that in order to pay for "free" it will have to be either rationed or subsidized by "rich" meaning 50K/year
@RandPaul How about all kids getting a decent Primary education 1st, then we'll worry about spoiled middle class white kids.
@RandPaul you want to pay the interest on my student loan? $87 a month interest payments, nothing on the principle. Lower rates would help.
@RandPaul Because some students will go to non-public colleges. So they would require loan help. Not that confusing really.
@RandPaul Majority Am's want PPL programs+all infrastructure fixed w/good pay jobs+adv edu>our youth=keep sm gov>GOP States>yell help often
@RandPaul very good point, Senator.... Now, if you wouldn't mind, PLEASE DROP OUT OF THE RACE!!!
@RandPaul #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul Your an idiot, thats not what he said Rand, think your hearing aide is messed up.. You know you #feeltheBern !!
@RandPaul my guess is free college is only state college, loans are for private
@RandPaul because he isn't operating with a full deck.
@RandPaul because his free college plan is not retroactive and many students are currently stuck with crippling debt that won't go away soon
@RandPaul Because a lot of people go to private colleges? Like Baylor, where you went? Do you think we're idiots? #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul From a guy who doesn't know what secured vs unsecured loans are, I'm not surprised.
@RandPaul @MichaelSteele The Iraq war has cost 2 TRILLION dollars

Where did America find the money to pay for that http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/5726571/1/ …
@RandPaul @Pape_2K that would make too much sense.
@logans58 @RandPaul well i mean the "free" only applies to public, not private institutions. This is not me supporting a dem tho.
@Pape_2K @RandPaul well I mean that's only 70% of college students...
@logans58 @RandPaul typical dem begging but still choosing. I don't agree with the "free" college plan anyways so Bernie sucks regardless.
@RandPaul Tuition free, paid for by a transaction tax.
@RandPaul @avznut Gotta pay the rent and cell phone
@RandPaul @juleslalaland 
If it's Free, why raise taxes?
@RandPaul I like your plan better, tax deductions on student loan debt.  People drop out less when they have to pay for college.
@RandPaul @MichaelSteele One word: TRANSITION.
@RandPaul Think about it. You might can figure it out. College costs go far beyond tuition. Should students live in tents?
@RandPaul THANK YOU! I Wish you could debate him.
@RandPaul #DemTownHall Once the primaries end and the parties elect candidates the whole process is already 1/2 over? Primaries in October!
@RandPaul @MichaelSteele almost like people already have student debt of something idk
@RandPaul Do you know about Martin Armstrong and @StrongEconomics advanced economic modeling? Martin says fixing the mess will take 30 days.
@RandPaul Lemme guess: so that those students who get loans arent placed in debtors prison for simply trying 2 get an edu
@RandPaul @trutherbotruby he could get it by removing oil subsidies. Other corporate welfare for these fucks
@RandPaul @BednarzJoseph Rand is pissing in the wind. Fuck Bernie he's a non factor, pound Hillary. Ignore Bernie. Keep eye on the ball.
@tgspecial @RandPaul problem is when does hillary say anything coherent! Her positions change every time she opens her mouth-lol
@BednarzJoseph @RandPaul Irrelevant what she says. She's gonna be the nominee. You go after #1. No wonder Rand is getting destroyed.
@tgspecial @RandPaul I'm not so sure she will be. I think she is coming unhinged. She is at a loss with what is happening in the election
@BednarzJoseph @RandPaul I really hope you are right. She is very unlikable, that is for sure. Now the FBI has to do its job.
@RandPaul #DemTownHall One of the unfortunate circumstances of the elite establishment is they do not like the people who can fix this mess!
@RandPaul BREAKING: FACTS STILL DONT WORK ON LIBERALS
@RandPaul Because there's a difference between paying for college and being able to afford to attend college.
@RandPaul #DemTownHall I thought Now was 'the Future' and in 'the Future' we we are not supposed to break down like in the old days gone by?
@RandPaul so easy for Bernie to promise other people's money. So easy for others to take it.
@RandPaul "free" education won't fix issues. Everyone gets a bachelors, strategies on what that's worth come in play. What's it worth now?
@RandPaul maybe he's plañning on sending the bills to the Fed
@RandPaul For private colleges...
@RandPaul for those of us already saddled with loans maybe?
@RandPaul just for tuition. There are life costs for people not born into money. Something you wouldn't know about. #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul High School grads barely read at 5th gr, math @ 3rd. Maybe if learned what need in HS, we w/n need subsidized college remediation
.@RandPaul because we need advance degrees
@RandPaul why is a college education a debt sentence? The colleges are racking in a good amount of PROFIT! we all need to work 2gether.
@RandPaul Why doesn't he address the salaries. The average public college president earned just over $428,000 in 2014
@RandPaul @CRNC If college is free govt can't afford all the research done at universities, scientific advancement will slow to a crawl.
@RandPaul You really don't know the answer to that?
@RandPaul duh, because maybe private, ritzy colleges would not be free and students wld have option to apply to those?
@RandPaul because there of millions of former students who still have crushing outstanding loans. Criminal that govt is profiting on them.
@RandPaul He talked about getting rid of student debt, not introducing cheaper government loans
@RandPaul because sometimes you need a specific university for specific degrees. Rand, I love ya but bro, this is easy to answer.
@RandPaul To help those who are still paying students loans years and decades after graduating
@RandPaul how about the public education problems we have now k-12
@RandPaul I am confused why he said 12th grade education is free.. My property tax bill says otherwise.
@RandPaul transition fool.
@RandPaul Because he wants government to Do everything!
@RandPaul That is an OXYMORON.. or something like that!
@RandPaul.  College sure . . but the country needs many skilled tradesmen (& women), machinists, electricians, plumbing, linemen.
@RandPaul @DennisMeadors Would only public school students get loans?
@RandPaul don't try to think logically here....the sheeple don't like it. #pointmade
#WeStandWithRand
@RandPaul he's funding it/speculation tax on Wall Street. Not govt program. @BernieSanders has my vote. I like @RonPaul ur 2 conservative
@RandPaul b/c college costs are more than just tuition.  COA includes books, living expenses, transport.  Remember?
@RandPaul  FREE ? What is free mean ? Someone always pays and it is usually the taxpayer (me)  You want something, work for it !!
@RandPaul Because math is hard. Well, at least for socialists.
@randpaul I do not find logic in his words.
@RandPaul hope Bernie answers this. I imagine its probably for things like private schools and professional schools.
@RandPaul @CRNC 4 kids who choose to attend private schools or grad school. Was that supposed to be a "gotcha", Doc?
@RandPaul maybe because there are also private colleges that are still open for business?
@RandPaul 
To deal with current student loan debt & for those who go to private schools
You're welcome
;)
@RandPaul Tuition free doesn't mean no cost, Senator Concrete Definition.
hey @RandPaul have you seen tuition-free college credit via @saylordotorg http://www.saylor.org/credit  #debtfreecollege in reach now
@RandPaul he would have to subsidize all student loans right?
@RandPaul Good question
@RandPaul Interesting question.
@RandPaul He don't know.  He just hates America and likes saying stupid shit.
@RandPaul Where will they find all those professors to work for free when college is free?
@RandPaul That was my question during their last debate.
@RandPaul Serious answer: most likely part of a timeline, acknowledging that change will not be like a light-switch.
@RandPaul bc he's an idiot.
@RandPaul For kids who want to go to a country club school.
@RandPaul STAHP with the logic and stuff, Doctor!
@RandPaul because private colleges would not be free...
@RandPaul
@RandPaul No need. He just wants more excuses to tax people to fund the NSA. #DemTownHall
@surgesoda @RandPaul  Well, does he support creating backdoors so that the government has access to private information?  #DemTownHall
@RandPaul Shhhh you forgot about private college
@RandPaul I think he's talking about the student loan debt already accumulated that republicans refuse to allow to refinancing on?
@BenFriedman The issue with refi student loans is there's no collateral to back them up. An education lender can’t repossess your education.
@RandPaul STFU You have NOTHING to offer the American people!
@Rae_in_SA @RandPaul Everyone has something to offer. Even if you disagree, its called political discourse.
@RandPaul cause he is full of shit
@RandPaul ~ and we don't need college ed dumbed down.
@randpaul - I think for Private colleges
@RandPaul Rand, you just showed Bernie!
