It's like they don't trust you or something, Rand. Oh wait...none of us trust you, Republican hack traitor. #TrumpRussia
Gonna get 'Greubered'
looks very secretive
Senator this looks so horrendously sketchy that you're having to go through this. Do you believe there's anything there?
y'all don't lie. That time the Dems did the same thing with Obamacare to the Repubs and everyone was fine with it.
Welcome to Republican created tyranny!
:Sorry but this has gone on 4 a few yrs under Obama. One senator 18 mo ago, couldn't take anything in 2 room.
Tell #Rinos #WeThePeople Already don't want that #LyingRyanObamacare
This is a disgusting move by Paul Ryan. Rand Paul should not have to do this.
He's doing it to get attention.
Missouri is sending backup.... They'll solve it!
Feeling left out of the limelight, Rand?? Wait your turn. You'll see it.
LOL does anyone still take Rand Paul seriously.  The Republicans know he will always fall in line in the end.
@MarkHalperin @RandPaul ...sound of door closing...Ryan turns around...pauses...WTF DO WE DO NOW?!?!?
@kramnivel81 @RandPaul Only the penitent man will pass
Those working on new healthcare bill draft should be able to work w/o interruption? O-Care passed w/o any public read!
Rand Paul Replacement idea SUCKS. So please shut up.
Keep after @SpeakerRyan. Most .@realDonaldTrump supporters don't trust him. We want a total replacement of Obamacare.
Insurance companies control both DEMS & RNC 100%.  Health Insurance companies luv Gov't progams, No Hope
love you Rand you're so tiny and adorable hun
Well. Did you ever get to see it?
@COSProject convention of states is a must. Estab R's are rotten. Next they will say you have pass it before reading it

Absolutely ridiculous that we're all living through the hell it caused yet it's a Secret. Grow up and be adults!
The treasonous bastards called Democrats have a very conveniently short memory concerning their partisan god Obama'
@LibertyCliff @RandPaul hahahaha!! At least we will get to see the bill before they vote!! That's more transparency than ObamaCare!
PLEASE keep talking.  Apparently these idiots need to be shamed into performing.  Thanks for speaking up!!

Did you use your secret decoder ring to find the secret office for the secret bill?
Ok, what in the world is Paul Rylan up to? I heard Sen. Paul say yesterday that the replace bill is an entitlement? Huh?
If it relies upon tax credits, which seems to be the way it's going, it is indeed an entitlement.
Spicey wants to check your phone. @eyokley @RandPaul
@Kinneas @RandPaul shhh. Its a secret
This is going to be the makings of a Great Movie one day.
this Obamacare replacement should get all nay votes until we figure out what's going on.  #SavetheACA
SOMEONE LET HIM IN TO READ IT. NOW.....
Nothing like a healthy dose of sunlight to send the roaches scurrying!
The Republican Elite needs to make sure their plan is approved by their special interest groups.
...It's the same obamacare..They just changed a few words to make it their own..
@shondi99 @RandPaul you mean the basement
grandstanding about transparency while he helps suppress any investigation on the Russia ties with Trump. #hypocrite
Armed Guards for a bill?
You'd think @RandPaul would have easier access to the locked away JFK assassination files. #somethingtohide
he should bring @GeraldoRivera along 
Here is a #ThursdayThought Since the GOP hate ObamaCare so much, how bout they give us #UniversalHealthCare ?
How about no.
'secret bill' = stink bomb turd repubs will try and put lipstick on and pass it off as fillet mignon
Poor @RandPaul is the Hooper Humperdink of Congress. #NotHim !
and ur the dog of twitter
Look how great he is at "Grandstanding" everyone!
wikileaks don't have it nobody has it ?
When are you guys going to realize that secrets are the problem
Was this the night of when Obamacare passed?
Read up on the history. Obama tried for 14 months to get Repubs to agree on ACA. No secrets unlike this corrupt govt.
Quit acting like a child that can't have his toys.
Bravo Rand what's the problem Ryan why you hiden the bill huh Rands not budgin bud till we have access to it..
