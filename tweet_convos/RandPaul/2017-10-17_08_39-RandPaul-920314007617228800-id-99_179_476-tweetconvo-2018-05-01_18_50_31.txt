FAUX News & Liars.  Hide behind the most corrupt network there is, to tell your lies and BS.  Any other network would challenge your lies.
Oh too funny seeing HOW many think @FoxNews is THE corrupt, lying network & follow @CNN @MSNBC believing every fabricated lie they spew 
ROFL I do not think FAUX Liars and Pervs is, I know they are!   You do not know which networks I follow, but keep working with your crystal
When I say Fox, you say fake, when I say fake you say Fox
Ok. Let's get the health Bill done!! It was 3 republicans that caused it to not pass?
Ideology is fine until you have to govern. We sent you to DC to govern.
What you don't understand is that by voting against Graham-Cassidy you stopped the conversation,the debate , and prevented amendments.
Democrat’s idea of “compromise” means spend, spend, spend. We hold the House, Senate & Presidency for a reason. CUT THE NATIONAL DEBT
Stop TAXING or social security benefits!!
Are you ever satisfied? We KNOW you are the one to kill the budget &tax cuts because of your purity test. Stop it.
Stop TAXING or social security benefits!!
No you have not & are not, on either. You are doing everything you can to obstruct Pres. Trump to make him look bad-So you can run in 2020!!
Rand Paul is full of crap. He’s nothing but a one man show who is jeopardizing the budget vote leading to tax reform. He’s worse than McCain

Since when did or would Senator Paul compromise on anything. His actions speak much louder than his hollow words. He is an obstructionist.
You mean you are for adding to the deficit and pushing premiums up because of your selfishness with the stupid executive order on subsidies!
Sellout
Vote FOR the tax bill!
Then vote to debate doofus
Repeal in full Obamacare to remove 28 taxes & regulations!  Please
Tax cuts for billionaires and business, central banks printing money inflating asset prices that does nothing for the working poor. #Stupid
Stop lying you keep blocking everything we want
I'm ashamed to say I did vote for Rand Paul so did many others that I know this needs to stop Rand Paul  not helping the people of Kentucky
Rand Paul doesn't represent the Bluegrass State
#GoldStarFamilies
You have become like Faust.
Keep working w/POTUS! Beat the RINOs and Dems! Repeal & Replace! WTG!

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 cut corporate rate from 46% to 34% and wages fell. 
How about cutting their pay to balance the cut to make it "revenue neutral". Tell them "work for free" 4 15years
R U voting for this? USA $20 Trillion Debt & $600 Billion deficit/yr, GOP plan TAX CUTS for BILLIONAIRES of $600 billion/yr doubling deficit
I've haven't seen you compromise yet.  Please stop acting like a Democrat. Thank you.
Rand Paul is a sycophant and a disgusting character!
Obama doubled the national debt in 8 years to $20 trillion and you want to kill tax reform over $49 billion for defense. Give me a break.
If you pass tax reform, you can work on cutting spending and government later. do you not understand that?
$49 billion for defense no big deal. pass tax reform, get win and tackle spending later.
Why are you giving the rich a 5% tax cut? Why eliminate the Estate tax for the rich? And comb your hair you look like a drunk crazy man dude
Vote NO on Ocare subsidies extension! #RepealandReplace

USA HCAccess , ask ZOE, a summer INTERN for details.
USA HCAccess follows YOUR principles!
SELF RESPECt comes from YOUR acting on YOUR professed principles!  USA HCAccess is YOUR BEST.
Swampers compromise their principles, YOU MUST NEVER.

Giving millions more to the Waltons and Kochs of this country is ridiculous...
@RandPaul Your colleague just attacked you @LindseyGrahamSC
#StandWithRand

Daily Caller's a sewer BUT they reported this story @RandPaul Meets #Rohrabacher & White Supremacist Chuck Johnson http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/47612_Sen._Rand_Paul_Meets_With_Rep._Dana_Rohrabacher_-__and_White_Supremacist_Chuck_C._Johnson …

Remember, you own all of this. History will not be kind. I' m sure your children & grandchildren will proud.
Ever wonder where the upwards of $20 BILLION+ a year for 4 MILLION people went? They’ve obviously not used 4 infrastructure or creating jobs

Sure you are-More like you want to stop everything the Pres. wants to accomplish-BC you want to run for Pres. in 2020-And use it against him
kentucky is for lovers....
We need to implement the #DougPlan on taxes. 12% flat tax on all sources (w-2, 1099, cap gain, etc) on income above $25k. No deductions.
Come on!pick ur battles!standing against everything doesn't help and makes you look useless# unproductive politicians!!
Endorsing @MooreSenate? Shame on you! Explain how you're OK with Moore's unconstitutional views? You're just afraid. @RonPaul is ashamed.
Yea and he was removed as Judge 2 for not obeying the law.  Very constitutional
It says something about Alabama when you're removed TWICE for not obeying the law and yet keep getting reelected. 
Mr. Grandstand always got to be diff., not the norm, must be talked about, A little narcissistic I think.

Graham on budget: I think Sen Paul is trying to find a way to vote no, and he always does.
Your followers understand that "Rome was not built in a day"! Many of us would like to GUTtheGOV & start over!So corrupt it's embarrassing!
bot
A compromise means you bring something to the table.  What, besides abject failure, do you have to offer?
I'll believe that when I see it!
Varney looks like he could barely keep a straight face. 
$12,000 (more than my annual SSA income). Many complic. $8,900 in nursing..not all tax ded.  What is going to happen to Seniors tax reform?

Congress is the problem! #TaxReform will not happen until #FAIRtax ends t/ability to sell tax policy favors. #MTFA 
@Talkmaster…
Sen.Paul  no one mentions medicare or social security. Our only hope for helping Sr is you. Just had neurosurgery....did not@take@medicare
Then please vote yes!


Look, appreciate your dedication to "getting it right," but when it PREVENTS you guys from getting ANYTHING done your premise is BROKEN.
#DrainTheSwamp #Beepboopbeep
Repeal is what I was promised.
Oh republicans lied to you so they could give rich people more money? Gosh, that has never happened before. Ever...
Thats tax reform and tax cuts.
I am not concerened with this as much as I am concerned about other things
Why do keep having him on ? He's nothing but an obstructionist that likes to hear himself talk .
Because you're watching fox fake news!
I read that as "you dummies that voted us in aren't getting either one"
