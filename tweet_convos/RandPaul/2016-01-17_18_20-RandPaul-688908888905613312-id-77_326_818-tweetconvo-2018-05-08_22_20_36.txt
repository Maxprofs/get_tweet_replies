@RandPaul While this is true, if you're implying that the #GOPDebate is any different (if not worse), then you're mistaken.
@Pancakecity7 get ready to be surprised
@Pancakecity7 Also, he did end up higher than projected.
@Pancakecity7 Nope, I have hope that ppl will wake up.
@RandPaul oh ok but what should I do if I'm a grown-up?
.@RandPaul t/f you kiss a gold statue of yrself at bed time
@RandPaul I played Rand Debate Bingo but my card is empty???
@RandPaul Better that than the drinking game I guess.
@RandPaul @juliaioffe Shush and let the grownups talk.
@RandPaul 
I'm so glad you are on Twitter tonight.  #RandRally
@RandPaul why are you even talking? You are not even remotely in the running..didn't even get a spot on the stage last time
.@RandPaul GOP bingo already complete: cut taxes for rich, fund more wars, YAY GUNS, xenophobia, racism, sexism, dismantle ACA #DemDebate
@HCELindsay @RandPaul I thought only the Donald live tweeted #DemDebate's. Rand go to bed, you're drunk.
@RandPaul #RandRally #RandPaul #TheRevolutionWillNotBeTelevised President Paul 2016 and 2020
@RandPaul And if you're playing drinking games, you're probably getting close to being hammered XD
@gwoodard41 You just shut up *burp* or punch you in the face! Where are my uh, yeah, someone put on that song about that guy!
@Mikecgoodwin It's a good thing I don't drink alcohol XD
@gwoodard41 Your loved ones and neighbors should thank you sir.
@RandPaul But let's be honest. The same can be said about the GOP debates. Both stick to their own talking points.
@ecdebree @RandPaul That is what was so great about the #RandRally. He was open to questions from the Twitter feed. ICHECK THEM OUT
@adlangston75 that's why I love the fact he boycotted the last debate, and hope he gets the nod.
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders  could you cross lines and team up with eachother. You are the best of both parties and could do good together
@RandPaul I imagine you're playing that bingo game.  Not like you have too much going on these days
@RandPaul And then there were those of us foolish enough to do a shot for each buzzword..
@RandPaul what like: equal rights/gun control/policies/legislation/urban development? Better than GOP: bomb/aliens/more guns/stupid head
@RandPaul @MrGaudreau Lets be honest here, the Republican's are guilty of it too.
@RandPaul @juliaioffe Don't let the substance confuse you, Senator. I know it's probably beyond you.
@RandPaul yeah watching the Republican debate I only filled the Obama, Hillary, and ISIS slots on my card (7000 each.)
@RandPaul Not sooner?
@RandPaul Thoughtful and intelligent discussion tonight. Unlike the GOPClown show. So yes, intelligent Americans say Bingo!
@RandPaul taking shots! can barely stand #StandWithRand
@RandPaul I'm hammered drunk already
@RandPaul m not because i'm not an IDIOT. I'm actually paying attention
@RandPaul Congress Funds #PP with $500 MILLION , WHY HOW does @HillaryClinton Get $20 MILLION , GIVE IT BACK 2 the MIDDLE CLASS #DNCdebate
@RandPaul if I could play the drinking game, I would be blacked out by now
@RandPaul So you have been reduced to Twitter trolling the debate?
@RandPaul  Real quick like good luck bingo! #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul
Whatever Republicans. Immigration immigration immigration. "@RandPaul: If you're playing #DemDebate bingo tonight... #buzzwords"
@RandPaul Really? Weren't you just advocating civil debate on @TheDailyShow?
@RandPaul this #DemDebate is a better drinking game than a bingo game.
@RandPaul I heavily disagree with your policies, but this is pretty dead on.
@RandPaul what on facts and that candidates are debating like adults and not calling names like the republican circus debate?
@RandPaul Just hope it's not a drinking Bingo.
@RandPaul at least they are talking policy and what they would do.  Not how they r great in every way #DemDebate #trump ugh
@RandPaul I played "Crazy Xenophobe" Bingo with the #GOPdebate and did the same thing!
@RandPaul at least we get to see THEM on tv #DemDebate
@RandPaul the drinking game is down right dangerous.... All three up there are already talking BAN on drinking games. #RandRally #DemDebate
@RandPaul #DemDebate
@RandPaul @juliaioffe Can't do that on repubs debate: they can only remember 5 buzzwords.
@RandPaul @juliaioffe Rand Paul Bingo.. "Constitution" "Freedom"
@RandPaul yes and bombing everyone was filled out quick in the R debate
.@RandPaul @News3LV hold on I still have "Rand Paul Inconsequential" ...  did they say that yet?
@RandPaul I'm getting a headache watching the #demdebate #standwithrand
@RandPaul Rand, as in, I rand for prezident once.
@RandPaul Took less than 10 in the @GOP debate.
@RandPaul does Obamacare enslave doctors?
@RandPaul If you treat national issues like a game of bingo, no wonder you're polling at 2.3%.
@RandPaul are there going to be any nsa questions?
@RandPaul if you're playing debate drinking game call an ambulance already
@RandPaul I bet "Constitution" is not on that BINGO card
@RandPaul Haha!!
@RandPaul Keep it on on'em Paul. Nobody Cared when Bernie was doing it in the Rep. Debates. Keep up the good work!
@RandPaul I blacked out 25 minutes into the #RepublicanDebate...  I think #buzzwords are the only words you politicians know!
@RandPaul Dems profess lofty platforms of what they will do. Why haven't they done it with Obama?
@RandPaul I guess Dr. Paul likes watching debates since he wasn't in the last GOP scrum.
@RandPaul I already won. I had "Make the country a better place" in every square.
@RandPaul already have!
@RandPaul #DemDebate
@RandPaul give it up Rand, they aren't going to let you on this main stage debate either.
@MorkanMindy @RandPaul you're in high school. You have no idea how shitty the country w/ sanders will be. Review history&use common sense
@RandPaul you got some weed I can bogart?
@RandPaul and the differencefrom the GOP debate is??
@RandPaul Bernies taling about Criminal Justice though which is really good for your numbers.
@RandPaul c'mon Rand
@RandPaul for VP on the Trump/Paul Ticket!!!!
@RandPaul Please educate yourself watching the #DemDebate.
