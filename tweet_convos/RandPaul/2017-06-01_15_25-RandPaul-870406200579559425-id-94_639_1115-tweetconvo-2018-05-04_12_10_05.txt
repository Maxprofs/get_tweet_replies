White House Fingers John McCain As Media Leak; Believes U.S. Senator Eavesdropped on Trump’s Classified Phone http://truepundit.com/exclusive-white-house-fingers-john-mccain-as-media-leak-believes-u-s-senator-eavesdropped-on-trumps-classified-phone/ …
True, cause they are models. They've consistently underestimated the rate of CO2 increasing. Read a journal.
Rand Paul has gained a ton of respect from me since POTUS has taken office. He's very knowledgeable & not afraid to speak out.
More like he's not afraid to satisfy those he sold out to, the Koch brothers
I think Paris needs to work on their little terrorist problem instead of the fake scam dollars from U.S. climate thing.
A) Paris is just the name of the treaty. There are 147 counties in it B) Their violence problems are actually little compared to ours
Not a treaty, never was. Never went through Senate.
Ok, let's say agreement. But spare me the posturing. It's clear from your page you've never thought about any of this until 2 days ago.
WTG Rand! These idiots also don't know that climates on other planets change over a long period of time w/no human interference. Mill of yrs
You guys are are headed into darkness. Stop it.https://twitter.com/damejemarshall/status/871054752670285824 …

1) how long was process 4 climate change b4 Industrial Rev? 2) how long is process today w mass production n waste at higher rate n scope ?
Awesome job senator!! It's common sense and love how u schooled tapper
Very impressive discussion on the #ParisClimateDeal why should we allow China and India to not have to follow such an agreement. #baddeal
Common sense by Rand Paul. We can use a little bit more of that in the Liberal Media. They have an agenda not supported by facts.
He also said the ice caps would be gone by now. Scientist for NASA by in the 90s said it was hotter because if the sun. Gore threatened to..
Pretty sure this all went over Jake's head. Not what he wanted 2 hear. Professor emeritus 4 CU builder day we'd be dry in the gulf by 2005
Agreed, that was an impressive interview. Well done @RandPaul!
WTG @POTUS #MAGA Just a ponzi scheme 2 redistribute wealth & take away US advantage to produce & lose 6.5M jobs & add 3T 2 Nat Debt.
omg, that was the same word I used. Total ponzi scheme no doubt lining someone's pockets.

More scientists disagree with Global Warming (our fault?) than agree/Talk Pollution. That is real, & not a normal surge from global position
Your science is flawed. Beside > You cannot get out of the Paris Accord for 3 years and then 1 more year waiting. The next Pres. will decide
Excellent! Spot on @RandPaul !!!
Paul OWNED this IDIOT with his DEMS talking points.GORE bought an Ocean front MANSION..guess he's not worried about rising ocean after all!
Look up NASAs latest glacier study. NOT disappearing. #scienceisnotsettled
PS Jake, carbon is a lagging indicator, not a leading one Worst possible choice 4 a prediction model. But you knew that cuz your a reporter!
Pull their funding The scientist retracted their statements and were then fired Not all scientist by the Anthropologic effect on the weather
Senator Paul was right about our Earth.
Awesome beat down debate! Great job, Senator!
Thanks Sen Paul for your EXCELLENT explanation of natural climate change cycles which all Americans need to hear to stop C/C hoax hysteria.

Hey Jake your a clown with talking points. Rand Paul owned you.
Thank you, Senator Paul!!!
@ASavageNation @marklevinshow @ClintEastwoodLA @RealJamesWoods @RealKyleMorris @immigrant4trump @ConstanceQueen8 @nytimes @latimes @THR
scientist who study GW are very aware of Milankovitch Cycles. Moreso than you. what you just said their claims were is nonsense. its 6 feet
@jaketapper .. Do you support #AmericaFirst? Do think USA should pay more these our fair share ? should USA pay for other countries bills
I think that we should do as much as we can to curtail global warming. This is for our children. Why are so many so selfish?
Why do China and India get this money when they emit more coal anyway and aren't even apart of the agreement
This cracks me up. Tapper is an idiot. All CNN ppl and other channels are trying to scare ppl like it's the end of the world. Ppl watch FOX.

Dear Congress, where exactly in budget is this $1 billion line item expenditure? @SpeakerRyan @RandPaul @SenTedCruz @GOPLeader @kausmickey https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/871022342272671744 …
It's extremely refreshing to hear someone with some common sense. @jaketapper probably couldn't recognize it with all the smirking though.
Excellent. Thank you. Always love hearing you explain the facts.
Thank you @RandPaul very level headed dealing with someone who doesn't even have a journalism degree. @jaketapper
Warming less than lowest predictions. Arctic ice has not disappeared. Hurricanes, etc. not worse. EVERY hypothesis based on theory failed.
Rand you Rock!
Great job Rand! You have an impressive interview. MAGA!
Excellent interview! Thank you.
All we have to do is to just read out their own statements that they've made in the pastpic.twitter.com/siX32V5VOq
@jaketapper Guess who controls the climate? it's not Obama, not NASA it's GOD, "deal with it"
@bans009 Rand Paul TRUTH BOMB. Fake Yapper misses his buddy Obama & worked so hard to get CRIMINAL Hillary elected!
Just like the left to go against the grain of anything that Trump says or does. It would be nice to hear agreement for once in his term!
Too bad MSM didn't try to explain why they thought Paris treaty was good instead Russia, Russia, Russia... Might have helped.
@RandPaul - excellent, convincing interview in spite of fearmongering by the increasingly dour and gloomy @jaketapper
Rand Paul was awesome in this interview with Jake Tapeworm
I fail to understand how people feel they know more about this complicated shit than the scientists that have made it their life's work!
Rand Paul handed Jake Tapper his ass. Way to push back with facts Rand. Brilliant politician.
Thank you Senator for standing up to CNN and not letting them twist the science or your words!!!
Asshole idiot
Excellent interview. Good job Senator.
#StandWithRand no others compare pure genius...
You don't need models to understand that ocean temperatures are increasing and that species are moving to higher latitudes and altitudes.
RAND 2024!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@ScottAdamsSays the models are wrong!
Hey Jake they also said polar bear population would be lowered and it has grown instead!!
Citation?
Thank you Senator The President laid out all of his reasons and they make perfect common sense
So please explain all of the pictures of shrinking ice caps, and huge cracks forming.. Photoshop?
Yes please explain
You are a total embarrassment. It's criminal the people of KY have to endure you for 6 years. Your #Overlords should be so pleased with youpic.twitter.com/3XooPMDltw
All the world's scientists must be wrong. It's not the racist bigots who commit treason that are wrong
@jaketapper is a good representative of the idiots who take science actors who know nothing about complex systems like @neiltyson serious.
Rand Paul, Excellent!
@jaketapper I'm sorry but Jake never seems to impress me with his intellect.But I really think he believes that sh*t about global warming!
Great interview Rand Paul !
Excellent, intelligent response Senator! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
This is so wrong. Wherever you get your facts they are not scientific, they are purely political. Too bad for future generations.
Good, sound reasoning.... Not from the "commentator".
Mr. Paul thanks for telling the truth about the constant evolution of the Earths climate. Jake, as a news anchor stop inserting your opinion
The renewable energy sector is stood up by Tax payer monies. Its not sustainable to artificially support a business model that support self
How do fuknuts like this Tapper dude become journalists and don't know their asses from their elbows?
what are odds that scientists are correct? If only 10% -even 5! -still gotta bet on reducing risk. Insane gamble.
I can't disagree, however climate experts agree that Paris Accords don't reduce climate change, so maybe our 3Bil can be spent better.
I'm unable to see this as alternative response. Blind denial. Lack of will, lack of imagination.
We have the most fabulous imaginations. Really the best. Big beautiful imaginations with big beautiful doors.
Newton was "wrong", but we still regularly use his "model" to fly spacecraft... idiots
How many variables go into flying a ship vs predicting climate? many more, go watch some Big Bang theory and leave science to the big boys
Thank you @RandPaul
I'm with the doctor. @RandPaul has more science, and besides, I saw @jaketapper on @Jeopardy ... he's not that smart.
Rand Paul is an optometrist. And life is not a game or reality show.
@jaketapper has become such a partisan hack. Rand Paul did a good job here. Most rational, middle America people will side with him.
Rand Paul is a cuck
How about that a politician that keeps his campaign promises.
