@deanmuncy @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Of course he can
@beejash @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Just Bloomberg stand on guns gets him beat.
@deanmuncy @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Hopefully, the election to the office of the 'most powerful in the world' is about more than just guns
@beejash @deanmuncy @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg You can't be president if you've dedicated your life to the desecration of the Constitution
@Lindu14 @deanmuncy @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg 'Dedicated your life to the desecration of the Constitution'; bit strong, and how exactly?
@beejash @deanmuncy @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Has spent tens of millions trying to infringe 2nd Amendment; & as mayor dictated what we drink
@Lindu14 @deanmuncy @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg So, infringement of the 2nd amendment is tantamount to desecration of the Constitution'?
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Actually, a pragmatist billionaire, and one with a brain.
@beejash @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Yeah, because banning fountain drinks is important
@leland1001 @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Every candidate has 'silly skeletons' in their cupboards'; picking on this just as silly!
@beejash @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg He still supports the effort. He actually believes his own bull shit
@leland1001 @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg I imagine the Presidency will be debated on somewhat more serious issues than 'drinking fountains.
@beejash @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Like his love for gun bans. He's an elitist and oligarch, screw him
@leland1001 @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Taht was a pleasant debate based on well researched facts of Mr Bloomberg. 'Talk' after November 8th!
@beejash @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg that is his legacy
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Talk sense to your Indy followers Paul. Many are choosing Big Money over History/Heritage. Still a Constitutional?
@donttreadonme53 @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Rand and his father should run a third party campaign. PAUL/PAUL 2016.
@HankFontenot @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg No one should do that = Free ticket to Hillarity's Village.
@donttreadonme53 @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg I'd bet a lot of Bernie and Trump supporters were Ron Paul supporters in the last 2 elections.
@HankFontenot @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg  Prob is...in my mind..that doesn't make them Constitutionalists. Contrary
@donttreadonme53 @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg agreed. I'm thinking in terms of numbers. Not considering what voters actually believe.
@RandPaul Maybe if the current field wasn't such a clown-show race-to-the-bottom, @MikeBloomberg wouldn't feel the need. #BringSomeSanity
@LungDocDoug @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg maybe you can follow your extra large soda guy to Hollywood
@RandPaul @Maxicat @MikeBloomberg you and Bush need to go home.  No one cares what you think and the polls show it.
@railgirl1952 @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg I don't like @RandPaul, but he isn't entitled to an opinion?
@Maxicat @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg yes you are correct he is entitled to his own thoughts
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg By far the best tweet of the campaign cycle. #StandWithRand #randrising #randagainstthachine
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Oh Rand didn't you get the memo....The Donald has been a registered Republican since the 80's?
@oldtinkan @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg I think you meant Democrat
@leland1001 @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg If I meant Democrat I'd have said
@oldtinkan @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg than you'd be wrong
@RandPaul At least you didn't end the tweet with a request for me to send your failing campaign 10 bucks. Thank you!
@MikeVee_ @RandPaul idiot.  #Trump is so clearly a fraud - this little ad by #RandPaul is irrefutable.
@RandPaul @Maxicat I can remember when @MikeBloomberg referred to himself as a Republican.
#BigGulp
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg HILARIOUS.  And yes, that billionaire from NYC slot is filled....
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg people may want Bloomberg instead of Hillary.
@RandPaul @TruthTellerTed Gees I wonder if we will be able to drink or eat what we chose while voting in ppl like MO or this Nut case
@RandPaul didn't know all NYC billionaires/politicians were liberals... Ooo and another racist conservative isn't that slot taken???
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Bloomberg is one of you, Rand!
@RandPaul If @MikeBloomberg actually gets into the race, likely only as favor to Trump. Birds of a feather.
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg would make a truly outstanding pres. Absent him, Trump has no rivals w/ current dysfunctional govt.
@RandPaul relax pubehad, you cant stump the emperor god king trump
@RandPaul @JosephMRyan1 @MikeBloomberg Hey Michael please run then we'll seen the election about who's for Gun Control or NOT!
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg steal his third party thunder! PAUL/PAUL 2016
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Bloomberg should run so Americans get a variety of people to choose from.
@MauriceJOduor @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg what variety? They are all the same except for Bernie and #RandPaul
@RandPaul @PoliticalLaughs @MikeBloomberg don't forget freedom hating and big gov loving.
@RandPaul @mkibbe @MikeBloomberg 
The Real Problem
The Quigley Formula
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynVqPnMQ2sI …
I'll vote for @HillaryClinton as long as @realDonaldTrump is the Vice President, and @RandPaul reads The Fountainhead to America.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @MikeBloomberg oohhhh burn
@RandPaul - are you still running??
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg SHORT
@RandPaul @jtLOL @MikeBloomberg Trump going to steamroll all of you too!
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Right now the Republican's are going to have an insane Trump as our candidate unless everyone, but top 4 drop out!
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg As @MarkSteynOnline says,"Bloomberg can regulate salt out of your fries, but can't regulate salt to thaw 43rd St!"
@RandPaul @AmericanSpringg @MikeBloomberg goodbye big soda...
@RandPaul lol savage 
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg  Rand you would score as much as him 11% (Mike is at 9.8%) if you run independant
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg He's going in to save Hillary. Bernie is going to beat her. He hopes to pull votes from Bernie so she can win.
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Savage! #RandRally #StandWithRand #DumpTrump
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg https://www.gofundme.com/driveforjason 
@RandPaul @zzcrane @MikeBloomberg #RandPaul has my vote....keep on!
@RandPaul @zzcrane @MikeBloomberg When i heard he wants to run as a moderate I almost spilled my big gulp!
@RandPaul @THERESAIZZO @MikeBloomberg Trump is trying to follow the Bloomberg plan: billionaire Dem fearing he can't get Dem nod runs as GOP
@RandPaul @zzcrane @MikeBloomberg sorry Zac but he would be a great Pres #LibertariansforMike
@RandPaul @zzcrane @MikeBloomberg Rand is the one who has let us down by adopting fascism as a campaign platform
@RandPaul @zzcrane @MikeBloomberg Rand has let us down BIG TIME
@RandPaul @zzcrane @MikeBloomberg he has basically dropped all his libertarian beliefs all in the name of a few extra percentage points
@RandPaul @zzcrane @MikeBloomberg I'll for Mike
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @MikeBloomberg  Yez it ishe needsto stayhome Americas notinterested enoughs runnin Rand is theonly truly qualified #SWR
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @MikeBloomberg  The New Bold Different Kind Of Republican #StandWithRand!
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg I see what you did there!
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg You're very quick with one liners but that's not going to help you win the GOP nomination.
@FranMFarber @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg rand paul is the most sane candidate in presidential race
@RandPaul sadly @JohnKasich just said his entering the race was a good idea!?! #KasichIsInsane
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg This is why Rand is my second choice to Ted Cruz.
@RandPaul don't be salty, Rand.
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Can we drink a 32 oz soda to that ??
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Rand you are a constitutional champion who will shock America in a couple weeks when real votes come in #Rand2016
@RandPaul Will Gallup include @MikeBloomberg on the poll they are conducting now that they left @RandPaul off of? #PollFraud
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg I see what you did there.
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg please run Mike!  Would love to see the liberals split their vote!
@randpaul @mikebloomberg At least Trump is from NYC and claims it, instead of moving to a state just to run for nat'l office.
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg So true lol
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg !#StandWithRand #RandRally #RandPaul #PresidentPaul Way taken
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg No Rand, you're wrong. He would be a fantastic choice. Proven track record of leadership both private & public.
“@RandPaul: Now Nanny @MikeBloomberg thinking of running! Another liberal billionaire from NYC? I think that slot is taken...” DAMNNNN 
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg can't wait to see him debate most important issue of the day, what size cups allowed for pop?
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Rand is the Man #VetsforPaul #RandRally #StandwithRand
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg @realDonaldTrump That was good.
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg is the one who paid trump to run republican. what is his angle now?
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg 
:) #truthhurts
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg when Hitler invented libertarianism he wasn’t a billionaire and he conquered most of Europe
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Bloomberg, the country club hero to the rescue riding in on his RINO steed.
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg
@RandLand2016 @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg I thought Archie Bunker died?Geeez Edith!
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg lol
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg @SenRandPaul : Senator: U KNOW I am #Prolife; on ur mailing list; reply back to u. Gloria Poole,RN,artist; Missouri
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg I am guessing ur are referring to the size of soft drinks issue? For the record : some g-mama's are called "nanny".
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg are you referring to yourself?  I thought you were from KY!!!!
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg two shots for the price of one!
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg no one Bloomberg .. Such an ass can't relate to people
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg who?
@RandPaul @MikeBloomberg Rand you are the one on MSNBC every day
@Trumps1stMember @RandPaul @MikeBloomberg only because Faux News is scared of Rand message. #RandRally  #WeAreRandPaul #Gollum #FoxFail
@RandPaul BOOM!!! @MikeBloomberg
