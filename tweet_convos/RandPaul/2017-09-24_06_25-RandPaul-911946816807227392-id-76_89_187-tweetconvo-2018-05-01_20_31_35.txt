Rand Paul is not capable of working with others. And we put him in the Senate. He actually thinks he's worthy of Office of POTUS!
Actually he works with both sides quite often. He's the least partisan Senator. But he wont vote for something he doesnt believe in.
Sorry U can't see when it comes 2 healthcare it is Paul's way or the highway. 3 people in an entire party shouldn'tt determine our future.
Just a few weeks ago even lol
Notice how @chucktodd gave him 3 opportunities to tell POTUS he should respect #1A & he dodged. When did #1A become a partisan issue?
Its not a partisan issue. The left has their problems with it too. Dodging that isnt about the #1A but to try to keep friendly with the Pres
I'm aware of that. My issue w/ it is that Senator Paul used to be very direct in answering q's abt Bill of Rights before Trump came along.
And he still is. But he has Trumps ear a little bit so when the question directly involves Trump he goes softer to not insult his character
Having this president's ear is not cool. You would think a libertarian would more forcefully speak out against executive overreach.
Yes it is? He can push policy easier more towards liberty based policy and more towards his liking. Its a very good thing lol
Not much liberty policy pushing going on. That's bc Trump is not a true conservative. He's a populist w/ a golden toilet & an iPhone.
Whats wrong with the Iphone though? Just the fact that its not a driod or what? Lol
Pass the bill sir for the love of our country we don't need a single payer plan
He actually does quite a bit. And hes actually getting something on Healthcare through eith the President
Read carefully. "Getting something through" not "has gotten something through" and should refrains from the assumptions. They're misguided..
#VoteNoGrahamCassidy
Hey rand I hope your up for reelection soon so you can be voted out for not keeping your promise
Hes the only one trying to keep his promise. This bill doesnt repeal Ocare and nope, not up for re-election  until 2022  #RandPaul
I'm for voting them all out and starting over. Why not straight repeal like promised? All bills proposed are shit
I agree and thats what he is pushing for. Hes not the one to target your anger at...
You should attempt to commit GOP to full repeal of Obamacare in exchange for a yes on this bill. This should be but a stepping stone to goal
Very good interview!  Thank you for standing strong.
Please senator, they are saying you have demands that if met will change your vote. For your constituents sake hold steady and vote no!
Who cares, #paul is on hi last term anyway.
Don't care about full repeal. #itsastart
A start to single payer because this bill is terrible, would fail and dems would use that as a platform to push single payer #fullrepeal
How do you get full repeal? Where will the votes come from? Already shot down in july
They voted unanimously for it before. Most are still for it. Vote out the ones that wont. Also thays why Rand did vote for skinny repeal
Trump should start by undoing all previous executive actions take on Ocare by Obama but Trump isnt serious about getting rid of Ocare
Paul 2020!!
I find libertarians a peice of crap neither wise nor princileled just hiding in the middle.
Trading $ and votes for human lives #RandPaul #FakeChristian
Look up his voting record. He has never been one to trade votes for anything. Most constitutional voting record in the Senate.
#StandWithRand
Health care is not a market. It lacks any of the vital features of a market. 
Rand Paul is a hypocrite -
Paul conveniently omits mention of the message pulling out of the Iran deal - which he supports - sends to North Korea
Didn't watch and could care less about anything that participants on this program today have to say.
NFL players get paid millions of $ how about they just do their job so we can watch a game with no distractions
Trump thinks Rand Paul is a wiener and will vote as TRUMP TELLS RAND PAUL
Sit down somewhere, president assure you. lol      he said the president assured him    omg   I'm dying laughing.Trump assured him
You'll vote anything and don't have the balls to stand up. Nobody's counting on you already shown to B a cookie cutter. Just want attention
Far from the truth. Look up his voting record. Most contitutional voting record in Senate. Votes with and against both parties... #RandPaul
POTUS use the pen and strike all taxes in the ACA then pen that all citizens must use the ACA that means congress and their own workers
Come on Rand Paul save America from OB uncare. Please @RandPaul
@RandPaul 2020.
#RandPaul2020 A clear vision for America
Mr Paul, savings acct's & vouchers are worthless for those with nothing to begin with. This just continues a policy of privilege!
Hes more concerned with allowing people to join association groups and buy across state lines which would make a huge difference
Still the same problem. Result, people don't get proper care.
Betraying the voters makes you no batter than the Anthem Protestors.
I have been boycotting Meet the Depression and the NFL(over paid athletes who disrespect this Nation, Military and Police Officers)
Sell out
Bi-partisan support that puts the right level of protection mandates on insurance companies (quality coverage) while lowering premiums.
Vote sir. The best path forward if McCain's way. Get both parties together. Go through conference come back with bi-partisanship support.
Senator Paul do the right thing. Does this bill help families? No. We don't agree on some things but we should agree on that basic principle
KJU also watched as Russia invaded Crimea & divided Ukraine from 2014 to present. Trump's threats to destroy NK fed exactly into their fear.
Ukraine held many if not most former Soviet Union's nukes. After SU fell nukes were removed from Ukraine which left them vulnerable to 2014.
Please vote NO on health care bill
The fact is republicans get blamed for everything anyway. Can't influence votes.Fight for free market solutions-get insur monopoly out!
THE RAND PAUL VIDEO DIDN'T COME THROUGH! TELL YR TECHNICAL PPL TO GET IT RGHT!
OTHER VIDEOS WORK NT THIS 1
If you vote no, you save 100% of Obamacare + likely a McCain + Collins +murkowski + Dems insurance company bailout. Vote yes Rand
If this bill passes. 90% of Ocare continues, Reps name are stamped with it, it fails, Dems use that as momentum for single payer
@SenRanPaul talked in circles about  Trumpcare he did not give a firm answer. This Gop S will vote yes to repeal! Needs to stop deflecting!
Dear White people don't  tell me how to be American when my people were  here since COLONIAL PERIOD @MeetThePress @RandPaul  @BenSasse
Dear white people your relationship to history in America is not the same as NON WHITES #Recognize @MeetThePress @RandPaul @BenSasse
Hope the rumors aren't true that you're waivering. You've seen all the medical .orgs that are against graham Cassidy?
Who the hell watches Meet The Press anymore?
Chuck Todd and @RandPaul focus on the wrong issue. They're debating: SHOULD NFL players #TakeAKnee instead of WHY they are taking it.
He said he agrees that there's racial injustice in our system.
This dick wouldn’t care if all sick ppl died 
Right...that's why he has always done pro bono work to help people see. He's such a monster. 
Rand Paul sure loves to be on TV
Proud of a Country where PALE People OPPRESSION, INJUSTICE, INEQUALITY Is It's VALUES! PALE People U R HATED World Wide 4 Your GREED!
.@chucktodd The idiotic denial by our politicos & media of dangers presented by Trump's purposely provocative behavior wrt NK continues.
I can't believe I'm thinking this: Rand Paul 2020?  Lol. I mean he made sense this morning...#ImpeachTrump
Should look more into him. Look up his voting record. Hes non-partisan and has the most constitutional voting record in the Senate.
North Korea thinks this of Trump's words. Two guys trying to prove they're alpha male=world devastation. #MTP
Why do you lie so much.  You're a YES  from the get go!!   Senator Dotard JR.
Watch the vote when it happens.He has the most consistent and constitutional voting record in the Senate. Idk where you're getting your news
This bill keeps Ocare. If he votes FOR it he'll save it...
NO WAIVERS! Stop trying 2degrade patient protections! Under ACA States can manage their ownExchanges but don't! @RandPaul @MeetThePress #MTP
Um....high school and college paid with tax. NFL is a business funded by economy, albeit a non-profit. And HS players are sitting too
Ask him to talk about the TDA accounts and trust funds of the people being held at the federal reserve!!!
Sorry, I #BoycottMeetThePress because they are nothing but a propaganda outlet for Progressive Liberals and America Haters. Also #FakeNews
You mean Press the Meat?  I thought it was for Conservatives and Racists.
If @RandPaul decides to vote for this bill and it passes, he will forever be known as the Senator who saved Obamacare. Smh

He is right FULL REPEAL is what was promised that is what is EXPECTED
9:00am CT. Will join Watching, Anchor @ChuckTodd,  Guest Interview : SENATOR @RandPaul ;  @SenKamalaHarris
Let's face it actions speak louder than words. Congress never wanted to fix replace Obama care. Its a tax law
I count you as a YES vote on healthcare again  Your a broken record like the last time, liar.
Watch the vote. Look up his voting record. Most consistent and constitutional voting record in the Senate. Rand Paul is straight up.
#AntiAmericanism is a rampant & harmful disease widely ignored as non-existent by #MSmedia which @realDonaldTrump has brought needed attn
