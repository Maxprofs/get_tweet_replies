@Imagine0468 @Morning_Joe @RandPaul When they write rules that undermines the effect of 15TH Amendment to Constitution thats rigging.
@Imagine0468 @Morning_Joe @RandPaul The Constitution doesn't guaranty the Republican/Democratic parties, only American voters. #Bamboozled
@Imagine0468 @alllibertynews @stevekenney @Morning_Joe @RandPaul Not in a primary, that's not a Federal election.
@Imagine0468 No votes were taken away, a non-binding Presidential preference poll was cancelled. Nothing changed with their caucus.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul Hillary got a Big endorsement from NY Daily news,No mentions by haters Mika/Joe Why is that Hmmm......
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul You Wonder if Trump is putting people off? are you serious? Yes the Heck he is,lets see,hes a habitual Liar,Bigot!
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul Donald Trump speeches sounds like a 4 year old having a tantrum,you folks are losing all dignity and respect.
@Morning_Joe @alllibertynews @RandPaul when delegate vote is decided b4 people's vote; ppl's vote is irrelevant, its BS regardless of rules
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC This Piece of crape needs out of politics he's such a mindless Punk!!!
@MissyPartin @Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC You talking about Rand? If so, Your out of your mind Missy!
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @Reince and you wonder why people are getting fed up with how our parties are doing whatever they want. What a joke
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul biased/rigged no difference
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul this is exactly why people are fed up with the government. I thought this was America.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul you would be an awesome team with @realDonaldTrump.  we need you fighting for the change we need.
@Morning_Joe @Workers4Trump @RandPaul @MSNBC rules biased in favor of the est but delegates being stolen still rigged vote machines rigged
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul Jr is still bitter that #rushlimbaugh & @FoxNews worked to keep his daddy from being a viable candidate. Aim ur blame
@Morning_Joe make no mistake about @RandPaul most certainly wants @HillaryClinton to win anyone else, he's gone along with many others

@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC  Exactly biased so if they dont like our pic they pull this crap look what they let go Rand Paul says sum.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC They are rigged. Ask Trump delegates in Florida who were in tears being replaced with Cruz. PLEZ ENDORSE DJT??
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC Dr. Rand Paul would love for you to endorse Trump...
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul Rand knows what he's talking about. If the rules weren't fair an establishment candidate would be winning.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul Fixing goofy/arcane rules is good idea but until you get power, accept/play by existing rules
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC #StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016

@Morning_Joe @RandPaul  Would you consider being @realDonaldTrump 's running mate ?  You agree on many things like regime change & debt.
@BackOnTrackUSA @Morning_Joe @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I dont think he's man enough swallow his pride in order to be Trump's running mate.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC The establishment change rules to benefit them. The establishment are laughing at the American people.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul They are very biased. I was at an event last night and based off of the discussions, I dropped my party.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul these Private Clubs are not subject to any rules except there own. They have the right to change as they want to
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC I believe the elections are rigged .and the CIA chief is a big baby.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC How can he not think "rigged" when a rule was made specifically to block out his dad?
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul there shouldn't be any rules committee. All the should do is tally up the delegates and the one with the most wins
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul I agree with Rand's #diplomatic answer
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC tomato to-mah-toe
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC Crybaby says the Constitution isn't about the people it's just doing business #DumpTrump #NeverTrump
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC Trump knew the rules he's a crybaby draft dodger #DumpTrump #NeverTrump

#JoeHoldsTrumpsBalls #morningjoe #inners
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul well said
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul I'm thinking they're there to keep phony hucksters from hijacking the party. Dems have super delegates; same reason.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul why Americans hate politics
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC it's not about rules you don't stack the rules when the rules are change as you play is like little kids rules
@Morning_Joe  if NFL decided that the team owners pick the Game winner after each game played  wouldn't  that be considered rigged ?
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC  my vote doesn't count it's rigged what planet are you fromPaul that estab,for you want complete power over us
@Morning_Joe Biased: Prejudiced 4 Or Against Someone Or Something. Rigged: situations where unfair advantage Is Given 2 1 Side Of A Conflict
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul It's ridiculous how the process is being done. Whatever word you want to use, not fair & shouldn't be allowed.
@Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC people's names are actually taking off and they weren't allowed to vote. on videos by Trump supporters
@yelsada @Morning_Joe @RandPaul @MSNBC @seanhannity has anyone reported this fact yet? #Ballotnamesoff

@divanaty @Morning_Joe @RandPaul @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump how can anyone in their right mind vote for a scum bag such as Whiney Lying Ted
@Morning_Joe even @RandPaul dodged questions. With His soft tone, he tried but failed miserably, it was that freaken obvious,  Get em out
