@FBI Help. I agree. This program is a disgrace to freedom.
Then why are you supporting Jeff Sessions for Attorney General?!?!?
Correct. Time for the SCOTUS to weigh in before Donny starts taking things.

@cspanwj #humor #UniteBlue #NotMyPresident
@FBI Its criminal to confiscate property before trial and proof of guilt. The Feds are engaged in stealing!
State & local gov'ts, too, believe you me...check out @IJ's research on "Policing for Profit"
I know! It happened to my family  back in 1998.
Really?? My sympathies! I hope that turned out well for you...damn those government thieves!
@FreedomWorks @washingtonpost The bill S.2644 @SenFranken #TeamFranken  Please,Consider favoring this bill along with @SenateGOP
Thank you for working for the American people & this country. Heck, it might catch on to the rest of Congress.
Thank you, thank you, Rand. We need about 500 more people like you in Congress.
yes, please reintroduce this
Civil forfeiture is a criminal act perpetrated by the govt against the people. Vote NO on pro-civil forfeiture Jeff Sessions!
Thank you @RandPaul  @washingtonpost
I agree with the sentiment. But disagree that it is legal. Or should be anyway
YES! @RobGeorge @washingtonpost @FBI
I agree Paul this isn't right
@FBI The USA's "KGB"
@FBI Violations of antitrust laws by healthcare providers is als illegal. Stop it and healthcare cost collapses!!
I've been researching the judiciary committee executive business mtg minutes and they didn't seem to look at S255 once..in 2 years
R's control House, Senate & Executive...new laws restraining the FBI anyone? No more talk Rand, (correct) action please.
Illegal plunder.
They are to broad without due process.  Proving your innocence is not American.
They just legalize stealing this needs to be stopped
Please, let's get rid of fed & state civil forfeiture.  Talk about removing due process, civil forfeiture is one of the worst.
@FBI Abused by police across the US. Seizures prior to a conviction is plunder!
Thanks for pushing this! @SenMikeLee Will hopefully join you.
Not the FBI's job to punish anyone, that's the courts job. Jeez, ur law enforcement not Justice. How r u in the FBI?
i warned of this in the 80's when they first started it with the war on drugs...using that as cover for massive corruption
yet another reason for ArticleV reiterate that individual rights come from Creator; strengthen private property rights; end IRS
wow. Awesome move, Senator!
WOW CANT WAIT UNTIL THEY COME FOR YOU BAD BOYS...
@NewParisite @washingtonpost @FBI Yes it's bull shite & an abuse of power similar to the IRS abuse! Help @realDonaldTrump repeal
@FBI NOPE its not. If U do the WRONG thing. If U break the law 2 obtain ur $, ALL ill gotten gains shud B forfeit
well of course, but you should be convicted first.
Unless that's the trade. Avoid conviction, time & prosecution by giving up ill gotten gains
@FBI it's a violation of the 4th amendment & is a mafia tactic 
@FBI I don't agree with you often, but when u get it right it's really right!
@AngiaksNanook @radleybalko @FBI help Trump end this travesty Rand.
@FBI Says the former libertarian who now wants jail people for free speech.
No
why is this article from 2014? Did this already happen, or is it happening now?
Now this I can agree. The asset seizure programs are nothing more than out right piracy in many cases in this country#piratesofusa
thank you Rand, never give up  the good fight!
@FBI Please work to outlaw it.
@radleybalko @FBI What about this shit pal?!
Thats a lie
Check the facts Bub
Dems on the Hill should start CYA, because IRS and ethics are gonna get sticky. B careful about dissing Trump Admi.
One things for certain we stand 100℅ with Trump but will still seeright progress willbe done nomata who it upsets
Please do Rand this is ridicoulus just another way gov steals from us it's ours they have no right ...#SWR
#StandWithRand he awesome
@FBI "legal plunder" "jumbo shrimp" "larger half" and other #oxymorons.
plunder indeed
unconstitutional as it comes I see not how this hasn't already been struck down by courts as equivalent to a crime
civil asset forfeiture "@RandPaul: Nothing more than legal plunder. Due process anyone? http://bit.ly/2js6mYg  https://twitter.com/fbi/status/821445863704625156 …"

@FBI I never understand how easy it is for some people to actively work towards stealing others property.
abolition of this repugnant practice would be the ideal "reform", but sure, baby steps.
Sessions supports civil asset forfeiture. Please vote against him.
You can disagree on a single issue. The AG enforces law. He doesn't make law. Hence this bill.
Justice Department is a main avenue for police reform. Also Sessions staunchly supports War on Drugs
As I said the AG enforces the law. Sessions already said. If you want legal Marijuana. Change the laws.
Is this bill being reintroduced in the new session?
Damn right it is!
billions are stolen from innocent citizens every year.
Oh shit. I thought he was AGAINST more govt infringing our rights. But he is wanting more? Omg. Gotta read all the way through my friends.
He says he wants more civil seizure to crack down on the crack houses. That's how I read it.
Yeah read that again. This time w/o your political filter if its even possible for you to do so.
With you on this one. How about "due process" for loss of homes to predatory banks. Not same legal application, but worse outcome
any legislation in the works to address this?
Our entire court system is corrupted.  Cases assigned CUSIP NUMBERS! Corp seal in courts! Must be brought back original now! :)
@FBI thank you
I agree it is legal plunder. It is often taken advantage of by less than ethical law enforcement. Victims of crime benefit.. NOT
may I give a tent meeting Amen
Highway robbery !!
Thank you for shining light on this...

@MattWelch @kmele @KennedyNation
I don't agree with you on much, but you're 100% right on this.
Confiscate before the court date! Pre-trial denial of constitutional rights.
