@alllibertynews pro coal IS pro pollution
@RandPaul Why don't Libertarians care about the environment?  Oh right because underneath they are adolescents - it's all about "ME"!
@eainsaunt @RandPaul read the Constitution
@opelikacreek @RandPaul Oh right, Ayn Rand was an atheist.  Prob why no Libertarian will ever win the presidency
@eainsaunt @RandPaul what does anything you're saying have to do with Following the Constitution? Can't answer that one, can you?
@opelikacreek @eainsaunt @RandPaul The Constitution is a framework & it is not infallible. It is, and should be,subject to interpretation.
@eainsaunt @RandPaul it was literally written, literally depicted, and violated on a daily basis by fed govt.
@opelikacreek @RandPaul Hate to break it to you, but newsflash, the Constitution was not written by libertarians.
@eainsaunt @RandPaul ugh. Nothing you're saying g has any point or sense to it. There WERE no parties then, that idiocy came later.
Isn't coal 'old  technology'? I think we should              reeducate the coalminers and train them for different careers.
@RandPaul  Please do Rand we need productivity not stagnation . Hillary should be in jail
@RandPaul More pandering from a loser.  The industry is dying and you are lying.
@RandPaul  Dude...you endorsed the #KingOfDebt....go away.
@reluctantzealot @RandPaul dude, he kept his word to the party and those who elected him. Hardest thing he's ever done.
YOU go away.
@opelikacreek @RandPaul   Rand choose Party over Principle....his choice... he's now court jester for the #KingOfDebt
@reluctantzealot @RandPaul I know you're stuck on that kick, & I'm #NeverTrump I just don't blame a man for doing what he promised to do.

Sir, we need NEW resources for our energy demands. And, we need to be prepared for the transition. People BEFORE business.
@RandPaul you should mount a third party bid. We need you as president
@RandPaul I work in the oil field. Help us!!!
@RandPaul coal is dirty energy and needs to be phased out your remiss in not preparing your voters for the inevitable
@RandPaul Why not disengage from any money the coal industry has given you and focus on getting safe solar jobs for workers #winwin

@RandPaul redirect to renewable energy. Stem the flow of $$ to your pocketbook from the coal industry. Stop raping the land for $$$
@hangglidded @RandPaul turn your power off
HRC is fighting a battle we are not ready to begin. We need NEW jobs BEFORE closing old jobs. People BEFORE business.
@RandPaul you need to get on board with the honest people left in this nation God's people we're talking not playing
@RandPaul I As a libertarian believe in  the free market resolution, but there is no market free of federal regulations persuading outcome.
@RandPaul why not promote new energy, instead of holding onto out dated and self destructive ideas?
@RandPaul Coal is going the way of the buggy whip. Help these workers transition to clean energy jobs. That's what a true leader would do.
@RandPaul sorry to see you won't support Trump, time for a new age GOP #lifetimepolitician needs to end!!!!!
@RandPaul 
Climate Change used to be called Global Warming but the temperature kept fluctuating based on Earth's orbit around the sun.
@RandPaul U can't stop Climate Change unless U can control Earth's orbit around the sun.Am I the only one who paid attention in High School?
@RandPaul when are people going to realize that it is fossil fuels that is bringing third world countries out of poverty and saving lives
@RandPaul Shouldn't you be fighting to end the use of dirty fuels that are helping destroy the earth and kill us instead?
@RandPaul What a fantastic story is life. http://eracle.stiforpmovie.com/ 
@RandPaul shame on you  supporting trump
@RandPaul they should adapt or become outdated, just like anybody else. No special protections to industry you hypocrite!
@RandPaul Coal; dying on its own. Market forces have helped clean energy become more profitable, old energy less so. Nothing nefarious there
@RandPaul #StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016

Ash Pools in Every Home
@RandPaul
@RandPaul please don't tell me you deny the scientific reality of climate change
@RandPaul and supporting @realDonaldTrump and his war on the whole world. Sad
@RandPaul Hillary hasnt been in the Senate for 8 years, so what exact policies of hers have constituted a "War on coal"
@RandPaul So basically a few jobs > environment. Wth?!?
@RandPaul you should be trumps vp!
@RandPaul id say "spend a year in beijing & see if you feel the same about coal" but you probably would, since youre a colossal fucking tool
@RandPaul surely you're pushing for free market innovation in that field, as well?
@UrNotThatSmart @RandPaul he most def is. Deregulation to use his word.
@RandPaul Switching away from coal dependency is not just a Hillary goal, it is a health and environmental issue for any concerned citizen.
@RandPaul

@RandPaul HELP #TRUMP PUT HILLARY OUT OF BUSINESS
@RandPaul FFS, I'm certain you've locked up the coal vote.  Will you stand for anything else?
@RandPaul Srsly we are out of the 20th century &  have entered the 21st century 16 years ago.. wake up to the times Rand, coal is out....
@SeabreezeCheryl @RandPaul prenatal chop shop, however, that's totally fine.
