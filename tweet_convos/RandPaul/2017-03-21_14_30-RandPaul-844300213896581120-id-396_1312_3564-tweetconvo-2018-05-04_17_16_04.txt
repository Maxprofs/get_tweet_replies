I urge the House to start over and I stand ready to work with the White House for REAL repeal and replace.  Let's keep our promises.
enough with the replace agenda! #FullRepealNoReplacement We're not socialist (yet). Healthcare is a responsibility, not a right.
no health care is a right
why?
there's literally nothing else that needs to be said because health care is one of those rights by definition
where is that definition?
someone who can't afford health care while they still work should still have the right to reasonable healthcare
why? What is reasonable healthcare?
I do too!
@mariannecope @freedomcaucus abolish govt involvement w healthcare! Cheaper for all
@PatVPeters @freedomcaucus please continue to stand against.  No Mandates & No free coverage to illegals
Why is the @POTUS so supportive of the #AHCA when it's not his promise to #RepealAndReplace? 
He lied to you.... hello!!!!
It's not a lie yet, but if it does, @POTUS's honor will fall in my eyes. Were you ok w O & HRC's lies.
Could u be more specific? Os foreign policy was shit, I'll give you that
You can keep your dr
Gov't will be transparent 
I turned over all my work-related emails
Rich should pay their fair share
1. Trumpcare will improve this?
2. I agree
3. I agree
4. You vote Republican, rich will benefit more, so u cant complain.
You have no idea how I vote. But that's not the point. Sanders has 3 mansions & paid 13% tax rate. No one complained.
What did Trump pay? How much does he own?
it's Obama Care LIKE.
Why is Ryan refusing full repeal? when that is why we gave u the Senate&House ACA BIZ&JOB KILLER @freedomcaucus #NoFullRepeal>2018
This may be the only opportunity to get this right. Ryancare is not what we want.
I believe we have to start somewhere.   Let the process begin.   Do something, please
It took us 2010&14&16 to SEND A MESSAGE 2 these Loser's STOP ACA&Still CRAP BILL @RandPaul @freedomcaucus TAKEMOUT VOTEGOP2018
...Thanks for having some balls! You might want @4LOVofScience to testify against the FDA, to really fix things!
You should stand with the best for the state not with ANY caucus or special interest
Please fight for Americans.
#istandwithfreedomcaucus
... Keep up the good fight against #AHCA. Let's get it right, not get it fast.
get out of the way you mucking fiddling fools.
and it shouldn't pass if Reps and Senators want to keep their jobs in 2018.
I hope you and your families all lose their health insurance. Maybe then you will understand how callous you are.
It should not pass anything!  Paul Ryan will lose his district, I live in it.  in 4 yrs.  Fix Healthcare
Oh I hope so! Paul Nehlen is such a great choice.
Republicans that vote YES for current version of #Trumpcare will be penalized by Trump voters in 2018 #factsmatter
Sen. Ayn Rand should VOTE NO ON #AHCA  Keep #ACA, drop @RandPaul
please stay a no way GOP just repeal obamaboo care
I think you have had 7 years to come up with a better plan and this will not cut it. Your not capable of doing this
Only real choice is single payer. Medicare for all get profit out of healthcare.
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus don't give left wing joe the satisfaction. He's a traitor!
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus Thank you, Sir.
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus and Paul wonders why he never received greater than 10% in his presidential bid. No one will follow him
@tcmccarthy_ @freedomcaucus 
@realDonaldTrump GOP must Defund O Care, as of: Dec 31 2017. 
Eventually, 20 pg regulation for ins
I agree with you, full repeal and replace
I'm with you don't pass something for the sake of passing it. Do it right
I'm with u!Voted Trump but should not b issuing threat. Ryan should have included freedom cauc. No free health care
@mariannecope @freedomcaucus 
Step1) repeal
Step 2) nix regulations / Tort reform
Step 3) don't replace
Step 4) free market
St
Ye we know you want to make the rich richer
Obamacare needs to be repealed! Please! We, the American people paying for this need your help! Vote YES! Please!
@robdelaney @freedomcaucus Nothing like being against a shitty bill because it isn't shitty enough for you.
i need more help sigle moman alone on ssi have many health issues
#Ryancare is a dog.  #tryagain @SpeakerRyan
total repeal & replace no illegals covered lower premiums.
legislate Senator.   Add any fix you can get thru the Senate.   Why make the House do your work?
We the People gave the Republicans the House and the Senate , do the job the American People demand you do !
@nottinghams1  How about #singlepayer
@realDonaldTrump - NO to RyanCare- Obamacare Lite!
If the Republicans don't support our President folks like me won't be voting for you! Hope u read this. TRUE STORY!
AND SOON YOU WILL STAND IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE #TURNCOAT #RINO
Stand your ground, We never wanted Ryan Care we do want OBCARE Repealed and market independence
#Constitution #Conservatives #Rule. The Senate & Congress & @POTUS are racing Obama to be a Fabian Socialist. Don't like it screw you too.
@liberty_grl @freedomcaucus #FullRepeal stand your ground.
Can we just allow people to buy high deductible policies - like $25,000 deductible and pay cash for regular care?
Stop ALL government till Russia connection is resolved...operating under false pretenses...illegitimate
you have no alt other than kill acu.  You will loose the house/senate.  Had 8 years to find alt. Start w/Ryan plan
Stand strong & tell the @POTUS to STOP listening to @SpeakerRyan! Full repeal & replace is needed! @realDonaldTrump
Thank you.  I agree with you.
@PatVPeters @freedomcaucus Hammer it out Senator... Repeal and Replace. Get it done!
@JoeNBC senator please vote no on trump care the man is a fraud and a ConMan !
Why dont you create a unified Senate Bill that can pass the Senate with 51 votes or more? The Senate is the block
Repeal Obamacare, don't replace it #OPENMARKET
Stay the course Senator, please!
let's see some significant steps toward a free market in healthcare and a timeline for achieving complete f-market
@NetworksManager @freedomcaucus Wow way to destroy everything you won So we keep Obama care no tax cut that puts us where?
Sen pse reconsider, get rid of ACA then go back and edit this AHCA bill
I stand with Freedom Caucus too!  Want to REPEAL but not with this RINOcare.
repeal, no replace, get Govt out of HC
Thank you for doing the right thing for the wrong reason!
you have free health care and leave the rest of us to struggle. Get to work for us and create s plan that works
@hplem @freedomcaucus - Foundation of #AHCA is flawed - that fed govt should bestow healthcare on states/citizens. House of cards.
People need healthcare to live why is it ok for people w/o access to healthcare to die in the streets in ur america
you don't care about the American people so stop pretending you do!
@Reapers_Creed @freedomcaucus Trump promised repeal and replace. This is nothing more than removing the label "Obamacare".
Thank you.
@NetworksManager @freedomcaucus @SpeakerRyan you have created a fiasco was this the plan to delegitimize @POTUS
I Stand with @freedomcaucus. RT and show your support! #IStandwithFreedom @RandPaul @POTUS @HouseGOP #ConservativeValues
If GOP did clean repeal,please explain how replace gets past dem filibuster;GOP promised repeal+replace;2018 doom
You guys are snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
Stop being an obstructionist. This is the only chance we have to fix obamacare.
Rand started the repeal and replace simultaneously now just repeal? Confused
Rand said repeal and replace simultaneously. Everyone on board now says no???
@NetworksManager @freedomcaucus -Agree! Vote NO!
@NetworksManager @freedomcaucus  Pass it , let it fail in congress
STAND W/@freedomcaucus
stop you lunatic this bill is part of the plan, your finished if you block this
Senator fix problems w/Obamacare, dont repeal & replace w/garbage Ryan & Trump are pushing. Healthcare shouldnt b4 profit
fix it asap or all you senators will feel the burn.
well at least u and a few more republicans have a brain and better yet a heart!!
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus you sir are a treasonous traitor McCain ask Senate to ratify the Russian treaty you voted no just you
you bright fellows haven't come up with an alternative after all this time of promising to do so. Wake up GOP
You're a complete and total obstructionist. Stop your temper tantrum and pass this bill!
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus healthcare before Ava was not accessible or affordable.  A myth.
it should be reformed more deeply
you talking about Trumpcare?
And I stand with you.
@spyguy8080 @freedomcaucus ya'll need to figure this out!  Looking weak gives Libs/Dems opportunity to criticize Repub.
Stop this crazyness!  Want the Gov OUT of health care to the maximum level. No mandates, no paying for immigrants
Thank you, @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz and the @freedomcaucus
for standing against this mockery of true reform.
@Politillogic
Wait, it has to get OUT of the House first so the @SenateGOP  can introduce markup version, stop the politics
* agree with you go see president I think he'll listen people are scared
Vote YES!!
TY for your leadership on ACA & holding to promise of ALL Rs in numerous campaigns:  FULL REPEAL.  Period.
.@RandPaul @JoeNBC @freedomcaucus    Please call it #Trumpcare not #ObamacareLite    Also, improve #Obamacare than gut it. #morningjoe
@BenWilhelm1230 @freedomcaucus
Thank you Senator.  Rep. Ryan is neither convincing nor truthful.
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus you mean RIP
what was w/ Nato vote and selling off private info to companies. Don't be a partisan hack!
Thanks for being complete friggin a$$holes and playing right into the Dem and MSM hands.  Big win, huge......JERKS
@RestoreHistory @freedomcaucus good . Need Free market w/billing transparency and more robust patient protections!
We need a bill that creates more doctors nurses hospitals clinics and medicine to hold down cost too.
When will @GOP learn to stop snatching defeat from the jaws of victory? Thanks for fighting for the ppl!
Traitor
thank you, Sir, for your service to our citizens and our constitution.
@georgefayner @freedomcaucus should t it be about ALL AMERICANS?
@georgefayner @freedomcaucus Why can't ACA b updated instead of wasted tax $ on repealing & displacing millions from health ins?
Keep up the good fight Rand. NH loves you.
I hope you're right senator. I hope it fails the house. Simple and full repeal.
Sen Paul knows that a full repeal and replace bill will NEVER pass the Senate. Fruitless effort, ACA stays.
just keep tweeting. Right vs quick. Do this right. Don't lose momentum.
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus 
Why do you oppose NATO expansion?
@NoahWWall @freedomcaucus The American people overwhelmingly want to keep The ACA. Listen to us. Grow up, Please!
voting with Democrats is not a conservative position. It is self serving and y'all should be ashamed of yourselves
You guys look like fools all this should of been worked out years ago. I admit  @RandPaul plans was ready but nobody considers your plans 
@jbendery @freedomcaucus It is Trumpcare.  But, of course, Obamacare is just Romneycare Lite, right?
funny how u guys r good at protesting but suck at governing keep standing tall and give it back to them
u will be more comfortable and yea i get it no one ever gets 100% the first time but hey 3 branches isn't enough
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus I hope you don't cave RP.
Keep up the battle for real repeal and replace.
We get it.  Your job isn't complete until people are dying and poor people are smacked down. #zerocompassionGOP
@DagnyDelinquent @freedomcaucus I like you Rand but if you don't figures a way to get together your all going to be voted out
we can't wait any longer . The American people gave you the house senate and White House . Get with it!
Senator, may be hard to swallow but health care SHOULD be socialized. It works better than free market.
pass a repeal when it means something. No more political posturing. When is your next meeting with the president?
you need to focus on this 24 hours a day the working and middle class are getting killed by ACA. Get this done.
@jbendery @freedomcaucus 

We *WISH* it was Obamacare lite. 
The #AHCA is the real Death Panel.
better make sure you repeal soon. I can't take these premiums (tripled) and deductibles($15,000) much longer...
@hectormorenco @freedomcaucus  Keep up the good work!!! We are  for your success #MAGA
please tell me we can get or adjust ins anytime any day! NO ENROLLMENT PERIOD! Life changes
#MedicareForAll
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus C'mon, repeal the ACA now! I want your voters to experience what they voted for.
Rand you should be at forefront of new bill no Ryan. Why doesn't @POTUS  get this?
Perfectionist Prigs!
@EternaFreeda @freedomcaucus Sir, PLEASE do not sign the Ryan Care bill; this is not what Republicans promised us!!!
Quality HCare doesn't mean forced insurance. Why does Medishare work so well? It's a co-op group. No gov funds needed
Repeal DO NOT REPLACE Get Big government out of our business.
So u Wud rather see effort in house go for naught than have a chance to amend it later? Bad optics for GOP!
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus Everyone should be as self-made as you. You need no one you rely on no one - did it all yourself - right.
a mandate is a mandate by any other name-THATS what makes both unconstitutional. NOTHING else matters
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus What's the odds DJT pulls these NO votes to YES votes by Thursday?? Deal maker...let's see
You're one of the few I trust, @RandPaul 

Persuade Trump to honor his promises. @freedomcaucus
A no is better than a yeah for this bill. After 7+ years of promises to fix ACA this is the best the Rep. House can come up with???
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus  go Rand go.  Vote no.
republicans that sending millions off of health care doesn't fix the problems with Obamacare
lower rates...however I am sure you will disagree...All I ask though is that you try to convince your fellow
I'm convinced pres Trump doesn't know how insure works or he would understand you don't get insure after you sick
repeal of Obamacare care is what the country needs...we need to improve upon what Obamacare is so that it does have
Senator Paul you are one of the republicans I as a dem can see actually cares about people but I don't think a...
Ryan is working with Obama-Clinton Coup.  He doesn't care about Voters only what Obama tells him to do.
Obama repealed Cheap Free market HCare give it back to us. No mandates, subsidies, taxes. Buy across state lines
Buddy boy, let's see how the "Deal Maker" does on Thursday.  #AHCA
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus Vote No.  That bill is crap
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus you cant have a true bill w/out the support or input from across the aisle.They are making the same mistake
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus #Trumpcare
It is Obamacare Lt. Fully Repeal! The we can always add Benefits back in for needy! Portability for Insurance Co.
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus so your point is after 7 years you still do not have a solution.  Either put up or shut up #fixhealthcare
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus this healthcare act is making opposites pull together. Not a great policy when opposites agree it is bad
Why can't you make the changes you want now that it's on the table and open to discussion?
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus work it out!!!!!
Why don't you get to work and make it better. Quit complaining and get to work with your fellow republicans
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus Repeal Obamacare now!  GOP has had 7 years to put the repeal together so repeal it NOW!
@POTUS pays 4illegals/refugees-Citizens don't approve @Jim_Jordan @RepMikeTurner #DrainTheSwamp #tcot #ccot #MAGA
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus It's crappier now than it was last week. To hell with this! Repeal ACA, & NONE of ya'll will be reelected.
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus idiot
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus thank you Rand!
@JoeNBC @freedomcaucus what's in your #kompromat file, Rand?
