@RandPaul http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/02/29/donald-trump-republican-party-elections-2016-third-party-column/81102918/ … -- if not to do New Hampshire over, then you lead a new third party as Randy Barnett suggests.
@RandPaul http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/02/29/donald-trump-republican-party-elections-2016-third-party-column/81102918/ …
