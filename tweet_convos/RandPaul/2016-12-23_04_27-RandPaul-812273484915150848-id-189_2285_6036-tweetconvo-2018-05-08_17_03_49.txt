Hello again, I hope everyone is having a Happy Festivus! It's once again time for my annual #AiringofGrievances...
On the media & #fakenews: Festivus is real, media, so don't try 2 fact check it. And @TheOnion is more accurate than a Brian Williams report
New administration is lookin good. Haven't seen this many billionaires in 1 place since I staked out Bilderbergs w/ Alex Jones. Good times.
.@peterthiel is advising the President Elect. That's great. But his plan 2 make the Statue of Liberty into a digital stop sign is a bit much
I know I've said a lot about @AmbJohnBolton so you're probably expecting me 2 say something nice for the holidays. Nope. #AiringofGrievances
My favorite Cabinet pick is what's his name, umm it's that guy who wanted to eliminate the Dept. of @ENERGY. Hang on I'll think of it...
New administration has some great people. But I wanna know who has to tell @realdonaldtrump he can't build a golf course on the South Lawn?
I've only just begun. I'll be back to talk waste, more gov grievances and nonbinding resolutions against my Senate colleagues #HappyFestivus
What do sea monsters, a superhero cartoon in Pakistan & gambling habits of Ugandans have in common? It's time for more #AiringofGrievances!
The national Park Service announced a grant 2 study “Knowledge, Experience and Beliefs of the Supernatural Environment.” #AiringofGrievances
I bet you didn't know the federal government is using $30,000 of your taxes to study Ugandan gambling practices. #AiringofGrievances
The Department of State, is advertising a $1.25 million grant opportunity to produce a superhero cartoon in Pakistan. #AiringofGrievances
Those are just a few examples. Our hard-earned money is wasted everyday while our citizens, vets & infrastructure suffer #AiringofGrievances
We’ve got a lot of problems w/ how our tax dollars are spent & you've only heard about some. But I'm not done yet...http://bit.ly/2h9Ob71 
For those of you "media" writing serious stories about my Festivus jokes, I don't even know what to say, just stop...#AiringofGrievances
Speaking of fake drama, this administration is the first to include 2 @WWE hall of famers. My grievance is, why isn't Mean Gene press sec?
I'm very sorry to have been the one to tell @jackhunter74 pro wrestling is not real in that last tweet.
Also, for those who think @WWE is real, I'm very sorry Bernie Sanders lost.
Of course here in our own office my adviser @dougstafford thinks the @nyjets are real too. I can't convince him or Woody otherwise...
Sticking with sports for a minute, I have an idea for @HBO: hard knocks, congressional baseball version.
They follow as a bunch of old guys who didn't play ball in college attempt to not break themselves each year for charity #AiringofGrievances
Great, now I'm proposing reality shows too. The new environment in DC is catching...#AiringofGrievances
I'm grateful you've followed along with me today as in last years. I try to have fun sometimes. This town needs it.
I'll be celebrating Christmas with my family this weekend. We wish you a merry Christmas if you are too.
If you only celebrate Festivus, enjoy today and I hope you win the feats of strength later. I've been practicing...
I decided I'd take on someone who thought he was a tough guy. Bring it, @SenatorReid #featsofstrength
I was gonna pick Mitch, but every time I tried to bring it up the Capitol Police kept getting twitchy. Sorry guys.
A few years ago I complained that my colleague @CoryBooker didn't retweet me enough. Apparently he can't take a hint. #AiringofGrievances
On a positive note, since that exchange @CoryBooker & I have worked on many criminal justice bills, proving Festivus brings us all together.
My other colleagues @SenMikeLee & @SenTedCruz are rumored to be on the Supreme court short list. @survivorcbs is gonna be so nerdy this year
"As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!"
time to overhaul Dodd-Frank so less government involvement and more citizen friendly, especially to lower income families
If you run for POTUS again try not to kiss Sheldon Adelson right on the sphincter. Off to one side would be good. More dignified.
Airline humor:
good man! I've made a donation on your behalf.
Humor AND an individualist. How refreshing!
you're fun!  Bet you vote for all, or nearly all of the Trump nominees you're trolling here ..
me & Jerry have the SAME HIPPO CAMPUS

I may not agree with you on several things, but this is fantastic.
My grievance is that the Dems are still pouting like a bunch of entitled whackadoodles over the election results. #GrowUp
like your side didn't pout for eight years?
We had the right to complain. POTUS doubled Natl Debt,wrecked healthcare, slowed the economy, worse recovery since WWII
yeah.  None of that is true.  You started up against him day one, when he had done nothing but be black.
I have ZERO issue with Obama being black, I have HUGE issues with his Anti-biz, anti-American ultra-liberal BS
unless you condemn the Republican's Day One strategy, you are painted with their brush.  Willing to do that?
I wish you were my senator. California sucks.
California has a 3 billion dollar surplus.
Where do you think that $ came from?  People's pockets.  So proud your govt overtaxed- great job!
I know it came from the people. Arnold left California 7 billion dollars in debt.  Which is better??
@TweetGyorgi more ranting about real problems needed, like our president-elect calling for an arms race.
u too.
Maybe they banned it because it's lame.
@alllibertynews I am sick of the media endless advocacy for more wars.  War with  a really bad idea.  Why the warmongering?
Why can't I substitute with dark meat in my bucket from @LeesFamousChick? There outta be a law! #AiringofGrievances
you gave us a good laugh. We're a franchise system, so offerings vary by location. Send us a DM!
Banning making $ off of Seinfeld is hilarious...

#Festivus
#bannon damn autocorrect
Do you think Trump will make a difference?
I wish to air my grievances... Now that you've made a mockery of me and my kind.
Crappy Festivus Senator
you're perfect. I'd love to see you on the libertarian party ticket in 2020! #rand2020
@kevinmarsh
I feel like y'all were channeling Rodney Dangerfield with those tweets. Well done!
Your party just handed the keys to the White House over to the Kremlin just so you can have more power. #AiringOfGrievances
Had to come to read them!  Don't stop!
Please tell us U are not one of the Republicans trying 2 keep 750,000 illegals from deportation? If not, can U tell us who they R?
how do I downvote?
I #Air #daily at least4 #oneday I'm going2 #celebrate the #birth of #JesusChrist even though #He was born #inJuly
#merrychristmas
@davidmccray13 I am grieved you're in government.
Don't waste your already low energy attacking Trump. We like you, but he's more popular than you realize.
Taxpayers would appreciate #AiringofGrievances alerts BEFORE a bill or budget is approved. As a whole, we could have all fought.
#AiringofGrievances How Democrats suck up to Obama even though they know he is responsible for the genocide in the ME and ISIS
Stick to taxes more than abortion next run, Rand. We loyally  tried to support you.Once you lost, we Trumped. Merry Christmas.
@nickychuchu @aye_gee96 @danny_mirbach  this man went off
love that so funny
Dead-eyed millennial social media interns are never going to make you a relevant political figure on the national level again.
I have a grievance why is the Washington post not considered a comic book because it's not a fucking newspaper

LOL
I know this is not government waste related - but can we eliminate the Designated Hitter?
I love you, keep up the good work.  Stay SAFE please. <3
Your entire thread on this makes you look like you're high af
The #AiringofGrievances by  @RandPaul about Washington is the greatest thing about 12/23 every year
finally got around to that crazy new show about nothing ey Paul?
now for Feats of Strength and Feats of Trump's nuclear idiocy

@thecivilcomment has it NOT been Festivus since 11/8?
good point. 
.@RandPaul I wish #obama would just shut up and show some class #Hillary #Trump #love #cute #tbt #me #girl #followme #girl #fun #like #like
@spyguy8080 We can say Merry Christmas   Or Happy Hanukkah. I have no idea who the heck Festivus is nor do I want to know.
thank you! My apology to you and Dr. Paul.
.Merry Xmas.Pls helpus with studebtLoans.Whynot reducing studentloans2principle&split it4ways,fed,bank,state&student&state lawapply
awesome list of grievances
You rock
It's amazing how many Tweeters lack a sense of humor. Oh, well - I guess not everyone can have it all. #AiringofGrievances
I've got a lotta problems w/ you people ... & you're gonna hear about it!!
Is there a plan behind having so many billionaires in  cabinet ?
I'll take wrestling hall of famers over all the Muslim loving idiots Obama had, hell maybe we can get one to replace you in KY!!!
you just went up a few notches in my book. #Festivus
@lilAuburnboy @TrillTitty look at this thread its practically art
holy shit the bilderbergs tweet
Hoping everyone has made a generous donation to the Human Fund in honor of Festivus
What poses a bigger threat to America ISIS, RUSSIA, ZILLOW or HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS?
Will celebrate when you guys can get #FATCA off our backs. Restricts my retirement investment options in Taiwan.
@SwissTechie @RandPaul  Consider repealing citizenship based taxation. We don't want to be Eritrea anymore.
Or at the very least relax reporting requirements on ordinary citizens providing for families & future
locals should only have to report to the local jurisdiction in which they reside. #FATCA is criminal @mambomeyhe @RandPaul
Agreed. And in Taiwan, some investments are off limits to us due to reporting requirements.
Do you guys have any clue as to what you have allowed to happen to a GREA COuNTRY

my #AiringofGrievances is much different, but what the heck, happy #Festivus
who let you enjoy 80s sitcoms.
I forgot how much fun this was!  Tuning in
Meanwhile #Traitor SOB @RandPaul pens letter to Iran's gov't behind back of Americans & votes to shut down OUR health care how many times?
Ok I don't agree w/ or understand some of @RandPaul #airingofgrievences but they really are a must read https://twitter.com/randpaul/status/812273484915150848 … #festivus
Good morning Seinfeld fans and Happy Festivus everywhere! Today I'll have my annual #AiringofGrievances. Join me here throughout the day...
This is why you're awesome dude!
This is my favorite thing @RandPaul does. The man
Good morning Seinfeld fans and Happy Festivus everywhere! Today I'll have my annual #AiringofGrievances. Join me here throughout the day...
@calmkuether  @RandPaul - Love Rand for this
@alllibertynews If the number 2.3 Million doesn't factor into your grievances, you're not trying hard enough.
I wish you were the Majority Leader in the Senate
one or two GOP Senators could literally save the world in 2017. You are among the potential few.  #sos
As its #1 priority, your party plans to take away my healthcare which could drive me into bankruptcy. #AiringOfGrievances
