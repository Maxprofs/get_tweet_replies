No one has fought harder for your right to privacy and 4th amendment rights than I have https://randpaul.com/issue/ending-nsa-spying … #DemDebate
@RandPaul Come back when you support higher disposable income even if it means higher taxes #DemDebate
@amoyal @RandPaul how would higher taxes result in higher disposable income? Lower taxes = higher disposable income.
@sweet_lou4 @RandPaul Single payer healthcare for example.
@amoyal @RandPaul that would result in higher healthcare costs and lower quality.
@sweet_lou4 @RandPaul Proof please.
@amoyal @RandPaul
@sweet_lou4 @RandPaul Gee, could you find something a little MORE biased?
@RandPaul That's nice, Rand. You'll also force women to serve as involuntary incubators. Talk about that, why don't ya?
@susanthe @RandPaul fetal genocide is cool, bc in the water.
@Bluecoat1776 @RandPaul  When you grow a set of ovaries, your opinion might interest me, BlueBoy.
@susanthe @Bluecoat1776 @RandPaul 
This argument dismisses the fathers rights to his child. Its dispicable and you should be ashamed.
@jokerbear54 Cry me a river. When you grow ovaries, get back to me.
@susanthe you would never accept the argument that without testicles your opinion doesn't matter. Reverse sexism & hypocrisy.
#Randpaul
@jokerbear54 waa. You want to make women's decisions for them, but I'm the sexist? #schmuck
@susanthe 
It seems sexist to believe a man doesn't deserve an opinion on his unborn child, or unborn children in general.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews incorrect demagogue statement, #VoteTrump2016 @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SafeAgain for #WeThePeople
@RandPaul how can common defense be construed to mean police the world?
@Bluecoat1776 @RandPaul I have no idea, unless the rest of the world are U.S. citizens.
@RandPaul @_emmylemon So, that went well. 
@RandPaul Help us give military #dueprocess rights. The single investigator model (Commander) is inherit w/ bias & undue command influence.
@RandPaul Failing to see that the 2nd Amendment is dangerous and outdated is part of the problem with you Constitution as Dogma zealots.
@RandPaul this is true
@QuoththeRavenSA QTR, Where do you think @RandPaul would stand on $HLF? Might he be too disciplined in libertarianism to be pragmatic?
@RandPaul @alllibertynews  curious - how does sponsoring a Personhood Amendment further a woman's right to personal freedom?
@RandPaul so you #FeelTheBern too?
@RandPaul Translation: "I will always stand up for white males, particularly rich no matter what". Thanks pal!
@MeanDanceFightr @RandPaul hey genius, learn what the bill of rights is before you speak on it. Hint: they're YOUR rights, too.
@StephensonOhio @RandPaul Point---over your head. It's cool bro, don't worry about it.
@RandPaul I have no doubt you mean what you say.  But what about the rest of the Constitution?  Laws and regulation through bureaucracy?
@RandPaul @MarcScottEmery WRONG PARTY...SORRY!
@RandPaul THE 14TH AMENDMENT TOO? BECAUSE...
@RandPaul The problem is, is that we shouldn't need the 2nd Amendment . . . and a lot of us don't want it.
@RandPaul  Student school exchange granted us citizen ship and we are equal even if crimes dice 1968 through the dept of justice if was sot
@RandPaul you are correct, people will wake up one of these days, I hope
@RandPaul I believe Sanders will do more to protect that.  You are the best of R's, but still an R.  Get out of the R rhetoric.
@RandPaul And that the green card was dim issued due to schools and birth of and if leaving must have a passport if not ten year residency
@RandPaul And whites are minority and then the Indians but I also read in 1774 that Mexico and onterio qubeck Alaska hawieii are states
@RandPaul  Stand up taller Rand. You are the voice people don't want to hear cause the truth hurts!
@RandPaul  The civil rights and the dear action of independence  I read first it's 1-4 Mexicans spics green card blacks Nigro need greencard
@RandPaul you're losing to Jeb.
@RandPaul I love this strategy, keep up the social media, and hard work. You will win by a #Randslide #demdebate #RandPaul2016
@RandPaul You, sir, are a joke.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul that's why you're the only candidate I support. Anyone else who gets my vote would be a "lesser of two evils" candidate
@RandPaul Good for you Rand, but you refused to debate the other night. That was a bad idea.
@RandPaul you're done.  You are toast
@RandPaul not to mention a champion of common sense solutions. #liberty #RandRally
@RandPaul what do you mean "stand by the entire bill of rights.."?
@RandPaul @timothycrickets & will STAND w/ MITCH MCCONNELL YOU PHONY !!!!!!!!!!!!!
@RandPaul wait, who is Bill
@RandPaul i thought i dropped out the race a few weeks ago..
@RandPaul you nor the Dems want the info to be able to accessed or kept, therefore YOU WILL NOT GET MY VOTE!
@RandPaul a little reading comprehension would tell you that the 2nd Amendment deals with well-regulated militias.
@RandPaul If the original Constitution is so great and infallible, do you think we should go back to letting only white men vote?
@RandPaul Really, Rand? I hope you'll stand up for this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8fMcdGypKM … Seriously. Because it's coming your way. @startribune @wcco
@RandPaul thanks for the reminder that you're still in the race. We all forgot
@RandPaul cool dude
@RandPaul Shush, please. You're not in this debate either.
@Live_Free_orDie @RandPaul @tedcruz  Ted can even show up to vote on #endthefed   ....#endtheted
@Live_Free_orDie @RandPaul @tedcruz  that's a shitty excuse
@Live_Free_orDie @SenateMajLdr @RandPaul @tedcruz  man I got an issues with all politicians bro lol
@RandPaul That is absolutely true .
@RandPaul The data has to BE THERE and BE ABLE TO BE ACCESSED when a warrant is issued! If data is gone the warrant is USELESS! #DemsDebate
@RandPaul unfortunately, people want big, stupid, unkeepable promises.
@RandPaul once again you manage to interject a superbly unintelligent anecdote to the debate
@RandPaul who are you again?
@RandPaul We Support you Rand
@RandPaul #standwithrand
@RandPaul don't u love it
@RandPaul If you don't get the presidential nomination, can you please challenge McConnell to be Majority Leader. The people want you to be
@RandPaul no you won't, you are bought and paid for.
@RandPaul Rand is the only candidate who will stand for the ENTIRE Bill of Rights! #DemDebate #RandRally #StandWithRand
@RandPaul  Only one so truthful n honest 100% protect n serve the entire Bill of Rights. #StandwithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul #yourenitwinning

@RandPaul You don't pick and choose?  How do you expect to be a politician?  You sound like a statesman to me.  #demdebate
@RandPaul why was @GovChristie on stage and not you?
@RandPaul They're for privacy! #DemDebate
