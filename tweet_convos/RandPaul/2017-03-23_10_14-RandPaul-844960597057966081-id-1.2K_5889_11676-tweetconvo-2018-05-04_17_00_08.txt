Yes, we need to ensure that the maximum number of Americans are without health care!
Whaaaaat? What you mean is how can we make everybody else pays for ours. And it's not HC it Healths Ins. Wake up
All insurance pools risks & costs. That's how it works.  Try Googling "basics of insurance".
That's why Obummer care didn't work it was based on a socialist utopia that can't exist. No college here but I read
ummm. No. Universal health care, often single payer, works. The GOP fantasy of a "market" solution /1
depends on how you define "works" If you mean 2d rate care with long waiting lists, then yes, it works
yes, single payer systems do tend to have longer wait times, but overall quality generally comparable
And why NOW be concerned with people losing coverage? Millions LOST it in wake of Obamacare-none cared
Now the takeaway.
GOP tells commoners if we don't accept MASSIVE tax they'll never lift it. 
HOLD THE LINE
@RandPaul
We can do real repeal. The naysayers are wrong. Hold the line for #FullRepeal. Pull the House bill, delay the vote & let's do this right
Paul Ryan Financed 300k Obama's muslims, Sold Internet & Refused REPEAL Healthcare Tax.
#DumpPaulRyan
Paul Ryan has never been #MAGA,instead pushes his Better Way agenda vs Middle America's President! #DC
#DumpPaulRyan
Vote Healthcare Bill Down & Paul Ryan Will Have 2 Resign As Speaker
This Is Only Way We Get #MAGA Agenda Accomplished
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Otherwise We Don't Get Trump's #MAGA Agenda. In Fact We Get Paul Ryan's Better Way Legislation That We Have Rejected
Vote Healthcare Bill Down & Paul Ryan Will Have 2 Resign As Speaker
This Is Only Way We Get #MAGA Agenda Accomplished

House Republicans need to REMOVE Speaker Ryan.
He's been working vs Middle Americans+TrumpTrain the whole time.

Yes where with you senator Paul Let's do this right
GOP controls House, Senate and White House, but conservatives (actual conservatives) barely control anything :(
I mean GOP ran on repealing it...I was very optimistic they will do it. They repealed >50 times when Obama = Prez
I particularly hate so-called "moderates" like Charlie Dent & Susan Collins pushing for something worse than AHCA
I know right. They allow the media to write "GOP Senator supports/said xyz" in headlines.
@POTUS git r done sir
@elliemae0404  and what exactly will happen to a system set up for Obamacare? Do you even have a viable replacement plan ?
@Warrior4Victory I submit to #resistfullrepeal Once original plan is repealed, Senate will send back for objections,then negotiate
@allheretr
@therealroseanne let's get it done ignore Dems they ignore us
You & others ONLY care about what the Insurance companies want. They don't make money, you don't get any money!!!
@tempteststorm2 you better do something or I can see the adds for the Dems 2018. Republicans fail to unite on Obamacare. Premiums rise
@Warrior4Victory #resistfullrepeal I was a believer ofyour Caucus until u wouldn't budge even remotely 2get Initial repeal passed
Repeal this crap Deregulate and the market will fix itself based on what consumers want and market pricing will allow
Sen. Rand Paul, What is your vision for making a good health care plan? Trump should have you spearhead the reform committee!
Oh, you can do the repeal, but what about a replacement that continues to help people and not hurt them?
Exactly!
@FreedomWorks
Full repeal no replacement.
@seanhannity Proud of the Freedom Caucus today!!! 
Me too! @freedomcaucus @SenMarkMeadows @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @Jim_Jordan @FreedomWorks  #FULLREPEAL
You're no patriot lady, & the freedom caucus has no idea what freedom means.
You're saying take it back to where is was before so that Insurance co. can determine what's covered & premiums so they can make money.
worked better than Obamacare and much cheaper
More "out of pocket" cost
oh please don't waste everyone's time with this propaganda.
FBI director offered no evidence! Morrell said no evidence of collusion do your HW
@jstines3 
do what's actually best for American ppl. U guys cannot afford to get this wrong. Do so and Dems will run things again
What's best is #FullRepeal and a return to FREE MARKETS -- no gov't interference!
100% correct but will never happen. Political suicide. Dems knew regardless of result, that control was n place forever
Good gov. Healthcare is an oxymoron.  It doesn't exist and will never exist.  PASS THE BILL! TAKE THE WIN!  And move on.
It's not a win.
can you comment on why you think, Healthcare Antitrust laws should be done away with, in conj. With HC reform? Or a link to doc?
read that said it and drive this home
@Gas8128 Meanwhile money is going to #PlannedParenthood to abort BABIES!
@oasisupernova Full repeal W/ no replacement, kick healthcare back to states and help fund #DirectCare startups like @AtlasMD
@NetworksManager As far as many are concerned, Congress is a swamp, which Trump has no power to drain. And there lies the problem.
@brad_studio I sure hope you are right. Actually, I pray you are right. Please don't be wrong.
@NetworksManager   I agree. Total repeal. It will work out
Just wipe it now. Why prolong the pain.
@NetworksManager Fine. OK. I'm with you. Now. Make. It. Happen. And. Soon.
@NetworksManager Do it! Talk is cheap! And cheap asses only talk! Kentucky expects more! Do it!
@JJussely IM REALLY STARTING TO LIKE THIS GUY
I liked him before he just doesn't have the passion we needed to MAGA
@therealroseanne Great idea Senator ! #FULLREPEAL We agree
Why can't Trump simply direct the HHS to re-auth short term med insurance policies up to 1 year?Easy to do & would show Good Faith
Enough! Get it worked out. Do it right. Don't let up 'til it's the right bill to push Obamacare off a cliff. #noexcuses
@therealroseanne just throw it in the trash and start fresh
@kekcorn 

How do you plan on getting past a democratic filibuster?
Yes, yes, yes!
CAN U DO IT PLEASE A #FullRepeal.& REPLACE WE NEED IT WE VOTED TRUMP & REPUBLICAN SO @POTUS PROMISES ARE KEPT
PLEASE WORK ON IT
yes... Full repeal
@therealroseanne Not my bill=no bill! We heard you loud and clear! Your way or no way! Got it!
yes do it right & it's too important to rush. Just don't screw around with Medicare, a lot us baby boomers voted for Trump..
Full repeal and REPLACE! Alt right owe the American people. Do your job or get OUT!
@therealroseanne Dump Ryan. The House needs a new LEADER...someone who has POTUS back and cares about Americans. HC too costly!!!
Senator, after 7 years you were not ready. You missed your chance move on.
Go Rand Paul!!!
@therealroseanne no follow Bernie sanders plan free healthcare 4 all not just politicians u need 2 b a US citizen 2 get it WAKEUP
@therealroseanne true
@jij3410 please make this happen
@geoff_deweaver why don't u keep what u have #ACA... and fix it!!! Make the insurance companies lower their premium s..
I think all big Pharma companies need to be removed entirely from Washington and not controlling Politicians via money @RandPaul
and NO LOBBYING..IN CONGRESS..MAKE IT A FELONY.. OH .CONGRESS...make them buy healthcare like everyone else  free
Why don't u get with #AARP & #AMRC & have them price out w health carriers how they could help 50-64 yr olds get coverage & save
@NetworksManager -  Do the health care bill with what real people need, don't insure illegals, keep cost down, just get it done
@Deplorangel   I'm afraid Rinos will never vote for full repeal! 7 years of lying to their constituents!
Will you replace Paul Ryan as speaker of the house? Please 
Repeal and then address cost of care. Insurance premiums will follow.
@cms full repeal of regulations let it b open choice insurance across state lines states can choose Obamacare it shouldnt b  fed
So proud to say you are MY Senator. Hold the line! #holdtheline
@NetworksManager please get on this quick Rand! Be transparent to the American citizens!
The bill was killed by the Freedom Caucus, now you better make good with Rep. Jim Jordan & come up with a replacement.
I've felt this was the best path
@veganvecoh When are you going to stop screwing with @POTUS?

Are you listening, @realDonaldTrump?
kill the mandate mistake ... reminds of dredd scott decision ... n let its funding die. Full blame on prog dems then.
hey I believe you. I am glad we didn't pass Ryan care, please let's see what you have can you distribute?
@christymatson64 Get Government OUT of Healthcare! 
its funny you pass bills oboma vetod you had no intent to pass one
yes!!!!!!@realDonaldTrump
You are a RINO, step down and run a a Democrat like you really are.
@POTUS @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @C4Constitution @RandPaul YOU got what you wanted, now it is on YOU to come up with the bill.
Do it, or the dems will win the house and the Senate, don't  give up, who said replacement anyway? Repeal Obama tax
1 Bill w/all goodies - buy in all states, association buys, etc., on to Senate 2 fight & expose Dems for 60 votes.
start by working 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, like tax payers have to or your fired next election!
All in due time. Thank You! Senator Paul
#RyanCareSucks
how long will that take
STRUTH THE TRUTH 
FULL REPEAL OBAMACARE
Agree.  What part of the word "REPEAL" don't the Republicans understand?
tell pres Trump 2 sign executive order 2 deport the Koch brothers & fam Forefathers intended govt 2 b run by the ppl 4 the ppl
despite 7 years the Republicans in House screw it up ?  
exactly!  I'm proud of the house for doing that, it was not a failure for pres Trump nor the party...
thank you!!!!
HUMMM - Congress Doing Something Right - OXYMORON

Confidence In Congress --- Z_E_R_O

Career Politicians Only Line Their Pockets!
I'm tired of waiting. What are YOU doing? Give us more than a no vote!
@frespirit01 agree 100% I don't want health to be a political football & end up repealing every four yrs depending party in power
- Ryan took a shot and lost. Now the onus is on you and the Freedom Caucus. Draft a Bill and get it out there, up to you...
thanks Dr Paul you're still a hero. Go get em! We are going to keep winning.
there is no GOP, disunity makes membership to this party meaningless
Pull the House Speaker.
#LOSEYOURSEAT!!! Voting against your constituents is NEVER a good idea!!
Are you going file this legislative action of "FULL REPEAL", Senator @RandPaul ? NOTE: Silence on this "QUESTION" is not an option
@hrtablaze unfortunately y'all will never come together. If you were on Obamacare I'm sure things would get done faster.
Thank you Rand!
The American people are counting on Republicans to comprise and get a bill that works. We expect results. #RepealAndReplace
Amen!
@weavetheone stand firm
@FleischerCg there are no words to describe my frustration & anger with republicans especially @freedomcaucus I used to like you 
However, you might be screaming at what was allegedly in bill that did not pass. Ryan's RINOS own!
I'm not screaming
Yet! Hopefully we won't need to!!
I've given up politicians don't care about Americans they done have to use Obamacare
Get out of the way Rand. Your selfishness will be remembered.
don't kid yourself; U own Healthcare now; reach out 2 dems and fix this b/4 it gets worse. Mistake 2 go 2far rt or 2far left
How about we all get the healthcare plan the Congress has.
Make #congress have our plan!!
@SpeakerRyan TIME FOR Ryan TO GO NOW! The fights you enter, you always lose. Give your gavel to a winner..a conservative fighter!
Listen to him @realDonaldTrump
how about we pull Paul Ryan off the House bill instead?
Agreed. Now not the time to fingers,now the time to "Unify" and Re-try.
@elimcgowan you are wrong
wrong. U guys just screwed up. Bad move.
@GIAGM2013 Kill Obama Care Now!!!
Rand Paul is an obstructionist trying to do anything to make Trump look bad
What's plan-B if you fail, Ryan's? Concerned 30+ Reps stopped 200+ Reps today. How many Yes votes do you expect from them or Dems?
way to give a win to the Dems and another loss to the middle class
Thank you, sir, for getting this fetid turd of a bill stopped. Please find a way for both parties to work on this together. Long past due.
yeah repealing the good stuff too. Lets keep preventative mandatory, mkay? Id hate to keep paying more and getting less.
I sure hope you guys can get this done. I agree with you completely
your antics were unprofessional.. and you are part of the problem in DC..your message was made irrelevant as a result
@WolfensPride needs unity within the GOP. We are counting on you to unite the party and back our POTUS. 
U HAD & YRS TO DO IT !WHAT HAPPENED??SO NOW NOTHING HAPPENS EXCEPT POLITICAL END RUNS!!!
Delay it..do you even realize how many are struggling to afford insurance,deductibles,premiums,co pays,meds? Stop the bs and games
talk ......hold the line....whatever. How about some action
@DorH84607784 Agree, @RandPaul Get the gov and ins co out of making decisions about our healthcare. Back to doc/patient care.
DEFINATELY!
Yes, I agree. How could stay out of our healthcare and then big brother wanted more control.
@joehos18   agree 100%
@sandyschaper Here is leadership in the Senate. @RepMarkMeadows in House, build it.
@DeplorableSheil .... please take control of this!!!!
@paphotog Take the lead, sir.
Yes, do this!  #MAGA #repealobamacare
WHEN?! WHEN will the @GOP get it right?! Time is of the essence; we don't want to wind up with single-payer. @POTUS @VP @GOPHouse
Your toast come reelection time
u r fired
Yes!
@sNaPpPerHeaD Make it so, but do it fast and soon. Work overtime. Use the majority well.
I'm with you Sen Paul!  @realDonaldTrump please get rid of Ryan as speaker!!
Trump can't break his promise not to kick uninsured to the street. Shame on you.
Yescsir!
Yes Sir!
@DorH84607784  
Amen! Might save the medical profession from demise!
joke
not giving up. Let's do this Ran! Bring up the bill in the Senate. Full repeal!
@CelticCross52 Are you going to lead the charge on the next failure, tax reform? We have got nothing for our votes! 8yrs nothing!
BINGO!!
GO Rand..GO
Thanks buddy. 

@RandPaul
>>@RealTrumpDoc
Thank you!
@megan_j_martine / No, let Obamacare fail.
you are going to sit around and moan and groan while American's take it up the tailpipe with insurance we cant use!
I don't think you guys can do it right.
Did u see Americans' reaction to taking away part? What do u think will happen if u try to repeal? There may be actual pitchforks.
Talk is cheaper than the insurance premiums.
Senator you need to take the lead and get this done. We need someone smart who wants limited govt-being an MD can't hurt 
@SusieBWakeland Still wondering why you didn't get your input in the first bill...
#repealandreplacepaulryan
I am all for it.
@LegendaryEnergy when was the last time you took hospital conglomerates to task for mammoth costs?
Repeal and walk away. What is wrong with house republicans? REPEAL IT!!! It was better before.
@lheal What happened?
As it stands, the Growth Caucus is taking their ball and going home. @RandPaul
Yes! Let's do it!
thanks so much for all your hard work and dedication to #FullRepeal! Keep up the fight!
please continue to fight for us Senator! Allow insurance companies to sell across state lines & get 26 y/olds off parents policy
@kimbosa24 Agreed!
Yes sir! Please get the gov out of our healthcare, even though the poor slaves are begging for it. They know not what they do.
Hell Yes to the naysayers!  They are right - you are wrong.
Now what Rand?
Yay..more of the GOP big nothing burger.
the elitist rinos always screw it up That's why we love Trump He's not like them
Paul's plan is a libertarian joke.
why? Ryans' is a disaster
35 million will sign up for Gvt Pool, pay outrageous rates, but they will eventually go down?
Today's HC failure is on your head. I pray the people of Kentucky don't forget who to blame when you ask for their vote again.
@megan_j_martine why doesn't anyone listen to you

thank you
I am very disappointed with you and the whole mic loving attention craving Republicans! I only wish you were all on O care! 
-grandstanding 4recognition-congress/Ryan Had 7 yrs, failed-Potus 2mo worked harder ne1-working 7days mo doesn't cut it 4 ur pay!
You are full of Political Shit so stop it.  Get your butt in a Room with the GOP Lock the Door and get a Plan out there or Shut up
I hope ur right. Seems more like u played into dems plan.  They'll demonize and u guys will fold. ACA will not go away
@28Dave38 Thank you, Rand for calling his bluff. Well done.
@TommyKendall11 ....Hell yes.
Get your tail to the WH and talk to the President!!!!
@path1124 Looking forward to seeing your work!
Rand Paul 4 Garbage Picker!
ASS WIPE couldn't even get 1%
He Is A Loser Like His Father!
@RAMRANTS Thank you @RandPaul for listening to the people
DO IT right & DO IT quickly- many have No insurance 'cause they Can't afford #Obamacare
-YES. YES. YES. YES.
obamacare destroyed many responsible citizens - we want free market and choices - no gov't involved!
Since when did governing mean no compromise. The founding fathers would be ASHAMED.
Hey Dr. How does it feel to know so many more babies will not die, because no new Health deal?
Just get the government OUT of healthcare entirely, and I'll be happy. #Obamacare is UNCONSTITUTIONAL!
I'm all for doing it right Senator but lets do it. "Living with Obamacare" as Speaker Ryan just put it is unacceptable
@FreedomWorks @freedomcaucus shouldn't participate in ANY #TaxReform discussions until @SpeakerRyan @POTUS #REPEAL/NOT REPLACE!
Yes! They need to grow up! Acting exactly like the dems did! No more insurance bills crammed through. Fix it and move on.
There won't be a repeal that costs ppl coverage while waiting for you all to agree to replace. Today proves you WON'T agree. BAD.
and you had better b right. I HATE ANYTHING OBAMA. NO DEALS W DEMS THEY R IDIOTS.
vote out Paul Ryan. We want Rand Paul as speaker of the house!!
ya'll r looking like Rep fools, obama got obamacare passed, n his 1st few days dems pull together we fought hard 2 give u a chance
u will never have another chance to have a rep majority than now, unless u had gotten behind Trump, and repealed obamacare.
u need to wk faster.get done now! ppl r suffering & r depending on u. no to PP, mk hosp, labs, med equip, generic meds b included
Didn't Republicans send multiple bills 2 Obama knowing he would not sign All PresTrump said send me a bill. U need same healthcare
In meantime we r still paying 4 Planned Parenthood & illegals U & ur colleagues had 7 yrs 2 get it right.  Major fail in ur part
Hold the line, just don't wear the cape when you go in ok? #FullRepeal
