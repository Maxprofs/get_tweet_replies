Pass the 2015 repeal that passed both Houses and keep our promises. Then immediately vote on free market solutions.  #FullRepeal
Offer a different vision of how to lower costs & provide greater access to millions of Americans and open the floor to all ideas #FullRepeal
If House leaders try do a little less using the same basic framework as the failed Obamacare experiment, then it will fail too #FullRepeal
I stand ready to work with my colleagues and the President on a plan that can both work and pass - first real repeal and then replace.
@Jenny_SunTzu That is what we are talking about.
#RandPaul why don't Libertarians Billionaires want the working poor to have access to affordable healthcare ????? #Obamacare
Here we go again!!!
That's great they want the working poor to have choices but not be able to afford them. Why???????
That's so illogical. The poor are getting all kinds of benefits on back of middle class.
The working poor are working thier asses off for low wages because White Trash Americans will not raise #MinimumWage
get the feds out of my healthcare completely, they have no business there, except to skim off the top for themselves
same reaction to your profile. Your party's acronym is an oxymoron
because only governments build roads, power, water...
You do realize that the state government's are the ones that instruct disign and implimint any roads/government buildings @SuppleChuckle
giving them the ability to hand out favors to whatever private contractors they want
Actually it's both feasible and affordable. Every other advanced country has done it
CBO says full repeal will result in at least 32 million Americans losing health insurance. How do you plan to fix that? #AHCA #ACA
If any of them want health insurance, they'll purchase it.
Reality - income is too low in many cases to purchase - choice is not iPhone, but food & shelter, or insurance.
I paid $1,664 per month plus a $12,500 deductible I don't give a rat's ass about the others right now repeal repeal repea
bullcrap my family had health insurance $723 per month $2,400 deductible you're full of crap typical liberal liar
again for what I pay now I don't care about pre-existing conditions. And you're not a Republican
@NetworksManager 
Sounds so easy, why isn't it?
Because Congress is corrupt @RandPaul @NetworksManager
Bad day for me at this moment totally defeated, no clue.
We're going to win this absurd war on humanity. Must build local nonpartisan SonsOfLiberty mtgweekly @RandPaul @NetworksManager
Justdon't believe abandoning will work....will cause a new bill requiring a 60% Senate Approval-will Dems Particpate?
@carenharkins and you sir are no saint so stop pretending to be we the forgotten are pretty upset with the whole lot of you
DISAGREE Ryan betrayed the Pres with lousy Ombamacare part 2. He's a traitor! @RandPaul stopped the disaster.
not referring to obama care although he has now allowed for the continued funding of planned Parenthood Not Good
you have to think longterm. GOP neocons are Not For Trump. They are trying to ruin him.
no argument there  even my own congress men are betraying. I am pissed at all of them right now including rand
Or yes, pass the 2015 repeal. That's cool too.
why not pass it in the House & have the Senate fix it? We all know it's going to change once it hits the Senate anyway.
@CapitalismLover I hope you get launched out of office if this doesn't pass tomorrow
The only solution is to fix obamacare, & expand medicare to all states, or go single payer. Nothing else works.
Vote to Fix Obamacare, that is the right thing to do, anything less is unacceptable. Or, you can go single payer.
@Love4Lavender Would Ryan let his gramma depend on Ryan care. Obama's Dr's. Of death killed my mother in 7mons.
it can't pass and if you guys bothered to listen to the people you would realize we don't want it repealled.
Do what can be done @51 votes, part by part.  You can not get 60 or more votes with Sen Schumer in charge of the Democrats.
Paul Ryan is trying to destroy president Trump as we all have tried to figure out I have never liked him from day one please
I pray that President Trump will listen to you senator Paul keep going after him and please do away with Paul Ryan
you are wrong
stay strong u r right
Pass the 2015 repeal that passed both Houses and keep our promises. Then immediately vote on free market solutions.
No repeal!  How about simply repairing the current healthcare law!  It's not rocket science!!!!
ya, selfish citizens wanting affordable healthcare,  dont think about the insurance companies an their needs? GodBlessURandPaul
I stand with Rand #FullRepeal
why can't we go to the root and focus on why the actual cost of care is so high? Maybe get rid of frivolous malpractice lawsuits?
why is this called health care reform when it's all about insurance?
Anyone can say No.   Did it for last 8 years.  Put better plan forward that everyone can lean in on.  Lead, Follow or get out way
There no doubt that RyanCare is a joke. Can you get your friends in the House to get rid of this idiot.
No doubt there are enough freedom loving Republicans in Senate to kill it on arrival. .@BillCassidy .@JohnKennedyLA #FullRepeal
I trust nothing with Obama's name on it full repeal!
The American People deserve affordable health care. The rates and deductibles cause  strain on working class.Unaffordable costs.
@england498 It is a 'welfare' bill!
.@RandPaul YES! Kill the infamous thing! No mercy!
Ask @SebGorka how long does it take it. He was born in Hungary too. We are dealing w Lib/Left now.
go back to Kentucky... You are clueless
I'm very proud of you, Senator Paul. You've always maintained full integrity.
@WashingtonDCTea Next time you see Paul Ryan call him a Cuck for me! #praisekek
@Scotttaylorva I wholeheartedly object to the disappointing #RinoCare bill. @GOP needs to get its act together with a #FullRepeal

what kind of health coverage do you have? Is it subsidized by taxpayer money?
YES! Lead our RINO cowards away from Socialism, a dismal fate of shared, substandard...everything, paid for by the middle class.
Senator Paul we want a Repeal but the argument to Repeal & Replace simultaneously is substantial. Can you deny this?
I have faith in u u are right so worried about all the people that could suffer more have u spoken to the POTUS directly?
I'm so happy to see we agree!
You're the man. Paul Ryan is a POS snake in the grass working for the established order against the American people. Rand, #MAGA!
Full support from most Trumpsters for your efforts...thanks
u have some kind of extreme brain damage? Will it be covered under your health insurance? Or is that considered willful ignorance?
taxation is theft
The only reason ur in office is because of POTUS Trump.  POTUS Trump supports ahca, so should u.
ahca is good law, it can pass and you and others should stop grandstanding and support gop leadership and POTUS Trump.
Stand firm and keep negotiating with Trump. Ryan needs to go!
give us a free market no state lines and make it illegal 4 insurance co 2 discriminate based on age sex or preexisting conditions!
I trust you when you can say it's a good bill I'll believe it is a good bill but not until then.
@handymayhem Ok why can't your plan be the one up for a vote
@liberty_grl Always a voice of reason. Thank you Mr. Paul.
I am becoming more impressed with you each passing day!
What the Libertarian plan? Become a doctor and cure yourself? Or have lots of Money?
And it doesn't kill enough poor people!
What is the PLAN. is there a WEBSITE?
SICK of PAUL RYAN, trying to take TRUMP DOWN. don't mind different solution 
YOU SB SPEAKER
So, Ryan's 3 step plan; how to get around it?
I stand with Rand!
@realDonaldTrump needs to pay attention to the will of the people not @SpeakerRyan
So what do you purpose in it's place?
Get 'em @RandPaul
Yes, ABANDON RinoCare/Obamacare Lite right now.  Paul Ryan is a turncoat and is no friend to conservatism.
agree!!
@POTUS listen to rand
what is Obamacare lite?
@walshfreedom Can you provide us a link to conservative plan? Is it outlined so that we can understand?  You have got to sell it
#Ryancare is an embarrassment #Trumpcare promised better COVERAGE.  #RepealAndReplace @SpeakerRyan

don't we need a real replacement plan before we tear it down? What's your alternative to Trumpcare?
We love you Rand!
pass HR25 TheFairTax and you will have effectively repealed it. Kill all the taxes/penalties and you/ America win! No teeth=No law
just like @seanhannity said you all need to go in a room, lock the door and make the COMPROMISES needed to FIX Healthcare, Stop BS
I agree it is a trap for Pres. Trump. Congress is compromised. Senate is compromised.
Hey, Randy. Call it by name: Trumpcare. Trumpcare. Trumpcare. This is a wholly owned GOP plan no Dem will support.
Your colleagues /really/ don't understand that Trump supporters are passionate Ron Paul supporters; they'll lose their seats. 
If it does pass WE ARE LOST. REPUBLICANS will lose at midterms. 
Whats the option for Americans who were told to buy this ACA while you figure out what to replace with? Lose Insurance?
R you simultaneosuly working now on 2nd bill on replacement plan that you wud like 2 vote on same day if U do straight repeal 1st?
@SpeakerRyan time 2B the bigger person & admit #RINOCare doesn't cut it! Join #Rand & B 4 THE PPL instead of yourself.
another better solution abandon republicans forever such useless corporate human beings bad for citizens bad for America sad
Any healthcare solution that does not cover every man woman and child is a complete god dam failure
what can we do to provide coverage to those individuals who cannot afford health insurance?
that's right it can't be passed. I sucks in plain English.
All we need then is targeted free market-based reforms as replacements.
Agree; house GOP leadership should withdraw the AHCA bill; if they don't, let it fail in the house.
You think they would do what they said. They need to remember what the voters want.  Not Obamacare with a twist but a #FullRepeal
@MarkGourley61 I agree with you ! Premiums still unaffordable as well ! We should not insure illegals or refugees !
I don't agree with full repeal, but I agree & appreciate your integrity on this, not supporting a bad bill because of your party!!
@freedomcaucus  @MSNBC @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Rs dump TrumpCare,ObamaCare Lite, RyanCare. Include Ds in decision making process.
RYAN must go
we talk about good game when minority now we do O Lite. Shame on you @PRyan next termLimit been there too long
@MatyMcAwesome I wonder how much money Rand has received from health insurance and related companies?
AGREE! @RandPaul @Anti_Globalists Keep up public appearances 
have issues with you sometimes, but you are spot on with this.
Doesn't matter. Must strike while iron is warm. Keep a promise for party only. To heck w/ the quality of law. @PRyan needs a win.
@Jenny_SunTzu . Glad ur there Rand. Can we please go back to 80/20 insurance. #quitmessingwithus
@Jenny_SunTzu #Vote2018 could mean loss of #GOP seats if u go with #ObamaLite @SpeakerRyan #NeverRyan
@watchyourSen There's only one real solution in a country where people are bankrupted by healthcare every day, SINGLE PAYER!
I am disappointed, Obamacare is full of corruption & kick backs, needs to be repealed 100% . Credits don't work, need lower cost
Americans want the mandates gone. Pre existing conditions covered. It's that simple
@justonepatriot please @realDonaldTrump listen to Rand on this one! Dump Ryan!
Hows it possible that  1st time in a generation we have"conservatives"in power at EVERY level of Gov still cant get anything done.
Don't give up, find supporters & make them listen. Ryan's plan will do for the GOP what Obamacare did for the Dem's.
what makes your solution the only one that works. If it doesn't affect u how could u know pain costs and hurt. Seems one would try
Only a universal non-lobbyist plan can save the GOP on healthcare. All but U.S. Have one - check out Germany's
@gop although some GOP say u r all united on this plan u r not. Disgraceful that u had yrs & this is best GOP can do.
you had best not repeal this and less you have something better in its place which is far as I can tell you don't.
Right. We need universal healthcare. Without insurance companies whose interests are increasing profits and minimizing care.
AGREE!!!
let trump work with you! Ryancare is lying care. It should not have coverage for illegals! America first! @POTUS
@mariannecope house leader is about to hang himself with this shitty bill. Be patient, there's a strategy me thinks
Thank u.  STAND UR GROUND.  PHASE 2 & 3 WONT PASS WHICH IS MOST CRUCIAL.  CAN'T GET 60 VOTES.
what do you say to people who can't get coverage without the ACA's consumer protections, like for preexisting conditions?
How about Crush the Insurance Monopolies @RandPaul ? #Congress was quick to crush MaBell’s as you may recall, Y not BIG #Insurance
Not surprised, but disappointed & angry GOP reneged on promise of repeal. We always manage to step on our dicks when in majority
#FullRepeal and do not replace.
clearly you have no solution.
We need to get rid of you.
HEY @@realDonaldTrump LISTEN TO @RandPaul @randwarrior62 Another FAILURE by NEOCON/WARMONGER/CRONY CAPITALIST @SpeakerRyan REPLACE HIM!
Heard you on Sunday--you made several very good points-hope we get a good bill 
rally both parties, senator!
if it's at all possible you're even worse than @SpeakerRyan - KY benefited hugely from #ACA - #norepeal #resist #ahcasucks
Ryan needs to step down 
How about that America has had enough of OB such ups
THAT IS "SUCKUPS"
Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal Repeal
that sounds like a great idea, then all of us with pre-existing conditions can go back on medicaid and stop paying for ins
yes! Full,open,antimono oligopolic,competitive,free market in health care services across ALL states no corrupt exemptions!
No cares what you say either so what is your point?
you should talk more about #directcare options See @AtlasMD & @SurgeryCenterOK Insurance is for unexpected, expensive care
Never quit shouting this as loudly as you can. Make Trump hear you. He senses this is a massive blunder. He is being lied to.
Certainly won't if you and other GOP don't support it! #betterthanobamacare
Seems like the GOP is more interested in undoing everthing 44 did, rather than coming up with plans that work FOR THE PEOPLE!
repeal it all! Not the middle class' fault this $hit got rammed down our throats. We cant sustain everyone who won't/can't work!!!
3)  Find a way to make prescription drugs affordable.
2) Do not let millions become uninsured.
1)The plan that the GOP put forth is not the answer.  Tweak the ACA or create a plan that can cover everyone.
@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPriceMD IF @SpeakerRyan someday wants 2run 4POTUS, he needs 2 humbly listen 2conservatives & repair AHA.
@NetworksManager PLEASE ABANDON OBAMA CARE LITE!!
why do you call it Obamacare?
The first lesson of life: Taking back what people have had for 4-6 yrs & have discovered is critical isn't as simple as a vote
@NetworksManager all you politicians better figure it out or it will be blood bath for every republican come elections U2 Rand
keep up the good work Rand your the man!
#StandWithRand
You need to part of the solution. I don't see any solution that you have brought forward that has the votes. Just obstructing.
As one of your constituents most of them are on the ACA myself included because the premiums offered at my husbands job were too..
Expensive. Mr Paul I stand by my statements earlier this year. I will donate and campaign for your opposition. B/c you only care..
about who fills your pocket books and not your constituents. Your vote for DeVos will be your downfall. You and Mr McConnell....
When you care about those that can't take care of themselves you'll surprise me. I thoughy the GOP was the "family" party.
You definitely can't tell that with the way you all behave.
@Michell71375111 right! And @realDonaldTrump  will hear you!
#GOP and @SpeakerRyan seem ready to ride this bill up to the Gates of Hell, despite near total opposition by the Republican Voters
@BAMAPERRY Cap salaries of top dogs. Cap profit over cost so care & meds affordable for consumers. Keep preexisting condtns as ok.
Thank you for fighting for us all and not being an big Insurer shill. Stay on tv and keep educating! Try to get on @joerogan JRE!
better learn to negotiate and get something done or see your majority go up in smoke during the mid term elections.
FULL repeal yes... but CBO says GOP plan leaves millions uncovered. Yours will do yet worse. We can't campaign on this! Errr
@BAMAPERRY work on your solution, do not stop.
What should My 26yo autistic son on Medicaid & SSDI do to afford his psychiatrist and psychiatric meds? How can he pay?
#AHCA The American people will be happy with healthcare when the people in Congress are interested in switching to the same plan!
Just try not to screw up Tax reform. Let HC die on the vine. Dems can address when back in power.
Sen. - things are dropping today - please speak out - #Vault7Pt.2, #McCabe set up #Flynn via #TruePundit, #Assange
thank you
Senator The emergency room plan: let them go bankrupt or "let them die", destroy the budgets of hospital in the process plan?
I worked in billing.  That is false.  They pad the bill heavily.  Even if they "settle," they make $$$...Biggest scam ever
Doesn't that reinforce the problem? Insured patients get negotiated pricing, uninsured are sued based on padded#s
actually, they won't negotiate a bill that HAS been submitted to insurance, so no.
thanks for the explanation
@TopherSpiro it is not #Obamacare lite, it's the plan that you had six years to come up with. #Republicare #Trumpcare
get out of our healthcare. Government has no right in our healthcare.
You should warn POTUS not to get trapped by this bad plan. Republicans would get hammered in 2018/2020 including himself.
No phases, whole plan at once. Your plan may re-create crack many fell into before. What about Doctors Co-ops? In addition to plan
we want the health insurance plan Congress has.
If CBO report was bad on Trumpcare, yours will be worse.  You call for full repeal, with absolutely nothing.
Full Repeal under a bait-and-switch President is dumb. Build on ehatxwe have or we have willy-nilly govt every 4 years.
Can we do full repeal without 60 votes?
probably b/c it could be done with budget reconciliation, but I doubt you'd even have 50
Full Collapse.Than start a new plan.Repub are going to get straddle with the lost from their mess.
