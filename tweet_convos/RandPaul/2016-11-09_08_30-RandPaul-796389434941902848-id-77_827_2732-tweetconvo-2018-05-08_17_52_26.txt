Yeah, we consider that a "pre-existing condition" so, you're on your own.
the gold plan covers "irony recognition therapy" but the deductible is like $15,000 a year.
Now all you gotta do is get rid of @SenateMajLdr He's a very large moron #kentucky
Need the whole state red.
after 100yrs it's time to make history that will make a difference!
#ThanksObama @RandPaul @PAccaria
Congratulations, Kentucky. We did it. Republicans control the Kentucky House for the 1st time in nearly 100 yrs. http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article113464563.html â€¦ 
Sure Trump had nothing to do with it, right Rand?
what are you talking about? Rand endorsed Trump as soon as he dropped out of the presidential race
I know he did. Trump does deserve some credit though for the record turnout of voters. And I love Rand, BTW
oh okay.  Sorry I misunderstood your comment.  Glad to have Trump in the WH and Rand in the Senate!
A true supporter of veterans. Thank you.
LOVED YOUR IDEAS THIS MORNING ON CABLE NEWS. @realDonaldTrump
