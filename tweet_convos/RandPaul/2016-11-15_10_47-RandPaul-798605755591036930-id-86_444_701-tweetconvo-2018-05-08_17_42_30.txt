@sconnell1791 @CNN didn't @RandPaul also say that @realDonaldTrump was unfit to be president?
But we have President Trump nonetheless. Bad nominees can still be opposed even with the election over.
Don't you understand how the two "unfits" cancel each other out and create a "fit"? 
Lol if that were only the case.
Holy Frijoles ! @CNNSitRoom @RandPaul
How many Electoral College votes did @RandPaul win?
... asking for a friend ...

@CNNSitRoom @Frmaza @RandPaul
so what ? He's right
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @CNN I have to say Bolton is a bad choice but let's give trump and his pick a chance
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @CNN oh god CNN take with a massive pinch of salt then CNN fake news network lol
I agree with you Rand!Not the right choice.
@CalJamieson @CNNSitRoom I fear that the more @RandPaul says that, the more likely Trump is to appoint him
you said Trump was unfit Rand. You said he could not win. You were dead wrong. You need to shut the heck up!
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @CNN Who DOES Rand (and Ron) like for SOS?
#StandWithRand LISTEN TO HIM PLZ TRUMP.
if anyone is unfit its Giuliani he needs to check into the wacko farm
Who cares what Rand wants, he lost!
We're coming after you, Rand.
But thinks Corker is a #HOT get somehow? #IDIOT
Does Corker deny that Iraq was wrong?
all of them are unfit & clueless. If this is what we fight, hope @RandPaul stands his ground.
Rand Paul the only one brave enough to speak out on Trumps disastrous appointments. Bravo! #DumpBannon
so who would you suggest senator?
Good news is, there's only one commander-in-chief! @CNNSitRoom @RandPaul @CNN
@jakemonsato12 I don't often agree with Rand Paul,but I agree with him that Bolton is unfit
@RoyceKoop @RandPaul @CNN Is that the total of your outrage Rand?
Glad someone is speaking out against Neocons.. if we wanted Neocons in WH we would have election @HillaryClinton.
#SecretaryOfState is @SenBobCorker 

Media just plain stupid :)
Why are you still talking about the Iraq war?
Bolton preferable to the dimwitted ,incompetent milquetoasts this country's had to suffer thru these last yrs..
rand we dont need this shit right now
@LibertyLynx @RandPaul @CNN If we wanted a hawk we would've voted for Hillary.
@MattWelch why would anyone care what Rand Paul thinks? He's positions have been mostly discredited.
do something.
Rand Paul!!!!! I remember you!
@sNaPpPerHeaD  @CNN if the MSM and Dems don't like him then he's perfect. Why are you on that that Hack Show @RandPaul?
Michael Bolton is more qualified
Now someone is talking and wisely big ssssnakes and little s ssssnake's are still ssssnakes
I hope @realDonaldTrump is listening!Right again!Just like u were about Comey!
so is Rudy Giuliani
@catoletters @RandPaul @CNN and Rand Pauls hair stylist is unfit for anything
i totally agree . @RandPaul
I can c Kellyanne as UN Ambassador Mayb US would help nations facing drought vs instigating regime chg wars
I hoped John Bolton had expired years ago,preferably in a jail cell.
And now I have to admit Rand Paul is 100% correct. We agree on something!
Let's thank @RandPaul for reminding us that the GOP is as splintered by Trump as the Dems are if not more.
guess someone is butthurt here.
It would behoove Trump to put either Ron or Rand Paul (or both!) in his cabinet. Smart men
#randpaul is going to be a crucial ally in stopping much of the Trump agenda.
Newt Gingrich is the only clear Secretary of State in we the people!
why even talk to @wolfblitzer @wikileaks showed him for the biased hack he really is. #boycottCnn
Go Rand !!!!
why not you for secretary of state?
John Bolton would not be a good choice for Secretary of State
Quit throwing clods in the churn.  CNN thrives on controversy.
100% true. Pat Buchanan should be secretary of state. #AmericaFirst
& what makes @RandPaul "fit" 2 determine anyone else's qualifications 4 a specific position
he's a "senator"
??!  John Bolton is more than fit for that job!

Please  we  need  to  listen  to  others ,  compromise  with  others  and  work  hard  for  all  Americans  Latinos  for  Trump  MAGA !
John Bolton is a NeoCon interventionist.  We need to worry about the rule of law first.
But he's okay with Nazi Steve Bannon as chief WH strategist.
Thanks, Sen Paul!  Hey, @realDonaldTrump how about picking someone that reps the change you ran on!
Rand I disagree so much with you but thank you for standing up to the Trump Admin. Appreciated.
as usual, Rand is right.
U.S. Does Need Infrastructure; But Trump Badly Needs Hamilton
So, you will vote for a person IF they agree with you? Very big of you.
seems like a good reason to vote for someone. Not the only good reason, but a perfectly valid reason.
Seem so. Expect he's not pres elect. Called anyone disagree with him unqualified. BS
I AGREE.
bolton unfit, giuliani questionable, but hey let's give bannon a chance. you suck @RandPaul
Rand Paul is the real deal.
In keeping with the theme....
that position is for another white Nationalist
Couldn't agree more @CNNSitRoom @RandPaul @CNN @realDonaldTrump @transition2017
that would be an Understatement.
well sure he is. He is a Trump republican, white nationalists that makes him unfit from day one.
I agree he is unfit
At least he'll have that in common with the President.
Turns out he just wants the position lol "derp"
