@FoxNews @RandPaul
Please stop talking!
@DebraRusso I do. He is not my POTUS choice at this time & I stop listening when he attacks others, but I agree with this @FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul What a big disappointment you turned out to be...What happened ? That Green Eyed Monster is on your back.
@FoxNews @RandPaul This two-faced candidate skipped a debate himself. Didn't RNC boycott entire debate with NBC? I guess these are different
@FoxNews @RandPaul Trump never said a word about you skipping the last debate, except it's "his decision". Your certainly not like your Dad.
@daniel1stperson @FoxNews @RandPaul Finally? He had it right the entire time!
@FoxNews kind of hypocritical I say. Hard to take @RandPaul seriously considering he took his ball & went home last debate. #GOPDebate
@FoxNews @RandPaul           I do not support Mr.Paul   Still support Mr Trump !!!!
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul Oh, Rand, you remind me so much of @JebBush Please make it stop!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  can't speak Rand you pulled out of last debate, because you were pushed down. Kindof hypocritical?
@FoxNews @RandPaul Oh rand... Where r u at again?
@FoxNews @RandPaul why are you and Jeb  even still on the stage?? It's like taking handfulls of money and throw in the fire at this point???
@FoxNews @FaithandFreedom @RandPaul He is correct. candidates can talk details, we don't need to listen to repeated rhetoric from Trump.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Why are we still listening to Rand Paul!! What's he polling at?
@FoxNews @RandPaul Yes you said it right!!!
@FoxNews @RandPaul You skipped late debate. All this debate will be is a bunch of politicians arguing.....l can see that on @cspan every day
@FoxNews @RandPaul finally an opportunity to hear real ideas! Don't screw it up Fox! #RandRally #makedebatesgreatagain
@FoxNews @RandPaul How old are you? Your a Doctor? Never knew you were so Immature.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Ive just endorsed the senator in my blog.
@FoxNews @RandPaul  You actually sounded just like Trump with your name calling of the Front Runner.
@FoxNews @RandPaul. People should pay attentiôn to rand paul!
@FoxNews @RandPaul what's up doc you have memory laps didn't see ya last round politicians NOTHING applies to you
@FoxNews @RandPaul You are not only chicken liver but also chicken shi! For sitting out your debate 2 weeks ago.
@FoxNews @RandPaul When Paul is a legitimate POLLING concern/FACTOR in this race, his opinion will matter.
@FoxNews @RandPaul,  polls are getting more accurate in Iowa leading up to the caucus.
@FoxNews @RandPaul,  It's what the poll should look like,  but it's altered, swapped around. The poll has Rand at 6.9%.
@FoxNews @RandPaul RAND PAUL IS SAD! TRY policy not attacks when your at 2%
@Teeroyd @FoxNews @RandPaul Do you recall when Trump, without provocation, attacked Rand during the second debate?
@FoxNews @RandPaul from the mouth of a man who skipped last one
@FoxNews @RandPaul CRYBABY GETS TO BE ON MAIN STAGE THIS TIME! HES NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS HIS DAD!
@FoxNews @RandPaul   Go home you have no credit   We stand with#trump2016 Fox news is so blantanty against #TRUMP will not watch  #TRUMP
@FoxNews @RandPaul you guys wouldn't know a conservative if it hit you in the face. It's so frustrating when low IQs vote.
@FoxNews @RandPaul fox news  is not going to determine who the Republican nominee is. THE PEOPLE WILL!
@FoxNews @RandPaul Fox News is now on par with other news networks, gone over the edge led by M. Kelly. Only show I'll watch now is Hannity
@FoxNews @RandPaul give it up Rand. You're getting Trumped!
@FoxNews @RandPaul can't get over being so smart yet getting destroyed by Trump
@FoxNews @RandPaul tired of listening to you complain and put Trump down...instead try telling people what you can do for America.
@FoxNews @RandPaul I am not tuning in b/c Trump won't be there.
@FoxNews @RandPaul So many important issues for candidates.  How does Megan exposing Trumps mistakes answer something we care about. Media 
@FoxNews @RandPaul,  Rand says I don't care about my hair. What matters is what I stand for. His hair is more like the founding fathers..
@FoxNews @RandPaul #StandWithRand #randrally  Rand is a stand up guy. Rand will steal the spotlight. He sipped for ethical reasons.
@FoxNews @RandPaul I love watching Megan the question about women was really inappropriate. Does that question have to do with relevance???
@FoxNews @RandPaul Fox you'd been smart to replace Megyn She had her chance and it was a fiasco. Light weight up against a heavy weight.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Bet Paul couldn't wait to slam Trump.
@FoxNews @RandPaul more IQ ??? Are you kidding me ?? DIDNT YOU SKIP YOUR LAST DEBATE ?? IDIOT !!!! R.P. IQ = 0
@FoxNews @RandPaul Tell him to go comb his hair.  He's finished.  Bye.
@FoxNews @RandPaul nasty nasty rand Paul. POS
@FoxNews @RandPaul  seems just a couple weeks ago you boycotted the kiddy stage looks like Fox pulled up a booster seat for you
@FoxNews @RandPaul hey Rand, you sat home crying from the last debate and nobody missed you. Boycott fox won't miss your mindless ego now.
@FoxNews @RandPaul didn't this troll just skip a debate
@FoxNews @RandPaul what happened at the last debate that you thought you were too good to be on second stage
@FoxNews @RandPaul Dude you have less than 3 percent support. You will be done after NH.
@FoxNews @RandPaul  Who?
@FoxNews @RandPaul why does it matter what rand Paul has to say
@FoxNews @RandPaul this Democrat agrees 100 percent with this smart Republican!
@FoxNews @RandPaul Excuse me Rand, wasn't it you that sat it out last debate? I would have expected a bit more.
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul hahaha!! Rand Paul has already lost! He cries about insults as he doles them out. Paul is a lying hypocrite and a turd
@FoxNews @RandPaul  Rand So Far behind obviously his judgement isn't very reliable to remark on a candidate who is winning by milestones!
@FoxNews @RandPaul Give up the fight, your numbers should be in the red where you stand now #NoChance
@FoxNews @RandPaul now there's a real dumb ass
@FoxNews @RandPaul 
Rand, start thinking about all the free time you'll have in Kentucky
@FoxNews @RandPaul talk about being delusional?When are these 1%ers going to get out? that's not only you #trump2016
@FoxNews didnt @RandPaul bow out of the last debate because he was on the lower teir. How is he in the main debate with the lowest pole #
@FoxNews @RandPaul Paul believes that he is smarter than Donald Trump
@FoxNews @RandPaul Rand has no room to talk he bailed at the last debate cuz he wasn't with the big boys
@FoxNews @RandPaul this delusional man is 1% in the polls. It's ok though cause hardly anyone will be watching
@FoxNews @RandPaul the Donald should change his tag to DONALD DUCK !!
@realDonaIdTrump #realDonaldDuck
@FoxNews @RandPaul @MomsDemand @newtgingrich @Reince @WV4TRUMP1 @LaTaN1231 @Ollie_621 @GOP #nra Trump is a wimp!
@FoxNews @RandPaul trump brilliant,everyone piles on Cruz at debate,Carson,Rubio,huckabee,steal votes from Cruz game over
@FoxNews @RandPaul Your presence in this 'debate' is no sign of higher intelligence - quite the opposite.
@FoxNews @RandPaul outstanding!!
@FoxNews @Lg4Lg @RandPaul Ran believes 3 more voters might come his way
@FoxNews @RandPaul Wow, what a bunch of whining!  They're acting like children all of a sudden.
@FoxNews @RandPaul no1 cares about iowa, 40% nationally but the country hasnt decided? talk about denial holy fuck
@FoxNews @RandPaul He sure is insulting a lot of people (Trump supporters) I would think he would want to win over.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Why doesn't Faux News explain why they gave a $3 million donation to Hillary not exactly a conservative news station
@FoxNews @RandPaul 
Really, we now care what Randy Paul says about the Donald??  Why doesn't Fox just get Communist Michael Moore,  oops
@FoxNews @RandPaul any way to get attention eh rand
@FoxNews @RandPaul   Did Paul not take his ball and go home once
@FoxNews @RandPaul WHAT  A PUTZ !!!!!!!!!
@tonigee11 @FoxNews @RandPaul y
@AdrianGCompton @FoxNews @RandPaul If you don't know, you shouldn't be voting.
@FoxNews @RandPaul RAND PAUL IS A NON PLAYER. HE SHOULD DROP OUT OF RACE. NOBODY IS LISTENING.
@fsteinmetz70 @FoxNews @RandPaul yeah, because posting it in all caps makes your statement legitimate
@FoxNews @RandPaul why talk about @realDonaldTrump when #Rand Paul whined and skipped last debate nobody jumping for it much
@FoxNews @RandPaul free Biafra free nnamdi kanu
@FoxNews @RandPaul same angry small man; same angry condescending rhetoric.
@FoxNews @RandPaul why are you still in this race loser! You didn't make the last debate cause u thought u belong on the main stage U DON'T!
@FoxNews @RandPaul  lets not leave out the Conservative VAlues of his wife http://postimg.org/image/jlldrr2th/ …
@FoxNews @RandPaul why does Rand spend so much time on Trump, If you think hes a joke. This whole cycle you throw insults yourself. Irony
@FoxNews @RandPaul 
Donald Trump has been making important decisions his whole life. Pretty sure, he knows what he's doing.. Go Trump 2016
@FoxNews 
I hope Fox keeps the debate on the real issues & not make it all about Trump not being there!
@FoxNews @RandPaul What?  Didn't you skip the Fox Business Debate?  That one was the BEST!!
@FoxNews @RandPaul that loser that they let back in needs to just stfu
@FoxNews You have lost a loyal viewer. Already turned the channel to CNN. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@FoxNews @RandPaul aww don't pick on Rand.. @realDonaldTrump is the only LOSER in this story.cant handle women
@FoxNews @RandPaul ☆☆ Rand Paul has no credibility since he refused to join the last debate ☆☆
@FoxNews @RandPaul #StandWithRand
@FoxNews @RandPaul there's no question that Megan Kelly was out to get Trump in the last debate
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/poll-without-trump-83-say-they-will-skip-gop-debate/ …
@FoxNews @RandPaul Hahahahaha... Okay Bye..

@FoxNews lowest rated GOP debate without  Trump
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul he's right #StandWithRand
@FoxNews @RandPaul Your kinda a jerk Rand for not supporting ur fellow candidate.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Rand is stomping his size 5 shoes in excitement!
@FoxNews @RandPaul he as far as I'm concerned doesn't even exist.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @megynkelly, engage #TrumpTrain right above https://www.donaldjtrump.com  via https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voxcie/pjnpehkgmahmjpiaeegfheclmfnkfpgg …
@FoxNews @RandPaul ANYONE in their right mind would know that Megyn Kelly is far from a "lightweight reporter." It's Donald's way of crying.
@FoxNews @RandPaul you should thank you it's the only reason your on the stage. Too bad nobody is going to watch it
@FoxNews @RandPaul Rand Paul? Name sounds familiar.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Would have been a perfect chance to reach out to #realdonaldtrump
@FoxNews @RandPaul the video fox didn't want you to see http://redstatewatcher.com/article.asp?id=4512 …
@FoxNews @RandPaul #DumpTrump  #StandWithRand #YouCantHandleTheRandal
@FoxNews @RandPaul  Rand...I am glad you got a spot on the stage....but I think you'll find out who is SERIOUS!! Trump!!
@FoxNews @RandPaul another loser winning because mr trump is supporting wounded worriers instead of fox.
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul Like I was thinking.Trump is afraid that Rand Paul will crush him with great knowledge at the Debate.Rand Paul POTUS 2016
@FoxNews @RandPaul Liberty is on the Rise
@FoxNews @RandPaul how is Pauly even on the stage with 2 percent?He's a idiot,He wouldn't make a pimple on Trumps a$$!Trump money 4 VETS
@FoxNews @RandPaul I'm not watching Fox News anymore. It's projecting there opinions,not reporting. Watching CNN as always
@FoxNews @RandPaul time to pack it up and go home Rand
@FoxNews do not underestimate us women, we can take whatever Trump say bec we r like Trump!
@FoxNews I'm sorry, but who is this guy?!!
@FoxNews @RandPaul u did not attend the last debate Paul, nobody complained!
@FoxNews @RandPaul Not all of us agree with you. thx
@FoxNews @RandPaul interesting that the last graphic they showed had him in 5th place. Why is he in the 8th spot on the debate stage, then?
@FoxNews @RandPaul who cares what u say
@FoxNews @RandPaul if your a Zero Rand your not my hero... You should be thanking @realDonaldTrump for blessing you with this opportunity..
@FoxNews @RandPaul Yay Rand. Hope you all get more time now.  DJT taking voters for granted & pushing narcissistic needs to forefront!  Boo!
@FoxNews @RandPaul   I hate the word "SLAMS".  Can't Fox just say Rand Paul disagrees with Donald Trump.  It's always FIGHTING words!!!
@DorothyYonker @FoxNews @RandPaul Yes. I have gone from loyal FOX fan to being greatly disappointed. 
@Dancing_Lawn @FoxNews @RandPaul  So have I.
@FoxNews @RandPaul  That ain't gonna help any Senator!!
@FoxNews @RandPaul  Rand & Trump gonna be sitting alone watching the #GOPdebate saying "I'll teach them".... #SMH #juvenile
@FoxNews @RandPaul He doesn't need to slam anyone - he needs to go home and run for the Senate.
@FoxNews @RandPaul You know your not relevant when even Jeb Bush is beating u
@FoxNews @RandPaul Rand Paul - Mr Irrelevant
@FoxNews @RandPaul really name calling from u that boycotted b/c u didn't make the big boy table? Shut up
@FoxNews @RandPaul Oh yes, Its only Trump's huge ego, not the life long political class. OK, I'm buying it, sure. Blather
@FoxNews @RandPaul I'm happy the debate won't just be a cat fight between Trump and Cruz now. Let the others talk
@FoxNews @RandPaul if he was smart, he'd abandon your station as well
@FoxNews @RandPaul yea right rand down on the end!
@FoxNews @RandPaul, Silly, of course he will say this, Without Kelly attacking Trump it might be a debate. Conservatives need Trump
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul didnt cry baby sit out last debate because his poll numbers sucked you idiots miss @megynkelly @NRO hit job Bias Retards
@FoxNews @RandPaul LOSER!
@FoxNews @RandPaul how can rand Paul criticize trump when he refused to show at last debate because he couldn't be in the top debate
@FoxNews @RandPaul. Rand Paul is jealous of Mr Trump
@FoxNews @RandPaul RT No one cares Rand. When are you leaving race and GOP. If you'd join the Libertarian Party, I'd respect you more.
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul Excellent diagnosis: "Trump suffers from Delusions of Grandure" People need to take this into consideration before voting
@FoxNews @RandPaul Remember when Fox Talking Heads and Conservatives were outraged because Rand Paul skipped the small stage debate!?
@FoxNews @RandPaul The estab.millstone is big and very heavy.
@FoxNews    Desperate people do desperate things!
@FoxNews @RandPaul OK soyou dug up one more needy person to bash Trump. How low will Fox News Go to "protect" the bought woman from trump?
@FoxNews @RandPaul lol starts off by saying how he hates how trump trash talks then the quotes on the side a speck of dirt is more qualified
@FoxNews @RandPaul check your own attitude. you skipped the last debate because you weren't on the big stage!
@FoxNews @RandPaul good luck on trying to speak on the issues....This is just another football game to Fox..."cage match"?
@FoxNews @RandPaul I hope you are right. I was very tired of he said they said. I want to know education,isis,and enviromental policies
