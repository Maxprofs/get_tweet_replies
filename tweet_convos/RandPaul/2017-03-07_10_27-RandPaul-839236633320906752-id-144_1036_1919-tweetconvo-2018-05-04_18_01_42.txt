some people have principles and are republican.  Shocker isn't it
it is like Paul Ryan wants it to fail. The Senate can not accept it in its current form
it allows their foot in the door mandates taxes and entitlements no thanks free market!
why does Paul Ryan want to fail? This bill is a poor start!
sounds like "pass immigration reform (amnesty) then we will build the wall."
Sen. Paul's suggestion-- repeal first, replace later-- is just as dead on arrival. There's no GOP plan on healthcare.
there shouldn't be a government plan on Healthcare.
but people with pre existing conditions need the help. 20 million still got insurance. No replacement WILL cost lives man
I've got a preexisting condition, I know what's going to happen. Still doesn't mean I advocate federal meddling.
we're not animals.  We shouldn't leave each other behind. Heck even lots of animals stick together.
what does that have to do with federally mandated healthcare?
I just mean we should regulate some parts.  We just should.  No one should die or lose everything cause they got sick.
my problem with this is that we're funneling billions into a gov't that shows no restraint with wasteful spending.
good Dr. Paul if the house sends it as is then spike it down. It is almost like Ryan wants it to fail
#StandWithRand No RihnoTrumpCare!
Hey if you want to fix this I have two words. Public option
GOOD! We need a #FullRepeal and will accept nothing less. 
@bpolitics @shonnarobinson @RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @SpeakerRyan
. New Ryan plan old Obama plan new wraper
Dead as a doornail! We already have Obamacare. Why would we want another crappy version of Obamacare?
is a MD. Ran & those like him are most knowledgeable of what it'll take to create the proper provisions for a HC Bill.
Instead of taking your argument to the media, try actually negotiating with your peers. #draintheswamp
So another words the gov clowns cant stop that ocare beast?
That Stinks.
it better be or the Republic is in jeopardy
What the hell have they been doing for six years?Paul Ryan is not getting this right. States need to manage Medicaid!!
Yep! Let the free market work! #MAGA #RepealAndReplace #repealobamacare 
Fake News
Repeal and stay out!  Is food and housing next for govt control?
what about those who will die without a replacement?
@Jana_1977 @RandPaul Thank you, Senator!
Healthcare is tricky-if Rep RPaul is so confident on his plan is he willing to Go&Bring congress to his HealthcarePlan?
Rand Paul should not be a team player if team is running across court to the wrong basket!
thank you for standing up for whats right. now if we could just stand up for womans righhts that would be great.
- I don't know how much we agree on but on this you are 100% accurate, Paul Ryan's plan is a sinking ship for POTUS.
how would this help the working poor?  Barely able to live. No money for health savings acct!! Many of us in Ky.
GOOD, cause he's right, the Bill sucks!
conservatism in healthcare=Americans at mercy of #BigPharm on product we can't live w/o so we are forced 2 buy  ins.
@MAF_CAT @RandPaul Save us, please!  #obamacarelite
Rand Paul doing exactly what he went after McCain for doing. There hasn't been any discussions or amendments to the bill. Low.
Stay strong Sen. Paul...Lowering Cost in Health Care ie Hospitals, Big Pharma is the Main Problem...Fix them first!!!
Good! Just think govt would allow us to pick our own MD under new plan. How nice of them. Morons support the bill
I Rand & vtd him 2b candidate-BUT STOP talking 2 the press! STND BY EA OTHER! Work 2gether! U NVR see Dems doing ths!
Rands the man he will stand with the ppl before he stands with the others in congress
terrrible plan    leave healthcare alone
@bill_auclair @RandPaul did he say this new bill will have us paying penalties to fucking insurance companies? This is BULLSHIT!
So rand are you going to repeal before you replace? theres not 1 good plan on table smfh
I'm a huge Trump fan but Rand Paul is 100% right on this issue. This new healthcare bill is a giant crapfest!
Please get big govt out of our business. Repeal ObamaCare. Just REPEAL!
I HOPE THIS NEW BILL DOESNT PASS. TRUMP PROMISED NEW HEALTHCARE AND FULL REPEAL - THAT IS WHAT WE WANT
PLEASE don't give in to the crazy. The country needs sanity right now.
Come on! Let's work on fixing the plan and stop complaining. You make our party look bad by doing this.
@tempteststorm2 quit whining & work together for a finished product. Rep never stick together. Try 2 agree for once.
@NetworksManager @RandPaul good 4 you, stick 2 your guns. Obama care must b completely repealed not modified; get rid of name too
@marcorubio @VP @realDonaldTrump @SenTedCruz full repeal @SenateMajLdr
just repeal this crap god
https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/222 …
shut up, follow Trump
Most definitely.
this is not about you,Obama blew up bldg with Obamacare,most bn repealed by Trump, will be rebuilt removed in phases
it's not perfect.  But it's a good start. Take the win. Otherwise you look hypocritical.
an ALL TALK no ACTION senator wanting his limelight instead of offering solutions
yaaaay Bloomberg!  Solid reporting and great stuff!
How do you get 100s of people to agree on 100s of details ? every detail ? YOU DONT ! So you draw the party line !
@dwaynecobb @RandPaul Only because it doesn't do enough damag.
Don't BACK it Rand .....
Our president doesn't realize Rand is telling the truth and DC insiders are not.
Unbelievable that the President is listening to the wormy DC insiders. Get a meeting with him if you can please.
Thank you Rand for defending us as does your dad. Praying for you all.
Hope he is right!  Terrible, terrible bill!  Obama Lite!
@zrabbit30
Great job Mr. Paul let the free market work
Amazing.  Rand doesnt like it because it doesnt give enough to the rich and powerful.
@usaforyoubruv @RandPaul Paul plan-Continuation Act 4 Continuing ACA(CACA)!MANY Trumpers prefer passable "path 2better"over CACA!
What do you propose? Remember full repeal requires 60 votes. You can only use reconciliation
/ cc: @realDonaldTrump  Your plan sir?  "It's "ObamacareLight"...and it's "Dead on Arrival" quoteth Rand Paul.
I declare Rand a spineless RINO @WilliamAmos @RandPaul
his guy couldn't generate 1% vote during primaries. His ideas aren't popular

Republicans' Obamacare replacement plan could hike health-care premiums by 30 percent or more http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/07/republican-obamacare-replacement-hike-health-premiums-by-30-percent.html …
Clean repeal first! Don't like what GOP trying to do. Slow down and do it right!
NO to government healthcare plans!  #freemarket
@Trickadlington @RandPaul you can fix this Senator Paul!  We support your efforts.
Harry Reid is gone. The next damned politician who uses "dead on arrival" needs to be. Pull your head out of your butt!
when you say mandate R U referring to the 30% increase for someone who was without health insurance and now jumps on?
your plan provides less coverage. Both plans suck. How much do you pay for Healthcare? Wait, yours is free for life
Please talk to Trump about your Health plan and not to pass the one Paul Ryan wants.
Great work Senator. Repeal!!!
Thatta boy, Rand. 
right it's #Obamacare in . Need true free-market private insurance. Safety net by universal Medicare A.  Medicaid.
It keeps the IRS home inspections too. Full Repeal is the only way
The foundations principles to Liberty hold the direction to all human action,it's allNewtonian,to not recognize porblem
It should start with REPEAL.
GOOD! We don't want Paul Ryans Obamacare Lite bill. He is a snake and no good for the party or the U.S.
he is just upset /c he wasn't invited to the policy party. Remember when you didn't support Trump for POTUS? We do
you are a mess!!!
Fight on, Dr Paul!!!
Thank you @RandPaul. @SpeakerRyan should thank you also. You may help him keep the house!
your right dead on arrival
Maybe the only government involvement in healthcare should be addressing runaway procedure and Rx costs.
And it will beNot even hospitals support that plan. The voters want the Freedom Caucus Plan and will fight for it
#StandWithRand. IT WILL BE WORKED FIRST
-Go Rand we depending on you
@MZHemingway @RandPaul flake, son of a flake gets his moment in the spotlight. First spot on MTP Sunday Rand?
stop being an obstructionist . learn to negotiate and compromise. This is why republicans can't ever get anything done.
I'm glad because what Americans want is government funded, universal health care for all.  Reps. suicidal?
@MZHemingway @RandPaul -<- why Republicans can never have nice things. #kookooforcocoapuffs
they need to listen to you! You're telling it like it is. I'm so frustrated right now, with nothing, just a waste.
HealthCare is not a right...Gov is not a sugar daddy...too many want gov money,care..etc...from womb to tomb..BAD
In other words no compromise, hence GOP and Conservatives will go down in flames and blow this one chance to win
Thank for pointing out the deficiencies in the new health care act. I support you completely.
Get in there and negotiate ...Repubs need to stand together against Liberals...work it out....
Go for it Paul!  Make the Republicans keep their word.  Repeal Obama-Care!
Great attitude. You need to be able to somewhat compromise. No one said ALL of Obamacare sucked!!!
Let the games begin.
We are gonna have the @RandPaul Republicans & the @SenSanders dems, up against the trump alt right
Phase 1 is dead on arrival boss
Don't worry, getting rid of state lines, which will promote competition, will be in phase 2 & 3 of healthcare rollout. @foxandfriends
United Health Group made $26 BILLION in profit last QTR. When someone tells U insurance companies lose $ they're lying
So in actuality weWUDNT hav a problem but THEIR GREED HAS created THIS& MILLIONScud sufferBillion$NOT ENUF?
if it is changed AT ALL it is no longer Obamacare, it is TRUMPCARE
All that time Time Now He Comes Forward with the best plan Rand the man . I Say Getting Paid All this time CAN
nontepeal without replacement; do your jobs ; stick up for the people!
All Americans should have same Healthcare as the Senate and Congress has... NOT BUTS.
