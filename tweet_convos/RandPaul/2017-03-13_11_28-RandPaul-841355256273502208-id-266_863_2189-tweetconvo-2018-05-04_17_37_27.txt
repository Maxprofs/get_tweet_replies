God Bless ya Brother your right ..
@spanglesvi @mkibbe Health Insurance CEO's make up to $250K per day. Why not cut their salaries to help pay for healthcare?
Not to mention Medicare fraud! Get rid of that, and everyone can have it cheaper!
Steele, today ran the ends justify the means republican platform. One would think he would start to think! Money?
please dont let this be another " Congress does nothing " moment-support your President!
Please keep fighting I trust Mr Trump Work with him Paul Ryan is a snake TY sir!
Government should not be in Health Care Business!!!
we should catch up with ALL of the developed countries that have universal healthcare. Protect more than $
.@anthonypresley1 @cajunairess @RandPaul @mkibbe Protect our Constitutional Republic do NOT play catch up w/ countries chasing Marxism. @GOP
capitalism has failed too. It's selfish by nature. I'm not saying socialism is perfect either
capitalism hasn't failed; free market capitalism hasn't been tried in 100 years.
1) it hasn't been around since the Wild West for good reason. If you really want to experience
Free market capitalism doesn't mean loss of natural rights, e.g. right to enforce contracts
"free" market means ZERO regulation. ANYTHING goes.
Dems won't help you. "Let ACA die" w/o a replacement & it's your 2018 funeral. YOUR majority. YOUR fault.
U cannot deliver something that is so terrible to the American people..
do me a favor and stop the public ranting. Go behind the close doors and negotiate. Your smart guy!
Pass the 2015 repeal that passed both Houses and keep our promises. Then immediately vote on free market solutions.
Rand Paul, kind of like the little boy that got a real Dr. pretending via his family. Just another hater of our democracy.
You spend more time on camera then actually working with the people that are trying to replace ObamaCare. @mitchellvii
like to see action rather than the words fm Rand as he has the best interest of the constitution♡
@RickySi16087724 @mkibbe yes repeal the whole thing
Remember, and some of you know, Steele just carries water for whomever is willing to pay for the water.
Why don't U just change Parties and become a DemoRat. You act just like them .
You may have run on that, but Trump didn't. He promised more options, cheaper premiums, and smaller deductibles.
Yep, let's all get rid of ObamaCare Lite & move it to ObamaCare death as the Freedom Caucus wants.
Agreed!!
Repeal O'care. Legislate existing conditions, no lifetime cap & national competition.   Medicaid 4 working poor w/sliding cost.
I am with you.
What is your problem? You seem gleeful about kicking people off healthcare. How is this good for anyone?
@MichaelSteele @mkibbe you are all deplorable!
@realDonaldTrump Time to ignore Paul Ryan and get the job done President Trump's way, WORK!!! Easy street is a failure!!!
THANK YOU Senator Paul!  My brilliant mind and extra finger are glad you are there in Washington doing some good things!
@SpeakerRyan  Mr. Speaker, anything less than #FullRepeal of #Obamacare is shirking the reason you are in your seat!
you couldn't even keep non-surgeons from getting privileges to do surgery in your own state!
Please replace it with the free market-I can't force a doctor to care for me, yet they get to tell me what drugs I can buy
The GOP should be embarrassed, by what they are trying to replace ACA with.  At least look like the give 2 cents...
@SpeakerRyan is ALL about himself..
ie re-election. Just ask UR colleague @SenTomCotton who whines with him
YES, YES, YES! The electorate wants it gone!
We need to remove manitory insurance. I've lost thousands cause restaurants could not raise the money for repairs
- tired of the Republicans not doing what they promised to do. So frustrated with our broken government No #ObamacareLite
great you wanna follow through, but what about the other thousands of things the GOP has promised to us?
@MichaelSteele @mkibbe Replacing with WHAT?  Bueller, Bueller, Bueller.....
sir, I broke my neck & preexisting conditions will cause plans to be unaffordable or uninsurable. Help!
won't Trump voters get a surprise when premiums are not cut in half as some senators have promised.
@NetworksManager @mkibbe Let's work together guys, leave ur egos at the door ! GO USA ! @RandPaul @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump
@Johannessen_USA @mkibbe and Rand Paul another GOP parasite 
@NetworksManager @mkibbe I want a plan that mandates 100% congress on the same system. No exceptions, no "extras"
Totally w/u Rand.The Ryan way, back 2 clogged ERs again. B/c ppl who don't have 2 buy ins, won't. Live off others' backs!
that's right! The Republican replacement bill as is, clearly does not take away health care from nearly enough poor people
deliver on what we promised to voters
<Sir are you&House Rep's exempt from RyanCare? as you are from Obama care? Does Biz still have2 insur part time employees @120hrs?
Keepin wut litl good ther iz in #Obamacare iz best if u don hav an alternativ
I'm with you! If there isn't a FULL repeal, there will be mutiny.
don't let this nightmare go thru

gets it. Full repeal. Lets not forget the old "Pass it to see whats inside" b.s. we were all fed. All that was inside was failure.

Hold POTUS to his promise of repeal.
We need the Rand Plan
TY! No to Rdrs/ OcareLite.Y does th presid support it? It's Not what he promised either. We need #FullRepeal #FreeMarket
TY 4 fighting 4 #FullRepeal Don't get th presid support of  Rldrs OcareLite. He promised to 'shred it' & #FreeMarket ..
be careful what you wish for.  If you are sick, they can drop you or increase premium.
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul @RealBenCarson  Dear Mr President. Please let America's Dr's; Sen Paul and Sec. Carson decide the best approach.
I'm tired tonight of republicans pretending they care.  Rand Paul wants to B*tt Fu*k the poor and help rich get richer!
NO, that would be Paul Ryan's plan.............
Only if you give up healthcare supplied to Congress and Senate members.
let them buy on "free market ". Then maybe they will begin to understand.
@MichaelSteele @mkibbe you were not listening rand, people don't want you to repeal it they want you to improve it!
we had health care before Obama care-give tax breaks to companies to make it attractive to provide health care end of bill
and so many cancer patients were dropped before ACA. should not drop us for using benefits
Please stop Ryan! - Price has to take lead!
Oaths. How we forget sir. #yourlastterm
I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy
I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures are required,avoiding thosetwin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic
I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine
Too many people are beginning to agree with Sen.Ron Paul's position on H C for him to loose the argument.He is very strong
I call up Stevie wonder, about the H C Bill and he said he too, saw the flaws in the Obama Lite Plan.
The Budget Office Reports, on your plan Rings out alarming bells of danger for those who are covered by Obama Care.
Remember I have not stated my own positions on the plan as of yet. Let Ryan 
and Sen.Paul work out their differences first
GREAT idea!
Great job, force others to keep their promises!!!
Sure @RandPaul you silly tool oppose it. It's a shame it doesn't uninsure enough people for you, but whatever. @mkibbe
Cannot seem to get Paul Ryan to wake up to this fact!
The new wealthcare plan won't kill enough people for you to be happy?
2B Honest-with the Promise-RAND PAUL IS 'CORRECT'-Get 'RYAN' the Hell out of the way-TRUMP wants what he promised US
@100PercFEDUP @mkibbe Keep up the pressure. They can't do it without you guys.
@deplorablezilla @mkibbe   Yes!
whatever you replace have congress pay and be on the same healthcare. Then, it's good deal for all.
@Tamaraw68415067 @mkibbe I think Rand Paul should resign.I left the R Party bcause so many RS in Congress are dooshbags w/no princ
absolutely.  Focused on paying back Dem. not what's best for USA
Uwould think after years of talking vs.ObamaCare R's would have had a HealthCare Idea in place to Repeal it.Instead u have no plan
How about we compromise and make better as we go along and see what works and not? Play ball.
full repeal
@MarilynCapps @mkibbe   You are nothing but a ghoul. Why not just cop to "culling the herd" and own it.
Yep, just go for it. S King is owning his repugnant self, so hell why not. All the rage among the cool R's
Process-with approval @realDonaldTrump inexplicable. Ryancare worse than Obamacare-Flagrant betrayal of supporters. REPEAL
breaking new the people don't want a repeal at all.
Sen Paul... Keep the fight... Make it right.
When Gov gets involved in anything out of their Constituted authority, 2 things happen, Price go's up, & Quality go's down
We need tort reform and a 50% increase premium for those who sign up with a lapse in health insurance coverage

YES!  We support you!
How bout fully subsidize the plan and get even more ppl covered.
damn right you need to oppose it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
apparently promises are made to be broken.
I agree.
totally agree. Trump supporters are not getting what they voted for. Paul Ryan is a Dem in Republican clothing
I hope you do repeal it. I hope you get your way. No surer path to victory for Dems in 2018. Keep it up!
why won't they do what you are asking ...because Ryan's will be bad for America
hell yes rand!!!!!!!
please repeal ObamaCare now. Let the establishment republicans hear us
.@RandPaul .@mkibbe We don't want Obamacare repealed! We want it strengthened.
I agree! Repeal and replace Obummercare with fair market healthcare plan!
must also oppose the US govt from supplying arms to Saudi Arabia against Yemen.
Love Rand is willing to do what is right rather than what may make more political sense for reelection. Voters remember!
Say no to Paul Ryan's version of Obamacare Repeal.
You guys need to fix this!  Too important to f*ck it up!
@MichaelSteele @mkibbe THIS voter did not vote for repeal.
@MichaelSteele @mkibbe Given The House's inability to present a viaable replacement, do you still want to see an immediate repeal?
Yes, full repeal is what we were promised. Keep up the good work on this.
Give them a chance to get started please!!!
Maybe take a lesson from Rockefeller. Be willing to work at a loss for a while to bring people in ... and let them get used to things ...
@NetworksManager @mkibbe  Yes  @SpeakerRyan   We should not be forced to pay a premium surcharge if a gap in coverage. Full Repeal
And why don't you understand that does nothing but keep millions from having healthcare coverage or access?
. You are so right!
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP RIGHT! So get it done, Full repeal!
It’s not "Obamacare Lite”.
Let’s place responsibility where it belongs. It’s "Ryancare”.

@mkues65 @mkibbe
@MichaelSteele @mkibbe please stick to your guns!! This proposal will hurt MANY fellow Americans. Damn-why can't Ryan see that!
have u no sympathy?
@Foxchick242 @mkibbe  Thank you for remembering HOW & WHY we gave you majorities over last 7 yrs
agreed!
Yes. #Repeal. #JustRepeal #ForgetReplace.
#FedsOUTofMyMeds #BureaucratizedMedicineSucks
You sir should consider fighting for the people of KY over 400K of them Or they wont fight for you Shameful
@MichaelSteele @mkibbe Drop dead.
14 million will lose insurance by next year, can't wait to see how your constituents react to your treachery.
No plan will work unless government stops forcing hospitals to admit the uninsured for FREE
Who do you think pays

WE DO
#StandWithRand
FULL M'n F'n REPEAL Mini-Rand!!!
Why do you hate the middle class?  We pay for your healthcare coverage.  smh

MY HEALTH CARE PLAN HURTS AMERICANS MORE THAN YOURS! I WIN!

in Washington YES! #truckin

I would be curious as to how the will monetarily work
oppose #ObamacareLite and replace with #SinglePayer
-Yes you useless Washington Elites listen to Rand he actually cares about people
Can u w/o ppl who r on OC not loosing their insurance? We don't want them dying in the street while new is implemented.
@BeaumontMelissa @mkibbe Replace that Obamacrap 
Trump, take your wall money and put it toward Medicare for all.
#FULLRepeal... nothing less!
@FoxNews GOP get these republicans off their asses /get this done  # be apart of draining the swamp or go down the drained
listen to the town hall meetings. People don't want it repealled. Unless you want to lose control
American public needs to know what the real facts are! Want detailed explanation of all plans proposed!
Thank you for fighting sir, we want full repeal and a free market.
Yes, exactly ! #repeal #FullRepeal
Yes! #FullRepeal!
.@RandPaul @mkibbe pass separate laws:
pre-existing coverage
preventative care focus
Rx/Premium cost
competition
stop fraud
Americans only
Thanks for defending us as usual.
MANDATORY
HARD
HEALTHCARE
PROVIDER
NEGOTIATIONS
Stop the monopolistic grip of the HC industry
Since when did Republicans deliver on promises? I'd guess it's when they began respecting the Constitution.
Tell us how you plan to get 60 votes in the Senate!  If you can't then sit down and support Trump!
sure, you can repeal. You call also lose the election in 2018
Thank you Senator Paul for defending our heathcare needs. Go get them.
Please deliver! #BuildersGuild #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Full repeal is the WORST possible option for voters in KY! People can't just "work through cancer" and call it freedom!
There are basics to every Insurance plan
Respect 
thank you for your service guys, put some backbone into these leaders
@POTUS @SpeakerRyan ^^^^THIS^^^^
@NetworksManager @mkibbe Should have started ACA repeal with Med Mal Tort Reform, lower cost  to providers / less to consumers.
is just upset @GOP is not supporting his plan...neither are doing what's right for America..Improve ACA..Lower premiums ..CARE
Do you have 60 votes? If not, get with the program!
Instead of encouraging opposition, why aren't you talking to President, GOP w/suggestions? This is 3 step process. Get with it.
so u are close minded and don't want amendment and conference of houses to tske place. Ur way or highway. Obamacare like
how about full replacement?!? You claim to have a better plan. Release it to the public you fraud
Free Market is only for Corporations. It's illegal for US citizens to buy cheaper medicine from Canada.
Give us the same Healthcare Congress has!
don't give up the fight.  Trump votes don't want #RinoCare
How are wild animals supposed to pay for health care? Animals in the jungle have no money, they live like animals.
That's right.  Give voters what they wished for and watch how well that goes in a state with 439K ACA Medicaid enrollees.
They say lite cigarettes are no safer than the full flavor ones. Same with 0Care
yes we support your plan Rand
@NetworksManager @mkibbe Give us the exact same health coverage that Congress gets.
COPY + PASTE
YES, YES, YES!!!
