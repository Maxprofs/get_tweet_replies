@RandPaul they're all using their outside voices.
@RandPaul GET TO THE KIDS TABLE #DEMTOWNHALL #STANDWITHRAND
@RandPaul Beats any GOP debate; Hey why don't you guys do town halls? afraid to answer the questions?
@bbkenn92 to be fair all town halls are a joke no matter dem or gop. All have people asking screened questions. Sometimes they've
@GreerBarnes1 @RandPaul Yeah, as in their wallets. They'll make them thinner for ya !
@RandPaul All they do is yell about problems they don't have solutions for either.
@RandPaul why are you still spending other people's money to stay in a race you can't win?
@RandPaul YA MEAN LIKE A REPUBLICAN DEBATE OF HOW MUCH FEAR & HATRED CAN BE INSTILLED?

@RandPaul You keep trying and it's just... what part of this is accurate?  Tone?  Language?  Attitude?  Or.. none because you're a joke?
@RandPaul Would you like some Cheese with your Whine?
@RandPaul and when we watch the RNC debate, we feel like it's all in
@RandPaul @DLoesch Only Hillary. But funny that a GOPer would find issue with that.
@RandPaul https://youtu.be/eKqGdKo2TZE 
@RandPaul Ur tweets are awesome.
@RandPaul As opposed to every GOP debate, which is always in fart noises.
@RandPaul that's OK, each GOP debate has been scrawled in crayon with terrible spelling.
@RandPaul
Hopefully @HillaryClinton doesn't choke on @BernieSanders hearing aid
#DemTownHall
@RandPaul it certainly feels thrown together at the last minute.
@RandPaul Sanders only yells because the voices in his head tell him to. Clinton yells cause the script says to.
@RandPaul @peddoc63 lol you are funny. You should've run for president  #TrumpTrain
@RandPaul Why, Doctor? I don't have CNN so I'm just reading tweets -- they say @BernieSanders is charming and detailed?
@RandPaul oh, go comb your toupee, Ayn Rand Paul
@RandPaul Bernie breathes in all caps
@RandPaul shouldn't you be asking your 2 supporters for $3?
@RandPaul 
@RandPaul
@RandPaul @ImpactDemocracy There are adults conversing. Go sit at the little kids'/clowns table.
@RandPaul @DLoesch Everyone must be shouting.
@RandPaul @ImpactDemocracy Who are you again?
@RandPaul, apparently you've never watched the main GOP debates.   @ImpactDemocracy
@RandPaul REALLY? THAT'S HOW THE GOP MAKES ME FEEL
@RandPaul if you can yurn your back on  your own father ...i can only imagine how you would turn your back on voters...you f***ed up
@RandPaul @MattWelch lol... Bernie can have that affect on us all, really senator!
@RandPaul @ImpactDemocracy TO MAKE SURE YOU HEAR IT.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul 
They misspelled it. 
It's DemoTownHall
@RandPaul What?
@RandPaul why did you support mitt romney over your own father ..i mean cmon..bahahahaha...i might support you if you were more like your pa
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Sounds to me so far Sanders plans equals higher taxes, bigger government, and more companies going offshore.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Can he not speak without waving his hands?
@RandPaul don't be so bitter, it's not a good look for you.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul @ImpactDemocracy dare we mention that you're sitting at the kids' table for the GOP debate? Not even in the top 25 or so?
@RandPaul 
I'm replaying your whining from #morningjoe this a.m. Man you are funny when you try to convince ppl you're relevant
@RandPaul that was really funny
@RandPaul that's just how Bernie sanders talks.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul The entire party is in ALL CAPS, including their registered voters
@RandPaul @DLoesch And yet the substance is all lower case.
@RandPaul
#DemTownHall? More like airing of the grievances, amirite, @SenSanders? 
@RandPaul @ImpactDemocracy better than the GOP crazies including you.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Really, I love you guy. Hope #Trump2016 lets you loose on the fed. @realDonaldTrump
@RandPaul agreed all I hear is a bunch of shouting from old rumpled stilts kin
@RandPaul @DLoesch THATS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN!
@RandPaul remember @BernieSanders is so old and @HillaryClinton doesn't listen so we have to yell in CAPS.
@RandPaul @ImpactDemocracy which would be funny, except ham sandwiches poll better than YOU in National Presidential polls.
@RandPaul @CahnEmily also nice to hear someone talk passionately, not like a high school senior who just discovered libertarianism.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders you are a socialist. #dontgetburnt.  #StandWithRand
@RandPaul are you out yet? Seem under the radar a bit.
@RandPaul it's that expectation that old ppl can't hear well, so we naturally raise the volume 
@RandPaul just push your "caps lock" button and you can take it off :)
@RandPaul #randpaul #DemTownHall Thank you giving me enough information to eliminate you from my undecided list!
HAHA! Biggest line of the #DemTownHall, by non participant @RandPaul. Keep em comin - otherwise I may fall asleep 2 this #rhetoric. #gop2016
@RandPaul this is really Ron isn't it?
@RandPaul have you seen @berniethoughts? You'd love it.
@RandPaul Yeah, but it reminds me to pick up some Metamucil on the way home!
@RandPaul ARE YOU OK?
@RandPaul SPEND SPEND SPEND! STEAL STEAL STEAL!
@RandPaul andddd we feel like your whole campaign has been a joke. At least @BernieSanders has a chance, you're already out...
@RandPaul
@RandPaul CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
@KennethWarner4 @RandPaul  Aww you beat me to it!  Lol
.@benjifish1123 @RandPaul the New Yorker in him was coming out. Haha
@RandPaul IS THAT SO???!!!
@RandPaul shift happens.
@RandPaul this was a CNN and DNC setup
@RandPaul Whoa, let's...let's take it down a notch, buddy. I don't know if I can handle this Randle.
@RandPaul no you just need to get off that damn high horse to see the script
Please don't. @RandPaul
@RandPaul shouldn't you be worrying about your own campaign? Or nah
@RandPaul No, Bernie has been quiet since he is losing his voice.
@RandPaul L O L. I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
@RandPaul lol
@RandPaul I'm worried he might have a heart attack...
