Clinton campaign paid $90K to Portland consulting firm to help compile a list of 13 songs to play at campaign stops http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/complete-guide-to-the-2016-candidates-favorite-music-20160201?page=8 …
Here's my playlist @HillaryClinton SHOULD be using on the campaign trail, free of charge. This will be more enjoyable than the #DemDebate.
We need candidates who will tell the truth. @HillaryClinton isn't one of them. 1. Little Lies by Fleetwood Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5HkuhSEnPQ …
.@HillaryClinton ran saying she would take the call at 3am. She didn't. Disqualified. 
2. 3AM by Matchbox Twenty:
h/t to @nbcsnl and this is self explanatory really. 3. I Can't Make You Love Me by Bonnie Raitt:
Her $90K playlist has a John Legend song bet it wasn't the one about the failed war on drugs 4. The House I live In:
Hillary's wars in Libya and Syria and her vote to go into Iraq have left us less safe. 5. War by Bruce Springsteen:
She loves NSA spying on you. We should stand for the entire bill of rights. 6. Every Breath You Take by The Police:
This has nothing to do with anything but play this loud wherever you are, esp if you’re watching the #DemDebate.
@RandPaul @timkmak - I know a guy...
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @timkmak I  you randpaul

@RandPaul @Pyfferrj She wouldn't do that if she were spending her own money. Can't trust her to spend our money. No sir.
@RandPaul @timkmak I'll take $90K to pick 13 songs. That would take care of my student loan debt.
Take a look at the songs recommended for #killary by @RandPaul    Good Man  @timkmak
90K on campaign songs? I'll help Hillary so next time she can save $ on songs. I am fiscally conservative after all. https://twitter.com/timkmak/status/706867081283772416 …
@RandPaul . When will you endorse Ted Cruz?
@RandPaul @timkmak She would make such a fine steward of our tax dollars if she just had the ability to be electable.

@RandPaul @timkmak Hillarys a jokeShe preaches about the constitution yet she would be the first one to start abolishing it#Randconstitution
@RandPaul Yours could be "Ironic" — you don't have to worry about campaign songs because no one wants to elect you. #owned
@RandPaul @timkmak How do I get that gig???  Spend $20 on iTunes and earn $89,980 profit.
@RandPaul I have an awesome song for your comeback! "Walk Again" by @BrokenRail https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XgWV8p6K5g&feature=youtu.be …
@RandPaul The sky's the limit when you're spending other people's money.  Typical.

@RandPaul @timkmak I'll show up with a kazoo for a fraction of that cost!
@RandPaul @timkmak "Lyin Eyes" by the Eagles @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul @timkmak 

This absolutely wasteful stupidity is why our Great Nation is going broke! #liberalStupidity
@RandPaul @timkmak for a 12-pack of beer I could do the job better
@RandPaul She's a liberal Democrat. They're generally confused about everything. Not surprising they needed a song consultant.
@RandPaul @timkmak They pay a "Portland consulting firm $9,000 to use music from the agency's library for Clinton's web videos." Read it.
@RandPaul @timkmak LOL Glad you're live tweeting! 
@RandPaul You are cracking me up!! Keep em coming!! #DemDebate #90K #tlot
@RandPaul @timkmak Envy that 90k was ur total campaign budget? #youarenotreadyforprimetime
@RandPaul Here is a personal song my husband wrote about his Kentucky born parents - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oe-64uLchI …
@RandPaul @timkmak this money being spent, superpacs- just astounding! Do these people donate to feed the homeless? Shame....
@RandPaul while I know you wanted to be President, we need you in the Senate for life! It's time to take back a useless organization!
@RandPaul: Portland is hotbed of Socialism.
@RandPaul this is how musicians and the music industry gets paid
@RandPaul My husband is an excellent singer/songwriter (with Kentucky roots) - I wish someone would pay for his songs.
@RandPaul it costs $ to legally license music, dummy
@RandPaul So typical of making irrelevant comments about non or unimportant issues.  That's why you are on Twitter & not in a debate Sir
@RandPaul @timkmak That's what wiping the dust off of a smart bomb costs. Those who can't do. Teach #debates #FloridaPrimary
@RandPaul @timkmak 
imagine that, and we work our ass off for a living and support the crooked Bastard's !
@RandPaul @timkmak guess when you're spending other people's money, you can be 'bold' right Dr. Paul?
@RandPaul @timkmak pretty good play list so far!
@RandPaul @timkmak It was probably for public performance rights, not to "pick the songs." #librariansknow #copyright
@RandPaul Please run as an Independent!
@RandPaul why is this man not president yet
@RandPaul @timkmak is it owned by Chelsea or maybe the foundation?
@RandPaul @timkmak This oldie but goodie works out quite well: http://youtu.be/awY1MRlMKMc  #HillaryForPrison2016 #Liar
@RandPaul Can only imagine how she'll be spending tax-payers $ should she win.
@RandPaul @timkmak "Take the money and run" would work for her
@RandPaul God damn it I wish you were the GOP nominee.
@RandPaul @timkmak #UnSuspend please! America needs #PresidentPaul2016 to survive. Lesser of 2 evils is evil. 2020 too late. #StandWithRand
@RandPaul think it would be smart to stick to your own knitting...your comments are wrong while you claim being accurate...go home
@RandPaul @jacksooon15
@RandPaul @timkmak it's someone else's money. ..of COURSE she has no problem spending it...duh.
@RandPaul @timkmak "In the Jailhouse Now" - Soggy Bottom Boys.  http://youtu.be/0v-C_KcdoBs 
@RandPaul @timkmak http://youtu.be/CFFS3ndWSJ4 
She's crafty. Beastie boys
@RandPaul @timkmak all that money for nothing. This is Hillary's song https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Hp2WANepc …
@RandPaul just found out my gym teacher was voting for you until you dropped out lol
.@RandPaul I think she was fiscally conservative. If she had to sing all of them herself, it would be $225,000
@RandPaul  Why of course!  This is a woman who has not driven a car, gone to a Safeway for over 40 years!  Out of touch using others money!
@RandPaul @timkmak your fiscally a clown
@RandPaul we don't want a brokered convention
@randpaul @shl i don't know, my playlists are about $90k worth of

@RandPaul Now we all want to know what songs you would choose.......
@RandPaul I love ya, Rand, but dear Lord, please don't let there ever be a next time!
@RandPaul @timkmak psychotics

@RandPaul Bill O'Reilly calls Trump vs Hillary Clinton would be the greatest presidential battle in history.
