AMEN!
You misspoke,you ment to say do things to the people.Doing somthing for the country(the state,deep state)doesn't mean bennifit2 the people.
America First!!!
Thank you!
I hope @realDonaldTrump realizes he has ONE ally in the Senate who truly fights for #AmericaFirst. We need a lot more Sen Pauls in Congress!
Wish he had a different attitude toward healthcare and Social Security. I'd vote for him.
Yes he's just doing like the rest double talk and hot air he's never been #MAGA
It should have always been Americans and America 1st.
No "Pork Barrels" for special interest lobbyist. Congress & lobbyist money are not the ppl & country. Unseat kings Ryan & McConnell.
Wait isn't he saying #MAGA but opposed it at every turn? I might be wrong but I think he's a democrat.
But..but...muh Israel
That should have been said the day you all were VOTED in.
#StandWithRand
All you creeps are full of hot air. So disappointed
He and many talk out of both sides of their mouth, part of the swamp. People get excited over hot air!
Get rid of ACA, EITC and the IRS. #nationalSalesTax
And DACA giveaways!
Please leave the GOP and be the Libertarian leader you should be.
Novel idea for a Senator
Yes all talk talk talk. What happened during the last 8 years.  Another RINO just talking.
#AmericaFirst; lead by example
Where have I heard this before
How many years have you been there? Your just now getting around to saying you should do something for your country? Can you suck any worse?
100% agree!
Yeah like fix the immigration system (send them back) And realize American Children have dreams too!!!!
then replace the speaker of the house Paula
Like prosecute traitors from #trumprussia.

You as well as GOP need to listen to that. You screwed us not repealing obamacare like GOP promised. GOP is a joke
Who are you talking to? The American people's or this criminal federal government?
Yes, it's time to start doing things for our country...like repeal & replace #ObamaCare how bout u #GetBusy & #DoYourJob
But still nothing gets done
Where was the senator over the last 8 years on the subject.
And if said legislator can't help, then do the right thing and RESIGN.
So far we're only seeing you do things for yourself...the @GOP as it stands is on very shaky ground!
U need to heed your own words. No comprimise nothing done.  Duh
Like build a Wall.
Bin Laden started USA off cliff 20 trillion dollars debt that could defeat us the end . Bring troops home and stop SOCOM 140 country tour
The part 2013 NDAA Act that allows Propaganda to be used on Americans by government & MSM MUST BE REPEALED!
@RandPaul
Sir, we CANNOT become isolationists either.
"A VIGOROUS PERSECUTION OF PEACE"
Glad there are so many people there to listen.....and we wonder why Washington is broke #doyourjob #IStandWithRand
u are absolutely right Senator. America and Americans first. Other countries need to do without American  $$$.
Preach It Senator Preachit! Country starving for new infrastructure, better health care, ethical Judicial representation
Vote no for military transgender surgeries...just ridiculous
Another way of saying that is "Let's Put America First" or #MAGA
Lot of empty chairs.  Not sure you can win the hearts and minds of your colleagues if they don't bother to show up.
Resign
Like the thought, so why are you obstructing the agenda Pres Trump was elected to do
I wish @RandPaul was the rule, not the exception. Everyone in Washington should defend the constitution with such ferocity.
Can you please comunicate this to McConnel & Ryan? They are fighting Trump's America first proposals every step of the way. Quite maddening.
You don't need to tell us that, tell your colleagues. You should start with your states other senator.
If we stop they came to killing us everywhere
Since when did politicians care about the people they represent
What about north Korea and ISIS
Yes
My taxes pay for your Healthcare, pat me on the back. Feel free to thank me.
Another great speech to bad you hate Potus & those of us who vote for @realDonaldTrump get busy & do you job!
If we don't start now, The People will take back the White House by force in the coming years. #AmericaFirst #EndTheFed
Would include Medicare for all
Thanks @RandPaul for your #NDAA amendment to repeal the 2001 #AUMF. No President has the power to wage #EndlessWar.
or let free markets decide.
...sounds reasonable. But you must discuss the other side of the picture. What will happen if we stop borrowing?
Amen Rand!
Amen Senator!!! God Bless you & your family!! Love your courage & work!!
Vets first
