I love you Rand! please run for president again in 2020 #RandPaul2020
Blackhawk helo's or any military helicopter should never be built anywhere but on U.S. Soil. Period
@RandPaul this is why you need to be president. Honor and dignity!
I think it's a bit hypocritical when rand Paul didn't file a vote on the money obama gave Iran...
All they have to do it change the senate rules. No person of congress can trade w/ companies involved in bills. But that would be too easy.
Never thought I would say this, but go, Rand Paul. Got get 'em.
He is more willing to step out of line to defend his convictions than many of our reps. I don't agree with him much, but I appreciate him.
I thought is was 350 BILLION.
There are other things in that bill.  The arms deal is a third of it.  There is also infrastructure in that bill too.
Senator Rand Paul is going to lose his job, we will make sure of it.  Tired of this crap.
Did the Senate vote on the Iran deal also ?
#StandWithRand
I'll believe it when I see it don't trust this man at all
He forced a vote in 2016 too
#StandWithRand
Good to see him doing something worth while. SELLING ARMS TO TJE SAUDIS IS A VERY BAD IDEA
This deal is all fluff! He passed up trillions with the TPP and Saudis pat his ego and he caves! This has 'kickbacks' written all over it!
Yea work n 24-7 u no takes it out of me, but ty for your concern, now govshoot one another
And I aint go n to now, hope you all pass on
@RandPaul 
You are for it right ?????
Do you think that it has committed war crimes in #Yemen ??

This 
Nope. I'm writing it w him and it's not on the full $110b. Our resolution will target munitions used in Yemen campaign & may not come today. https://twitter.com/kevcirilli/status/867030787090239488 â€¦
Would that really be enforceable even?
I don't want my American made products in that country and I don't want their filthy money in mine. #28pages #BombSaudiArabia
Vote NO! That's blood money. Def need to steer clear of dealing arms to non-trustworthy countries
A vote for what? doesn't make sense maybe that's why Rand is a low level politician
What's the purpose? To accomplish what? 
the real question
Rand Paul a puppet for the swamp! We get it he is just as stupid as his father! Rand will be replaced  #inbreedRand we get it
my God you're pathetic
Even if he does, it will pass because money is in almost all the pockets of our representatives.
#StandWithRand
Trump and his family are invested in weapons.
Atta boy, Rand.
Good; president's have been making unconstitutional agreements for over a century because Congress won't wrest power back.
Rand woke up from his nap?
And did not force a vote on the Iran deal?????
We do not have a monarchy-last time we checked! The people need to weigh in this deal cld cause WW3.if it goes awry.
Yes! Well done @RandPaul.
Demand it. You Sir are an American Patriot.
But he was quiet as a mouse when Obama made the Iran deal!!!!
I like this idea
Good fir @RandPaul . Deep state is counting on passage - shut it down now! @SenFeinstein @BernieSanders @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer
thank God, someone cares about us
Who cares?
What about the other 350 billion arms deal the day before?
You can always count on republicans to eat their own
Let me get this straight. We are voting to take in money for surplus junk obama abandoned in Iraq ?
Can this move actually block the deal?
Rand Paul is just grandstanding. The deal is signed and done.
Atta boy senator!  Stop the #EvilLoser 
Goood for Rand Paul.
@TeeHodge_ 
At least one "republican" gets it.
Thank you @RandPaul for standing up for Americans to ensure we don't endless fuel more conflict in the Middle East
Wait. If we don't do this deal, how are they going to keep shooting? We have to arm both sides or the Russians may end the fighting.
Gotta keep raising that debt ceiling. Our national credit is based on it. It's certainly not backed by anything else.
Disgusting!
it deserves a look. in the works for 2 years, but Obama was holding back on some of the weapons included in it
Will he demand an Independent Investigation into the biggest crisis our Democracy has ever faced?
Many of us have no interest in better by the worlds largest weapons dealer.  We find shame&blood in it. It's complicity as well
He must be in line for a boost to his wallet! Dems Unite against this foolishness! #RESISTANCE
Why would he do this, of all people? Honest question.

cc @kampeas @ilangoldenberg
Let's arm the people who financed 9/11!!!!!!
Is this a vote Senators want to take, and/or McConnell will let happen ?
It will be approved with ease - with many Democrats breathlessly enthusiastic.
@maggieNYT what do the people of Yemen think of the deal?
Why?
#Congress #SenateI think this needs to be investigated to see who will be profitting from this sale before it's approved.
Ha! The Saudis own just about all of them or did so before this deal was announced. Let's see how many join this movement.
Doubt he wants the vote for good reasons, probably just wants votes on record. May haunt him later tho.
Exactly, ALL of these politicians are frauds,always looking ahead
I don't see the deal as bad but an honest debate is always good
Good idea.
YES!! Thank you! Balance of powers in governance needed.
Is he for it or against it?
He's for himself only
.@SpeakerRyan What happened you didn't get your cut I know you don't do anything for America
Reject Saudi arms deal!!! It will be your funeral and wealth of the Trumps and GOP!!!
It would bring jobs and wealth to Americans...I can tell where you get your news.
Greatest deal in the history of dealmaking?
Have you forgotten September 11, 2001? Because I haven't. FIFTEEN of the terrorists that blew up the WTC were from Saudi Arabia.
Only ppl that forgot are the Millennials,they have no clue
Good
