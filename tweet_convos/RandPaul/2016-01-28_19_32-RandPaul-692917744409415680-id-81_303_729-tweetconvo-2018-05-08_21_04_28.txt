.@TheFix @missb62 You have Jeb! in the top 7?
@stvrsnbrgr  Don't agree with Bush but he's really the only qualified candidate
@JoannaCocoGrove Qualified... for what? #Jeb! doesn't even seem qualified to run his own campaign! Redefining #bushleague.
@stvrsnbrgr  Relax; I am not for GOP, just saying out of that group of clowns
@TheFix @RandPaul flip jeb and rubio and agree 100%
@TheFix @RandPaul I'm going to have to say Rand, Carson, and everyone else is tied for irrelevant, a democrat/RINO, & can't win the election
@TheFix @RandPaul Cruz ethanol answer was outstanding
@TheFix @bdomenech I'd swap Christie and Rubio. Rand needs to be more vocal, aginst his type.
@BradTastic99 I didn't say he needs to shout. He needs to be more assertive. I think Rand is great. I'm not against Rand at all.
@BradTastic99 That's fine. It's ok if our opinions differ.
@TheFix @RandPaul Rubio!  You ARE a RHINO!  Half truths are your lies.
@TheFix @RandPaul Cruz might be a couple notches lower
@TheFix @RandPaul #randagainstthemachine ! #StandWithRand  !
@TheFix @RandPaul totally agree
@TheFix @ChipEnglander unfortunately Trump beat them all
@TheFix @RandPaul Jeb at 2?? Disagree
@TheFix Cillizza has been hyping Jeb for over a year -do some research.
@TheFix @yywhy Can I revise that?
1.
2. 
3. 
4.
5. 
6. 
7. Rand Jeb Rubio Christie Cruz Kasich Carson
@fullofbalogna   I think I like yours better!  @TheFix
“@yywhy: @fullofbalogna   I think I like yours better!  @TheFix” ;). I can't put any of them higher than last ;).
@TheFix Cruz stands out among them all.....2) Carson 3) Paul! From a Constitutional conservative. Not from a Compost propagandist!
@TheFix @RandPaul is there any humility in a candidate who continues to say "when I'm president"? We need a STRONG HUMBLE president! Please
@TheFix why do you rank Kasich so lowly?
@TheFix Oh come on. @RandPaul is good,  but @RealBenCarson shouldn't be last. He's really good too!
@TheFix @RandPaul 
1. Rubio
2. Carson
3. Cruz
4. Christie
5. Kasich
6. Rand
7. Bush
@TheFix @RandPaul I move Carson to near top of list; he gives very cool, calculated and thought out answers, such as how to handle Putin.
@TheFix @RandPaul Christie was at the debate?  I can only remember Carson due to his almost forgotten preamble closing statement.
@TheFix @1kecko Yet it looks like Trump got the most face time in the time slot. WTF?
Put down the bong! @TheFix @johnglenpdx
@TheFix @RandPaul part of that is because they ignored Dr Carson!! Unfair
@TheFix @RandPaul Chris, seriously? Bush #2 so far? Rand is doing well but Bush is a bad joke.
@TheFix @RandPaul you forgot  to put fox news at the bottom of the list.
@TheFix @RandPaul lol Jeb and rand are on stage?
@TheFix @RandPaul  If Carson ever got called on, he'd shine! The only honest man on the stage.
@TheFix have another candy bar. You will get the order right eventually.
@TheFix @RandPaul trump won by not coming to this mess !
@TheFix @RandPaul Jeb at #2? Uhh no! But so great to see Rand on the big stage!
@TheFix @RandPaul Rubio and Jeb should swap places! Paul has done a great job tonight!
@TheFix Kasich was way better than Carson.
@TheFix @RandPaul Jeb 2? No way ! Sry
@TheFix @RandPaul I disagree Rand then Ben
@TheFix @RandPaul ha!
@TheFix @RandPaul Pffft. Rand doesn't have a dog in the hunt.
@TheFix @RandPaul Trump is easily #1!
@TheFix @RandPaul Jeb #2...just lost all credibility...
@TheFix @RandPaul yeah, right.
@TheFix @RandPaul typical rand fanatic. Carson has done good.
@TheFix @RandPaul I'd say @JohnKasich is doing better than @ChrisChristie
@TheFix Rand is much better after his bye!
@TheFix @RandPaul are you joking guess so lol
@TheFix @RandPaul Yeah it's definitely a Rand - Jeb night.
@TheFix @RandPaul BS
@TheFix But who moved the needle the most?
@TheFix I agree.
@TheFix @RobStutzman Agree, but I'd flip Cruz and Kasich.
@TheFix lol.  Rubio has owned the debate
@TheFix Rand-mentum?
@TheFix perfect. A win by anyone but Cruz helps Trump. @KatrinaPierson
@TheFix I think you are selling Gov Christie  short.
@TheFix think you are under-rating Kasich. Hands aside, he’s done really well this round.
@TheFix @bdomenech No way Jeb is that high. Otherwise I agree with the list.
@TheFix at this point, if Trump isn't there, shouldn't Cruz be taking over this debate?
@TheFix Carson is there?
@TheFix 0. Trump
@TheFix including hypocrisy?
@TheFix Rand?? Why in the world?
@TheFix @micah_morrison agree #RandPaul  #1 but the rest in that order, not.
@TheFix I'd move Kasich to #4
@TheFix @murphymike I think Jeb should be #1. He is having a great night.
@TheFix Cruz looks and sounds Presidential, Rubio seems nervous
@TheFix Where would you put Trump on the list?
@TheFix depends on what you are measuring them against. Kasich & Paul sound rational / reasonable & offer more detailed proposals.
@TheFix switch Rubio & Christie
@TheFix @murphymike huh? Yeb?
@TheFix 7 - 10^100: Carson.
Jeb (despite his best debate) and Kasich, too high. @TheFix
@TheFix Kasich should be above Christie.
@TheFix 8. Trump
@RanalloBrandon @TheFix only Trump supporters would call actually discussing issues and policies a "snore fest".
@TheFix Carson is there?
@TheFix - Carson is on stage?
@SouthwestMotion @TheFix He wishes he wasn't after his Putin fiasco.
@dnredsox @TheFix this
@TheFix Trump ceded the stage to Rubio. How is that smart long term?
@TheFix So Cruz is a thundering flop? Ha ha ha.
@MadaGasp @TheFix No, Hillary is. Ha Ha Ha.
