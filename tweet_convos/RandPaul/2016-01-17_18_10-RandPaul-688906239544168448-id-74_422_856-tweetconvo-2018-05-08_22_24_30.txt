.@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  #DemDebate Problem is that the market makes $$ on sick people.  Where's incentive 2 make &/or keep people well?
@MasterEdTC @RandPaul that's not the way it works. Competition means if my doc ain't working, I CAN fire him. Right now fat chance.
@jsargent8458 @RandPaul Respectfully, how would you know if your doctor is doing a good job? Unfortunately $$ r a huge driving factor
@MasterEdTC just ask Dr. @RandPaul; if you get a bad name, and harm or abuse customers, do you continue making money?? No.
.@jsargent8458 @RandPaul I respectfully disagree. There r many examples of people makng $$ while not only doing bad jobs, but illegal things
@MasterEdTC because bad things CAN happen, we should restrict the Liberty of everybody. @RandPaul
.@jsargent8458 @RandPaul I don't believe providing healthcare is restricting liberty. There r some protections I believe gov should provide
@MasterEdTC @RandPaul limited of course. Even that can be privatized. But government coalitions with big business to prevent competition?
@RandPaul LOL we tried that before #ACA & it bankrupted people & led to runaway costs. Gotta come up with a better plan. @HillaryClinton
@jstheater that's NOT an example of trying what Dr. Paul is talking about.....
@jsargent8458 OK. So let's have @RandPaul & his #GOP colleagues introduce a comprehensive reform plan. Pre-#ACA status quo was a #FAIL.
@jstheater @RandPaul
@jsargent8458 Thank you for the link. I did read @RandPaul's statements on #healthcare. I await a comprehensive reform bill fr him & #GOP.
@jstheater @RandPaul remember when reading Dr. Paul's positions that they pretty much all affect one another. Big picture thinking required.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Yes, so your rich friends can get their greedy mitts on those health dollars. We know the #GOP routine.
@Monctonsnowman @RandPaul better service at lower cost says you're wrong.
@jsargent8458 @RandPaul Better service? The doctors don't change, only the way patients pay for services. It's more $ in private care.
@Monctonsnowman lots would change. Even if it did cost more money, that would be covered by several other solutions provided by @RandPaul
@jsargent8458 @RandPaul That doesn't add up. Pay more get more with other solutions?  That's political lego son.
.@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Oh, you mean turn back the clock? Because that was working so well? Criticism is cheap. What's your plan?
@EvilNorton @RandPaul in some ways yes, turn back the clock; technologically NO... Don't subject yourself to false dichotomies.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton all competition did was gouge the American people as back door price hiking took place.
@RandPaul @Phibear94 @HillaryClinton What bills have U/Congress put forth to date to revise and make better ACA??  Do something quick.
@PaulStout10 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton They just sent one to the President last week...
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton right on - no credit, no admission
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Because for profit health care has historically worked SOOOOOOO well. Jackass.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Start with allowing insurance across state borders. Allow more people to have HSAs - lowered costs in Indiana.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton i am surprised ppl don't see that there is a ton of greed in this country right now.
@RandPaul @KosloffM @HillaryClinton Yep. DE-Regulate...Then You Too Can Have Filthy Poisonous Water Like Flint, Mich...WhatTeaReds DID ToYou
@RandPaul What competition? Most rural areas have a single hospital per 50-100 miles. Limited health insurance options too.
@szul @RandPaul gov is in the way. You're not seeing the full picture. Try
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton respectfully, health care competition still exists & the prior system was a slow motion disaster.
@sharpemcelroy you habemt been keeping up with @RandPaul and don't know what he's talking about. Look into it.
@RandPaul We tried that and the healthcare companies do what businesses do, they gouge the people.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton competition hasn't worked so far
@RandPaul We tried that before the ACA, how well did it work for the tens of millions of Americans who couldn't get health insurance?
@RandPaul how would that work with our patent system?
@RandPaul healing people shouldn't be for profit. Free market shouldn't determine if people live or die
@RandPaul <--we've tried that already homie. Explain healthcare costs in countries where govt IS in the way. @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton That's the system we had for the 1st 200 years, and that's what we're trying to fix.
@RandPaul @liondawgs @HillaryClinton she just wants us to keep paying for everybody and we get less quality
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Been tried with utilities, as soon as your pals get in prices rise.
@RandPaul pasteurization may help prevent sickness yet it also helps to cause malnutrition which could make a person sick #DemDebate
@RandPaul lets say a certain 6 fruit juices mixed together could cure a nasty disease, the juice would need to be homemade #DemDebate
Got to find a better way than that @RandPaul @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul did you know home-made pomegranate juice prevents cholesterol problems, and that pasteurization kills most nutrients #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton O wanted 2 lower also, how that work out? Friends mine got divorced 2 save 2k month on health insurance?!!!
@RandPaul man you have diarrhea of the interns fingers
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Then we have to repeal Obamacare, which is just a revised compilation of HillaryCare
@RandPaul health insurance getting robbed so plans have to cost more, rather than fixing real problem they help money get robbed #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Americans pay over 80 Billion Dollars in Healtcare fraud each year, Audit, Fix the Healthcare System #demDebate
.@randpaul Competitive health care is a fantasy. Who shops for the best deal during a health crisis. Amazon.heartattack?
@RandPaul also some doctors, medical care centres charge way more than others for the same thing #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton WAKE UP AMERICA
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton one out of three black men are in prison because of Bill Clinton's policies!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  #StandwithRand #DemDebate #RandRally
@RandPaul also prescription costs have gone way up, there should be more natural preventatives and treatment options #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton That has worked so well for the past 100 years, senator.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton just because gov't. knows better? please, stop helping with gov't. solutions requiring more gov't. solutions
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton what kind of competition can exist in a "your money or your life" environment like healthcare?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton why is it EVERYONE can afford a hand held device with more computer power than the Apollo space craft?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Rand Paul you are somewhat irrelevant, however.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton 
She can't expand her gov power that way
#Randpaul
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Hillary is crazy
.@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Debate about it on #Lighthouse http://www.Lighthouse.club  #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Rand Paul has a real plan: https://randpaul.com/issue/health-care â€¦
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton regulated and they can overcharge!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton 
You forgot to say freedom in your tweet
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton You cant let competition work. Companies will compete to lock you into a plan and once the plan is locked its not,
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Yes, because our health and life should be a profit center for corporations.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton what's wrong? forgot to blow your load at the last #gop debate?
@RandPaul come on Rand it hasn't worked before what will you do differently?  #Sameoldsameold
@rikt When?! Free Market, NOT ACA or whatever you're referring to. @RandPaul
@RandPaul yeah, that works well...until people die because they can't pay.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton yeah because that has worked so well for the last 50 years.....bullshit Rand
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton get rid of profit for insurance co. and cost for Americans will go down
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton wants power. She could care less about health care costs or the economy.
@RandPaul then we would have what we have now, ridiculous costs for healthcare and perscription drugs ...
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton we've tried that. Millions of people are now going without healthcare. Didn't work too well
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton #Truth
More of this, a few months ago... @RandPaul @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton rand going off
