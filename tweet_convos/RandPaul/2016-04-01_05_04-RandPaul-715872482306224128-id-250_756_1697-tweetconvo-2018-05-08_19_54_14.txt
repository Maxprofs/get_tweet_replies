@RandPaul I'll be honest that your little stunt has caused me to change me mind about you. Will no longer send any contributions your way.
@imacommi @alllibertynews @RandPaul can't trust anyone who had been to bilderberg
@RandPaul 'just an April fools' joke endorsing Trump. U attemptedToBringhim down KY primary; joke too? #Trump2016
@RandPaul We endorse you too, Rand... thanks for the shout out
@theentropyband @RandPaul Good job Rand
@DontStalkRegina @realDonaldTrump pick @RandPaul as your VP.  After that happens we can talk about endorsements in that order.
@RandPaul #feelthemuthafuckinbern
@RandPaul how can you joke about something as serious as electing the next Prez,u are disgusting ....
@RandPaul  @GovGaryJohnson @2016Entropy

Neat. So, #WhereisGaryJohnson in all this?

#NotAllData#EndorsingEntropy
@RandPaul You were suppose to endorse Sanders...
@50th_President @alllibertynews @RandPaul Don't be insane!
@RandPaul absollutely disgusting
@RandPaul well what are you wating for? The American people are speaking loud and clear! Donald Trump is the Man we need in the Whitehouse!
@RandPaul I'm #StillRanding on the #RandWagon with #SFR and #AmericansForPresidentPaul! #UnsuspendRand
@RandPaul you should help out the Libertarian party.
@RandPaul you could always endorse @AP4LP, since he endorsed you.
@RandPaul Or at least endorse Gary Johnson and give the Libertarians the spotlight that they desperately need.
@_SpaceMonkey7 @alllibertynews @RandPaul or you could endorse @AP4LP #DoYouEvenLibertyBro
@RandPaul I wish the endorsement was real.  If you teamed up with Trump, you both would rescue the GOP and give it back to the people.
@_SpaceMonkey7 @RandPaul Rand Paul is the guide through the fog and snow.
@RandPaul Stupidity Post of the Day
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump pretty funny, you do realize though that /r/The_Donald blew up right? All good and fun, don't alienate supporters
@RandPaul just as phony as ever
@RandPaul April Fool's day should not mean making foolish April Fool's Day decisions.
@RandPaul When you asked him for money for your foundation. Trump should of given you a check then taken it back and said April fools.
@RandPaul have some tea if you believe in it, #teaparty and keep believing you will make a difference. Will McAvoy field day #usa
@RandPaul Did you have to insult @realDonaldTrump for childish kicks? Now I know why you lost. Your candidacy is like #EndorsingIBS. #MAGA
@RandPaul good job REALLY promoting entropy by your actions, and rejecting REAL progress to unite and succeed. #BernBabyBern
@RandPaul WOW... you are LOW ENERGY!!!!
@RandPaul Damn I thought you were gonna endorse Cruz
@RandPaul Just don't endorse Trump. Ever. Please.
@RandPaul Entropy for president! Entropy will improve America. Entropy will defend us best. Entropy for free markets & freedom. Entropy 2016
@RandPaul   
@RandPaul #ap4lp2016
@RandPaul  I do not think so:)
@RandPaul love it! My fave #AprilFools joke so far
@RandPaul Confession. Had to look up entropy. Ha! Thanks for the humor and helping #makeamericasmartagain
@RandPaul aren't you the guy who supported Mitch McConnell in his last election? You're part of the problem, dude.
@RandPaul Well, I guess that joke fell flat. Thanks for ridiculing your former supporters. Won't be donating now.
@RandPaul perhaps, but still you just gave @realDonaldTrump a non-endorsement endorsement....for what it's worth I think better of you now
@RandPaul I'm pissed
cool @RandPaul just endorsed @realDonaldTrump ..way to go Rand...that's putting petty squabbles behind and doing what's RIGHT !!!
@RandPaul  Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.
— ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
@RandPaul nice
@RandPaul NOT funny. I only wish it were true! Could anyone TRUMP that if it were true?
@RandPaul  Losers join the attack on @realDonaldTrump with pranks LOL Playing the establishment Kelly card card with hopes for some ratings
@RandPaul One word Sir..HAIR!#TrumpTrain #Trump2016 #MAGA
@RandPaul At least one candidates is having fun today...
@RandPaul    This just shows you all are in the same bed so tired of politicians
@RandPaul Because this is the only way you can get a few sound bites. #loser
@RandPaul entropy is always a winner, good choice.
@RandPaul why sir
@RandPaul If supposed to be funny, millions out here aren't laughing. With our children's' future at stake #missedopportunity  #NeverTrump
@RandPaul Kinda sad you're not jumping back in.....
@RandPaul Well that is unfortunate. The level of maturity is ridiculous. You have lost my respect and any future vote in any election.
@RandPaul thank god
@RandPaul Rand, we need to talk.
@RandPaul Lame. The country is falling apart, Rand is making jokes. Har-Har. He might as well go tango with Obama.
@RandPaul You're dumber than I thought
@RandPaul I called it... I called it... #AprilFools
@RandPaul Im so happy u didn't endorse #Cruz.   I do envision u working w/Trump  ... you'd be unstoppable together.
@RandPaul lol good one!
@RandPaul  SICK, SICK, SICK
@RandPaul @CurtisNeilson
@RandPaul I'm disappointed Rand.
@RandPaul So funny. NOT!!!
@RandPaul Mature.. But not shocking. Real shame you're not going to be POTUS.  BTW Bernie does better w/ civil liberty votes. #CISA
@RandPaul Proud to be endorsed today by Dr. Rand Paul!
#endorsingentropy
@RandPaul You are a human bacteria. I'm not fooling.
@RandPaul just saw this I was gonna say dude
@RandPaul  NOT FUNNY. DO YOU NOT REALIZE HOW SERIOUS THIS ELECTION IS? I HAVE NO TIME FOR APRIL FOOL
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  #AprilFools #endorsingentropy
@RandPaul your Tweet was quoted in a story by @USATODAY  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/04/01/rand-paul-donald-trump/82512022/ …
@RandPaul No, you're lending to entropy! 
@golo1000 @RandPaul Juvenile Ass.
@RandPaul-big fool if you're for mentally ill Trump. Lock him up with psychotropics. Join him. Two for the same price.
@RandPaul @JayS2629 Nicely played 
.@RandPaul #JokerWasHere
@RandPaul you fuck 
@RandPaul Not at all funny considering that our liberty will be destroyed if Trump=Hillary wins the nomination. Time to endorse: @tedcruz
@NancyMcAnally @RandPaul @tedcruz lol. Hardly
Dr. @RandPaul  Endorses Divided Government.

@Dividist @HFA @SpeakerRyan
Proud to be endorsed today by @RandPaul!
#endorsingentropy
@RandPaul #WeThePeople want #ConservativesUniTED! Stop the unwanted #PoliTricks being played.This is an important election year. #ChooseCruz
@RandPaul At least YOU'RE not a fool, endorsing ANY would have been negative on your future, young man, hope you listen to Ron from now on!
@RandPaul
The galactic empire falls into #Entropy & could wallow 4 10,000 years if not 4 #Psychohistory
http://www.PACALLIANCE.US  has the plan
@RandPaul too bad..missed opportunity to help #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@RandPaul And entropy is winning.
@RandPaul @TheVoiceOfPaulR  can l celebrate with you or is party bashers not allowed?   Lol. April's fool
@RandPaul Let me guess, your real endorsement is for Hillary Clinton.  It might as well be.  You are the biggest sellout!
@RandPaul I knew I loved your politics :) Nice prank!
@RandPaul You are truly an April Fool!
@RandPaul IOW, you're endorsing Trump. 

P.S. It's past time to endorse Ted Cruz!
@RandPaul @TheVoiceOfPaulR BOO!
@RandPaul phew!!!!!!!!
@RandPaul So relieved that your YUGE endorsement was an #AprilFools prank and not really for @realDonaldTrump  #StillStandWithRand
@RandPaul should of added
@RandPaul You should be endorsing @tedcruz
@RandPaul Oh, Rand! *jazzy sitcom end credit music plays*
@RandPaul It's cooler if you wait until AFTER #AprilFools to admit you were kidding.
@RandPaul why do you hurt me?
@RandPaul Good man, you are a star!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand
@RandPaul you had me scared there
@RandPaul thank goodness  it is April fools because rand would never make it as a comedian! Stick to fighting for limited gov. America first
@RandPaul Yeah. Haha. Let's all get a good chuckle while the Republic burns down. This is ALMOST as bad as an endorsement of Trump.
@RandPaul Well played. 
@RandPaul #Stillranding!
@RandPaul I love the fact even though you suspended your campaign you are still trolling people. #DoYouEvenLibertyBro
@RandPaul I love this as it perfectly describes what remains of the GOP race. God bless you, Rand.
@RandPaul "The Goal should be to set you free. To leave you alone." Well, you got it with this obvious unfunny stunt. Bye!
@RandPaul I think it's safe to say we were panicking. Or hoping for a rogue Ron Paul run. 
@LaughterKye @ITSDREWWEST @CollinMMiller
@RandPaul YUUUUUGE
@RandPaul No one thought it was funny. The future of this country isn't a joke. I don't think anyone thought you were endorsing Trump. Sorry
@RandPaul Entropy does not want nor need anyone's help but thanks anyway. -Entropy
@RandPaul nicely played!!!
@RandPaul Would have been funnier if you didn't tell anybody, that's the object of the April Fool...In any event that's a good one
@RandPaul I respect you,Mr Paul but I wish you'd just go ahead and play golf with Donald and work this thing out. You could be VP
@RandPaul sir if u were a REALLY CONCERNED American...u would stand with us. #loser #emobaby
@Rhondeezie @RandPaul he gave up way before Bernie, 4 places ahead of the losers in Iowa that have dropped out...Disappointed!
@RandPaul And THIS is what we now have in our Congress. Term Limitations are WAY overdue,,,disturbing.
.@RandPaul Not funny at all. Quite sad.
@RandPaul But I thought you were a small gov't guy. Entropy always increases :p
@RandPaul  BOO!  Wanted either UNsuspend or yes, Trump/Paul!!!  You'd bring perfect balance! (I know, CRAZY, right?)
@RandPaul #superlame
@RandPaul you missed it you could have endorsed @VerminSupreme
@RandPaul so what your trying to say is #SMOD2016 
@RandPaul I knew it. Rand Paul's a joke, just like his dad.  This is why he never got above 5% in this race.
@RandPaul Your supporters in Kentucky were Trump voters and he is the best candidate left, endorse him! #StandwithRand #StumpforTrump
@RandPaul nice one but Republican voters are out pranking you by voting for Trump.
.@RandPaul This is not okay.
.@RandPaul best part of your campaign was when you didn't easily denounce trump when he did the "ban all muslims" thing
@RandPaul Can you endorse defenestration? I could get behind that.
@kristenrudd @RandPaul defenestration. LOL. Best comment on here.
@RandPaul what's your position on enthalpy?
@RandPaul Oh my now that's just cruel. 
@RandPaul Rands silence in opposition to trump is an endorsement in its self,Rand and Marco should get off their ass and fight beside Cruz
@RandPaul Hey Libertarian girl,Pass it on,Rand should help America by endorsing Ted Cruz and joining his campaign,This is no joking matter.
@RandPaul Too bad, it's not true. I just lost all respect 4 you 0% #AlwaysTrump
@RandPaul cmon endorse Trump! We'll never be able to elect a libertarian until we can fix the immigration problem. Sad reality
.@RandPaul Endorsing entropy, disorder, chaos, i.e., the GOP's frontrunner, Wreck-It-Ralph #NeverTrump. April Fools.
@RandPaul  #Entropy is better than @realDonaldTrump. #NeverTrump ! Happy #AprilFool'sDay Rand! 
@RandPaul keep fighting the good fight! liberty now. liberty forever.
@RandPaul  That was silly about something so serious...
@RandPaul I thought you were going to unsuspend your campaign. Now THAT would be yuge! #istandwithrand
@RandPaul What a boss. Hahaha
Yeah, thought so @RandPaul .
Kinda late to the show, no?

@RandPaul I really would like to know why you wouldn't be endorsing @tedcruz? I would have thought you would be one of the first to support?
@RandPaul Stupid move Rand. Glad u are out of the race. This is no time for crap like that.
@DeafFromAIDS Great comeback, you really showed him.
@DeafFromAIDS Coming from the 45 year old stalker running this account
