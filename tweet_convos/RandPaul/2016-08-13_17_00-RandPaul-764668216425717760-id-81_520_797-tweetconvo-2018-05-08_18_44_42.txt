.@FoxNewsInsider @RandPaul @oreillyfactor @ericbolling Find a non-fed prosecutor who'll indict HRC, since POTUS can pardon only fed offences
@LouDobbs @greta #Hillary should be in prison but US laws do not apply to #Clintons
As a Kentuckian, I'm proud of Paul for speaking the truth that other GOP doesn't.
Like we dont already know that
are you going to be able to do anything Dr Paul?
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @oreillyfactor @ericbolling OK Rand prove it. Call for a constitutional convention to stop her
To our disappointment, she owns the FBI!
@P0TUSTrump totally agree you're amazing
Gee YA THINK???????????????????
best senator ever, keep it up Rand, let the criminals go to jail, Obama/Hillary/Lynch.
Rand, your endorsement of @realDonaldTrump would be large in defeating Hillary. Will you consider it
#StandWithRand you will get the truth.

You know better Senator.   Shame on you for kissing Trump's ass!
No more extremism!The country has had enough!The whole world has had enough!
"You shouldn't be on this stage." One of the best lines of this campaign.
