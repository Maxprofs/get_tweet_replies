@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump The fly on the wall has a better chance and higher polls then you
@Gunsight416 @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump love your kind the other side is either crazy,angry,brainwashed
@Catrocky22 @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump it's true in this case. You are brainwashed into believing bias polls.
@Gunsight416 @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Right their all biased and he's not really ahead and the media is playing along
@Catrocky22 @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump They only poll people 50+ via landlines. They are bias, I'm not saying Trump isn't winning.
@Gunsight416 @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Winning is the idea
@Catrocky22 @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump right, but I'm saying they are not accurate. You know Trump hasn't won any straw polls?
@FoxNews @TIB2016 @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump 
You trump bashers do realize that he's going to win and be the next President
@cdnrod @FoxNews @TIB2016 @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Trump has the support of only 10% of voters.  He is unelectable.  Enjoy Hillary.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Poor baby Rand Paul.  We don't want u for president!
@marilynarndt @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump speak for yourself.  Trump has the support of 10% of the voters.  He is unelectable.
@HCPSteve @marilynarndt @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Hahaha , u must b an immigrant!
@RodgeeG @marilynarndt @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump you must be a Trump supporter, you have no intelligent response just like him.
@HCPSteve @marilynarndt @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Tell that to president Donald Trump when he's in the white house!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump -Kasich, Huckabee and Fiorina - how the heck does Paul rate a,spot  !!
@ukcountess @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump because he is the best candidate
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly hair looks stupid. Had to say it!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump if you want to be president you don't get to choose what you put up with.These statements show weakness.
@Planner_Brian @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump And trump is skipping because he is scared of a 5'3 women
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Here here 
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Re: @marcorubio performance proves #America memory is faulty. ONE decent day and he' presidential?

@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump

@FoxNews @CANUCK4RONPAUL @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Paul is such a pussy he's like a little kid that all the big kids pick on poor  baby
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump looks like Meghan aged 20 years in the last few weeks
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump You are only there @RandPaul because @realDonaldTrump isn't. I dislike you the more you open your mouth,
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Agreed. Suddenly this debate has d potential 2 b about substance & issues rather than fluff
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I can see why #RandPaul would say that; all the #candidates look like, talk like minors next to #Trump
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand you lost mine and others interest when you bailed out of last debate as Trump tonight
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Someone tell Megyn that current hairstyle not her best look. Not her second best look. Still easy on eye
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump don't hold your breath we will be watching Donald NOT FOX
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
@FoxNews @RandPaul any kind of attention is like oxygen for Trump. He can't survive if you simply ignore him tonight.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I told you yesterday to focus on why I should vote 4 u! You keep ur focus on Trump so I can't follow u!
@FoxNews @RandPaul - My sentiments exactly. Excited to see a debate without @realDonaldTrump there.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump found! !! Donald Trumps boogie man, 5ft 5in, 110 lbs Meghan Kelly
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Rand skip the last debate? #makeamericagreatagain
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump checkmate dude, he won't have to put up with you!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump so it's good to see whose ass you're kissing!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Randy,like UR isolationist foreign pol was going anywhere, go back 2 the Senate & debate ur irrelevance
@LibrtyGuerrilla @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  Do you go to your neighbors house and force them at gunpoint to agree with you?
@stompk @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Not recently
@LibrtyGuerrilla @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Then, by your definition, you are an isolationist.
@stompk @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump it was a sarcastic statement genius,  no, we don't wait for the enemy to take it to us
@LibrtyGuerrilla @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I was in Desert Storm. Supposedly, we won that. What happened?
@stompk @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump We did? Did we oust Saddam?
@LibrtyGuerrilla @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump No, after Desert Storm, we left Saddam in power. Thank daddy Bush for that. Killed alot
@FoxNews @RandPaul surprised they're letting you debate!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump for me this is not about Trump, it's about the PEOPLE, lying ass FOX, and the establishment.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Yay! Everyone will then be able to focus on the REAL candidates.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump but they have to put up with youlol
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Trump 40% Rand -3
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand your still in I thought you got out your in the minus they go by who got the most not the least!!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump and you won't have to stand on stage with a real winner!
@FoxNews We need to narrow field to at least three, Trump the national fav, Cruz for Tea party, and whomever establishment wants...
@FoxNews first time your show was full of spin and bullshit. Or was it?
@FoxNews @RealBillyGrant @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Whoa, when did Megyn start channeling Brigitte Nielson?
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand Paul is a joke Fox is a joke TRUMP will  gain supporters Fox will lose supporters
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I will remember that Rand when you drop out!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Looks like these two schlonged all night
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Double win for us, too.  We don't have to put up with Megyn Kelly or Rand Paul.  #BoycottFoxDebate
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  And you all won't to occasionally mention Trumps maturity? Give it a break!!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump What Trumps supporters don 't realize is that when he loses, he will call YOU the losers.  Mark my words
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump and yet U are still a loser Rand.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump rand. Kiss Megyn...good grief.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump IO'm glat Trump isn't going to be there. No I don't have to watch Megan Kelly's attacks on him.
@FoxNews @JasonsGrandpa @RandPaul and @realDonaldTrump doesn't have to put up with you or the NASTY @FoxNews @megynkelly
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump amen #StandWithRand this looks like it'll hurt Trump, let's just hope it brings him down enough
@FoxNews @RandPaul @tedcruz of course you won't have any confrontation just same old standard politics..blah blah..
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Paul, no one wants to hear your views or opinions. You are irrelevant. Wake up!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Loser who can't compete against a Leader? We Can Tell
@Bonfiredesigns @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump a double win? What a joke. Nobody will be watching and Rand Paul will be out of the race before March.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump you are a double lose Paul.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump hahaha, are you kidding the little boy made the debate stage by default!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  is there any wonder why this guy is a fringe candidate.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I hope and pray that soon the nation will not have to put up with#Trump either
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump It will be a win for us real Conservatives because we will be watching "The Man" on CNN and not you.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump BECAUSE YOUR NO MATCH 4TRUMP EITHER IS ANYONE IN THE DEBATE
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Just afraid of trump!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand, this is as simply as I can state it, in the final analysis he wins in spectacular fashion.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand looks tired.
@FoxNews @RandPaul lets just hope the debate doesnt still revolve around trump and focus more on how you guys will deal with the issues
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand Paul is not going to be the nominee regardless!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump have it all. Hope people watch. Boring debate without trump.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump another Paul running for president for decades to come. So sad and pathetic!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump we all will be watching CNN and raising money for our wounded worries!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump bet she can't make it through the debate with out mouthing off about trump,no one's watching
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump who is Rand Paul?
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump if you can't handle Trump -- YOU are not President material!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Anyone seriously concerned about electing the next president of the U.S. Will be watching the debate
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump careful Rand if you make Donald mad he might not talk to you
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  Fox News debate,  the JV squad, The varsity team is raising money for vets, Cuz JV team sent to war.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump and America got a double loss.  They don't get an entertaining debate and they have to put up with Paul
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump RON GO HOME, YOU HAVE LOWER THEN 0 CHANCE, YOU COULD NOT EVEN BEAT @REALBENCARSON  sorry it's the truth.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump. Ratings will be in toliet for Fox. Megan will loose big time
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump But who will be watching...or caring?
@curtiswright @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump people who want to hear real policy debate?
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump He is still running? I thought he dropped out months ago. Has he broken 2% yet
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Too bad America won't be watching.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump What debate? Fox, Google, GOP estab pushing an agenda by bringing illegal immig to ask questions.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Fox set up Muslim , illegal immigrant to ask questions at debate Debate big set up TRUMP RIGHT AGAIN
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump You will put up with the Voters. Don't be Koki. With 2% they are allowing you. Megyn Thank u. Trump Wins
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand, you are the 1%
@sunq24 @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump he's also beating Hillary in key swing states while Trump loses to her every time.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump   I hope you wear your big boy pants. Coordinate with Megyn.
@FoxNews The only reason @RandPaul is in the debate is so that way @realDonaldTrump doesn't get center stage to himself! He showed y'all!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump it's going to be a real shame when hardly anyone will be at the debate.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Chicken!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump you should be kissing Donald trumps feet. I would laugh if he showed up and you were booted off
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump amazing Rand Paul says the Cruz/Canada thing is a big deal. Wasn't Trump saying that weeks ago ?
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump and nobody will be watching your shit… We're all going to watch Trump benefit for the troops…
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Feels like round 10 of a 10 round fight and Trump can only lose with the knock out punch. Can't hit him
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I will become president the same time Paul becomes president, NEVER
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Keep up the condescending BS. See you on Election Day
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand enjoy the gift while you can. Fox loves you today. Megyn needs your support.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Keep attacking Trump and he'll go higher in the polls. Rand will keep dropping like a rock. He should go
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  but it is a loss for the audience, we have to put up with you.  Oh no, we'll be watching CNN
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Your a big man Rand!Fox and their agenda other than an actual debateDisgusting!l
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Then why are you bringing him up? That's why Trump will win and not even be on the stage.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  I am not impressed with rand. So instead of getting rid of 1 pedestal they move up another 1%er. Nice
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Megan reporting is so bias. Who are you kidding?
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump what's wrong with the debates people  < 0 on stage. People not even competing in Iowa in Iowa debate.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Your reborn again 
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  Megan Kelly showing her true colors! Disgraceful#notarealjournalist
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I guess if a LOSER can be a WINNER. Not one of my goals!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Kelly stumping to get her old gig back at CNN
@FoxNews with @realDonaldTrump not there @randpaul won't be sitting at the kids table for the debate
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump ok rand Paul just went WAY DOWN IN RESPECT IN MY BOOK.TRUTH IS TRUTH. AN MISLEADING IS THE SAME A LYING
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump    Now that's  FUNNY.  Donald grow a set and attend DEBATE
@apprentice31st @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump 

I thinks she's gone w a more matronly dew to downplay the "bimbo" thing.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump keep licking the boots of the establishment!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump ..... This is coming from a guy that dropped out of a debate because he wasn't in the main stage. Loser
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump It will not help him. He is only there because they allow so many on stage. Possibly last one for him
.@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump 

Doesn't matter what @RandPaul thinks
We won't have to think of him for too much longer either.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump. Not watching debate.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand Paul's chances of being elected to President or finding a following: ZERO
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump the @realDonaldTrump is OUR NEXT PRESIDENT
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Actually the only candidate I like from the GOP, Rand has a brain.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Hang in there Rand, when the Trump idiot is run out of the race, everything starts from scratch!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump why does he get any time on tv wasted space
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump same No Trump not watching, CNN has a Trump special on, better show to watch
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump you and trump got a lot in common. You can share "daddy hooked me up " stories
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump actually Rand, "WE" don't have to put up with either you or Megyn!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump unbelievable! a media institution recognizing a man who real intentions to help this country @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump No bully pulpit for the big bully in the room. #DuckingDonald
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand Paul I live in Glasgow you're a joke
@mikedigi @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump you got that right
@foxnews @randpaul @realdonaldtrump 25 years ago Donald Trump said this:
@simplyjaycom @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Trump is a narcissist c'mon fellow conservatives can't you see, Cubans 1959 , deceived
