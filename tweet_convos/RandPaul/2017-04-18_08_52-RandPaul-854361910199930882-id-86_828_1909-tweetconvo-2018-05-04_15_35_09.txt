Your dad is a heroic saint. Your his finest achievement
It's almost too late for this. No mainstream news outlet will cover this viewpoint.

President Trump needs help getting back on Candidate Trump's track. You can remind him his base is anti-Wall St and anti-Goldman Sachs.

Your father has always been ahead of his time.#RonPaul. 2 favorites! Voices of Reason.
What are the odds @POTUS would veto it? #AuditEnd&ArrestTheFED #AbolishTheIRS #TaxationIsTheft #InflationIsAlsoTheft #BalanceTheBudget
Congress can't even pass an annual budget and you want to give it control over monetary policy? What a sham.
PLEASE get healthcare reform passed first!!  Small businesses and those in individual markets really suffering under huge increases!
Sure wish you had it together to do it the last 8 years...  we would be in MUCH better shape now
Would love to see result of Obama regime audit
