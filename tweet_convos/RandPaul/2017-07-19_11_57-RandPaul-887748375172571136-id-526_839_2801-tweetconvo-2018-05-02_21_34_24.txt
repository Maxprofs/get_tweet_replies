#RandPaul2024
ObamaCare subsidized insurance co's. We don't need to continue this corruption.
Insurance co's make medical decisions and profit from it. Giving them anymore $ regardless of what you call it is naive.
I can't afford to pay for Obamacare-do your job and stand with President Trump. Repeal Obamacare now!
Thank you! ...so are the American people. #RepealNoReplace
I am against using taxpayer money like it's poker chips.
Better do something I'm waiting for the letter that tells me they won't be renewing my policy for the 3rd year row, 7yrs you've had 2 fix it
@Jam1p Me, too!!!
So are the taxpayers @RandPaul ! 15M in profits, it's sort of a no brainer!
Mr. Paul needs to push repeal and make it stick. The GOP is losing the next election. They look like idiots.
But their policies force companies to insure the risky and lose money
Get the government out of healthcare
Wow! If there was ever an example of corporate greed, this is it. Ins com's gross billions, as does big pharma. Bail out the TAXPAYERS!
Obama is the one who sunk them
no bailout
@KLSouth @RandPaul Obama gives hand picked insurance companies carte Blanche in the exchanges, they lose and SWAMP wants bailout HA
Name and numbers came from where? And, for kicks, What bailout?
RT @realDonaldTrump The PROBLEM is big Healthcare Insurance Cos. They created #AHCA & #BRCA. McConnell & Ryan are owned & paid off by them.
Get rid of everyone Democrats as well as Republicans
Paul wrings hands-refuses support for healthcare. I need relief Paul. Support Trump!
Bernie has a solution.  Could you please look at it and keep an open mind. https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/ …
No
Come on Crow!! If it's gov't run it'll cost $6 trillion MORE over a decade. Just like every other gov program has. They're all under water.
Look at health care cost in the US compared to countries with socialized medicine.
Who did the studies?

This would not be a study to base public public policy on.  Not sure it is a study

RT @realDonaldTrump Please notify the @GOP & #Congress that the days of politicians being paid off by Corps./lobbyists is over. #FullRepeal

If Rand Paul believe the GOP bill is no good then the GOP bill is no good, you do not want to keep the taxes or bail out insurance.
Also Fox News is going against Rand Paul secretly pushing this bill Rand Paul said it's not good.
Do you think these senators care they get insurance for free just saying
Well the corrupted ones definitely don't care, Rand Paul care Trump care but Trump is not the one making the bill.
The question is does Donald Trump have time to look over this bill that they wants to replace Obamacare with.
I feel sure that he has. Then again,Is that NOT what those that were elected suppose to do & had 7 years to do?
If those who were elected can't do their job with the assistance of a baby sitter, then they need to resign. There are a million plus n need
How you going to force them to resign you only can prevent them from getting reelected.
So what is the alternative? Health Savings Accounts
Where are the cost controls? Why not audit Medicaid and cut the fraud waste and abuse?
