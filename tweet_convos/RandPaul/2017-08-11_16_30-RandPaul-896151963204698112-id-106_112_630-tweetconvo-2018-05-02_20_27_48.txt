@Randpaul Will you follow @SenateMajLdr and condemn actions in #Charolettesville ? If not, explain.
I ask again, @RandPaul, will you condemn the actions in #Charlottesviille ? You're my only member of Congress silent on it.
#Charlottesville  we hear your silence
He's obviously in favor of the liberty to practice hate, racism and commit automotive murder. What else could excuse the silence?
So many white men on the stage.... Is that what liberty looks like?
Dear Senator, an #imposture under account @SenatorRand contacts people on @Twitter claiming to be you, proposing business deals! #FAKE
Did you get another moral victory without a win for the American people? Please respond to retired veteran.
#RandPaul would do well as majority leader; its #McConnell that ignores you...

Republicans Fail when they feel Appeasing Democrats is More Important Than Doing What's Right for Their Constituents  DO WHATS RIGHT #MAGA 
Nothing on #Charlottesville ,nothing on #OklahomaCityBombing either Jerry Varnell part of group "Three Percenters"
Your silence is deafening #Charlottesviille
Why haven't you spoken up about #Charlottesville yet?
#TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #GopCOmplicity #GOPSilence History will remember - your grandchildren will remember
You mean the #WhiteLivesMatter convention?
I think @GOP Senators should refrain from attending all white rallies because #Charlottesville
U support Trump Who unearthed the Nazis and the KKK and made them think this was their country.blood on your hands too! 3 died tonight!
very silent about racists killing people though.
hmm...
How many Americans will die and how many will die if Trump goes to war before you Repubs  will act for our Country! U Rs are all complicit
You are with the white supremacists.
Sounds like Sons of Liberty to me 
Check ur history . Weren't they Kkk members. Go back and do eye surgery . u can actually help somebody.
Dems were kkk, they formed the kkk.
Why is the stage full of old, white men? Is that your idea of liberty?
You are another racist. Why not pull your head out of that cess pool of hate and take a breath of fresh air?
Trump is bringing back the KKK, Nazis & White Supremacy. Congress swore an oath to defend us from enemies foreign & DOMESTIC. #ImpeachTrump
Liberty?  You conservative's look to suppress America's at ever turn.
Why aren't you condemning the alt-right, nationalist, white supremacists?
Every Republican needs to publicly condemn the white nationalism rally in Virginia.  Racism has no place in the Republican party.
At $500 to attend!!!!!!!!!!! You have no shame! DO YOUR JOB Koch Boy! #townhallNOW #voteLIBERTARIANSout! #bananarebuplicans #FREEKENTUCKY

RT -
Yep, so much liberty...if ur a RICHwhiteMAN! Yea, we ppl of color feel it, EVERYDAY!
Did you tell them how you still strongly support Mitch McConnell ??
"so much liberty"  ring as hollow as " so much winning".  Actually for both of you - so much BS, we are getting tired of all the BS
Look at all them white folks, Randal!
So what was your excuse for not repealing Obamacare Senator?  THat's why we elected you!
GOP is on life support with very few liberty minded representatives. It's time to pull the plug and move on @Federalists_USA
Get a job, Rand.
It's good to have honorable men in @RandPaul and @GovMattBevin representing the people of Kentucky
Yeah you always screw things up.

A reminder to @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP; you're still on notice. Your support of @POTUS will determine your future in politics #RedNationRising 
@RandPaul why are you the only senator advocating smaller government?  Why do you not have any help?
Because he's a politician 
Not anybody that cares about u
Fantastic.  How about getting the crazy vile orange treason-piggy out of the White House before he gets us all killed?
#trumprussia
#treason
No. He's staying.
Quiet #putinbot egg. Blocked.
And a whole bunch in the audience (including myself and the family). Thanks Rand for the great speech. #SpotOn #PackedHouse  #MAGA
Crooks unite
But there is only so much liberty without opportunity!  Sprout some seeds and let this nation grow once again.
... uumm ... can someone please help me understand what he meant by this?
UNBORN_have been waiting for you & @AmerMedicalAssn 
to honor your Hippocratic Oath
And for you to honor your Constitutional Oath_my brother
You are useless just like daddy...get the hell out of Washington.....
You need to place the foot of liberty up some as ses and whip them into shape
You do such a great job. Wish you could teach @marcorubio  how to do town halls in other towns. He seems to hide out in Miami - never a word
I wonder how your Bluegrass constituents  will react when you vote to kill their insurance. Again.

You're a coward to your own constituents. If you had the fortitude to stand in front of people that won't suck up to you, I would be shocked
Where are the miners and medicaid people?? Voters who need your help aren't here. Why not ??  Looks like all your relatives in the photos.
Please resign.  Americans voted for REPEAL OBAMACARE.
I mean that's not how math works so...3 mil more voted in favor of it.
The majority of American people also are in favor of universal healthcare they did not vote for repeal. Sorry confederates your math is bad
Hillbillies do not need insurance ok so give this MONEY to rich Total Corporate Control from the ripoff Republican Party.
Mitch ain't there, I bet.
Lol dumbest thing ever on twitter
SO MUCH FREEDOM!
Did you guys R&R Ocare? No, get to work. Get over Your plan&work on one for us & NOT http://Ocare.You  heard what we need,start there
We would have more, with health care, tax reform. Go back to work on  Monday. We haven't been on vacation, so work!
real trust 
God bless you Sir and god bless Who believe it in God we trust 
Sure wish your constituents didn't have to pay $500 a plate to talk to you about our concerns.
With all of these unnecessary Gala's it no wonder that Overpaid Welfare Recipients in DC can get nothing done!  Bastidges!
Healthcare Senator.
Love it!! Liberty for all!
You really know that liberty isn't a physical thing you can have on a stage, though, don't you?
Love it!
With Obamacare still in force. You're pathetic @RandPaul
Thanks for your service!
Is "liberty" code for "white men"?
To be fair, a few white women were there too
Tru. Don't look like they was allowed on stage tho
Another stacked room , Rand. REALLY?
Rand Paul is a poop stain
your accomplishment free record is unbroken but #freedumb is your lol battle cry
Please fund our defense spending bill! Thanks. God bless
