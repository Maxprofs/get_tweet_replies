Q: Clinton how are you going to bring coal jobs back to Kentucky? 
A: Put them out of business. - Clinton

that's not how this works...
"Let's not assume trade is the only challenge in the economy." No let's not. You & all your big government regulations are YUGE challenges
"When I was Sec of state we actually INCREASED exports..." yes unfortunately, it was arms to Jihadists #debatenight
Hillary wants us to go to her website to check her facts. THAT'S WHAT I AM HERE FOR HILLARY. I give her website "Pants on Fire" #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump - "The Fed is not doing its job" I agree. We need to Audit the Fed! http://time.com/4170969/sen-rand-paul-audit-the-fed/ … #debatenight
Rules & laws are apparently for other people, not Clinton. It should preclude her from being president. http://time.com/4393859/fbi-hillary-clinton-email-fbi/ … #debatenight
Trump just admitted to not paying income tax. They're both criminals.
and she wonders why she lost!
they would just as happily work in a factory making energy efficient light bulbs. You agree with him less than you agree with her.
So in your world where would you get the electricity to power the high efficiency light bulb.
rate payers R saddled with trillions of $ to rehab coal plants that poison water & air. Time 2 look ahead, do better.
I'm about clean reusable energy but we R never going to bust up the cabal between the government and the lobbyist
and you're right, the coal lobby is a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to progress.
Progress only leads to Socialism! Socialism is not for the powerful only for the peasants! Wake up!
I disagree w/ you b/c I'm awake.
@PP15146407 We don't have to figure that crazy ole dingbat anymore. Hopefully, she is gone from politics now!
@HillaryClinton will say and do anything to win truth be damned according to Obama #BigLeagueTruth
Wrote a poem about #HypocrisyOfHillaryAndDems #DonersDineAndDish https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-M3Zbe2ugI … Please Watch and Subscribe.  Thanks so much!
@TheFloridaGOP because there r more jobs that just coal!
Sad thing is, her #Lemming supporters will say we're lying when we point out her lies & inconsistencies #Can'tFixStupid #Blind
@alllibertynews she is very SELECTIVE  on what she will do and for whom.
Because Coal Is Going Down...STUPID ASS!!  How about helping those coal miners train for clean energy jobs!!!
SHERENE ARE YOU SERIOUS! GLOBAL WARMING IS A HOAX!!!!!
BBWAAAHHHHHAAAA I block uneducated trolls
@HorseShort West Virginia Pennsylvania Ohio Too
she was blowing smoke! @TrumpsterWarriors
pretty same were going to rake hillary over the coal
@alllibertynews you go!
because those coal mining jobs will be replaced with clean energy jobs.
clean energy is expensive and hurts the poor the most. But who cares about the poor people right?
how does it hurt poor people to create jobs in the clean energy field?
Coal is dead, dick. I'm a Kentuckian.
coal isn't dead, Obama just wants to make it unfeasible because he doesn't know anything about ANTHRACITE coal
Dead technology. Sorry.
so you computer is running on wind or solar at the moment??
Neither, unfortunately. Not my choice. Regressive politicians stop it from changing.
please research anthracite coal. It's cleaner and more energy-efficient than petroleum
going to being back coal burning engines then?? My hemi runs on gas not coal.
obviously it's not effective for transportation, but it's the most efficient source of electricity
Because she's for other jobs. Don't be a child about this.
other jobs that don't exist as opposed to jobs that are already in Kentucky??
New jobs are in fact ones that don't exist until you create them.
you mean like all the jobs created by Solyndra?? How'd that work out??
Interesting you focus on one solar company instead of the solar industry, which is booming. Cherrypicking much?
oh there was more than just solyndra. That one just got the most press. How about Fisker.
@CygnusX27 correct, Dr. Paul
@schnalda  So much double-speak when she talks it make me want to hurl!
I have a question, why is no one talking about... http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/08/27/repeal-of-glass-steagall-caused-the-financial-crisis … or the book Clintons War on Women either
Going out on a limb here, but perhaps because she is a #liar??? @RandPaul @smidgean
she wants to declare winners and losers based on her desires not free markets
she means jobs for Social Justice Warriors & other useful idiots.

She said the rest of us are considered enemies
@WinnaWinna2016
fear tactic, they need the coal for hybrid and electric car batteries. If you want to save the planet, bike.
@Bikers4Trump forgot about that one
she's just as bad as Henry Ford, who put horse carriage makers out of business. Coal is dirty. #Coal is over. Wake up.
all she has is self serving words!
KY coal is doing a fine job putting itself out of business. Where is the fed ed $ to #retrain and #revitalize out of work East KY?
Donald: My life has been blueprints. I blueprinted every step of the way up to stepping into the Oval Office.
@steveveling Hillary: You will take the job we give you and you will LIKE it!
.@RandPaul @marsialynn86 Will she stop there? No. After greasing herself with KY she'll screw coal states WY, PA, WV, IL, MT, IN & TX, too.
one of a thousand idiotic statements this (thing) says or supports on any given day. Vote for your Future, DJT.

Hey,Rand — it's the free market she recognized that cheap gas is doing in coal and we need new & different jobs.
it would impact Montana too. Nothing about her character or prior actions indicate anything positive for this country!
@BookTyphoon  mines. I'm surprised you either lack that knowledge or are just lying.
@BookTyphoon  She is not putting coal miners out of business. Pressure from cheaper natural  gas is causing the closure of coal
And Trump sends jobs to China and Mexico?
@alllibertynews #Hillary is all about social intervention, and has 0 economic accountability... We had 8 yrs of that, want 8 more?
@alllibertynews Apparently she's 4 Chinese jobs where solar panels R made, China. HRC is the least qualified "qualified candidate"
I can't stand her but probably the same way you say you are pro-constitution then go to bat for @realDonaldTrump .
Sad thing is Kentucky Democrats just don`t care, they will vote for her anyway.
GO TRUMP GET THEM!  http://israelvideonetwork.com/is-the-obama-a …
Just the beginning Rand. After the Coronation the real HC will place more regulations on us to where '08 will look like good times
She plans to create more jobs at the Clinton crime family foundation, as POTUS much more $$ to count and launder...#Followthemoney
@twojjrs Higher taxes on businesses, and individuals, kill coal, oil, etc. Net = negative jobs. #WakeUpAmerica
.@RandPaul Who are you again?
They have to be the kind of jobs and in industries that her donors want.
ACTION REQUIRED: STOP THE INTERNET TAKEOVER NOW
It is time to move on from coal, she has plans for solar jobs and retraining. Coal is over, dead, and you keep lying to miners
The poorest, most illiterate people in America live in Ky and vote Republican. Numbs the senses.
This isn't what Hillary said and you are bastardizing her words. You're lying
The real question is how do people in Ky keep voting for GOP who has done nothing to help them?
@HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump How much will you raise taxes on the middle class Hillary?
@alllibertynews #LetGaryDebate @GovGaryJohnson
and she is pro regulation, pro nlrb, pro epa
Ohio West Virginia Tennessee if you vote for HRC you economy goes in the shitter
@sandiv11 This will effect every American, higher electric bills
"How can Hillary say she is for jobs when she has stated she will put Kentucky coal miners out of business?"
@POLITICAL_Jeff    She ment more government jobs. Bigger Government, Bigger Taxes!
you mean shovel ready jobs like Obama promised? More politician bullshit. That's what they shovel.
there's nothing genuine about Slick Hilly
Hillary's always lies and has bad ideas . Love how she says trickle down doesn't work, then says top down socialism will work
She wasn't counting on winining Kentucky. So she doesn't care.
SHE is a LIAR,from taking sniper fire in Bosnia to her Husbands affairs, e mails, free college, jobs, 25 yrs Govt make $ off lies
great question, Dr. !
coal mining is not renewable and ecological energy. It has no future.
she lies like everything else that comes out of her mouth!mouth of sauron
She's a disgusting woman.Can you do anything with her connections with George Soros?I hear he has a terrible agenda against the US
the devil lies #HillaryClinton
@fredwimpy #MissedOpportunities

Hillary is for Hillary
I just seen a commercial with Michele ODUMBO saying she trusts Killary with our kids future ARE YOU KIDDING PLEASE
@ImAmberHahn the 1st question was how are you going to bring jobs back. She rambled but never answered HOW moderator didn't push
@ECrocker34 hilarious. It's 2016.  Coal and steel are not where job growth will come from.That ship sailed long ago. #payattention
no reason not to have both. Coal is not as bad as the special interests make it out to be.
not really my point. Coal is no longer a growth industry.  It is a dying industry. Growth will come from other sectors
I'm talking about the people that lost there jobs already due to regulations.And more to come for many industries
sorry, but coal disappeared because of Natural Gas not regulation.  We still export coal, not import. #coalisdead
this misinformation is a classic example of politics101. No real facts there either way just a distraction
natural gas prices can't be manipulated by markets that are manipulated?
don't quite get your point here. Coal as a growth market is about as relevant as the newspaper industry right now.
and how can you support Donald Trump. He is not a Republican, he is dangerous. Those are not the Republican values and principles.
> did they give #hillary immunity as well? Maybe that's why they didn't have her swear to tell the truth! @txrogue1
Remember, while GE's CEO was on the hob board, GE moved hundreds of jobs to CHINA.
There are no jobs. Factories are gone, only restaurants, service sector, part time. NAFTA and obama passes, killed it.
She's for failed big government jobs and anyone who despises our constitution .
@rockynickydog And the gun industry
@GrrrGraphics. And she will ruin the coalminers life. ALL INDEPENDENTS NEED TO VOTE TRUMP
she claims she will invest in training & education what's the point if once your done there are no jobs available.
I wouldn't be surprise it was done to benefit one of her donor.
OH RANDY - YOU KNOW MINERS ARE NOT IN BUSINESS? DON'T YOU?
she is for jobs. Low paying immigrants jobs.
and she truly means this! TRUMP
JAIL THIS LYING WORTHLESS BITCH.
Theirs some people who should protest in mass in Chappaqua  But I forgot there would be no media coverage b/c clintons bye MSM
maybe she means the jobs of the future, not of the past.  Can you take us into the future please?
The only job you can  get is a Kentucky coal miner. #MAGA
@GeneMcVay For that you must sugest to #VoteTrump
@GeneMcVay Golden argument for @realDonaldTrump for the next debate He must stop to go nice with #CroockedHillary #VoteTrump
coal is what kept me warm on cold winter nights....thank you Mr Paul for protecting jobs. Some people only care about themselves!
she will finish what OBAMA'S started..."let's shut down America" OBAMA'S plan to move to their private island so they're safe!
@HoustonWelder The same way she says she is for women's rights and takes money from Saudi Arabia. She lies
@Misruption_Org The public has no idea how vital coal is like vegetarians have no idea how vital farming is.
The same way she can say she's worked for children her whole life, but sanctions the murder of children not born yet
yep she want coal for diamond
SHE IS FOR EQUALITY,,,,SHE WANTS TO PUT EVERYONE OUT OF WORK
She will never create jobs.She 's there to eliminate the midle class.She wants the whealty and the poors.Easy to control by NWO.
She said that about West Virginia coal miners as well. We will #NeverForget
@Rasa171a we cant have coal mines anymore. Clean energy-efficient technologies only at all. Let them have 10yrs to close up shop
Don't forget WV, PA, OH & VA.
How can you be for internet security when you voted to give UN control of the internet
She'll be putting a lot of Native Americans out of jobs, too.  Her "plan" sounds racist to me!
@Verona83  30 years destroying our countries jobs! Great! We R not going to take it anymore!
Don't listen to the witch. Shut her up.
Just a hunch Doctor.. Maybe it's the #SaudiArabia oil ducket$ in #Hillary purse. Oil competes with coal.
Good one Dr. Paul! #TrumpPence16 #TrumpTrain #Crazy Hillary
why shouldn't she? Coal burners spew mercury sulfur, etc. bro you're state welfare game is obsolete you have no answers #buggywhip
for DECADES #Hillary is a SHAMELESS Criminal - more than legal crimes, SHE IS ALL 4STUFFING her FAMILY COFFERS on America's BACK!
and $15.00 min. wage puts small business out of work.
- Government Jobs.
@Best4MT she cherry picks Trumps remarks try's to make them hers-cheap tricks-talk is cheap-just 2 hide she's very sick & dying
this is totally 100% correct!
out of context while there may be some coal its industry past industry is gone. Renewable resources is future + training & jobs.
She is for jobs the way Kervorkian is for life saving procedures. Not sure I would trust either with my economic/personal life
Well she meant jobs in other countries
Hillary's job list is limited to email server technicians
Clean energy is a ruse & Red Herring to deflect from the fact she sells natural resource land rights to foreigners via Clinton Fnd
Maybe she says nuclear tech is outdated as she sells 20% of our uranium to Russia.
You know who would dig our coal? China.
This woman is simply on all these foreign dictators' payroll.
She sells our natural resources to the Eastern bloc & takes in the ME's mercenaries for a coup.
And that's how she's gotten rich. That's parasitism. And subversion.
@nc4everblessed Thanks for the help @RandPaul !
@jenilynn1001 - exactly!
@lori89144 Dr Rand...this is the 21st Century...she mentioned training and rebooting, retooling,coal is over. Soon!#getprepared
Watch the next NorthernSuffolk Railroad commercial, showing RR engineers changing shifts. Coal miners keep the lights on!
Yes Hillary what happened to that 500 million You and Obama LOST in that Solar Panel Company @realDonaldTrump ask her that pls.
all coal miners, WV 2, wish Trump had brought that up
She DID also say she would put those coal miners to work in solar cell factories. Highly unlikely for many reasons. @GrrrGraphics
@kaekykyn only certain jobs, picked by democrats.
@KellyannePolls https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3BnJL7af7gw …
she putting miners in wva out work also we better get together or both states will have nothing to do
Even Bill mocked #coal miners in September. Many out of work, many families in dire straits. http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/09/bill-clinton-criticizes-coal-people-oppose-hillary/ …
@GrrrGraphics She's going to train them to make solar panels. Factory won't be in WVA, OH or PA, but they'll get training...maybe.
Great point!  Were there any of the disenfranchised miners in the audience?
@GrrrGraphics green alternatives to coal gas etc are dying as the tax relief is being withdrawn.
@GrrrGraphics @RandPaul Obama started shutting down coal jobs Hillary will completely close them
Everyone knows you have to put them out of work before you can put them back to work
treacherous Hillary moment by moment DECEPTION.
The only way Hillary creates a job is if she hires another bureaucrat.
New #Energy isn't going away. Start preparing for the change with retraining and finding best uses of old energy, or new uses.
Their deplorables.
@dssinojuli Only those who don't know how important coal is to our domestic energy profile can believe coal jobs are expendable!
right
@KellyannePolls hmm so no ppl will have 2 find new jobs under Trump's plan? Give me a BREAK!!!
NY state has 400K fewer jobs now than before she was their senator. What does that tell you?
right on point. The coal miners are just subjects or peons to queen Hillary let them eat welfare
She's lying like a rug.
She is going to save the economy with solar panels 
#Crooked Hillary is for eliminating jobs.
2020 man!
@NetAdvisor
@NetAdvisor
BC she is a serpent , a liar
@NetAdvisor just like a politician speaks with forked tongue
she's created jobs. She created the 'I'll stab em and you slab em' program.
@KellyannePolls coal is dirty and these people need to learn a new trade.Mining is dangerous and not worth dirty coal. Uneducated
Exactly!! Hence the reason my state of West Virginia despises her.
Say that Trump in the next debate! U can b presidential & still call her out on her lies!!!  we need proactive!
Because  mining is polluting our beautiful planet.
Grow up USA coal has to be stopped. If you got back into manufacturing eg.renewable energy components you could kick economic arse
rigged debate she did not get thrown under bus like Trump. No mention of her lies emails & scandals ....hmmmm?
did you actually listen to her words in this clip? They say the literal opposite of what you're claiming. #ListenBetter
Lester should have asked Hill about that!
As Trump says, what she says during debates/campaigns doesn't matter a wit. It's what she does that counts. And that is bad for us
@KellyannePolls and fracking, oil and how many jobs they want to kill.
@SpecialKMB1969 I know right?
because she lies, lies, lies. She's corrupt.
Putting #MINERS out of work means MORE families TOTALLY Dependent on Govt; hence, #SUPPLICANT #SUBJECTS NOT #CITIZENS @RandPaul
.@RandPaul Because the welfare offices will be hiring in droves to handle all the laid off workers. That's jobs growth, #hillary style
#MAGA
yes
@BeachDreamin291 
She'll say anything to get elevated. Truth is irrelevant.
She can say it because sociopaths have no conscience.
