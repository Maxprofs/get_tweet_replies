Joining my friends @SenMikeLee and @tedcruz tonight to say: no Obamacare lite. #FullRepeal
yeah who needs insurance when they can just die, right?
Where did you ever get the notion that govt is responsible for your health care?
the notion that govt is there to regulate business and stop predatory practices.
What does that have to do with health care?
it's an incredibly huge market rife with waste that the govt has an obligation to regulate.

I read this, and it clearly shows how govt efforts to curb/recover waste are effective.
, replacing with what? A full repeal has been in talks but no concrete replacements by GOP. As the current POTUS wd say. SAD!
Sen @RandPaul plans to replace it with NOTHING, as it SHOULD be! The #freemarket is the only worthwhile solution to healthcare...
Healthcare does not logically work as a free market commodity. Supply and demand is insufficient to prevent death
Your needs don't supercede the freedom of others. Universal Healthcare is an absurd concept. 1/2
Agreed on the freedom concept, however, we should address the issue of healthcare as the dilemma it is. Solve it.
Most issues with ACA were caused by obstructionist Republicans collaborating with insurers for ACA failure. #FixACA
Thank you Missy. Don't you feel that the GOP should now fix that which they broke? #FixACA
I've always loved your dad...And it's good to see that the apple is getting closer to the tree! #maga
@Dc37Deborah Congress is NOT performing well 29% Approval and that's up in last 30 daysDrain the Swamp is only wayMAGA
@SenMikeLee
.@RandPaul you voted to repeal but #GOP can't/won't get it together & come up w/replace! FRUSTRATING! How long do you need? Hope Price can
@plainjane52 @RandPaul Watch Trump make his magic! They are only on stage 2 . Keep the faith!
So don't pander 2the left or moderate repubicans do what you have to do now is your moment &use the media like they do call a town hall mtg
@CruzinAhead Congress should have their insurance abolished. They should be on this new insurance.
you had 8 years to come up with something better!!! Instead y'all decided to shut down. If real ppl did that they would lose jobs
Few people thought Trump would win. Why would they have repeal plans if they had no idea GOP would sweep the elections?
You haven't seen Rand Paul on the news multiple times in recent weeks hawking his replacement plan?
Eight years!!!! EIGHT YEARS!!! EIGHT FUCKING YEARS!! and they threw a hissy fit and closed down gov't!!!
What ever in the world are you talking about?
, you actually no expertise on healthcare economics. Your ideas are ideology and not connected to the real world.

 @MatthewKBurke
You seem to be unaware that Rand Paul is actually a physician so yes, he has expertise
and @MatthewKBurke think medical school and an OB-GYN residency makes one an expert on healthcare economics. LOL. Okay.
It's more than you have. My roomies are nurses and they even know more than about it than congress.
TOTAL REPEAL, CLEAN & NO REPLACEMENT OF THIS HORRIBLE ENTITLEMENT H/C PROGRAM! GOV'T DOESN'T BELONG IN 1/6 OF OUR ECONOMY! #REPEAL
Keep fighting for us! Only FULL repeal!!
@ConserValidity   A totally full repeal
Now that you've seen it, discuss it and get it to work better than what came before!
@bawlaw99 I agree. Where is it?
what a waste of time and money. Almost 20 trillion in debt and you guys just keep adding to it. When will the next WS bailout be?
hold the lying leaderships feet to the iron including my own senator coryn
get them Rand and shake some sense into them or we're kicking their asses out! Ask Dave Brat how we did it!
Unless you want socialism, Government HAS to get out the insurance  business & INSANE/OUT OF CONTROL 'soup kitchen' mentality.
@steph93065 In short term, have to keep ppl from falling thru cracks,over promise,over deliver.Then migrate to balance spending
agreed! Keep them honest and keep them on track. You are emerging as the leader of new GOP. Keep it moving!
: You have lost what little mind you had. Why are you content on killing people. Cause the name has the black guy's on it?
That was when they KNEW the Pres at the time would veto anyway.  Now that @GOP 'can' pass a repeal, do we really think they will?
As POTUS says, it is time for action...
@Lrihendry exactly good place to start
@ChristiChat. Can you work with the pharmacy companies to get medication like insulin to the children. Some parents can't pay
@ChristiChat. Sir please help the children that need medication like insulin to live while aca is being fixed.
If you do a stand alone Repeal then the devious Dems will hang you out to dry on Replace. MUST be done together.
@ChristiChat agree, why isn't it?  Because it was action just for show. They knew it would never be signed then. Buck up and pass
@Lrihendry No excuses

@suziique03 We love you, Sen. Rand!
We trust you to get it done Senator!
My friend had her hip replaced with libertyhealthshare and all expenses where paid by 87 people. No gov involved, taxes credits
and congressional health care should be part of the repeal vote.
Agree!
Will your plan keep the drug donut hole from increasing for seniors? Look at how Mediashare Christian healthcare shared plans
:  Very good, this is what must be done!!!

If McConnell won't do it, he should be replaced as Majority Leader
Continue to fight the good fight sir.
Easy now, Senator ... Gotta do it right.
Please help pre-existing with other than HCAs!  Federal is needed, but not Obamacare!!
Yes #FullRepeal !!
@SenTedCruz it was 16 years ago
it's cute that you thought your colleagues were sincere. 6 years and no legit plan to replace.
2 years ago, #GOP tried to drop #insurance coverage for 20 million people. That should be the bare minimum.
#TrumpFollies
Yes!  Get this done or kiss the Republican party good-bye.
@kevindandy1 Why isn't it.... cause they are ALL corrupt liars!
Thank you for stdg strong for #FullRepeal Senator! U R tight. Need to add to 2015 bill ins & individual mandates. Thank you!
Enough with your uninformed & immature comments. Grow up.
I used to like you, but now I see that you are both cruel and delusional.
GOP has been talking about this for years.  U have no real plan that will yield what ur rhetoric says.  "It's complicated"
@PC1170   YES
You are right... we MUST make sure right @pnehlen  to push egop Paul Ryan to #FullRepeal
60 times this has been voted on? #DoYourJob and investigate #russiagate #liarinchief #Countryoverparty
Put on your big boy pants and work to come up with a proper replacement so you don't leave 30 million people out to dry.
Yes, the beginning of the end of the fiasco #Obamacare, @realDonaldTrump. More worthwhile work to free #WeThePeople
Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are NOT Conservative!
Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are Gutless Cowards!
dont like ACA but your club is too stupid to get this right. No imagination
Congress presented 6 repeals, knowing full well Obama would veto. What's taking the time now? #GOPSuperMajority
@MelissaTweets Please get together with @Potus @SpeakerRyan and hash it out. People are looking for details from @realDonaldTrump
@LilMissRightie You guys have to fight for this. Too many ppl are counting on you to win this one
we're behind you. Thank you.
or, wild idea, you could listen to your constituents, who need affordable healthcare ??
You tell them Senator!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
how about coming up with a replacement that does more than give tax breaks to the rich? Pro Tip: You can't.
ACA repeal would give millionaires an avg tax cut of $50,130 and multi-millionaires an avg tax cut of $197,340
so lame you can't call it by its real name-the ACA-invented by @MittRomney when he was Gov #countrybeforeparty
you repeal the free health care the we pay for for you and your buddies in congress first. Then we will talk about the ACA
put up a better one now! Repeal if have a better one up and running. Evalaute medicaid. Plenty of #fraud
due to you saying "republicans shouldn't investigate republicans" I will never vote @GOP for anything again. Ever.
get it done and done this year im a member a firefighter association and this needs to be done and we dont care how it does
it seems you have a plan to correct this mess. Why aren't you being heard? The American people are with you!
There are literally thousands of people who would die without a law banning preexisting conditions.
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP @McConnellPress @SpeakerRyan


DAMN RIGHT!!
@SenTedCruz #RandisRight
What hell is going on?! @SpeakerRyan
So why r u not supporting the bill to force Trump to release his tax returns.
Suggestion-we shld now call law ACA-not Obamacare--reminds dems of savior--will resist repeal--calling it ACA may bring more supp
Cool, I guess I'll just have to off myself when I'm diagnosed with cancer so i don't leave a lifetime of debt to my family.
why can't you just make adjustments to it instead of leaving us with nothing?
Just do it. Repeal OBC. Not affordable. Medicaid for poor people hospital care. Not ER or Dr visit.

how about investigating Russian influence on the US election instead of attacking the benefits of your constituents
@FreedomWorks bring it
ALL OF YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING AND OBFUSCATING AND REPEAL THE DAMNED MESS. YOU COULD HAVE DEFUNDED IT ANYTIME.
say yes to full investigation into Russian espionage. Say yes to trump tax release. Say yes to American demands
@SenTedCruz Deplorables agree with you Sen Paul.  Get 'er done!!!
Start with your health care senator that taxpayers pay for! It is time for you to go! Out of touch with Americans! Elections soon!
we do not want it replaced with another government plan
do that for those who fall between the cracks, but the rest/majority of is want to return to private plans
Agree!  Why is this such a difficult concept.  Big talk, Weak knees from the Rinos.
MANDATE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
That's not happening. And @POTUS just learned healthcare is complicated. Wut do u do with 49M uninsured if 100% rollback?
We agree! @GOP ignoring people's will, will be replaced!
them put it on the floor. What've u waiting for?  All talk no plan
@SenMikeLee Yes!  Love it when you guys work together.  Think you can get @marcorubio and @SenSasse to join you?
Yes, please!
Full repeal. Nothing short.
Talk to the approximately 400,000 Kentuckians who have healthcare through Obamacare. You R's have a moral blindspot with ACA.
Every thing is telling you to be careful.  Devise something to take its place.
you, sir, are an enemy of the people!
FULL REPEAL.
Period.

Why would you want to replace something that never should have happened in the first place?

#FreeMarket
Because the GOP loves medical bankruptcies? Or was it anti-Obama showboating for 8 years to whip up the "base"?
Abolition of the entire worthless government should be the floor...but that would require a minimally moral electorate.
. Together we can do great things we stand proud with our President
I used to think you were OK for a GOP, I don't anymore. There are many more disappointed people out there.
If you were to compromise on two things (no mandate, and expanding competition beyond state boundaries), I'd support you.
Please keep the important issues the focus & FIGHT the obstructionist Left! ENOUGH of Russia!! @GOP needs to get to work w @POTUS!
@SenTedCruz no a plan for replacement should have been place & none of you greedy sleezeballs came up with one so Obamacare stays!
Your solutions will destroy the gains made by the GOP. check out Germany, healthcare not bought by the lobbyists.
Lets do it now.
It only passed because the cowardly RINOS knew Barry would veto it.
Amen!
Why can’t we just re-pass the 2015 Obamacare repeal bill @BillCassidy @JohnKennedyLA? https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/836384727418404874 … @RandPaul @exjon
2 yrs ago, the GOP Congress voted to repeal Obamacare. That 2015 repeal language should be the floor, the bare minimum. #FullRepeal
@SenTedCruz sweet, copy and paste pontificating...
Stupid GOP leaders should forward to the President one of the 6 repeal bills B.O. vetoed; REPEAL OBAMACARE!!
What insurance do my tax dollars pay for you? And then you gotta go and take it away from me... Not very Christian..
How many more Americans will be covered under your plan than are covered now? #saveaca
the GOP are completely inept,corrupt and incompetent if they can't get the ACA repealed AND Tax and immigration reform.
@FlashReport and replaced with . . . What?
Fed govt make sure we can buy insur @ competitive rates, details of our choosing. Expand HSAs. Focus on tort reform.
Way more than half the country disagrees with you. Remember your a representative not an aristocrat...
8 years to have a replacement and you got nothing!
Here how it start sound like u backing out of all the tuff talk now that u have to produce something. I know BS when it spreading
give the American people congressional healthcare benefits
just repeal. No need to replace. The mrkt will take it from there...
didn't you have a new plan then to replace Obamacare in case you won!
VACATION is over @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @senrobportman MOVE FAST! 2YRS past by & NOT READY?! U should B PAID/Performance! @POTUS
@SenTedCruz PLEASE PLEASE HURRY and REPEAL THIS NIGHTMARE! Over $3k per month in Arizona! #FullRepeal
@SenTedCruz ObamaCare is killing people in Arizona! Paying over $3,000 per month for premiums! That's criminal!#FullRepeal
. Please help the children while figuring out new health care plan. 
Just because you all read from the same republican talking points doesn't mean you all need to tweet the same bullshit verbatim
@SpeakerRyan follow @RandPaul  suggestion!
kill effing O'care now!
@SenTedCruz so where is it at???? Put up or shut up.
How about a plan for what to do after repeal?  Don't we deserve knowing what comes next?
No. What SHOULD be on the floor is #TrumpRussia. And it shouldn't leave the floor until an independent investigation is completed.
You are my senator... and a doctor. Why are you so hell-bent on taking health insurance from 1/2 million Kentuckians?
@SenTedCruz Replace with what? Fairy dust and bitamin C?
480k Kentuckians will lose thier health insurance, or more than 10% of the population of your state, if you repeal ACA.
@SenTedCruz What's your plan?!
y'all also defunded the catastrophic fund pool, ensuring it would fail and we all suffer
I support repeal ONLY if all American taxpayers get the same SINGLE PAYER coverage Senators receive. The single payer? INCOME TAX!
.@RandPaul @SenTedCruz The American people stand with you to #Repeat2015Repeal and fulfill @potus promise to #MAGA
Speak for yourself please
how, replace with what genius?
to bad you don't know how to chew gum and right a bill. You just want insurance companies to get rich, why not admit it. Donors
@RepMarkMeadows easy to say when it's the yxpayer paying your tab
@SenTedCruz 
Help come up with a replacement you and your dad are best suited for this
ACA Repeal is #RepublicanSanctionedMurder
aca #FullRepeal is #freedom
yeah,that's what they call death. Freedom.
THANK YOU PLEASE KEEP FIGHTING FOR WE THE PEOPLE! STOP THE OBAMA DEATHCARE NIGHTMARE!
@sentedcruz everyone knows you are a gulen cult member ps fyi
Some need 2 Stop procrastinating Surely if this impossible bill can B passed  it can be #FullRepeal
agree! Wish you were senate leader, McConnell sucks. Full repeal, cabinet, slash size gov, BUDGET
The House had no problem passing repeal bills that had no chance of passing the Senate...what's the hold up now???
@POTUS we the people want #FullRepeal now!
@SenMikeLee You are killing those who need the most help. Is that what Christians and Americans do?
watch Paul Ryan. They think he may be setting POTUS up on obamacare setting him up for impeachment.
@SenTedCruz to be blunt #wtf are you doing to America?and Americans? And what about #townhall2017? Grow some balls gentlemen
what's the plan for sick people that couldn't get insurance pre Obama care?
Emergency room
you are cowards, do what is in the best interest of the people of this great country, not just your party. Country before party
100% with u on this! Demand action from @RepPaulRyanVP and congress now! @WSJ
Russia
@SenTedCruz Ummmm, y'all have a replacement? Your constituents are looking for more from you. #gonein2018 #resist #disappointed
we the people are behind you senator Paul! #FullRepeal
@SenTedCruz you have voted 60 times and have no replace plan. Shame on you #Obamacare #resist
Here's how you pass it quickly. Make Senators and Congressman be on the plan. Period
Get Ryan moving on this. It looks as if he's stalling.
you need to be the speaker of the house Sr!
