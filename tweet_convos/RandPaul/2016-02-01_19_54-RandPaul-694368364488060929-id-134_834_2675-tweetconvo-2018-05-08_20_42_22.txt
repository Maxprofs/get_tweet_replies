a win for you to be next Pres.Step into the fire.
Thank you @RandPaul for getting the voice of the reason out in the debate! Top 5 finish and you beat Bush, Christie and Kaisch! Congrats!
@RandPaul glad to hear! Honestly you are my 2nd choice, only behind @tedcruz. @realDonaldTrump is LAST on my list
@RandPaul best advice to you, write a bad ass speech sir and turn up the damn Mic!!! 

Liberty isn't ringing loud enough!!!
@RandPaul seriously, this is where Rubio got his momentum, he pandered to the evangelicals and he's loud, turn it up!
@RandPaul You are a bright mind with great values.  So glad so many people had the chance to hear them.
@RandPaul Change the game, Be the 1st GOP to stand up & say we have a climate, water & food crisis! Be a game changer and reverse the "Bern"

#StandWithRand
@RandPaul @jacobvarner14 lol
@RandPaul @lizzyf620 Maybe you and Jeb! can combine your <1% support each to become a real juggernaut.
@RandPaul @lizzyf620 you keep on going, trooper
@RandPaul I'm an independent that usually votes Dem but I am rooting for you!I like your vision and your open mind on issues that make sense
@RandPaul Kentucky needs you to win senator in our state. Please focus on that instead of this impossible task of winning president.
@RandPaul we stand with you, always
@RandPaul you're welcome Dr Paul. I delivered a damn fine speech for you tonight in Iowa. Best of luck in New Hampshire!
@RandPaul seriously??? Wow
@RandPaul and Liberty will prevail. #StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul Never Give Up
@RandPaul time to concede so party can unite.
@RandPaul Nice to see you speak tonight in Cedar Rapids. Thanks for coming. #IowaCaucus #StandWithRand
@RandPaul Are you really that stupid ? 4% ... Buh Bye !
@RandPaul Thank you Rand!!! We're with you until the end. We will not compromise convictions with popularity! #StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul *facepalms*
@RandPaul Why? You don't resonate.You don't have a snowballs chance. Why not show love of your party and get on board with top candidates?
@MilamBill @RandPaul because the rest of his party is shit and he knows it
@cxnscixus @RandPaul Go Suck your pacifier.
@RandPaul I'm still going to #StandWithRand
@RandPaul As long as you're in, I #StandWithRand
@RandPaul continue we will!
@RandPaul Use the GOP for debate time.Then leave them for an independent bid! Expose the "unholy alliance" of more war&spending NATIONALLY!
@RandPaul drop out please
@RandPaul run as independent
@RandPaul @GeorgeChristy8 why bother your numbers in Iowa are pathetic
@RandPaul Keep fighting!!!
@RandPaul TOP 5 MOTHERFUCKER.  Let's go Rand, I know you can do it.  Once you make top 3 then people will come to their senses.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Rand stand behind a candidate who can WIN & make a difference with policy in the cabinet. #Cruz
@RandPaul Glad to see you in top 5, though I wish it was much higher. #dontquit #pushon
@RandPaul @joesonka Rand, just to let you know in case you missed it you got 4% of the vote which means you finished 5th.
@RandPaul If you don't make it farther, you should be Cruz's VP
@RandPaul the only fiscally conservative candidate & supporter of the ENTIRE Bill of Rights. I continue to #StandWithRand
@RandPaul gotta get that money from your gullible followers Eh? 5%? Shock the world? PLEASE.
@RandPaul Suspend the campaign
#Trump2016 
#NewHampshireForTrump
#TrumpTrain
@RandPaul I'm with you to the end! #RandRally #StandWithRand  #IACaucus
@RandPaul At least you beat Jeb and hopefully got yourself another debate spot.  Should've never gone soft on your message.
@RandPaul don't give up. You're what this country needs.
@RandPaul @joesonka
@RandPaul Yes!!!!
@RandPaul @Nancywillask no one is congratulating CRUZ ,except Megyn Kelly , who is the big winner in this debate
Keep fighting @RandPaul.  Top 5 is still a good start. I will caucus for you in Nevada on Feb 23rd
@RandPaul you need to suspend your campaign and endorse @tedcruz for President. You are now doing more harm than good.
@RandPaul Without a representative, we are slaves...James Otis Jr.
You are our rep Rand...don't ever give up!
@RandPaul NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@RandPaul least crazy GOP candidate available...sorry but that means you lose sir
@JoeyAdams7 @RandPaul its one state
@adlangston75 @RandPaul the state isn't my point. GOP voting majority is. Plenty of sane options outside of top two crazies
@RandPaul like I said I used to think democrats were the dumbest. Now I'm pretty sure Iowans are
Always happy to support @RandPaul @justinamash
@RandPaul all 4.5% of it! Amazing! How do you fundraiser off of that result?
@RandPaul work the convention!!  Here comes the ground game!!!
@RandPaul Will be great to hear from you next debate!!!!!   Congrats!!!!
@Nancywillask @RandPaul I'm sure they will censor him
@RandPaul back @tedcruz Dr Paul & back out. You're my 2nd choice but don't have a chance.
@PoliticalFreak_ @RandPaul @tedcruz Cruz is a fraud.  Research better.  I am not bitter...Cruz is my candidate...he lies.
@RobbinsLeisha @RandPaul @tedcruz you need to research better. #CruzCrew
@PoliticalFreak_ @RandPaul @tedcruz....he is my Senator!  I have done plenty of research and I won't vote for Cruz!!!
@RandPaul keep on running, remember there's 2020!
@RandPaul #StandWithRand
@RandPaul fight on with what? A broken tail pipe?
@RandPaul you haven't dropped out yet bruh?
@RandPaul
You @SenTedCruz And @RealBenCarson Need to have each others 6. Ur fighting the #Gopestablishment
@RandPaul Don't give up!!
@RandPaul thanks, keep the fight going.  Call Jeb and get some of his money
@RandPaul @joesonka drop out
@RandPaul Thought you were going to exceed expectations??  Hope you do better in New Hampshire, but not holding my breath.
@RandPaul it's not over yet! Get ahead of Trump- buy a farm in New Hampshire
@RandPaul Nice job placing 5th!  Especially since it was higher than @JebBush. #StandWithRand
@RandPaul 
keep up the fight and the war has not bean won yet.
@RandPaul yes we will!
@RandPaul @joesonka get out now, before you soil yourself.
@RandPaul nice job beating jeb
@RandPaul the country needs you!
@RandPaul #why #constitutionalconservative @tedcruz
@RandPaul Solid effort. Solid principles. Thank you.
@RandPaul Iowa's straw poll means little.  Just ask President Santorum!
@RandPaul C'mon Paul drop out, and if you stay in stop fricking attacking TC.  Go after DT.
@Mellecon  #TedCruz is a creep.  His wife may be even creepier.  "TrusTed"... I don't think so.
@RandPaul Liberty never gives up! We fight, we fight all night and all day! We the People, not We the Iowa.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul You got it Senator!
@RandPaul that's,, ambitious
@RandPaul drop out and run for reelection.
@RandPaul good luck in nh
Stubborn pride @RandPaul .  Think of America....not yourself.
@noprezzie2012 @RandPaul Rand's support will not break to Cruz, maybe 10%.  Won't break to Trump either.
Great night Dr. @RandPaul . Strong finish.
@RandPaul #StandWithRand
@RandPaul love you
@RandPaul doesn't matter if we lose dr. paul we still fight for liberty
@RandPaul We tried out here sir!!! Keep going strong!!!!
