Congress is a joke all they do is bitch about Trump
that's true, so we all must find the candidates who r talking like trump. Anti globalization. The real patriots!
The only thing the RNC is incapable of doing is the right thing for the average citizens of the USA.
thank you Senator Rand Paul for standing up for truth and goodness.
@realDonaldTrump pushes Congress 2 act on DACA/immigration & @RandPaul pushes on war power duty after 7+ yrs of Rep obstruction.  About time
Sorry senator. They won't. Money and power.
Congress quit doing its job in 1945 When it created agencies to do its & the judiciaries job. Unconstitutionally!
Since we are in the beginning of the election campaign for 2018; one could second Rand Paul and include the American voters, time to put or
Seems like Congress is just another welfare program! What have they done that's worthy of payment?
They have done nothing except aide in the stripping away of our liberties.
CALL YOUR SENATOR AND ASK HIM TO BACK UP SENATOR RAND PAUL.
Only sane voice in D.C it would seem
We know they will not do thier job as long as Paul Ryan is speaker of the house
Thank You Rand. It's time someone starts doing the right thing!
US needs to get out of drug trade. 42% increase production from last yrs record opium poppy crop Afghanistan+ created targeted opioid crisis
Do there job? Funny, coming from someone that sat in a corner sucking their thumb.
Haha! Do their job? This is a parody account, Right?
y'all haven't for years why start now?  #bothparties
Why not gotta start somewhere right?
Now we know that 61 Senators prefer that congress continues receiving welfare checks instead of doing the work we sent them to do.
I applaud what you attempted today @RandPaul. It was a valiant attempt. Please consider now standing with @SenSanders for #SinglePayer.
Too bad we can't clone you about 98 times.
Repubs vote for more war & do nothing to stop abortion. GOP will not give life, peace or Paul a chance so write RandPaul in '20 PresElection
THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE WORKING ON OH YES THEY ARE WORKING ON DACA 2 A PROGRAM WITH 50% FRAUDULENT APPLICANT'S @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump SAD !
@PressSec @LouDobbs There appears to be a myriad of empty seats in Senate as Sen Paul makes a plea for Congress to uphold the Constitution!
Don't hold your breath
..thry can't get a simple repeal
I could have saved you some time on that one. Too many blue shirts on the red team.
How many desks did you have to turn over before you found all the cowards?
I hate to say it but I doubt it, that's like saying congress will work together efficiently effectively & ethically
Congress stand up and do its job. Lol. Are you a senator or a stand up comedian?
Won't count on it
Senator Paul attempting to work for American people but he deals with blockades @realDonaldTrump I believe U maybe trust
Mind control is easier when t person will not believe it could be,as it is ALL those in Power that R UNDER THESE MIND CONTROL FACTS,#T VOTES
#StandWithRand
Sorry4r Country that r so called brothers&sisters in office r so damn drugged uP they have no Idea what is wrong w/them not Voting 4t people
I don't expect much from Mush McConnell, the RINO's any longer. Bitterly disappointed they squandered our trust and votes since 2010 & lied
Poor baby! Then make 2018 the year you take back your Constitution!
No comprimise mesns stand alone means you snd constituents loose. Wake up senator. @VP @POTUS
So where are @SenJohnMcCain and @JeffFlake on this?  Gulf of Tonkin resolution was a disaster.  AUMF fixes nothing. Alienating voters.
Won't get better until we go back to Senators appointed by States. Appointment by States keeps them in line with States and the people.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your leadership on this issue. I won't forget

Most senators are elected by ignorant,misled, misinformed and abused electors and you,you expect senators will do their duty.
I voted for you in primaries, and am impressed by your adherence to constitution. I may not agree w/ everything u fight 4, but enough war!
They haven't been doing that in years. What makes you think they will now ?
I want a list of all who did not vote in favor of Rands bill- remove the eliteist warmongers!
Thank you senator. You have your dads courage and belief in adhering to our constitution. Where have all our great spokesmen gone?
Congress hasn't done crap in years what makes you think these old cronies will change vote them all out Rep and Dem term limits! Enough 
Support this amendment
That will be a first
Nice to see that you're drawing a crowd... 
That's the true sign of a leader... How well respected his ideas are among those he works with!!
Return power to Congress
Unfortunately we already know the answer.
You are as big a #bozo as @SenateMajLdr ... you guys are abysmal and incompetent, so why would anyone listen to your ridiculous quest
#IStandWithRand too! He's was terrific today!
Congress & Senate members who do not uphold their Oath need to be brought up on TRAITOR charges, plain & simple. Start w/sanctuary city ppl.
God bless you and God bless every citizens 
Thank you! You are the only sane voice of reason in our government to date. Thank you for taking this stand!!!!

#Congress is the biggest bunch of worthless corrupt ppl & needs to be purged
Good luck on that one they haven't done their in the last 8 years
I must say, you certainly have your supporters!

A real loser. You are finished
says the real loser who is an "expert" on entertainment. Get real. Ppl must follow the Constitution b4 it's gone.

Rand Paul #2024
Great speech! Please do the same to stop DACA amnesty! Thank you!
#StandWithRand
HE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW! But he wasn't hardcore enough. Should have went after hillary more!
