GOP should NOT emulate Nancy Pelosi & allow text of #RepealObamacare bill to be read @abettel @RandPaul
To answer your query, it is not democracy. It's a pity that you supported Trump. I wish you had been stronger.
1. We don't live in a democracy & 2. We're very PROUD of our @POTUS & 3. We'll re-elect #Trump2020. #MAGA
Proud of him for what?
he can read?
.@abettel @RandPaul seems to be more of the stuff his dad @RonPaul had to endure while voting on the #PATRIOTAct http://www.ronpaul.com/2015-12-21/congress-passes-patriot-act-ii-in-secret/ … ...
.@abettel @RandPaul @RonPaul in 2001, 2005 & while trying to pass the audit the fed bill in 2010 http://www.ronpaul.com/audit-the-federal-reserve-hr-1207/ …
& I can't help but comment that I've seen this coming 
@jcoralpark @RandPaul @politico it's a house bill he's a senator
That is a concern. Mr Paul's plan is a good one. The other plan circulating, not so much @MitchMcConell
Mr. Paul's plan is nonsense.  Obamacare works...slowed cost growth + insured 22M new people.
.. at massive cost to those of us already insured
@ga_undrdawg @RandPaul @politico keep up the good works Rand Paul  we citizens know that you R correct and wide awake. Thank you.
He's one of the few on The Hill that I trust. Why are the republicans being shady?
@FriendlyJMC @RandPaul @politico why,I'm not getting it
Because Ryan's plan keeps Cadillac plans & an entitlement. Rand's plan is complete overhaul.
I was under the impression that @POTUS was working with Rand as well.We all know Ryan has liberal
If Ryan pulls a fast one and doesn't completely REPEAL Obama Care you are going to see a REAL REBELLION.
that's because the bill doesn't exist! NeoCons are solutionless frauds.
it is all just one big circus sideshow
when the hell are you people going to wake up and realize your government is your slave master
@_metafizik @RandPaul @politico they were afraid he'd use it for rolling papers
@_metafizik @RandPaul @politico WTF?!?
Because he is a leaker and cannot be trusted with confidential preliminary info. Too bad so sad.
Ryan @SpeakerRyan can't be trusted with this.  His track record of late is not good for "the people."
they do what they do because we let them get away with it so easily
thank you Sen Rand Paul for your integrity. I don't always agree with you but I always believe you
When people start dying from lack of health care, these guys might be sorry they were so "Liberal" about guns
This guy has proven to be a true conservative...you go Rand!
#StandWithRand
and when I bring this subject up no one shares it.
I have been telling you people Republicans Democrats two faces on the same coin period good cop bad cop
tell us how did they do that
Will this guy ever go away? He is not his father
#DefundTheGOP
maybe you have to pass it first?
we live in a banana republic.
swamp dwellers,take names to #draintheswamp
- You were blocked because you are a right-wing-extremist-wacko that somehow got elected Senator. U have zero in common.
wait & see , be careful ,either way too extreme ,can do harm also
.@abettel .@RandPaul .@POTUS .@realDonaldTrump .@PressSec .@whpresscorps Wonder what they are trying to hide. Maybe the Russians know.
@tamaraleighllc @RandPaul @politico The good senator can't get his hands on the replacement bill bc there is no replacement bill!
@tamaraleighllc @RandPaul @politico what's the secret? Let it be seen by all !see if it will pass!
Why does it seem you have become the only principled member of congress?
.@abettel @RandPaul @politico now you know how we all feel-The GOP is doing back alley deals. You should have stood up long ago!
Rand Paul ideas Suck. So please shut up.
UNACCEPTABLE!! RELEASE THE BILL **NOW**
GOP ACTS LIKE DEMS. WASHINGTON INSIDERS. GOING AGAINST WHAT TRUMP WANTS. STAND W RAND
ask them if they have Hilliarys emails
Hell no-bamacare! Repeal! Completely REPEAL! The @realDonaldTrump promised complete repeal!
keep fighting! Glad Paul stands up for what is right
Go get 'em Senator, we appreciate it!
Although I might not agree with all your policies, I've seen you do the right thing for the American People THANK YOU.
unacceptable and more proof they do not have US citizens interests at heart! 
@spicysaurus5 @RandPaul @politico Why?By whom? Outrageous America should demand disclosure!!!!
@POTUS @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Get @RandPaul the bill!!!
Did you stamp your greedy little feet?
Because any odd idea will be blown up in the press, I don't mind the closed door for now. Wait for proposal then discuss.
But still, give 'em hell @RandPaul .  Hold them to the fire.  #ACArepeal
You have to pass it before you can read it. Remember? You loons set this precedent.
That's not right.
Uh... you know it's the House GOP hiding it, right? "Progressive liberals" want the details.
He needs to just cool his jets.
Guess he'll have to vote on it to see whats in it...
Where did I hear that before?
This bill needs to be read and discussed before any of them sign it!  Thank you, Rand Paul, for your efforts!
#StandWithRand
you are curing cancer, just denying treatment for those that have it. Bring in the death panels.
what the heck we have major #RINOS #DrainTheSwamp
#GOP betraying #WeThePeople
Outrageous!
Shameful!
Why? What valid reason does GOP have?
@NetworksManager @RandPaul
why are they hiding it from Senator Rand Paul is it because it really is a scam? Should people be paying 30 000 $ for Obamacare?
**FOLKS --THE GOP REPUBS HAVE TO GET SOME GUTS & GO AFTER THE CRIMINAL DEMRATS & THEYRE PLENTY OF THEM
**START WITH TRAITOR OBAMA & CRIMINAL CLINTON--GO-JUST DO IT**
hell anybody could have told him that this is the way nothing gets done
Seems DR. Paul should be one to review any bill.
is dangerous to the status quo. Theyre afraid that he will uncover their big gov plan.
why?
This is just bizarre...
why are you being blocked? I called my rep and his aid told me he was unaware of such
as a doctor i feel you should have wrote the thing not a insurance company
why?
there is no replace. The plan is to tell poor people to go die quietly or be arrested
When it's time, it'll be released
That's not a satisfactory reason. Elected reps have every right to the peoples' business.
hmmmmm
@OutnumberedFNC - @SpeakerRyan needs to be taken to the woodshed by @POTUS - This will not git 'er done!
- @RandPaul should at least be included and both sides need to stop the publicity
He's not a quiter! You go Senator!
Unacceptable. Will they use the pelosi defense to get it passed?
You can't see what doesn't exist.
supposedly available to read in a viewing room by committee members
oh whatever. He will see it when it's ready and he can pick it a part then.
tell me again WHY this is part of FOIA?? ITS OUR LAWS
Go Rand Go!
You can't be "blocked" from something that does not exist. #ACA
And???
