.@RandPaul @ibarradoug @HillaryClinton @katiezez students don't have an income. Tax deductibility means literally nothing to them
@JasonRBNY making it free isn't the answer. That would dilute the education.

The main complaint is that they can't pay their debt after
@ibarradoug debt is a real issue. Both Bernie & Hillary want massive cuts to student interest payments. Tax deductibility is still pointless
@JasonRBNY there are companies that will cut your interest rates for you.

Hillary and Bernie can cripple our economy some other way.
@ibarradoug if we want college to be affordable there are real ways to do that. Cutting taxes on no-income folks is the least effective way
@JasonRBNY Making it free isn't close to the answer either.
@ibarradoug well then why are you arguing for cheaper college if you don't like that outcome?
@JasonRBNY I'm not arguing for it. I'm fine how it is. I thought you were arguing for it to be free?
and fund expanded medicare+ college tuition by 90% by cutting the NSA/DHS/Ag/Commerce/DOD budgets
@RandPaul @evangie @HillaryClinton Rand if College were to be free, how would we pay the staff?
@Donkey_Tales @RandPaul @evangie @HillaryClinton By stealing it from someone else. Nothing is free!
#Freecollege increases tax burden; we could improve access by offering a course at a time http://imaginealex.org 
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul  why are you still talking??
@stephaniemagui4 @RandPaul Why are you still talking? #RandRally
@wesley2455 @RandPaul Yawn
@RandPaul doesn't that just further complicate the tax code? We need less deductions, not more
@adamUCF @RandPaul You must know nothing about his tax plan abolish the 70k worth of deductions and use a flat tax, best tax plan.
@RandPaul UMMM new flash it already is, and your student loan repayment....
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost Show em Liberty Rand. You are the only candidate that understands anything really. #RandRally
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost Hey dummy, that doesn't help poor people go to college. It just makes it cheaper for rich people.
@randpaul @hillaryclinton Yeah, they are just able to do it in a dozen other countries.
@RandPaul @IngaKaybor @HillaryClinton Or remove Government from education period.
@RandPaul @QuoththeRavenSA @HillaryClinton Great, let's make college even more expensive!!!!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton stop charging us 8% interest to borrow from the Department of Edu and extend the interest tax to all earners! #wmv
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Make college avoidable. Rewrite gov't job openings in terms of certifications, not degrees.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez @QB_obstinance16
@RandPaul @patriotnurse77 @HillaryClinton @katiezez lets dump the code.  #fairtax
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost What about your simple one page flat tax?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez yeah, let's continue to force kids to work full time while they're going to school. Good point dick
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost this sounds great, but how would you do it?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton BTW, interest paid on student loans is already tax deductible, so I'm not sure what add. tax credit you could add.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton And high interest, mortgage-sized loans just to be able to earn a degree are? A tax credit isn't the answer.
@RandPaul @iloveco2andgmos @HillaryClinton And what wrong is there with parents paying the education ? Nothing, other relatives can help too
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez Hmm ... Abolish the IRS, but make tuition deductible to students with no income. Smart?
@RandPaul You had to sit out your own party's debate. Do you REALLY think anyone cares what you have to say during the #DemDebate?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost Tax deductions DO NOT help anyone that is financially unable to pay for college tuition upfront.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Germany seems to be sustaining it just fine. What say you?
@RandPaul what about foster children with no parents ? Would you lock them into life poverty ?Homeless 18 and no way go college
@RandPaul imagine that ! But common sense can't be implanted like silicon so not a chance Doc.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I would be very interested in better understanding the logistics of this idea.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez what does that say to the families who lived in poverty to send their kids to a CC? Do we get a refund?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost  does any one know where all that money is really going to come from. Free isn't free.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost not right it isn't if you make over 60K.
. @RandPaul that's funny, your flat tax plan would eliminate all deductions except for a mortgage and charities would be eliminated
@efty0529 @RandPaul more to Paul's tax plan than just the 14.5% #readup
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton What about reform of accreditation to drive down cost. To many classes have to be retaken driving up cost
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost Also not a solution. A world of Band-Aids doesn't fix a gaping hole.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton no individual too powerful to jail! Prophetic self reflective words from Mrs. Clinton perhaps?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton SNARK! LOL! :)!!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost Not sustainable?? Then how is almost every other major industrialized country pulling it off?
@RandPaul what good is a tax deduction if Im unable to work enough hours while studying? I only make 15 grand a year full time, and school.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton The fact you're unwilling to take the steps necessary to do it doesn't make it impossible.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Do you know what else isn't sustainable? Vote: https://youtu.be/mxh6sWX1x0g 
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez No Rand, ur campaign is what's not sustainable. If US can pay 4 war it can pay 4 college #DemDebate
@whitsubstance @RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez HAHA i don't like Rand Paul, but free college would SUCK
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost you could start by eliminating the cap and phase out on the student loan interest exp deduction!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton You want a degree then you better be ready to pay for it.  Let's get government out of education and healthcare
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez These student loans are out of control!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost but doing nothing is not an option
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez it is if you go to state school $4100 and under
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton How would that simplify the tax code?? Bring back Shop training to high schools. We need tradesmen right now
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Its is if you use Pay-for's from closing wall street and donor-class loop hole & apply it to the education system
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez that's a legit idea. Thumbs up from a hard lefty
@RandPaul The higher education system as it stands is the next bubble, it will either be entirely subsidized by the gov or become absolute
Keeping US on top with education is sustainable. Figure it out. "@RandPaul: .@HillaryClinton, free college isn't sustainable.. #DemDebate"
@RandPaul @washingtonpost since students rarely have taxable income, would you allow a carry forward NOL? That would be sweet!
@RandPaul HRC: Young voters want to be independent.
Parents: Then why do you let them stay on our insurance until they're 26?
@RandPaul - doesn't that only benefit the rich? What about people with low tax burdens like the poor?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez how does that help people who can't afford tuition in the first place?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost I wrote a proposal and cost analysis on this. @RepMikeCoffman has had it in office for 4 yrs or so
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez only include courses relevant to the degree also.  That'll reduce a lot of unnecessary expenses.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez good point
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Why not? Other countries have free tuition?
@RandPaul very true!!!!!!!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost that's actually a really good policy proposal. #DemDebate #StandWithRand
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost we don't need right off's when we don't have anything to right it off of.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost even better if Gov out and costs decrease. Gov made tuition increase from $30/hr to $315/hr
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez how about #interestfree #education #loans ? @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez no more playing around with the tax code. #flattax
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost Rand, are you really still running?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton It is if you're willing to close some tax loopholes on the wealthiest Americans. @BernieSanders #demdebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez I agree especially for those who don't get the education free!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton then why is it sustainable in successful European countries...?
“@RandPaul:, free college isn't sustainable, but making college tuition tax deductible is. http://wapo.st/1ncTE0D  #DemDebate” amen!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez Nice stepping stone.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Yes Rand! A tax write-off would be awesome! #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez it should be free!!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Will Hillary ever answer a direct question?  Why must she go around EVERYTHING she's ever asked.  Disgusting.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost Bullshit it's not!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez if only I already paid $30,000 in taxes.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton and get the govt out of the student loan biz.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @washingtonpost  #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton But wouldn't that deduction go against your flat tax and simplified tax plan?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez Nothing is "free". She SHOULD know that by now!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Oh, come on Rand!  You know that's bullshit!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @katiezez agreed
