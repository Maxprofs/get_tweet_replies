@GinnieLumpkin @hedeen89 @RandPaul #CruzPaul
@trissysmom @GinnieLumpkin @RandPaul I'm down for that
@RandPaul @joshuah006 Anyone know if Rand Paul is on all 50 ballots or not? We need to rally & move forward by voting for RP in the primary
@brook30white @RandTheBrand @RandPaul @joshuah006 even if he's no he can even be written in even on a primary ballot.
@RandPaul thank you and your family for your courageous fight for Liberty.
@RandPaul I am voting for you in the California primary. I thank you for all you do. Never give up!
@RandPaul god bless you rand, I am very concerned for the future of America and I feel like you were our last chance to get it right
@RandPaul I gave birth to my first child this year. Your campaign gave me hope for his future. Please don't stop fighting for our liberties.
@RandPaul I live in TX. I'd like to send money to you every time @tedcruz asks me for it. Can I still donate to you or your fav charity?
@RandPaul Still voting for you, btw.
@RandPaul let the circus of clowns destroy eachother and die down, then jump back in. You will save a TON of money!
@RandPaul  Liberty lives on! #RCW ensures it. We pick up where the founders left off in defense of #Individualism:
@RandPaul Literally crying rn. Our country needs you.
@RandPaul Thank YOU, Dr. Paul #StandWithRand
@RandPaul And we thank you, Sir. And as long as your name is on the primary ballots, we are still voting for you. #StandWithRand
@RandPaul get back in the game. That's how you start
@RandPaul you're just getting started bringing liberty back to us. You've lit a fire that won't be extinguished 
@RandPaul who do I even vote for now? Lol
@RandPaul would you reconsider your decision? Your voice is going to be missed in presidential debates.
@RandPaul I'm glad that we are the minority...I wouldn't feel special anymore when everyone agrees with us. It makes me feel smart!
@RandPaul Thank you Rand Paul for bringing your message of Liberty to the GOP and also sparking my interest into politics #standwithrand
@RandPaul to bad Rand didn't trust GOD more about his running for president and his seat in Congress.
@RandPaul we will miss you.  Thanks for trying and keep fighting to defend for our freedom...  
Thank you @RandPaul. 
I feel our country is moving closer to the movie "Idiocracy" with the clown show going on.
@RandPaul how are you out of the race and all those "others" still in? Something is just not right
@RandPaul "BANKRUPTCY GENIUS " START BY CALLING BEN CARSON A CHILD MOLESTER AGAIN! Love you all
@RandPaul I wish the result was so different. Ugh!
@RandPaul It really sucks you're suspending your campaign. Out of all the candidates, from both parties, you were the most logical.
@RandPaul from Jesuit high school in Sacramento, CA we love you Rand!
@RandPaul I'm sorry to hear you dropped out of the race. You had my vote! Thanks for giving liberty a voice. Best wishes. 
@RandPaul It is sad to see you leave. I was ready to #StandWithRand in NH. Anyway, you are an idol to me and I wish you luck in the future.
@RandPaul Our Pleasure!
#StandWithRand
@RandPaul Are you supporting Cruz now? He is probably America's last hope to shrink Government now that you're gone.
