@RandPaul IMO its also pretty explicit about SCOTUS.  Advise and Consent
@optimistelf @RandPaul Advise and consent is not the rubber stamp you want it to be. Sorry
@Swampbeast777 @RandPaul Wow-Nice.First rule of dialogue is making baseless assumptions about people you don't know anything about.Rock On
@optimistelf @RandPaul It's well researched my friend. Every other tweet you send is you whining about Garland. Am I wrong?
@Swampbeast777 Whining? Nice. Yes, you are wrong. I would like them to respect the Constitution, advise and consent, not necessarily approve
@optimistelf They are advising and consenting. They are advising against confirmation in an election year, and want the people to have a say
@Swampbeast777 And FYI I would be saying same thing if Dems were doing this.This partisan bs from either side is destructive to our country
@optimistelf So is wasting Congress time. They still haven't passed a budget under Obama in 7 years. That is the priority.
@dawnellemurray        I will be supporting Trump, though my first choice is Rand Paul.  I believe trump will make a great president.
@mcclure_donnie @Justified_Not @dawnellemurray and I believe Rand Paul has a future in the Trump Administration
@duane_steele @Justified_Not @dawnellemurray  I'm a former Rand Paul Supporter.  Enthusiastic @realDonaldTrump supporter now!
@RandPaul @YouTube if our constitution is so explicit why can't a judge figure out what a natural born citizen is
@duane_steele @RandPaul @YouTube The Constitution is very clear on natural born citizenship. The Cruzbots just don't want to hear it
@Swampbeast777 @RandPaul @YouTube it seems like none of the courts do either
@duane_steele @RandPaul @YouTube Well the courts are full of Obama judges so what do ya expect? Their decisions are based on opinion not law
@RandPaul @freedomtex  & This Congress may see MASSIVE TURNOVER because of its complete failure to protect CONSTITUTION from POTUS!!!
@jdarrell208 @RandPaul Probably not. Most Dems seats are safe.
@RandPaul @C4Constitution EXACTLY RIGHT !YOU NEED TO SPEAK OUT ! PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW FACTS ! CANT LIVE W/ HILLARY !
@RandPaul @alllibertynews - Tell that to Hillary....!!!
@RandPaul @brendasyl55 Treason!  Dictators! Now funding foreign mercenaries.  We need to review our Declaration of Independence.
@RandPaul @TeaParty_CA we have not declared war since WWII. It's a disgrace. And fake treaties too. You should have taken Iran deal to SCt
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Without tacit approval also, there seems to be no culpability either.
@RandPaul @YouTube 
When has our gov last respected the Constitution? I'm just curious. No way to change the system. Look what happed 2 Ted.
@RandPaul @DrMartyFox
Where do you stand on Presidents lying to Congress about 911/WMD/KSA?
@RandPaul @DrMartyFox under the constitution, this usurper would be tried for treason...what gives?...have we no honest representatives? SMH
@RandPaul If you & Congress truly honored the oath you took to the Constitution & We the People you would have IMPEACHED BO @DonnyLateNight
@RandPaul Say one thing do another Congress not tried 2 stop BHO's lawlessness & US destruction -importing illegals/Muslims @DonnyLateNight
@RandPaul @Ricky_Vaughn99 There you go, Making sense again, How dare you!
@RandPaul @TeaParty_CA What about the 2300 Marines headed to Iraq to face ISIS. So far Congress has not done much.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews we should stop all the wars. The only bring misery and death. Oh, forgot: some people make a lot of money
@RandPaul @YouTube and the impotent, bicameral, U.S. Congress say idly by, watching Obama trash our Constitution and our reputation. Thanks
@RandPaul @YouTube I hear Prince Hussein from Jordan will be making a presidential run in 2020
@RandPaul 
@realDonaldTrump
@RandPaul @TeaParty_CA and have you done anything to stop obama?
@RandPaul @YouTube Dr. Paul who're we kidding #Banksters destroyed Khaddafi & Lybia to prevent the gold base dinar currency. Congress?!
@RandPaul @wildflower6422 @YouTube
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Vote for Candidates that believe in Liberty and Transparency in Government.  Thank you Dr. Paul!!! #Patriot
@RandPaul @TeaParty_CA
Between CONGRESS, MSM & CALIPH
@OANN @ABC @CBSNews @nbc @CNN @msnbc @ABCWorldNews @NBCNews @CNNPolitics @nytimes @NRO
@RandPaul @TeaParty_CA Dr. Paul please endorse @realDonaldTrump ! We need you in the new administration!
@RandPaul @YouTube I agree
@RandPaul Congress can't decide if were in a war or a police action. Their approval is 15% while the President is 45%. Give me a break.
@RandPaul the big "C" strikes again
@RandPaul is there still time to impeach him? Can you do that?
@RandPaul Did congress pass any resolution condemning the same??
@RandPaul and if they did, do you really think the end result would have been better or different?
@RandPaul @YouTube Yes Senator Paul
.@RandPaul The #GOP Congress has been very clear, they don't want to have a say in the decision to go to war. #tcot
@RandPaul the US has a DoD why not a DoO - department of offense to ID those nations ripe for regime change. i.e. those posing threat to USD
well, damn, @RandPaul ... you know what they say about a stopped clock...
@RandPaul can you address your relationship with the koch brothers. They contribute money to you ,just like they do with Obama
@RandPaul We need you as President Sir. I will never stop supporting you for this position and everything you stand for!
@RandPaul   No, No, No!!
@RandPaul - The GOP, the Dems and SCOTUS have violated the Constitution for more than 100 Years. How do we restore our foundation?
@RandPaul  let's be real. The GOP salivates when the word "invade" or "war" is brought up. #youreInTheWrongParty
@RandPaul can you Un-suspend your campaign? 
@RandPaul once violated, then there is a loophole that sets the stage that it is now OK to violate the #Constitution at any time.
@RandPaul then why did our illustrious congress let him do it? Just as all the other illegal unconstitutional things he's done
@RandPaul but how else could @POTUS and @HillaryClinton create #Isis
@RandPaul @YouTube Must follow the Constitution itsour guide n protector everything messed up because we havent must restore our Liberty#SWR
@RandPaul @YouTube Opened the gates of Hell. Wider. Intentionally.
@RandPaul Thank God for you and your father. Constitutionalist and reasonable minds are in very short supply in our Govt. Thank you Dr. Paul
@RandPaul  good interview. Only 4 those seeking truth over political 'color' 
@RandPaul And a lot of other places like Vietnam but we have to try out our new weapons & dispose of the old ones while training soldiers!
@RandPaul Hitler did not invent #libertarianism just to ask congress about every military action! #StandWithRand
@RandPaul @YouTube Assign Responsibility and Accountability..Dnt just comment what we all know.
@RandPaul The evil king and his do-nothing courtiers don't give a rat's rear about the Constitution.
@RandPaul didn't need a vote Hillary made the decission and that was good enough for pres O
@RandPaul @YouTube #StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
@RandPaul  We should have never gotten involved with Libya period.
@RandPaul @alfwats09 Tell that to Hillary and Obama.  Hillary pushed her agenda
@RandPaul @YouTube How about you stop the Jim Crow Rules in the GOP, keeping "certain types" of people out?
GOP is openly discriminating.
@RandPaul be Trump's VP
@RandPaul The American people are sick & tired of ALL of Congress' hindsight excuses! Wake up; read, write & think about what you are doing!
@RandPaul I sincerely wish you had not dropped out of the race..
@RandPaul Mr Paul our Govt has gone astray! This election cycle will go down in history as "The Year The People Took Country Back"
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton your war..
@RandPaul
