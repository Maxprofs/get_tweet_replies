@eventestes @RandPaul @freedomtex I think you will not find anything in the vaults if and when it is audited.
@eventestes @RandPaul @freedomtex Absolutely! Never audited? How does that happen? That's like never balancing my checkbook. #Incompetence
False,@junnietidbit! @BernieSanders & @RonPaul joined together to audit the Fed in 2010. @eventestes @RandPaul @freedomtex
@eventestes @Notorious_Nava @junnietidbit @BernieSanders @RonPaul @RandPaul Fed should be audited, then unwound and disbanded.
@RandPaul They own the economy. They are the puppet masters. All Jews!
@RandPaul Jail the Bankers like Iceland did  cong. issue our currency as a public utility at no interest just like the Const. says

@RandPaul @ReversingASD
@RandPaul @freedomtex They say abolish the IRS, audit the FED, put Obama & Hillary on trial for treason. Great let's do it! HOW DO WE START?
@MileHigh49er @RandPaul Well the last 2 are unlikely, but for the first 2 we need more conservatives in Congress.
.@RandPaul - Bernie Sanders voted for your Audit-the-Fed bill and he wrote this op-ed on reforming the Fed: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/opinion/bernie-sanders-to-rein-in-wall-street-fix-the-fed.html?_r=0 … #TheFed
@RandPaul And you fail to understand that income disparity is significantly more impactful to citizens than is the value of currency.
@RandPaul Bernie voted for your bill, dork.
@RandPaul Didn't Sanders co sponsor an audit the fed bill with your dad.....
@RandPaul Well THAT is simply NOT true!! At least according to google... http://www.rawstory.com/2016/01/audit-the-fed-rand-paul-and-bernie-sanders-join-forces-against-the-federal-reserve/ …
@RandPaul Time to #endthefed
@RandPaul i agree 100 %!!!
@RandPaul didn't Bernie sanders vote to audit the fed? Didn't he also work with your father on this issue in the past?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders  voted with you on that. You're being disingenuous
@RandPaul what's the obsession with inflation all about? Moderate inflation has no negative inpact. Probably even good effect. #Econ101
@RandPaul what will you do to improve economic conditions in Central City, Ky. ? either party seems really only care about big metro cities
@RandPaul I thought Sanders supported you in the recent vote to audit the Federal Reserve, Senator?
@randpaul why throw @berniesanders under the bus when he supported #auditthefed that's low and disrespectful.
@RandPaul @sherrysue66 #AuditTheFed
@RandPaul it's nice, but let's make it read "no one"
@RandPaul I feel like Sanders would be very in favor of this
@RandPaul not one question about how the Fed printed its way to an economy based on Facebook users and Amazon memberships
@RandPaul @BernieSanders voted to audit the Fed, and has spoken about it on many occasions.
@RandPaul Good luck with that.
@RandPaul Sanders voted with you on the Fed Transparency Bill while Cruz and Rubio left you deserted? Why lie on this serious issue?
@RandPaul audit the fed bill now.
@RandPaul they understand... They're just scared of them..
@RandPaul @endwardd This tweet is like a ghost of the Ron Paul Revolution past, circa 2007.
@RandPaul didn't @SenSanders vote yes on that?
@RandPaul Sanders talks a good game regarding the Fed but destroyed the last bill
@abben_anna @RandPaul Rand knows!#EndTheFed #StandWithRand
@RandPaul  #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul didn't you just comend @BernieSanders for supporting your audit the fed bill despite dems striking it down?
@RandPaul *Applause*
#RandRally
@RandPaul I agree!
@RandPaul @freedomtex How about no one on stage...?   Analysis:  True.
@RandPaul you know it lets hang out lol
@RandPaul Mrs. Alan Greenspan isn't going down that path #AndreaMitchell
@RandPaul
@RandPaul audit???  Heck, who even owns the fed??
@RandPaul @BernieSanders voted with you
@RouteLastResort @RandPaul @BernieSanders I'm really disappointed that Rand has trashed Bernie when he's been so outspoken on the fed too.
@RandPaul Bernie voted for your bill. What are you talking about? #FeelTheBern #AudittheFed
@RandPaul Audit the fed and break-up big banks that control wall street
@RandPaul gas now costs five cents per gallon in1964 dollars.  Tnx Fed.
@RandPaul this is why I voted for Ron. I won't vote for you because you're too concerned with the conservative social agenda.
@furnsey @RandPaul,  that's because we want to win this time, what ppl want, no third party will win, you gotta infiltrate and work em.
@RandPaul unfortunately you can probably fit the people who do understand that into one small room.
@RandPaul  agree, but make it last on the list of to do
.@RandPaul audit then #endthefed
@RandPaul i like most of the things you say, but you're isolationist stance on defense issues bothers me
@JenniferRo79 @RandPaul it's not isolationism, it's non interventionism.
@RandPaul So, you support the legislation @BernieSanders has put forth to do just that, right? #DemDebate
@SFR_UMD @RandPaul @BernieSanders There's more than 1 proposal.
@RandPaul I will give @SenSanders some props tho. At least he voted aye instead of gutting it. #LessonLearned
@RandPaul to be fair Bernie voted yes on it
.@RandPaul HRC gets it. #WinSheMust #Hillary2016
