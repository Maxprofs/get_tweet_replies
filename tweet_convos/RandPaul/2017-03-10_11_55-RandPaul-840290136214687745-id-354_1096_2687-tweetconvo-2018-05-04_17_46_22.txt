Do your bill criticizing in private Rand acting like. You and Jordan are acting like Dems. argue it out in pvt.
disagree. i hope every conservative speaks up against the establishment plan #Ryancare
so you just want to make sure people have nothing but still have to pay a fine?
ALL Americans want the health care our Senate and House have
@ParentWayne @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Then apply for a government job. They have the same as Fed employees
Hiring freeze by 45 prohibits this.
plenty of jobs for people with skills. https://www.usajobs.gov 
There is a hiring freeze. I am employed but want good insurance.
I agree. Repeal and replace the damn thing! Or let it implode. #CongressDoYourJob No RyanCare No O-Care Lite
Do not support the Paul Ryan healthcare proposal. It is bad. Prefer a free system.
Paul Ryan healthcare proposal bad. See Rand Paul proposal. Tom Price. Free market competition to keep price down.
Must repeal all regulations that made their way through all group policies of health care and made costs increase
yes repeal don't replace our medical concerns go back to dr/patient relationship Government is not invited period
way to go Rand!! 
Would be great to someone put a true repeal on the table..Where does @SpeakerRyan get the nerve to lie so boldly
Is RINO RYAN trying to separate Pres. Trump from his supporters with this BS Copout bill?
@POTUS thank you both for working for the citizens!!! #MAGA
Ryan is trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube and it can't be done.
I hope he was open to your plan.
Paul Ryan works for his Liberal lobbyist wife... Repeal ACA,then replace Ryan
your plan is fatally flawed
@bridget4kicks @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews spk to head of disabilities on ins
SenPaul force MConnell to revoke Fil Rule. No Const Reqm't 4 60 votes 2 pass legis. Reid did it for Obama 11/2013
two excellent minds !
you need refundable tax credits so everyone can benefit from the market. Big Corp tax credit 4 all
Allow federal government contractors to join group insurance carrier that signs on federal gov. employees also
Individuals need to join a group to lower costs. Allow them to join carrier of federal health care employees
Can you talk to POTUS about removal of Ryan?  He's not worth keeping around just because of fund raising. #DumpRyan
@ellabella_007_ @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Open to negotiation does not mean giving in to a cry baby.
#istandwithrand

We see socialized medicine is substandard. Foreigners visit U.S. for excellent care
I was stationed in the Uk and trust me we do not want fed ran med like
ours will be better
not hardly look around you Obamacare is not even affordable and middle
Keep fighting Sen. Paul, Ryan needs to be locked up in the closet some where!
Revoking filib. rule allows all legis to pass incl COMPLETE ACA REPLACEMENT. Reid did it 4 Obama GOP can 4 Trump
Need to make law NO ENTITLEMENTS for ILLEGALS. No Insurance surcharge! Who collects Insurance Lobby Money from SURCHARGE
@RandStudents @realDonaldTrump President Trump, if you sign Ryan's bill, you might as well have not bothered to repeal ACA
Rand Paul's bill is the only real replacement on the table right now.
Why isn't McConnell fighting for the 1\2 Million residents of Kentucky who are gonna lose healthcare under TRUMP
Breitbart is not news its propaganda. That's why 10s of thousands will lose healthcare in Kentucky under GOP plan
And that's only the beginning!
You realize that uninsured went from 17-7% under Obamacare. So you and Mitch are taking that from Kentucky citzen
Rand don't let us down. No hidden taxes, no subsidies, no insurance company sweetheart deals  #fullrepeal
perhaps you should take into consideration the hundreds of thousands that will loose ins
if they have in now.... it holds so long as they fund it toll next open period...
sellout
Seriously Senator Paul, you're using Breitbart? I expected more from you.
they can get up to a 75% subsidy.. that's fair ?! Cuz I pay for that with Paul Ryan & 18,000 a month paycheck
SENATOR PAUL YOU ARE AN AMERICAN HERO AND WE LOVE YOU!!! THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION!!!
@SecPriceMD ....WELLNESS > ILLNESS
@SecPriceMD Fund MedSavAccts w/ tax free rewards for neg Metabolic Syn risk factors & prevent CAD DM BP CVA etc..

NO ENTITLEMENTS FOR ILLEGALS, Get rid of SURCHARGE TO INSURANCE CO, LOBBY MONEY
Fix it Rand!  Open up interstate competition!
Do you think he understands that the public doesn't want a "new" Obamacare?  Will he help to END the MANDATE?
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAY SAME PREMIUM  SICK OR HEALTHY .AMERICANS HAVE RIGHTS TO THE SAME PLAN. DO NOT DISCRIMINATE
A AHC compromise: allow refund tax cr. for two year but has to go to HSA. After 2yr a tax ded. If put to HSA.
full,open,competitive, unsubsidized, free market in health care, domestic international bidders
Not a fan of the postcard I got from you Rand. Canadian drug fear mongering is not what I expected out of you.
let's stop fooling around, #Repeal and Replace with free market solution
Rand, GOP has had 7 years to get internal agreement on replace plan. Why are you making waves now instead of b4?
My family (3 Voters) COMPLETELY AGREES WITH YOU, SENATOR!  Keep FIGHTING FOR US!  God Bless!
I doubt if any other president would give access the way he has
Thank God we have an advocate like you who understands what needs to be done to reform healthcare senator.
@SpeakerRyan uh oh. Paul and Trump making a deal without Eddie Munster?
http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/house-republicans-let-employers-demand-workers-genetic-test-results/ …  Keep your eyeballs off my DNA! This is an invasion of privacy!
awesome thanks
we don't want @SpeakerRyan plan. Yes for @RandPaul plan
you are the voice of reason . Keep fighting. Oh loved the copy machine outside locked door.
thanks for talking to President Trump.
Thank you Rand go to the man himself God bless #StandWithRand
Please no #RinoCare #draintheswamp of @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @gop @RepTomEmmer
please keep up the fight!
He's a liar and a con. You can't trust trump.
@StephenHerreid @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews I hope so!  RINO-TrumpCare is unacceptable.
I always liked you since the songify the news.
I really like a lot of your suggestions for the heathcare bill. Makes so much sense.
hope you made progress
Listen to Rand Paul, doing right for American people
Trump has not been given accurate info about the Health Bill by Ryan. He needs the truth in order to fix it.
"The only  solution to America’s care crisis is a single-payer  health care program” B. Sanders
DID you mention Illegal Invasion Syria? Assad did NOT invite us there! WE ARE INVADING SOVEREIGN NATION AGAIN!
#PaulRyan has written & voted yes on lege for MY tax $ to pay 4 illegals, and NOW 4 FREE health care! #Ryancare
#REPEALANDREPLACE
It's time #Congress has to have the Same insurance they stick us with!! or give citizens theirs!
Our gov't is broke and should get out of healthcare. It doesn't help the ppl or the country.
There is no repeal.... #Trumpcare is an amendment to the ACA.
@SpeakerRyan has to go. He is blind to the ppl and only cares about his donors. Americans see right though him.
so what happened?
.@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews
 good luck sir!  
.@SpeakerRyan is the New Pelosi!
What a joke he's become!
#FullRepeal ! no less
Do not let agencies grow size by collecting fines & penalties.  Dangerous to freedom in America.  Pass Law to end
To cut back gov. agencies.  All fines & penalties DO NOT GO TO AGENCY BUDGET.!  They go to taxpayers as refund.
Thank you.
The President will listen to all perspectives! Bring the votes to Amend or replace and the President will deal!
New plan will fail. Love Rand Paul plan. Solves many problems.  Power away from insurance special interests.
this will be disastrous, keep fighting Rand, As a pvt prac peds it is more Govt/Insur between me & my patients!
will the House and Senate get the same insurance
I am so encouraged to hear there seems to be real conversation and a wish to work together
hope hes open to your suggestions I think he is being snookered by Ryan. Is he deregulating everything but HC? @realDonaldTrump
everybody needs to listen to @RandPaul .  He's the most reasonable voice, a brilliant strategist & a doctor.
Sorry, no longer read Breitbart. Should do #FullRepeal & free market solution. Your plan better than House plan. @realDonaldTrump
Standing behind you on the healthcare and against Paul Ryan.
I agree with Sen Paul we must get repealing Obamacare done correctly no Obama lite
Please Mr. President listen to Rand Paul!! Get all costs down now & no mandates&penalties...
he and @POTUS  are communicating
Did he win you over on OcareLite? I pray the answer is no.
@__DragonWings__ @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump need to end Congress passing laws that exclude themselves
This is great stuff. Please block Obamacare Lite and vote in the the Rand Paul plan
ok...
PLEASE WORK TOGETHER TO GET THE BEST H-CARE PLAN EVER...ENVY OF  THE WORLD!! PRAY AND WORK!!
@POTUS NEEDS TO LISTEN TO A DR PAUL, NOT a car salesman Paul Ryan....
Stand Strong Rand. Don't give in. REPEAL B4 REPLACE
Is it true what's being reported today that Freedom Caucus members are being threatened?
@NetworksManager @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews

Whoopie!

Offer a 4 million reward for a brilliant mind to produce a real plan.
BASIC-BASIC-BASIC health insurance should b mandatory from cradle to grave and it should b a health savings acct
and I assume he insisted you go along with this monster?-Anyone still doubt Trump's a big gov guy?
@NetworksManager @realDonaldTrump  hope it was s good conversation. American people want what's best
Yasssss Get Government out of our Healthcare Love the idea of Free market and Co-op No Mandate Tax Credit REPEAL
Or just go to the tried and tested single-payer which is cheaper and more accessable
If TrumpCare is anything less than a tax, it's unconstitutional. We know that! Who wants to bet it's still a tax?
And if it's still a tax, we don't need or want it. #FullRepealNow
no penalties, no mandates, no government compulsions, that is what the people want who voted republican.
Repeal do not replace. Let the free market work. No more entitlement programs, #Repeal
did @POTUS get you in line to support #Ryancare ?
Did not vote for Rand Paul as POTUS. his so called plan doesn't help people
Thank you.  We need free market solutions.  More competition.  Less big insurance! @Jim_Peoples_ @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews
Really like your plan!!! Kick Paul Ryan to the curb!!

FULLY support Rand Pauls ideas !!!! #StandWithRand
. Give us the exact same health coverage that Congress gets.
COPY + PASTE.
Please stay on this and convince Ryan that his plan needs to change.  We need free market to work.
AM 64 PAYING OUT OF POCKET 4 YEARS PRICED OUT OF MEDICAL CARE BY OBAMA NOW THIS RINO CARE? GO WITH RAND PAUL PLS!
@hectormorenco @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Did he listen?
cool way to elaborate. How about some substance and details.
just learned the 10 requirements of O care will still be in OMG WHY please explain
I'm sure President Trump will listento you, Senator Paul! I trust you and certainly hope he does too!
I sure hope this means you are NOT going to concede to this crap Obamacare Lite
@gr8tjude @realDonaldTrump Tell him voters were the machine that drove him to the presidency fueled by HIS promises not Ryans!
@woodseysmith @realDonaldTrump no healthcare for illegals.
why is brietbart in the news not crediable source!
.@RandPaul @.realDonaldTrump .@BreitbartNews Thank you Sen Paul.Obama admin regulated monstrous mess. Only full repeal will cut off its head
Very good interview; touched all aspects of the issues with current bill.
Thank you, sir. I needed to hear the strategy to pass the bill, now I'm on board.
keep up the pressure.
@woodseysmith @realDonaldTrump I have absolutely no problem with them hammering it out in public.. it's called transparency
Stay the course.  Pres. Trump probably believes that mutts like Ryan actually CARE about America.
@POTUS @KellyannePolls YES! American Healthcare Act 1st stage of R&R  WITHIN reconciliation process. GET IT DONE
please listen to Rand Paul.
Repeal/Replace on same day. Love idea of Credit unions co-op to buy insurance plans.
@BrianFeldbusch @realDonaldTrump Sen Paul is correct; hope GOP can reach a consensus better than Speaker did with us re refugees.
@Lori4Unity @realDonaldTrump Stick to your Guns Senator. Get the gov't out of the insurance and healthcare business.
i bet he told u to stop the grandstanding and vote for the acha.
Ryan has to go. He will never understand conservatives. Such a phoney.
you have no integrity.
@hectormorenco @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews with the business tax credit have business lower your insurance
I hope you convinced him there is a better way than the path we are on!
@hectormorenco @realDonaldTrump you bragging?
healthcare should never be for profit, your plan is not for the people.  trump u promised to take care of us
pass the healthcare bill. Get on the Trump train.
#Ryancare is just a twisted version of Obamacare.  SAY NO!!!
I hope and pray president Trump listened to you.This was a promise Trump made to repeal & replace Obamacare.Praying.

@tom_trotts @realDonaldTrump i dont trust ryan
you're not alone in that lack of trust!
I hope some of that conversation included your plan to replace. Obamacare-lite is bad bad bad.
Go DR Paul! Rands the man with the plan! Senate bill #222. Please go with his plan Mr. President!
please listen to Rand don't look back and be sorry
ACA has >450"Secretary shall" rules. AHCA adds >50 more-That's >500decisions we can't make ourselves (or vote on) 
because you don't get your way you destroy all. Something not heathy about that
conservatives didn't win the election. Donald Trump, did and now you clowns wanna sabotage all
I'm on your side, but I sure hope you can work this out  -- we need to start getting things done -- THE RIGHT WAY, of course.
THANK GOD! I hoped you would.
Thank you Senator Paul. Please continue to fight Paul Ryan and the other sell outs
we trust you both.
If we wanted ObamaCare-lite or Ryan Care we'd have voted Bush, Rubio or Kaisch
I know who you kissed last summer. @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews
@cookphotoworks @realDonaldTrump repeal don't replace. If you replace demos win govt is not a hc provider ask the Veterans REPEAL
Doubt he will. His own @BreitbartNews is already crying about Trump's voter base losing ACA subsidies
#FakeNews stop retweeting Breitbart.
please help @realDonaldTrump understand that Obamacare 2.0 is a complete disaster for families, and your party.
it's GOP leadership that's the major roadblock. If get McConnell out of the Senate maybe things will get done.
really? I didn't see trump around when you were hauling your printer about.
nice! Keep the line of commutation open and work on a compromise
Is there any hope he is listening?  Need to kick .@SenateMajLdr and .@SpeakerRyan  in the butt. No fed role in HC
DJT is allowing @SpeakerRyan hang himself by the way of THE PEOPLE
If Congress had to be on the same plan, they'd fix this disaster in a hurry! They get premium govt plan 
Reply to @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Stand With Rand! Senator Paul's replacement plan...4 pages long! It is all that is required.
I think we should let Obamacare implode them it is on The Democrats then fix it since you all can't agree on much
Did you figure out how many people that will die from the repeal?   #irresponsible
actually  ignoring us who are self employed with huge premiums AGAIN. We're the backbone you're still trying to break.
And I bet u laid down like a dog 4 him to scratch ur belly, eh? Promise of a big donation in 2020?
Repeal and don't replace.
