@bfraser747 @RandPaul @DRUDGE  I think Paul is a granstander! He should put his money where his mouth is and shut it!Just work!
I care about America more than anyone, but my respect for the Republican Party's support of Donald Trump makes me question the entire
Senator Paul: I heard Bowling Green is a "sanctuary city." BG doesn't want or need refugees or illegals.
Arm the homeless!
you and random deserve each other nuts meyer
Republican Party's belief. Is ideology and party lines more important than the majority of Americans who DID NOT VOTE FOR TRUMP?

Has the people's interest at heart! Good Man!
***** the ACA is imploding on it's own!!!
Rands ideas are so great he won the Rep nomination and then the Presidency...oh wait...
People can't get passed the mainstream media... or he would be President
@RandPaul Senator, please explain why you believe that members of congress deserve better healthcare than their constituents?
Drudge is wrong about Trump tweeting.  His base loves it and want him to continue.  It's necessary bc the media has abdicated the truth.
@hale4jesus @RandPaul @DRUDGE Censored yet again?
I could tell that the Repeal Golf game went well; I could see it on Rand Paul's face!
POTUS Trump is NOT against tea party, he is against things not getting done after 7 yrs! Koch bros are paying @freedomcaucus to say NO.
I agree, Mr. Drudge, we need his health plan.
That's the best joke I've heard all year! #Gracias
You should have your head examined. My dog is a far greater american than these troglodytes. Rand Paul is a fool. Drudge is a charlatan.
Are you optimystic fór state deficit to be balanced under current Administrator.
@HaukurHjaltason.
Drudge always deletes his tweets.. here it is
looks like u were censored.
Really like him and agree -
Matt too, he's our modern day Walter Winchell.
He's a modern day Davey Crockett. Pioneer, explorer, patriot.
AGREE, #MAGA
Eric always seems so NeoCon...strange.
Not as long as Senator Paul opposes the Trump agenda & undermines initiatives like he did in #RepealAndReplace   He had a lot to prove.
You're not correct on health care! I agree with you mostly 122 pages vs 2700 pages can mon!
Can they explain the utterly inexplicable as @realDonaldTrump hands control of agenda to Ryan-Losing war of words on intel- Comey employed?
Sorry guys, Rand, like his dad, only cares about Rand and demonstrating his vastly superior intellect, his way or the Evan McMullin highway
nice take. It's amazing all of different factions of loyalty in the GOP. Amazingly destructive for a party. So many cowboys.
@MSNBC @CNNPolitics @washingtonpost we agree thank you very much for the note
Do not add your name to this list#DMV
Way to go Senator Paul! You told it like it is today on CNN.
He had a good mentor.
You couldn't be more laughable if your makeup was orange and your combover was blonde. #AnotherTrumpAssKissingSleazebot
Rand Paul fights like a KING, not a team mate
Eric-Thank for recognizing what most of America is missing!!!!
#StandWithRand
You got that right, Eric!
It's just the way they say things at times. Words have meanings
Couldn't agree more@randpaul and @drudge! They truly are#MAGA
add @TGowdySC  to that and you have an army of Patriots. #savingAmerica

you mean the destruction of the republic
You need to get to the @POTUS and get him to realize that Paul Ryan is NOT a friend.
You earned it TY from the rolling fork valley Kentucky
RPaul is a granstander.Needs to keep mouth shut and work! Pettiness aired in public for exposure!
@ericbolling - are you crazy?  @RandPaul is a prima donna.
But Eric, he wants to create Associans.  That is just another word for PAC, Political Donor or AARP or..."Give me a dollar and I will vote."
I stand with Rand.
If Rand Paul weren't so anti-Israel, he'd be a great Senator.
Please get face time with Trump! He is being brainwashed & controlled by GOPe! True outsiders are Freedom Caucus! Trump going backward now!
This guy Bolling lost all credibility after getting his leg trembles for Papa Trump. Stay away from him Rand, he'll only pull you down.
^5
#StandWithRand
never trumper and obstruction instigator  trying to derail anything not his idea no compromise
Not so sure at times
add Cruz, Lee and Freedom Caucus to that!
Agreed!
Trump is now apart of the swamp. If he wants to go after the #FreedomCaucus remember the primary?
NOT REALLY  TELLING THEM TO START WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE #AHCA MUST HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT @ericbolling @RandPaul @DRUDGE
Rand Paul yes but Matt Drudge?
Matt Drudge has reprinted more BS and fake news than the National Inquirer. RP smart honest man MD not so much, EB not at all!
I certainly hope our @POTUS verbally supports  @RandPaul efforts on the ACA when the bill is redrafted
Rand should have been VP.  Love Pence but Rand knows ALL the waste and BS in Wash. Not afraid to fight either
Dadgum Shame! It feels like Special interest has won again over hard working Americans.  Dadgum shame!
Anyone tell me why the Drudge Report is suddenly being blocked by Twitter as being "unsafe"?
disagree that he is best.
Can u have a private word with Trump and bring him back to reason? Siding with snake RINOs over tea party patriots?
for Speaker of the House! @DRUDGE #ResignRyan
Oh Eric you have gone down a dark hole @RandPaul great American   Ha no way self serving person
The pity party for immigrants and refugees is facade for future votes for the one world order.  Dems / obooma
Eric u must have Started Young to claim to know as much as you Do
Trumps support of the "Ways and Means" committee does not lineup with "HIS" Campaign Promises?
Love him!
