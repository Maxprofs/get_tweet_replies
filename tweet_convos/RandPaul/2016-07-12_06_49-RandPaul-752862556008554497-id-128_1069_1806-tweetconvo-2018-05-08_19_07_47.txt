yes, it's an "outrage" because you didn't get what you WANT. The outrage is you pretending you care about this just to slander her
She did this to herself! We want the laws to be the same for everyone! Even the Clintons.
uh huh. The FBI would completely disagree... which is why they didn't suggest filing charges.
You should watch the video of the Cromey answering ?'s from Trey Gowdy. She was not innocent.
or are you trying to claim you know more than the director of the FBI?
That's all he was saying rather than addressing the fact the she did commit all of the actions
Are you serious?? She is clearly guilty. The facts were there.
Clearly, you're ignorant. That article has nothing to do w/ 3%ers or what we were talking about.
You and the Senate are the OUTRAGE! #DoYourJob Pass laws for money for #opiod and #Zikavaccine. You’re an MD!  Laws need money!
@drginareghetti
this is what ALL Federal agencies have come to...double standards! NO JUSTICE!!
.@RandPaul "Dr"?? You stole that honorific. You're not a doctor. You're a Libertarian, corporations-shou-own-everything, RW nut-job.
and, of course, one for you. What about innocent until proven guilty? Are you judge, jury and executioner? Preposterous!
so low
NO, we have one set of laws. The framers of our great NATION will not go down over pansies. PPL DO YOUR JOBS! ENFORCE!
@alllibertynews  Rothschild owned DOJ-FBI-CIA- R PROTECTING HER! SHE IS THEIR MINION ROTHSCHILD CREATED UN TO BILK & CONTROL WORLD
#Hillary4Prison #Justice4Benghazi
Close, but not quite. It is more like one set of laws for politicians and rich people and celebrities and one for the rest.
agree 
@alllibertynews Money speaks volumes Id say
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich  @deejay90192 @HilClin4WOPriso JUSTICE NOW... The American Law...@TheJusticeDept

@alllibertynews we can not leave it up 2  bought off congress 2end the Rothschild fed-we must do it ourselves.He rules our country
Equal Rights 4 Hillary.lock her up lock her out
@alllibertynews the key to a Clinton conviction is the clinto foundation. Stop thinking we are idiots Rand, she sold SAP's come on
. Hillary a disaster
@franksladeltcol that would be a lie tho... Forget it and just vote for @realDonaldTrump
hopefully the law & order president will see that Hillary is charged.
It's funny!  FBI did their job. Result wasn't what you wanted but would have been classier if you and Repubs accepted outcome.
@bigbanecia support TRUMP!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NyfiFZsDZU&t=0s …
It's all rigged! Clearly, she is guilty & very evil! Lynch&Comey are part of the Clinton Cash Elite! #AboveTheLaw #NotTrustworthy
because @billclinton  gave @LorettaLynch a job she excused herself from the final decision leaving it to career professionals
you are a doctor if one has an emotional attachment don't they have to hand the case to someone they trust will be impartial too?
are you acting outraged for cool points because there is nothing unusual here. Why are you attacking a person who is doing well?
so, you think Powell, Rice and Bush should be prosecuted, too? Why aren't you saying that's an outrage, Mr. Constitution?
you sound biased.
WHATS GOING ON ? @fbi investigation meeting w/lynch,then COMEY did what?and now had time to BUY BERNIE.CHOICE IS ?TRUMP OR SATAN..
trust the fbi or trust a politician...
how about we let the people decide in November if they want her or not.
also Obama he should be in jail for supplying our enemy guns and more...........
Thought you were "Liberatarian" not dick-sucker of the radical right. THERE WAS NO CASE!
/ shut up !  Because Trump is an option
and what are you as a US Senator going to do about this travesty?
you are ridiculous.
Profound cheeky indecency on display -
suck it up and stop your whining
You're a little worm if you don't go to the convention and support our candidate. I heard that and said no way not him. That true?
rand paul is supporting the nominee. He's a man of word after signing the RNC pledge .
Thank the Lord! What was that American Hillbilly Levin talking about? That dude isn't on the right side at all.
don't forget about the billionaire class they have their own set of laws to. Or do you not like to admit that?
As soon as you can explain a difference...

Tell the DOJ to speed up your nominee's THREE pending cases. #Trump #Justice #PartisanPolitics

damn rand, the replies to this tweet make me pessimistic about the future.
The AG is not someone we can talk to .@RandPaul AG, DOJ part of the problem. #extremelycareless #lawlessness crooked Administration
If you want someone to respect you, you have to earn respect .@RandPaul #extremelycarelessHillary extremely clueless America #lawlessness
I don't see how Obama, his team, AG, or #extremelycarelessHillary could respect us when we let them get away with #lawlessness .@RandPaul
what can we do to even out the playing field? The only way i can think of ends with me in jail. I want to scream,  its such a joke
She must have dirt on a lot of those law makers!
you are a bad person.
.@RandPaul how many of your familial campaign staff were recently indicted for election law violations?
did you call it an outrage when Bush lied about WMDs and wasn't prosecuted?
can you draft articles of impeachment for her tenure as Secretary of State?
.@RandPaul so what can we do now?
The DOJ better get with the program you have a AG who is dishonest,devious,unscrupulous and untrustworthy ! An a criminal 4 POTUS
@realDonaldTrump No, we have 1 for LITTLE people, one for congress/admin/rich ppl. You IGNORE our laws for MONEY.
stick to being an eye DR and stay out of law enforcement
are you accusing the #FBI of not doing their job?
no
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secretaries-handled-classified-material-private-email-state-dept/story?id=37404084 …
can you please tell me how are Congress / Senate, the most powerful entity in this country, has allowed this to happen??? #OVERit
@akaMikeG this isn't new. You just don't like it when it works for both sides.
I thought you were better than this!! I will delete you!!
see some ignorant responses, clearly she should be prosecuted! Sheep rarely revolt from what they think! #checkthefacts
She is a slap in the face to our military She has sold out America Sad thing people will vote 4 her @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016
she needs to go to prison! It pisses me off that they still let her have classified emails!

U know her presidency was planned, Trump & Sanders were part of the mind manipulation to all the ignorant citizens..@Snowden
@ChristyNews3LV you mean we have a law for the 1% and one for everyone else.  Jail @realDonaldTrump first
I'm pretty sure we've established that she IS above the law. Aren't all the big name politicians?
this shows how corrupt the system is. No one should be above the law
That's a good defense for criminals. Logic says if "she doesn't have to follow the law neither do I. Wonder how a jury would rule?
Democrats continue to prove they are not interested in EQUAL TREATMENT under the law! #HillaryClinton is a criminal!
pretty good for first citizen Hillary caesar
where was your "outrage" when children got shot - NRA puppet?
@alllibertynews @RandPaul Dr. Rand prescribes you 500mg of #STFU
Can't stand the truth Ms. Dee? So sorry.
#StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
With all due respect to the Senator from KY, the corruption in the Executive branch is systemic, FBI, thru DOJ and to the POTUS.
It's only an outrage to you because you wanted her to be prosecuted.
and what's going on w the Clinton foundation? Guarantee it's a slush fund of corruption!
I Have! In The Mean Time Why don't You Show A Little Class N Honor The Pledge You Signed 2 Support The Candidate @RealDonaldTrump
Absolut right. I´m from Austria and a distant observer, but what is happening in the US justice system is a scandal.
what does it take-40 years of lies, deceit and immoral if not criminal behavior. We have her on tape on the record.
Americans are losing faith in America. I'm afraid Justice Is not only blind but also corrupt. "Facts are stubborn things".
I know you may have to actually win an election rather than trying to lock up the people who disagree with you.
The endless attacks are an outrage. Let the people vote. Face your responsibility & America's problems. Work on it. Stop whining.
she not above the law girl in omaha was given 9 yrs for perjury google it
-Not the Clintons, you dink, the powerful. And that includes you.
#hitler invented #libertarianism because of unfair legal practices! #StandWithRand
The American people won't abide by any rules at this point. Why the hell should we if no others are held to the same standards?
what do you think of Fla Ag dropping investigation into Trump U after trump donated to her? @MTVNews @CNN @ABC
@alllibertynews @RandPaul
That's not how it went.
yes it is
Tune into cspan right now if you want to see actual real corruption on trial. #LorettaLynch
if I want to GOP members embarrassing themselves- I can watch tv anytime @MTVNews @CNN @ABC
Why bother, they're hearing aids are PERMANENTLY turned off to ANYONE who opposes their BS. :sigh: We can dream though...right?
DOJ needs to indict Clinton on Perjury charges! Millions watched testimony of Clinton and Comey and She did LIE to congress!!!
The American people have spoken &56% of them say she should be charged!
I'm very disappointed that you're not going to unify the party and speak at the Rep Nat Convention. Laura is right. Agreed
Don't suppose Hillary Clinton would be willing to submit to a polygraph on Benghazi and/or her illegal server/email debacle?
As Clintons, we deserve special treatment, what other couple has served our country like we have, so, we're kind of special
You didn't get the memo Doc.  There is no there there.
Being under Oath of Office & ignoring the fake pResident  & Sheriff Joe's Cold Case Posse Investigation is equally outrageous ;-)
Just like in Macedonia! Soros and democrats backed opposition leader Zaev doing the same thing here!
when the fbi director basically states a crime has been committed but won't prosecute, he should lose his job too!
You mean the DOJ she has in her hip pocket?  Why not beat my head against a brick wall instead?  Just as futile.
how come every time there is a Clinton scandal there is something in the press about race? Bill/Rodney King ... Hillary/Right now
we need a special prosecutor to take this case to a grand jury let the people decide not the political hacks
It's a done deal Senator.  The DOJ serves at the pleasure of the Establishment.
AS UK
