Really, Rand? SMH. This is so petty. RT @RandPaul In honor of #NationalHugDay. Submitted without comment.
And Lord KNOWS I am no Chris Christie fan. AT. ALL. But the fact that repubs like @RandPaul hate him for shaking PBO's hand is,well,telling.
The republican party is full of bitter, uninformed, ignorant, backpedaling, war hungry, offensive, women hating, privileged racists.
@T_dot_Lee_PhD politics in general has issues..both parties have their downfalls...depending on the issue I could agree w/ either of em
@T_dot_Lee_PhD when u say that stuff it comes off as "Dems are better people" which I wouldn't say is true..just different interests
@c11utch I didn't say all republicans.
@T_dot_Lee_PhD true...but "full of" implies a high % or majority to most Lol
@c11utch Trump is literally their front-runner. There is a huge chance he'll be the nominee. If that doesn't validate "full of" then eh.
.@RandPaul You mean submitted to prove there was no hug?
Right. RT @Lawrence .@RandPaul You mean submitted to prove there was no hug?
.@RandPaul In honor of national handshake day.
@hillarysusans @RandPaul And Rand thought "OMG they are taking our picture" "this is gonna come back to bite me one day".
@marker98 @RandPaul Right.  I almost felt sorry for him.
@RandPaul A classic photo of The Penguin and The Thin Man
@RandPaul Should he have dissed the President for his support? What exactly is the implication here?
@RandPaul #manhug
@RandPaul yes, how dare he work with the president in a time of dire crisis. You are pathetic, and so are the sheep who follow you.
@JMannino1424 @RandPaul chris christie is a joke he's the bridge man
@RandPaul @MrPaulotics
Still figuring Twitter out? @sir_enge
@MrPaulotics I have No Idea how to use this
It looks like you just used it. Click #IACaucus and follow everything being tweeted. @sir_enge
“@RandPaul: In honor of #NationalHugDay. Submitted without comment. ” what a savage
@RandPaul The RINO @ChrisChristie lol 
@RandPaul You are at your worst when u make the petty hug attack. This sort of partisan BS is Y Sanders won my Libertarian vote instead of u
@RandPaul Silly Rand! Shitting on the guy with 3% isn't enough to compensate for your 1^
.@RandPaul I'm glad you submitted that without comment so I can assume you're pleased at our political divisiveness being healed by hugging.
@RandPaul hahahahhaa
@RandPaul     I'm sorry Chris but I'm just not into bears.
Seriously? That's not a hug   @RandPaul
@JerzyLuv2A @AMeansstotheend @RandPaul
@RandPaul National Hug Day! @realDonaldTrump and his caddy. That's pretty neat!
@RandPaul Now let me get this straight @RandPaul are you saying you should NOT show appreciation where appreciation is due?
@RandPaul So is @ChrisChristie Voldemort or Draco? #awkwardhugs
@RandPaul @TheTammySimmons This childish behaviour is why you will never be president & you are going to lose your senate seat.
@RandPaul yeah Christie has a lot of nerve respecting the POTUS. #grasp #lastgasp
@RandPaul I like you but stuff like that is ridiculous
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  Randpointin outthe charadeof fraud liars isto remindin u of Christies untrust n he did hug O I sawit!Total scamartists
.@RandPaul this is called a handshake
@alecjacobs The "well played, Senator" and "this is seriously funny" replies make me sad
@rjt686 it's that famous conservative sense of humor
@alecjacobs hard to laugh with job-killing Obamacare and Hillary killing Americans in Benghazi also Bill Clinton = Bill Cosby
@RandPaul No comment necessary...They both come from third world countries!
@RandPaul @TicTockMrsGlock I'm no fan of Christie - hate him actually but I don't understand why this hug is such a big deal.  Why?!?!
@RandPaul You forget how huge he actually is
@RandPaul hugging with the left hand i see?
@RandPaul @theaustinritter Actually the only redeeming quality that @GovChristie EVER had. #tellingitlikeitis
@mrnwright16 @randpaul @skyeshepard okay that pic didn't make you chuckle? I thought it was funny 
@RandPaul Nothing wrong w/ this. Stick with your policies & let Trump do the trash talking. That's all he could do since he lacks knowledge.
.@RandPaul, I think this would be a better photo for #NationalHugDay.  #StandWithRand #dumptrump2k16
@RandPaul @MichaelBiundo And this is why I would never vote for you. #SellYourApples
@RandPaul @MichaelBiundo A governor and a president coming together over Sandy.....nothing else
@RandPaul should he have said "GTFOH darkie the free market will save us from this storm surge"?
@RandPaul I still don't understand how grilling a guy for working across the aisle to help his state during nat. disaster proves anything??
@RandPaul Man there's so many real political weaknesses you can name about Christie. But saying he "hugged obama" is lazy gossip.
@RandPaul rand is at it again @CharlieFenner32 @Christianvouges
@RandPaul you need to be better than this. Your value is in your ethics and Virtue, and this post takes away from that.
@RandPaul Thought you were an Opthamologist. Can't tell what is and is not a hug from that distance? No wonder you're dead in the polls.
@RandPaul comeon you're better than that please go back to ideas, not to insults
@RandPaul Pretty funny thanks for making me laugh!
@RandPaul  love it
@RandPaul Outlaw Cherry Pies! #NationalHugDay
@RandPaul @slone one looks like a heart attack coming, the other well, ??? fill in what you like!
@RandPaul For all legal marijuana users, I believe your first act as Prez should be to outlaw cherry pies! Enjoy your hug & pie now, Chris!
@RandPaul I HAVE TO COMMENT.
THE SPRINGSTEEN TICKETS ARE IN THE ENVELOPE & THE BUFFET IS IN THE BACK OF AIR FORCE ONE.
@RandPaul @catoletters ~ He's just shaking his hand. Most ppl put a hand on the shoulder when showing sympathy.
@RandPaul @slone
@RandPaul @slone Laurel & Hardy
@RandPaul @ace2blue Can you retweet the ad that has Cruz stammering when asked tough questions.  Loved that one.
@adeleshiv @RandPaul the one with Bret Baier

@RandPaul @MsContrarianSci - I'm hearing "Endless Love" playing in the background...
@RandPaul awesome!
@RandPaul 
@RandPaul @RyanWrecker "Eat More Chikin"!
@RandPaul Jealous? Just come out and admit how desperate you are for a hug from Obama...
@RandPaul haha savage
@RandPaul Are you jealous?
@RandPaul @GovChristie was just sucking up to get $ for the morons that didn't have insurance.
@RandPaul it's like beating a dead dog. Move on
@immifin fully supports @ChrisChristie as the Penguin in the next Batman movie @RandPaul @BenAffleck @DCComics @WarnerBrosEnt
Don't vote for Christie he's a civil human being
“@RandPaul: In honor of #NationalHugDay Submitted without comment. ”
the butt hurt comments below are killing me. Love it @RandPaul.
@randpaul @brucenv I’ll comment. Several of you also-rans should exit this race to let the public focus on a real contender.
@RandPaul I believe thats a thank you for helping me out when my own party was dragging their feet - hand shake.
@RandPaul...lol
@RandPaul THATS the last person i would EVER want a #Hug from, #NationalHugDay or not, #ChrisChristie is the worst!!!
@RandPaul   Christie talks like a republican but talk is cheap.
HILARIOUS! @RandPaul There's a lot 2 love there, huh Barry? @GolightlyGrl427 #NationalHugDay
@RandPaul, @POTUS needs longer arms
@RandPaul Epic picture right there!
@RandPaul Great sense of humor.  Gave me quite a chuckle. Love it.
.@RandPaul @kohrgi two for one deal, came in late
@RandPaul this is funny 
@RandPaul it's always great to see leaders stand together!! #ThanksForTheShare
@RandPaul Hugging the "petulant child". Nice!
Seen better hugs between icky boys & gross girls at school "dance", @RandPaul! Just like THIS one!
#NationalHugDay
@RandPaul Actually, that's not a hug and when did having manners become a negative?
@RandPaul something wrong with shaking the hand of the President of the United States? we know our politics are messed up!
@RandPaul petty attacks like this is why Rand Paul lost my confidence. He was supposed to rise above the fray not join it.
@RandPaul This is why no one wants to vote for you.
@RandPaul you're serious making me rethink my support of you.  You are aware that people died because of that storm right? #socialmediafail
@RandPaul is that all he has two offer
@RandPaul how desperate is your campaign?
@RandPaul I'm not sure you know what a hug is.
@RandPaul Should be able to hug even people you don't agree with.
@ArcherNimble @alllibertynews @RandPaul My wife and I do that regularly.
@RandPaul don't see anything wrong here
@RandPaul um. this is a handshake.......
@RandPaul that is funny, quit taking everything so seriously,  funny is funny.
@RandPaul this picture proves that Obama isn't Muslim. A Muslim could never be that close to a pig.
@RandPaul savage
@RandPaul everybody's got a water buffalo.
@RandPaul this is where ya lose me rand. How any Idea of voting for you is lost. Decry difference all you wish. Same where it counts
@RandPaul "Submitted without comment". Like we don't know your intentions though.
@RandPaul jejjejejejejejej
@RandPaul I want to know what you would do to Obama if you met him. You wouldn't be disrespectful.
.@RandPaul I'm sorry this election cycle punishes you're gov't fluency and rewards this kinda stuff. Have you considered jingoistic bigotry?
@RandPaul your better than this ... Like all you have on a man is him shaking obamas hand or hell who even cares if he hugged Obama
@RandPaul hundreds of people's lives gone and 1000's homes destroyed. You republicans really are disgusting.
@RandPaul hilarious, no comment needed, #handhug
@RandPaul @anna_lippincott
@RandPaul Although u r #2 4 me behind @tedcruz I must say, I do enjoy your cleverness & humor.  I hope it continues deep n 2 the year.
.@RandPaul Yet submitting the image is a comment. Btw, if that's a hug, I'm a virgin.
@RandPaul this was taken after Hurricane Sandy tore apart NJ you fucking slimeball
@RandPaul Looks more like a handshake than a hug to me. Did Ron not hug you as a child? That would explain a lot about you.
@RandPaul Hilarious! Some people are taking this post too seriously. It's a harmless prod! #StandWithRand
@RandPaul @MikeNellis well that was just petty.
@RandPaul 
.@RandPaul Actually I have infinite more respect for leaders who can put political differences aside to solve a problem than those who don't
@RandPaul When is American Handshake Day? You mistake this for a #hug, you must be lousy at it.
@RandPaul What hug? Ahh, another Republican lie. Good job moron. That's not a hug.
@RandPaul #NewJersey needed help and Obama did what any responsible commander in chief would do. Make the welfare of Americans a priority!
@RandPaul :-) Dr. Paul is the wittiest of all the candidates.
Pretty snarky & small @RandPaul - grow up. #Election2016
EYES BUT CANT SEE
EARS BUT CANT HEAR
ADAM CHRISTIAN @gop
EVE MUSLIM @DNCWomen
BROTHERS KILLED
THO SHALT NOT KILL
Carpet Bombing ?
@RandPaul
@RandPaul his arms are not long enough for cisco
@RandPaul I guess Christie is twice the man Obama is.
@RandPaul #NationalHugDay
@Kim_Perryman @RandPaul Show me your friends and I'll show you yourself...
@RandPaul  that's not a hug.
@RandPaul WTF!!! DID CHRIS WIN THE BIGGEST LOSER RECENTLY??? DAYMN
.@RandPaul wants to use Hurricane Sandy to score some political points. Kind of says it all.
Sad, that one of the few examples in living memory of politicians coming together to help real people is now being exploited by GOP.
@RandPaul #HeThoughtItWasNationalHogDay
@RandPaul grow up your a looser
@RandPaul Jesus. Can't even shake hands anymore!
@RandPaul yes acting like civil adults is a bad thing grow up, man-baby
@RandPaul
@RandPaul There's a whole lot of big gov love in that picture It's hard to see where Barack ends and Christie begins
I #StandWithRand
@RandPaul  best for them not his political career.
@RandPaul  to help the people. Gov.Christie was at the time now beholden to the people of NJ & at the time he did what was
@RandPaul  together to help the people of NJ. I am sure if your state was suffering something similar you would welcome any Dem. that wanted
@RandPaul Not cool, I saw nothing w/welcoming the president to the state that needed help. That was not a time for politics but rather come
@RandPaul Well played, senator.
@RandPaul That's seriously funny...
@RandPaul Pre hug pix...in physical terms, quite Reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy...
@RandPaul you really hate @ChrisChristie
@RandPaul @StudyingLiberty My aunt was a victim of Hurricane Sandy.  The house she grew up in, the family grew up in was destroyed.
@dpmoran1962 @RandPaul @StudyingLiberty i am sorry to hear that. loosing everything is a horrible feeling. compassion!
@RandPaul rude.
@RandPaul @MikeNellis you are an idiot, WE THE PEOPLE need to work together NOT be divisive
@RandPaul @R8DER_NATION55 

It looks like you can fit four or five Obama's into one pair of Christie's pants.
@RandPaul That's no hug. That's Obama going into orbit around planet Christie.
@RandPaul  embrace a whale
@RandPaul 
You are wrong for that.
@RandPaul Baby bump.
@RandPaul @jeremyrev  look at rand! Haha he's deff the G.O.A.T.
@RandPaul It's ok to like a Black guy.  Just because you're an R does't mean you have to be phobic.
@RandPaul Oooh. Solid burn...SMH
@RandPaul Fucking hell. This is too funny.
@RandPaul That's a handshake champ.
@RandPaul I don't think he hugged Obama, Christe was just so huge that he pulled him into his orbit.
@RandPaul It looks like a handshake to me. #RandPaul
@RandPaul If a man dosent have the dignity, health concerns to keep his weight from being obese, how can he have discipline to lead?
@RandPaul Things are getting nasty on the ole campaign trail. Shows @ChrisChristie not a partisan hack if you ask me.
@RandPaul Haha. Oh Goodness.
@RandPaul do you need money again?  Call me,  I'm worried about you.
@RandPaul: #Rand its too early, but they see you...
@RandPaul  @SpeakerRyan Holder, Lerner and Koskinen, have attained the threshold for Contempt of Congress. Has Hillary Clinton?
@RandPaul
@StormForce_1 @RandPaul My sides
@RandPaul  with just a little photo-shop editing to Christies right arm .. could be interesting  ;-p
@RandPaul he is 3.5 X borac
@forrest_fire1 @RandPaul I was going to ask how many Obama's you would need to fill Christie's pants.  Lol
@RandPaul I #StandWithRand... But that isn't a hug.  Lol. Looks like Obama is brushing him off.
@RandPaul You're better than this.
@brandon_weigel @RandPaul actually - having seen Rand so much during this long campaign -- I no longer think Rand is better than this.
