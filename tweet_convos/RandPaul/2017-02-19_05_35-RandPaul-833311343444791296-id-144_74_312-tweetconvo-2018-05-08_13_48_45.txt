I don't understand why you think Dems can help you with Healthcare when @GOP came up with nothing in 6 yrs
You sounded like you didn't care if anyone has healthcare. You only care about what you want. #likea2yearoldbrat
LOST CREDIBILITY-Putting party agenda over possible criminal behavior? Authoritarian behavior? WOW
Kudos to Paul for the stinging rebuke of Mccain the Warmonger.
Much respect for calling out Sen McCain. His rhetoric is over the top and he is hurting the republicans
what a hypocrite and truth denier you have become. I thought you stood for what is right, now it is about $$
ABC you stink, George is in the Clinton bag! Can't stand MSM news anymore
Who would have ever thought that Rand Paul would fall into the "least crazy" camp in Washington?
Libertarian, my foot. Your insipid support of Trump makes you like every other craven politician.
and what politicians do u support? Mr 5 generation Democrat
You've become a fraud. NO longer credible. You're out.
you are wrong Rand, about Separation of Powers. Executive Legislative and Judicial.
how dumb does Rand Paul think we are? Trump is a disaster. Sychophants all, except for McCain and Graham
I didn't like what I heard from U on show~glad you're not my Senator~I think U need to stand up 2 Trump more
You are pro Trump anti McCain? Are you kidding?!? This KYan will NEVER forget.
oh yes we def. Anti mccain. For sure.
A big Thank You to Senator Rand Paul for speaking truth and loving our Country 
oh my gosh he 2
lives in a parallel universe too! God help us all
Kentucky is 47th state in the Bachelor' s degree. That is why they selected this coward.
Do you perm your hair? The chemicals maybe affecting your brain! 
Senator, WORDS MATTER!
Mr Paul, you are unAmerican.
Investigate @realDonaldTrump ties to  Russia! Hands off my Obamacare!
Hands off my Obamacare!
If it were Hillary tied to Russia, you'd be all over it with investigations w/tax !
Delusional and hypocritical.
Glad you didn't get any further than you did in the election. Your Trump bootlicking is disgusting.
ur naysaying re Trump was appalling. You must want something awful bad, to debase urself like this on TV @ThisWeekABC @RandPaul @jonkarl
Wow. Grow a pair. Country first!
what a WUSS!
there are 413K Kentuckians receiving healthcare they didn't have until ACA, going to lose it, Nicely done RP
you are the most mealy mouthed person I've heard. No morals or ethics! #SwedenIncident #fakepresident
YOUR ONE GOOFY SOB,defend the constitution,laughable
shameful @RandPaul sell out to push your insurance industry backed health plan.
RP is an ass kisser, kiss the ass of a lying bully to pass his extremist agenda.  #resist #theresistance
liberty in peril as you ride the back of this nefarious president.
Senator Paul is hitting it out of the park facing questions. @POTUS should be proud to have him on our team
great job senator. Thank you for countering the nonsense spewed by bitter john McCain.
Very Impressed by your Fair and rational answers! 
can't answer a question without trying to deceive America. He showed his lack of Integrity on @ThisWeekABC. He's Not a Patriot.
Sen. Paul 
Easier to criticize @SenJohnMcCain than 45? You are a afraid of tweets instead of defending Constitution
KY is taking you with grain of salt, Rand
GREAT interview @RandPaul, You did great!
Rand is a massive disappointment
You must be afraid of a tweet from 45. You're a coward not to answer simple question about YOUR OWN WORDS
Sen. Paul you use to be the voice of reason, now your becoming a supporter of alternative facts.  SAD!
killed it They looked like grade school
You are Joke. Sell Out complete. Please spare us with any of your Constitution talk forever
Pursuing HEALTHCARE FREEDOM will result in GOP defeat. People want reliable healthcare. GERMANY & BERNIE
LIKE your CENTER MIDDLE practically INDEPENDENT position & for  workers, stay this way & have all my SUPPORT
Republicans so corrupt & desperate 2 CoverUp 45's nonsense @RandPaul BACKPEDALED on HIS OWN WORDS abt 45's credibility @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl
When @RandPaul was asked abt 45's comment on Sweden he turned into @KellyannePolls w/crazy redirection & blame & LIES @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl
#Wuss
When asked about 45's CREDIBILITY, @RandPaul turned into @KellyannePolls with word vomit & redirection. #sad @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl
.@RandPaul sounds like a robot whose battery is in the same direction Republicans want to take our country; BACKWARDS @ThisWeekABC @jonkarl
IMPRESSED W/ interview, Mad W/ ESTABLISHMENT REP'S & DEM'S  playing MIDDLE CLASS WORKERS, especially McCain

How about answering the question and knock off the avoidant little prison bitch routine?
#DoYourDamnedJob
Watched your interview.  Nice to hear someone speak with intelligence. Trump is embarrassment to GOP & US.
Doing work Senator, great interview.  You're correct McCain has been wrong a lot over the years on FP
Rand believes propaganda is A-OK. He's fine with Bowling Green, Sweden LIES. Hitler would have loved ya Rand
So, repeal pre-existing cond. part of law & ins. cos. r losing $$? We know who u r4 & it's not most of us!!
cmon Rand - Sweden is now the rape capital - why are t you talking about Malm√∂ - are you cucking out on us

@realDonaldTrump Rand Paul killed it on ABC This Week! WTG RAND - a true Patriot!!
Are you on today or sometime during the week?
If Trump paid his taxes & quit weekend vacations, then U.S.could put a trillion dollars into infrastructure.@ThisWeekABC @RandPaul @jonkarl
#standwithrand
You didn't bother to ask Rand Paul about the conflicts of interest, including Emol. Cl., nor Russia, nor chaos...why??
Are you talking to Obama oh I forget he isn't our President lololol
fearful & wondering what a bad week looks like? an insult to one's intelligence, music to ears of fanatics.
Glad that the senator does not share your hysteria. Loss of your credibility is self inflicted.
why bother interviewing him? He refuses to answer a question.
- good job calling out war monger Bolton
Laughable. A news actor with insufficient knowledge and cojones to get in the weeds with Paul.
Anything to protect your job and staying with Con-gress on screwing over America.
If you were to get rid of Assad, I would be concerned about the 2 million Christians protected by Assad. @ThisWeekABC
@RandPaul to @jonkarl
What a sell-out you are @RandPaul !!  #Shameful
- good job calling out Johnny "Wet Start" McCain!
Quit being a cheerleader for coal and push for legal marijuana for your constituents. #KentuckyCanGrow
Listening to your answers.  You are part of the problem..standing up for a quack of a President. @ThisWeekABC @RandPaul @jonkarl
- cannot answer a simple question. Hypocrisy!
Randy, you have the spine of a fucking jellyfish.
same coal job that was safe repeal #obamacare now affect same coal miner w black lung disease #aca
may as well be @realDonaldTrump press secretary. Lap dog. LOL

@JonBershad Shame on @RandPaul for normalizing @realDonaldTrump #Shame #ITMFA
God bless you. You do so much for your state.  Country
Bah Hum Bug to NBC - No Real can's watch Fake News that 'Twist' news like a pretzel
