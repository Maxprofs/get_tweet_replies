What kind of presidential candidate brags about putting hard working Americans out of business? #DemTownHall
Tonight @hillaryclinton said out loud what the national democrat party has been trying to do quietly for the past 8 years #DemTownHall
She vows to finish @barackobama's war on coal and Kentucky. #DemTownHall
That's why democrats in Kentucky running for federal and state office have been and should be soundly defeated. They don't represent us.
I won't let her do it. I am running to fight for Kentucky and to stop the national democrats from killing more coal jobs.
Kentucky voters know which party in Washington is trying to destroy their state and industry and they know I am fighting for them.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I think the word you're looking for is DISqualified. Not #unqualified. GOP drop out, go back to high school.
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton The galling part is that she then asked for miners' votes whilst back pedaling. No moral character
@RandPaul So happy to have your content on my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1PMk45z 
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton   no no, she was taken out of context.  
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton you are just as pathetic as rest of your party. You know that comment followed a statement of funds to re-educate
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton that just shows how dishonest and evil BOTH PARTIES ARE if people follow her  think about it
@RandPaul @Americasgarden @HillaryClinton  We will just put those coal miners to work building the Trump wall
Then say "it was taken out of context" Only @HillaryClinton cld brag abt putting Americans out of work  @RandPaul  #DropOutHillary
@LyndaG1963 @RandPaul didn't she claim to be stating what the free market was telling telling us about coal? The #queen of #DoubleTalk
@RandPaul @greeneyes0084 @HillaryClinton Democrats don't get it she IS a two faced bitch HRC only cares about her and power not the people
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Trump/Paul2016 #HillaryForPrison2016 #HillaryDropOut
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton Coal should be destroyed. What have you done 2 help transition ppl to new jobs like solar install?
@RandPaul  Its simple Trump or Hillary & if you're for Hillary you are evil & in Denial
@JHKamper @RandPaul @HillaryClinton Wrong. You just showed how uneducated you are.
@JHKamper @tladd58 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton appealing to your degree is a pathetic argument
u know @HillaryClinton made no such statement: u r willing to deceive voters 2 support republicans that refuse to help coal miners
Coal provides half the nation's electricity. Perhaps Rodham thinks only the Democrat half deserves power.
@RandPaul @abben_anna @HillaryClinton I remember seeing that
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton SEEMS LIKE THE "NEW" FUNCTION OF GOVT. IS TO DESTROY INDUSTRY/CHASE MANUFACTURING OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!!DISGUSTING!
@RandPaul @greeneyes0084 @HillaryClinton sick and disgusting. destroy coal destroy steel industry. It's war on real ppl. We need to stand up
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton SHE SAID WE NEEDED TO PRIORITIZE COAL COUNTRY PEOPLE. WAY TO JUST DISTORT HER STATEMENT. WHAT A F*CKING LIAR.
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @HillaryClinton , yep!

@RandPaul @Just_a_Texan @HillaryClinton hillry's experience seems to be in toppling Mideast 2 create ARABspring=ISIS

@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton Hillary Clinton work's for America's enemy

@RandPaul making the laws equal for minorities and the rich is what you should have said in your speech. Jail the rich, fining only hurts us
@RandPaul @lou7859 @HillaryClinton How many Americans will that put out of work?Recruit Romney our corporate raider he could help you.
@RandPaul It just went live, crediting you, on my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1N4wQLf 
@RandPaul was part of her discussion to revitalize it, unlike rhetoric relying on a dying industry. How have you helped the SOAR region?
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton I wonder what accent she uses when she talks about wiping out eastern KY. #Trump2016
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Wake up!Be informed.It is Natural Gas killing http://coal.Fracking.Vote  down fracking.It's GOING TO HAPPEN no mater.

@RandPaul @HillaryClinton HILLARY is a crook
@RandPaul thanks for sharing! I've added your tweet to my news updates at: http://rbl.ms/2430beR 
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton #distortgate listen to the entire comment "Rand"
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton How dare she take responsibility for what Energy Co. CEOs and mechanical automation have been doing for 30 yrs.
@RandPaul @Good2bqueen67 @HillaryClinton but sell American uranium to Russians for $2.5 million in donations
@RandPaul @amagrammie @HillaryClinton a Hillary administration will make the last missed.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  Disgusting! Appalling! I can't find the words
@RandPaul @bayareahausfrau @HillaryClinton is mimicking Potus, betraying hard working Americans who lose job because of ignorant liberals.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders NO politician is, or can, destroy/save coal. TECHNOLOGY is, and will continue, killing coal #fact
@RandPaul  You know damn well she was talking about CLEAN energy for the 21st century, and about HELPING coal miners find new jobs.
@RandPaul What's your fave chapter of #TheFountainhead? @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Sir, I should think you'd be kinder to the secretary considering republican voters see you both as unqualified.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton #StandwithRand #RandingStrong #StillRanding
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton You aren't in the race anymore, so you don't fuckin' matter...
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton YOU WHAT!!!!!
@RandPaul .@HillaryClinton "Dr" Rand Paul, it appears the ppl spoke & decided YOU couldn't be anymore unqualified. Don't embarrass yourself.
@dnahealthnut @RandPaul @HillaryClinton unsure why you put "Dr" in quotes. He went to med school and did his residency at Duke.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Disgusting! #WakeUpAmerica #DemTownHall #Election2016 #CruzCrew #Trump
@RandPaul @LelandShow @HillaryClinton should propose filling those mines w/ nuclear waste, Mercury bulbs & hybrid car batteries, brilliant!
@RandPaul @ScarletnGrey1 @HillaryClinton maybe because we are destroying the earth with fossil fuels??? Or is business more important?
@RandPaul @SkyeShepard @HillaryClinton Because an unproven theory trumps jobs.
.@SkyeShepard @RandPaul Hell @HillaryClinton had Vince Foster killed & she was screwing him. Allegedly (smirk)
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton you're supposed to be one of the lesser evils on the right, and yet here you are, doing Trumpian & Cruz mental b.s
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton not destruction, unless you think America is still built on coal, which it isn't, those families will need help.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton That's almost Glenn Beckish in it's 18 loops of crazy to get there. You should be happy she's talking about jobs
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Rand, how do you go from her talking about taking care of those who've worked coal mines to her destroying them?
@RandPaul @briankellykelly @HillaryClinton  Rand. Add McConnell   .  Back stabbing,lying McConnell.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I agree, and that goes with the rest of the three main candidates. America could use someone like you as president
@RandPaul @ChristophHeer52 @HillaryClinton Rand Paul: I didn't think that SHE was THIS UNQUALIFIED!!!   Amazing...
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  Doesn't tell the whole story Rand.  Constituents look for the whole statement.   Cherry picking RP for votes.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Try Rand.  Solutions to problems are achieved, when multiple views are represented in debate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton : people are still dumb enough to vote for her!
@RandPaul @IAMMGraham Sadly the United Mine Workers Union will still blindly support the Dems and vote for HRC
@RandPaul @billpostmus @HillaryClinton I never expect anything good from her and she never disappoints.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton #coal
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton oh Rand just stop it already. It's customary for the also - fans to pipe down for at least a little bit my friend.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton she's disgusting
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton is coal bad for the environment? Should the coal industry take precedence over protecting the environment?
@RandPaul Thank you!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I don't believe she made anymore friends in Indiana !!
@RandPaul @RestoreHistory @HillaryClinton Two sides of that you and the GOP R on the other.....#2HeadedCoins
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Rand kick Hillary's ass. Hillary lick Rands ass.
@RandPaul @damon_thayer @HillaryClinton Coal is a limited resource and not the future  Find an alt plan for the poor of Eastern KY to work.
@RandPaul #HillaryClinton government sabotaging private business it disagrees with...sounds like she will get along great with the Chinese
@RandPaul @billpostmus @HillaryClinton Wow. She put her foot in that one. Obama's put enough of them out of work!
@RandPaul you should have stayed in the race then! I would have voted for you.
@matt_didato @alllibertynews @RandPaul @HillaryClinton I'll remind you of these words you have spoken, as we watch America burn together.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton the world can no longer afford to keep burning coal. It does no one any good to keep propping this industry up.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton honest....by mistake.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton No coal no problem, just gotta find a market for tumbleweed because that's all that remains here thanks D-Party
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton this is horrible. Did you see this @TurnerAltman?
#Pennsylvania has Fracking @RandPaul @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul You misunderstood what @HillaryClinton said. She wasn't bragging. She was promising to take care of coal miners when jobs dry up.
@LMWeidman @RandPaul @HillaryClinton lol, Hillary is a pathological liar
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  she's the devil !!!
@RandPaul I respect you and although I am not voting for her, I respect @HillaryClinton. This was taken way out of context. Disappointed.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton The loss of mining jobs is only the beginning. Will effect river industry jobs from Pittsburgh,  to New Orleans.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Our coal is the cleanest burning in the world. KY alone has enough to power entire East for over 500 yrs.
@RandPaul @joshmariana @HillaryClinton there is a reason I donate to Rand and Ron. Snake Truman & 1948 @Israel blocked 1946 Dead Sea Scrolls
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton 9000 unemployed W. VA miners, 7000 unemployed KY Miners. Power plants shut down. And they're proud of themselves.
@RandPaul No, actually she talks about rebuilding it.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Sicking. No concern for families, communities and way of life. These are hard working folks. Just repulsive.
@RandPaul @MarianneHaran @HillaryClinton Nice way of saying stupid  as a post Rand
@RandPaul since you've been here we've lost more coal jobs than ever before. Quit half ass running for president and represent your people.
@RandPaul so, support an industry that destroys our health and environment? I don't think so. They can get jobs elsewhere #ImWithHer
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton stop lying Paul
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton joy global just shut a union plant in PA. Hey 1000 good paying jobs bye bye. Always Walmart.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  From a drop-out candidate to the one who will be president!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton exactly! Say no to Hillary!!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton is continuing her Husband's strategy of shipping our jobs over seas. End the Democrats war on small town America.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton thanks George Soros for mythology of coal. Montana depends on coal for power and education funding.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton No, #Clinton said she will revitalize those communities with renewable energy jobs. She's super qualified.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton this country has so much coal!  And those were good jobs!  She is against working people! #DemTownHall
@RandPaul coal is dead. What kind of party keeps people in a dead industry? Build technical colleges out in Appalachia so they can live
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Selective listening...that's why no one listens to YOU!  #ImWithHer
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Mr Paul, your voters would be better served by your leadership helping them move to clean energy.
@RandPaul @ItsJustJill @HillaryClinton wait til she bans fracking...millions of jobs up and down the industry.

@shupe_laura Tell me how you really feel about the authoritarian establishment 
@RandPaul Since we're on the subject of qualifications, wasn't your own ophthalmology certification contested?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton More jobs in renewable energy than coal, a dying industry. Should focus on retraining, not saving buggy whips
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton #HillaryForPrison2016 #Remember Benghazi #RememberAmericanJobs
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Who cares about people dying from pollution as long as your funders profit
@RandPaul stop fighting for worst case scenario. Time for you to grow some balls and bring new solutions to the table.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton deplorable woman!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton put a lot of railroad employees, rr towns(coal trains)energy plant emp...out of work as well.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton This woman is unreal.. So out of touch.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton She said to replace those coal jobs with clean energy work. Deception is the only thing you people work in.

@RandPaul @damon_thayer @HillaryClinton Hillary didn't destroy the coal industry. The truth did. Just like it destroyed the the tobacco ind.
@RandPaul Everytime the #GOP shuts the gov't down you put hard working people out of work. Grow a pair and stand up to Ted Cruz next time.
@RandPaul people of America obviously thought you were more unqualified. That's why you're home tweeting & @HillaryClinton isn't #ImWithHer

@RandPaul paid $7/hr to die in an accident or of black lung, all while helping destroy planet. Yeah. Way better than green energy retrain.
