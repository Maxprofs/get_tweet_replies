I put $1M on....NO!
Where does it say Congress has the ONLY authority for war?
Sure would be a nice surprise if we are wrong, huh Janice....hope they actually choose to do the right thing, we will see.
You do with the Democrats do you interpret the Constitution in order to force a agreeable meaning rather than just reading it.
Commander in Chief orders military somewhere, they go. Congress thinks it's illegal order then impeach him.
asking the modern day Senate to stand for the rule of law and actually carry out their constitutional duties is a tall order Senator.
Vote em out!!!
#StandWithRand
your no martyr senator, just haven't the ability to build a consensus to get work done!  That is a terrible weakness  in legislat
He must think we live in a constitutional republic.
@RepBarbaraLee Cross the hall and aisle, please. Make a friend, please. #EndAUMF
Repubs vote for more war & do nothing to stop abortion. GOP won't  give LIFE, PEACE or PAUL a chance so write RandPaul in '20 Pres  Election
Probably not.
Doubt it since they only seem to stand for themselves, not American voters!
Funny, they didn't for Obama. He bypassed congress a lot.
I actually dislike Rand Paul, for just about everything he stands for, except this. #EndTheWars
Constitution says POTUS needs advice and consent for his nominees. Where does it say they need advice and consent for military action?
Very Doubtful...
#StandWithRand
Thanking God for you every day
Quit grandstanding and get on with necessary legislation.
There is something sick about me agreeing with #RandPaul on anything, but he has a point. Endless war helps no one.
Ditto
Repubs look to the pocketbooks. Senate is blind to the principles of LIFE, LIBERTY and PEACE. Senator Paul is a man of courage & conscience.
If not, America is in deep kim che.
@SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr  Why are you not with Ron Paul?  Please explain your position to North Carolina.
Probably not. We have a lawless government!
But what say the companies that own the Senators whose bills they write, whose pork they barrel, and whose souls they own?
Every senator should be in their seat listening. Instead they're at lunch, or have their hands in a lobbyists pocket. For the people?
Congress has the power to declare war but it doesn't say they have the sole power to declare war. POTUS is commander and chief. Deal with it
@SenMikeLee I hope you are with Sen Paul on this
Congress is a joke. I wouldn't want to rely on it
No, they don't believe in the constitution anymore. Or did they ever?
#StandWithRand
Why now...law is an oxymoron for you rinos who are allowing illegals to stay and the gov elites to skip all criminal charges!
They know they can't sell these engagements to their electorate.  1% wants & special interests.  This alienates the voting base further.
Interesting you refuse to mention that previous Presidents made exceptionally STUPID decisions?
Let Trump make the proper corrections
I usually can't stand you, but I'm with you on this one.
Why is Congress 4 War on 12Tribes #HebrewDNA?

And declaring a race born after 1225AD,
North of 50:90N,
"RM-8392"=New KKK White Master Race?
No they won't. No profit for senators in following the law
Why is Congress 4 War on 12Tribes #HebrewDNA?

Then declaring a race born after 1225AD North of 50:90N, RM-8392 New White Bible Master Race?
Please stop 19:15AD ZioNazi events staged to hunt & murder Dark people for not looking like #BrownHair = FakeJesus!
PREACH!
Most senators are under the spell of industrial military complex they sweat just thinking about ending the war. they may lose their job.
I'm with you on this one.  It's stressing out the country having an unbalanced man at the helm sabre rattling on Twitter.
Unbalanced?
Obviously you are thinking of a different Foul Stentch in Government .

How can the Left ignore what is so clear to us?
Say you?
Rand, Obama unmaked your name, remember? Get to work to put him in Gitmo and end the war. Y did you give up the war on OBAMAMOHAMMED?
Yes. End Bush's war declarations
I don't want YOU running or deciding for war. You are inexperienced and @DNC - like.
Preach Paul
Good luck dude.  You're going to need it.
Amen  I pray they do @CBNGordon @HealthRanger @FoxNews @RandPaul @TGowdySC @dbongino @700club @marklevinshow @SandraSmithFox @KennedyNation
War is my guess
Waaaah! Mommy they all hate me! Why do they hate me mommy? Y wont they do what I instruct them to do? I'm wearing my big boy pants? MOMMY!!
I doubt it. Most of them have given up their power as far as I can see. You and few others still have integrity. The rest want a paycheck.
The #spyringincongress? https://trello.com/b/RMx1r5dG/hillarys-hamlet-haiti-and-henchmen-episodes-54-150 … Anyone there have the balls to do anything about that Sir? Asking for a friend @GeorgWebb
Presently Watching Sen.Rand Paul Speaking on Senate Floor, @CSPAN 2 U.S. Senate; Defense  Programs & Policy
Sit down and shut up. What do you have to offer the people except your mini-Republican gang " freedom caucus" obtruction otherwise?
Yes 100 %
that looks like an empty room. senators and congressmen are purely ceremonial
Well we know 3rd generation traitor @SenJohnMcCain won't since he's BFF's with ISIS/jihadis. Thankfully this is his last term. #NoMoreWar

You cant even fix health care and the current agenda. And we should entrust YOU with protecting our country?
Will you ever stop taking Russian money?
Wouldn't he have to start in order to stop?
Ted Cruz too busy fapping to think about legal nonsense.
