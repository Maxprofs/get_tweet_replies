@RandPaul double negative?
@helms83 @RandPaul clearly someone ain't from the south. #randgirling #StandWithRand
@DrMAMAC @RandPaul yeah, cause "not never" brought the point across. And KY is not the south.
@helms83 @RandPaul Kentucky isn't the south? You don't read or travel much. I'm a born n bred southerner.Don't mess with us south of the M-D
@DrMAMAC @RandPaul sure haven't, I didn't live in KY for 8 years nice try "Dr". Oh, and lookup double negative, "not never"... lmao
@helms83 @RandPaul I'm a southern Dr with a Naval Commendation, a long list of publications and enough sense to know u r a troll.
@DrMAMAC @RandPaul I'm a troll? You responded to a tweet from over a month ago.
@RandPaul @randwarrior62 Look at our founders' grievances against King George in the Declaration of Independence. Many of those are ours

@Real_MrBill @RandPaul
Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice!
Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVNoClu0h9M …
@freedomtex @RandPaul and pursuing a course of failure for one's own ego is.....?  He can't win.
@RandPaul I will support you until the end! I will not buy into @tedcruz and his  #CounterfeitLiberty ! #StandWithRand
@RandPaul You tell em Paul. I'll write you in if I have to, it's my moral responsibility.
@RandPaul #StandWithRand
@RandPaul thanks for sharing Dr. Rand Paul, have a great Tuesday :) (Want this for FREE too? >> https://commun.it?aid=thankyou13commun.it/?aid=thankyou13 )
@RandPaul I will support u till the end my friend!
@RandPaul Keep fighting the good fight. You're the man, man.
@RandPaul I hope that you one day win the presidency, and have better luck than your father (who totally should have won the nominations)
@RandPaul it's done.
@RandPaul @D_Rich012 no
@RandPaul @hotbabegilbert Not never.  Double negative.  Um . . .
@RandPaul time to drop out.
@RandPaul YOU ARE AWESOME - DON'T STOP!  You got 1/4 the coverage of Christie and twice the turnout
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  So thankful Rand is 5 thank u Iowa thank u God Thanks Rand #StandWithRand
@RandPaul #DoubleNegative2016
@RandPaul i have supported you from the time you announced, but focus on your senate seat. It's rigged Rand.
@RandPaul You don't have to use double negatives to appeal to your base.
@RandPaul @samcjordan_ smh
@RandPaul On to New Hampshire! #LiveFreeOrDie
@RandPaul Then you don't believe in the greater good of society. Therefore you don't believe in a stable society. You can care a little...
@RandPaul too bad, you didn't go all out on Christie early. Could've made a big difference in perception.
@RandPaul language
@RandPaul A word from the grammarian: never say not never.
@RandPaul @bishingpole that's not very nice language for someone running for president
@Theresa_Hanley @RandPaul your man isn't very PG himself
@bishingpole Paul seems a little bit more than Bernie. Maybe I'm bias I don't know.
@Theresa_Hanley eh we're both a little biased
@bishingpole honesty is the best policy -g wash 
@Theresa_Hanley very true. This is probably the most civilized political talk we've had 
@RandPaul Just get it thru your head you won't be president...
@RandPaul The end is near for you
@RandPaul my shirt tonight
@AndyJMacc how'd that work out for you?
@RandPaul its not over yet;) #StandWithRand
@RandPaul I love the libertarian stances!
@RandPaul Please help protect us from Trump! If you're a true servant put country 1st so you will have a country to serve.
@RandPaul your attempt to derail the conservative vote almost worked, this is not your daddy's party any more
@RandPaul LEAVE the GOP!They are NOT the party for Liberty! Run as an INDEPENDENT! Now is the time! D&R parties are weak!
@RandPaul I would hope not. Time to go defend your Senate seat that is in even more jeopardy after your poor performance tonight. <5% sad!!!
.@RandPaul keep working it!
@RandPaul unite the conservatives drop out and support Cruz
@RandPaul @justinamash I supported your dad, and would have supported you, but you played the game just at the wrong time. Fuck you.
