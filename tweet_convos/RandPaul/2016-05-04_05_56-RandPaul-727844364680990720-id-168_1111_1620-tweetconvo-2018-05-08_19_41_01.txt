@RandPaul @diamactive2001  when is she gonna admit that she is a muff diver ??
@RandPaul @tinadavidson08 Thank you @RandPaul
@RandPaul Fuck coal. Stop pandering. Tell your constituents to get educated. We don't need miners. We need neuroscientists and astronauts.
@jasonmyronbyron @alllibertynews @RandPaul actually coal is really important and we don't need astronauts because nasa was defunded.
@miachs_waters @alllibertynews @RandPaul Coal is old news. Change with the times or be left behind.
@RandPaul What will they say then the rest will have because more to supplement them. When all I can say is that elections have consequences
@RandPaul it's America's war on coal. Pay attention!
the War on coal is going on around the world.
@RandPaul I'd sooner let every coal miner in the world be unemployed than allow a lunatic like Trump to be POTUS. Life>Livelihood
@RandPaul for VP!
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Rand: Go get some lessons on how to be Trump-like and bold and astoundingly powerful.  It would be a good idea.
@RandPaul What a cheap, dishonest shot by Rand Paul. Play the FULL QUOTE by HC. Nobody offers more to help #coal country than #Hillary!
@RandPaul The world is moving away from coal dude. Wake up! and tell ur followers the truth.
@RandPaul Thank you for  taking the right steps in unifying the party, we will eventually get there, but God Bless you good sir.
@MiloAmerican @alllibertynews @RandPaul yeah I would've been disappointed if you hadn't kept your pledge. You're still my guy next time 
@VAChair   no need to raise Taxes ...When you can just BORROW the money Johnny #NationalDebt $19trillion @FOX5Atlanta @wsbtv
@agreatercountry Great
@RandPaul @alllibertynews These stances are why its Trump and not Paul. (Or maybe Bernie just drained the millenial pool for libertarians)
@RandPaul people dont realize what is going to happen to our electric bills when coal is gone. Then poorer people will be in the dark
.@RandPaul @aduanebrown #HillaryClinton says she'll put a lot of coal miners out of business https://vine.co/v/iwX0WDUgvwv  #NeverHillary

@RandPaul how about ending the attack on women's and gay rights? Aren't we allowed personal freedoms and choices? Only your choice matters?
@RandPaul Being pro-liberty doesn't mean we have to be idiotically anti-environment. We should all be fighting a war on coal.
@RandPaul which #libertarian candidate would you suggest need options for #NeverTrumpOrHillary
@RandPaul. THANK U!  From America~
@RandPaul She's living in a bubble of $$$. Frowns on people who make America run.
@RandPaul oh wait remember she told that coal miner she didn't mean it she's going to increase coal jobs. Good ole two face!

@RandPaul more importantly, who does your hair?
@RandPaul If people are intelligent,organized,&forward thinking in business for $,can they also choose to be responsible&ethical? Will they?
@RandPaul Does that mean you'll end the gov't subsidies for oil, gas and coal?Can we let the people deal w real costs?
@RandPaul mostly a market thing. Cheap NG flooding the market has pushed coal aside. Plants switching because cheaper. Consumers want clean.
@RandPaul Empty words, if you don't join the team. @smartvalueblog

@RandPaul not to mention the EPA.
@RandPaul @DerKaiser41  Addressin the haters on Rands page Coal isnt going anywhere it gotus here n it will remain our Coal industry forever
@RandPaul @DerKaiser41  Alright Im right there with ya Rand lets go the atrosities have to end .. #StandWithRand he onit America..
@RandPaul @Darren32895836
@RandPaul @Amberis4LSU You are the best to get it done like u as VP
@RandPaul you clearly took her comment out of context... Just ask her. Make sure chubby fingers aren't crossed.
Better late than never. Let's fire up that Hi-Tech Clean Coal industry. On second though, just fire it up. #wiyh @RandPaul @aduanebrown
Yes let's keep polluting the air & environment! @RandPaul need to move next door to a coal energy plant if you like dirty air it so much!
@RandPaul @aduanebrown she's heartless !
@RandPaul @aduanebrown #MAGA
@RandPaul why would we continue to use coal? #350.org
@RandPaul please join # republicanfor hilary , it's the right thing to do
@RandPaul thank you for returning to the Senate you are one of the few truly representing us
@RandPaul  coal the biggest pollution source on earth. It may make jobs for Kentucky, but it's killing all of us.
@RandPaul My retirement investments are counting on your fight to end the chokehold on energy.
@RandPaul You know who is for coal right? #VoteTrump2016 He'd like your endorsement
Surely no one is entitled to be ignorant, & stay ignorant; even if U R called @RandPaul
#LearnAndTeachWhatIsEnergy http://goo.gl/h52sh1   @RandPaul
If U @RandPaul don't know what is #Energy & have no mastery of thermodynamics then #Learn
@RandPaul coincidence that over 90% of Kentucky's electricity comes from coal and that state has 3rd lowest electric rates.
to know what is #Energy mastery of thermodynamics is required @RandPaul
According to 1st law energy is not nationality bound @RandPaul
@RandPaul coincidence that Kentucky is 3rd largest coal producing state?
@RandPaul Glad to hear that Rand.We can't afford to have Killary put all those miners out of work. Good for you. Please stand with Trump
@RandPaul  One way is to do this is cut off energy oil tax credits and send the money to coal miners way to reeducate, training and welfare
@RandPaul .@realDonaldTrump WE THE PPL WILL NEVER ALLOW U2 BE POTUS! #Unite!! @tedcruz JOINTHETRUMPTRAIN#NeverClinton
@RandPaul  Would you consider serving in a Trump Administration?
@BackOnTrackUSA @RandPaul Mr. Paul for Secretary of State. That would be awesome

@RandPaul Thank you, Dr. Paul.
@RandPaul don't they have a right to work to support themselves
#u mf e b
@RandPaul Why don't you just let the market kill it, it's dying already. "libertarian". Ahahaha
@RandPaul Please, don't pander. Fracked gas is cheaper than coal. The market has declared coal dead. #libertarian
@RandPaul thank you Rand for all u do. It is not easy. Please God Hiliary doesn't win
@RandPaul thanks
@RandPaul @fromeverymount1 Miners deserve our gratitude fueling our energy
while risking health & lives.That Clinton cow is a horror!
@irgrannyg @RandPaul yes and yes!
@fromeverymount1 @RandPaul It makes me so angry...she lives off the sufferings of others and then dismisses them.What a swamp creature!
@irgrannyg @RandPaul Come to think of it, she's scarier than the swamp creature :)
@RandPaul I would love to see you as VP! Your a blessing to this country.
@RandPaul Dr Paul, we can produce electricity with out fossil fuels,but we need coal for many things,there is a happy medium that works.
@RandPaul what we need is deregulation of the energy industry,Its a new world,we need to focus on space,that's the new wilderness.
@RandPaul we need coal to make graphine,and other heat resistant components as well as electrical components.we need deregulation totally.
@RandPaul we can generate more than enough energy just from our waste water, if you could just deregulate
@RandPaul fight on. Now that the GOP trench is clear lets file the front echelon with libertarian leaders
@RandPaul Ever been to Beijing?
@RandPaul Damn straight there should be a war on coal.
@RandPaul back trump
@RandPaul fight the good fight. Fight for the liberties of all Americans.

@RandPaul Her non-apology & "made a mis-statement" remarks are priceless Hillary moments of ego driven 3rd person talk
@RandPaul You going to fight the outrageous Tariffs placed on our consumers by a President Trump?
@ttturner68 @RandPaul Would you rather have jobs in the US or cheap shoes from China?
@rahtexas @RandPaul ignorant protectionist view, Growth through lower taxes and less regulation. Not punishing commerce and consumers.
