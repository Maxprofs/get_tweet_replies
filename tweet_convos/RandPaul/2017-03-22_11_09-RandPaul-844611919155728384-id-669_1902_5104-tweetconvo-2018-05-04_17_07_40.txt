Does @RandPaul & @freedomcaucus remember that Mr. Trump looked straight into a camera and promised voters UNIVERSAL, affordable healthcare?
I don't want universal. I want freedom to NOT buy
Heck then, the rest of us will pay for hospitals, clinics, labs, equipment, medicine so it's all ready for when you need it
we've always had hospitals BEFORE O'Care don't try an act like mandatory coverage is gonna create a hospital system.... dumb
If you aren't paying into the health insurance pool, you are freeloading on the rest of us.
that's WHY I don't believe in the healthcare system and I have a RIGHT to not support it
If a community decides to have a fire department and collect taxes for it, you DON'T have a RIGHT to live there and not pay.
you do have the right to move into a rural area that doesn't have fire service....
So when you all get a really kick ass bill together for repeal and replace is it going to be Obamacare Ultra?
Or does it only bear Obama 's name if you deem it terrible?
Also WTF have you guys been up to since ACA went live.  Too busy shit talking to think on replacement proactively?
They passed a bill to repeal it over 15 months ago. Obama vetoed it and now the Rhinos shelved it.
my point is that their replacement is worse than what they are trying to replace and they had time.
The Rhinos never planned on repeal. Read #TedCruz book. He exposed their lies.
Hard Pass. I would sooner read a book by his daughter who looks to be smarter and more articulate.
I remember @SpeakerRyan wasn't their choice.
Why don't you FIX IT instead of obstructing. We will remember to vote you guys out. #MAGA
What do you propose they do? @SpeakerRyan could have done it day 1 using bill Obama vetoed. @POTUS
WE worked our asses off to give Republicans full majority. It is time they deliver
However, it isn't the @freedomcaucus who is doing the damage. They are simply working to fulfill the #FullRepeal promise & need THANKS.
YOU OWE THE ACA NOW & THE SUFFERING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! WE WILL NOT FORGET! REPEAL & REPLACE THE FREEDON CAUCUS
you were quoted by @CNN
you should have been president my vote would've gone to you
Thank you both. Glad to know there are at least a few good folks still left in Congress.
ANY & EVERY REPUBLICAN REFUSING TO COMPROMISE & SUPPORT POTUS WILL BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE. ARE YALL INSANE?
while all of your are getting your insurance paid 100% by the taxpayers we are all struggling. My insurance went from $120-$1,200/mo..
you've had 8 years to get it done. Now when a plan is in front of you, U want to start over. Really? UR killing us
If this bill is passed, it will insure defeat. BAD BILL! MUST have #FullRepeal. This isn't that.
"understood" & agree, fed up with 8 years of complaining. Go time & our party can't get it together
You failed Senator and inched US one step closer to single pay system!! You are terrible. Shame on you,
Let's hope they do start negotiations. I think we need a #NewParty NOW! Give Conservatives #People2Vote4. The #GOP has #GoneDemocrat.
Agree. However, u have to get rid of the ROADBLOCK. That Monkey Speaker Ryan. He will SINK THE GOP..GET RID OF HIM
Nice job guys, you have courage, you fight for what we believe in and you have integrity; God Bless you all!
YOU STOOD WITH PELOSI AGAIN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! WE STAND WITH POTUS! ENACT THE MAGA AGENDA NOW OR FACE VOTERS!
why did you still fund PP?  That is not good.
WE SUPPORT POTUS TRUMP & NOT YOU! YOU STAND WITH PELOSI AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! SEE YOU IN THE PRIMARIES!
Then get to work and repeal immediately, start fresh with new bill ASAP!
thank you Senator Paul!!   Keep fighting for us. #FullRepeal #KeepYourPromise
Wake up Senator all you are doing is supporting Pelosi and ACA You can't repeal ACA without 60 Senate votes. Best Republican bill in decades
Like your idealism and conviction, but where does that help American People. Staying the course sunk the Titanic.
now, put forth a plan that will work, NOW, repeal/replace
You better do something or you will be out!  Citizens stand behind President Trump 100% - that's why he is Pres!
WHEN YOU STAND POTUS IN THE BACK YOU STAB THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE BACK! WE WILL NOT FOGET YOU OWE THE ACA NOW!
A VICTORY FOR PELOSI IS NOT A VICTORY FOR AMERICANS! REPEAL & REPLACE THE FREEDOM CAUCUS! YOU WON ACA NOW!
in his campaign, Trump ppromised that everyone would have health care and it would be cheaper than Obamacare. Lies?
don't repeal Obamacare, just make it better. Why reinvent the wheel? Universal Health Care is needed.
must remember not all Republicans are ultra conservative.  Your "My way or the Highway " ruining Trump's movement.
Sooner or later the voters of Kentucky are going to wake up and throw you oout of the senate.  Hope sooner.
ONCE A LOSER ALWAYS A LOSER! YOU OWE THE ACA NOW & THE SUFFERING OF MILLIONS! WE WILL NEVER FORGET! ENACT MAGA NOW!
YOU TRAITORS OWE THE ACA NOW & THE SUFFERING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! WE WILL NOT FORGET! SEE YOU AT THE BALLOT BOX!
I just wonder how Conservatives were Not at the Head of the Table!!!
Answer: Too many uninformed voters who keep electing left-leaning Republicans like @SpeakerRyan & @GOPLeader.
@Trickadlington @freedomcaucus rand when are you going to start being conservative and call out government breaking constitution
why r ppl against Ryancare? I'm glad there's no mandate, right???
should have had the members from the beginning
@SpeakerRyan should have listened to @freedomcaucus & used already approved 2016 bill day 1 on @POTUS desk for signature
Sure hope @freedomcaucus @RandPaul can stop RyanCare. I want Trump 2 win but we must REPEAL Obamacare b4 we replace!
I commend @freedomcaucus for staying united against Obamacare Lite. Enough NO votes to stop bill and restart negotiations w/ conservatives
LOL...please...you clowns won't be seeing the political light of day for a while
Keep working, let's get it done right. Now is the time. #MAGA  @realDonaldTrump Thank You
THANKS TO YOU TAXPAYERS WILL CONTINUE SUPPORTING ABORTIONS, THANKS! WE THE PEOPLE STAND WITH POTUS TRUMP! MAGA!
YOU STAND WITH PELOI WE STAND WITH POTUS TRUMP! WE DEMAND YOU ENACT POTUS TRUMP MAGA AGENDA NOW!
WE THE PEOPLE ELECTED POTUS TRUMP & THE MAGA AGENDA, ENACT IT NOW OR FACE THE VOTERS WRATH! NO MORE EXCUSES!
WE THE PEOPLE STAND WITH POTUS TRUMP! ENACT POTUS MAGA AGENDA NOW! OR FACE THE VOTERS' WRATH!
WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND YOU SUPPORT POTUS MAGA AGENDA OR FACE THE VOTERS! NO MORE EXCUSES! DO YOUR JOB!
Now get something done.  It is time for action! You guys seem to spend more time out of Washington than in.
-WE THE PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE AND PAY FOR INSURANCE-ALL OF YOU IN WASHINGTON. LETS GET A PETITION UP?
You did a great job funding Abortion. Are you working for @TheDemocrats or @PPFA ? Re-election coming up.
@ConserValidity @freedomcaucus Ryan couldn't pass Obamacare lite and you can't pass repeal. So who's more guilty it's still here?
@ConserValidity @freedomcaucus Except now it's the Freedom Caucus' job to get rid of Obamacare & I don't think you can do it.
@ConserValidity @freedomcaucus I really appreciate the fact that they stood for the American people.
When will a full repeal bill be offered up for a vote?
Freedom Caucus sealed their fate.  They need to go  Novel idea- think of USA 1st & not just ONLY YOUR constituents
Don't give up. The American people need you. 
O-care is killing us.  We have the senate & house. Get it done!
I'm embarrassed for you. You failed to lead.
perhaps they should start negotiating w democrats 2 devise a plan that works for everyone not just conservatives.
so obvious you have never spent time in the corporate world. Have no idea how to project manage.
You and your obstructionists gang have thrown away your chance to fix this HUGE problem....shame on you
you should know better, Senator, just repeal it
U have been complaining abt this FOREVER & have done NOTHING except continue to complain! #wheresurbill
Now you have the responsibility to bring up a bill that to repeal Obamcare and stop Planned Parenthood funding asap
he has one. No one has been listening to him. Go to his website. Bill is there
@JBaker31826004 @freedomcaucus Term Limits for all Elected Officials No More Career Politicians you can't get along so get out
@cutterko ummm. Just to be clear, the @freedomcaucus ARE the conservatives.
Thank you, @tedcruz, & Mike Lee for fighting for what was promised. @mcneil4congress @freedomcaucus
@TeamTrumpAZ @freedomcaucus as a doctor you know Obamacare is a disaster. Stop critizing.
He and Cruz are setting themselves up to run again
Bring it on they will lose their ass.
Failure 2 agree 2 some plan regarding POTUS bill solely failure ur caucus. Great going! No more $. Down in '18!
You are missing the chance to actually do something rather than nothing.
You've made Trump, Republicans and yourselves look like fools. Bravo. Hope you all are voted out.
Fine, you got your no votes.  Do you know how to succeed and actually pass something?
I respect you. But you are on the wrong side of this.....  @freedomcaucus
how many years will that take Senator Paul? - all the while we are still paying Planned Parenthood - thanks..
sure but that's not the perception. Appears that your impotent. After 7 years of talk...nothing. Nxt election bad
@JBaker31826004 @freedomcaucus that shldve happened before you took down POTUS in public http://way.You  own it. Feckless
how does one rid the entities model of ensnaring the unsuspecting for personal gain? And why are they all the same?
the only winners are the Democrats and PP.  I am sick of it!  Repeal and replace or we will replace Freedom Caucus.
The problem is you just don't have the numbers, you're a microcosm of a big party.
If conservatives are going to start over they need a new speaker to bring everyone together. Ryan failed. Resign!
Sen. Paul. Hold their feet to the fire make sure it's full repeal replace bill. Voters will reward you for it!
good luck with that
.@RandPaul @freedomcaucus don't let .@POTUS drop the ball on this #GitRDone
Nancy and Chuck thank you for your complete failure. I hope you're proud.
@KamVTV @freedomcaucus you better hope this works out or you are screwed....
Please guys take your time and get it right.#norushing
Rand,are you pay off the swamp? Check yourself.
repealing and replacing isn't the answer. Stop working for the RICH.
you are the reason nothing gets done.
you are all bums!  Millions will suffer for your actions on hc!  Thanks for screwing America!
BUT, did you open the door for @POTUS to work with DEMS since REP are NOT reliable to stay united? @SpeakerRyan
no you allowed Koch brothers a huge win.  This wasn't about HC.  It was about damaging Trump.  At least be honest
@evampasano @freedomcaucus your head too far in the clouds to be of any earthly good. This from a huge conservative.
Senators in their safe districts ensure the party will once again be a minority party. You have lost the middle
Plan to restart negotiations w/ conservatives to replace Obamacare. The ship has sailed until Obamacare explodes.
no more negotiations! Gee thanks for your help!
vote for the bill don't want a replacement bill cost will come down when Trump gets COST under control
@RockMetalKittyX @freedomcaucus The majority is meaningless now, no thanks to you.
@RockMetalKittyX @freedomcaucus whatever dude. Good luck getting it done now. Could've fixed on senate floor with fewer votes.
I do not commend freedom caucus or any other special interest including you. You ALL should have been ready day 1
@TeamTrumpAZ @freedomcaucus 

You guys own Obamacare now. What's the new plan?
we gave you the house, the senate and theWhite House. You had 7 years to get your plan together. @realDonaldTrump.
POTUS needs support.Changes can still be made in senate.Caucus needs 2 ustand just put imploding ocare on table.
You all better get your shit together. Conservatives want action, now. Show progress. This hinders tax reform
Glad you carry on the legacy of stupidity. Conservatives destroying conservatives over ego, is lose, lose. It's We the People, not Congress
@WashingtonDCTea @freedomcaucus it's over. Enjoy your Obamacare. Time to move on to taxes.
@benfergusonshow @freedomcaucus shame on you all!!!
Regarding the new healthcare bill, will you/your family commit to taking whatever is offered to the working class?
So, you get free cadillac healthcare and we get stuck with Obamacare because..oh that's right you never compromise.
@benfergusonshow @freedomcaucus - typical Repub action -can never come together, always delay, kick the can down road - recess
@benfergusonshow

Hope you're right, Senator. The American people are counting on the GOP to make this right
@Redone68 @freedomcaucus
I could almost see it!
Sad that it's come this far
We need more true fighters for our Constitution or it'll be whittled away
@Redone68 @RandPaul @freedomcaucus
AND I DO NOT COMMEND THEM.  THIS IS ALL EGO. BILL NOT PERFECT BUT A START. PASS IT. SENATE CAN HANDLE.
You know budget reconciliation can only do so much. Why do you want more babies slaughtered while we pay?
How can we successfully bring together Constitutionalists, Mods, Libertarian,  etc without destroying POTUS & GOP?
Keep up the fight if you don't we will end upwith the one payer system. THANKS!
It's either For or Against, Senator. The choice is yours. The time is now. Let's do this! Vote YES
Why can't Republicans  stick together.  You are an embarrassment !!  I guess you weren't ready to get 3 Branches !
@KamVTV @freedomcaucus senator with all due respect a deal isn't 100% what you want it is some for all sides not like dems did!
Appreciate that we still have a checks & balances system within our own party as it doesnt exist between us & dems
How abt let's get th govt out of our freaking HC? Provide 4 VETS,elderly & disabled-everyone else can get a freaking job & buy it on mrkt
As a doctor and a represnetative of all people, you cannot allow 24 million to go without affordable health care.
@KamVTV @freedomcaucus negotiations are done prez moving on you want to keep ocare and if they don't vote to repeal you win.
<- will seal their own fate and all of their good deeds will be forgotten. Banished forever!
It is irresponsible to take a path for which you have no secured votes to get the job done WITH YOUR PLAN.
Great! You, Tom, Ted & Mike keep up the good work. Thanks
actually we gave you all three houses and you failed once again.  Obamacare is here to stay, thanks for nothing.
1 thing they keep saying is people will "have access" to health care. This will be sad 4 poor sick people
Vote no, fix #Obamacare! Don't be intimidated by a bully who doesn't even know how Government works!!!
hope you're still a No vote. Trump trying to bully folks votes
You should all get off your high horse.  The alternative is obamacare. Wake up!
dump obamacare then get out of healthcare altogether. Leave it to the experts.
What have you been doing for the last 7 years?As a party leader you should have a good replacement bill ready.
Do what is best for the country. Vote for the AHCA or we vote you out! You are worse than Pelosi!
I say let it explode on the Democrats watch because its all their gig anyway Thats why Ryan wrote the bill he is biggest Rhino there is 
Hang in and repeal in full not piecemeal. It's not governments respomsibility to provide insurance
Until they repeal McCarran-Ferguson and abolish 'networks' where the patient out-of-pocket amounts change, no fix!

:  it is time for the Health bill co-sponsored by Senator Paul to be debated in House. KILL ACA
if nothing is passed  @RandPaul the @freedomcaucus will be united as they are voted out the door, great start to get rid of the disaster OBC
Only the rich should be allowed to vote.
The only people who deserve healthcare are those that can afford it, via for-profit private insurers.
Please tell the President I don't want Ryan involved in our health care.  Bring us Rand Pauls plan and it will pass
I VOTE that @RandPaul #randpaul replaces @SpeakerRyan He is an honorable man! Ryan not doing good!
Different house
Compromise & pass/tweak after Senate/Adjust Medicaid later/Smooth transition/Show unity/Grandstand later/No Dem win
#DumpRyan #FULLREPEAL #NOMANDATE
We the people want #FullRepeal #nomandate government get out of my healthcare!!
Get something done. Tired of all the talk and no action. Ya'll talk everything to death.
Let's prep your 2018 goodbye party if you vote "No"
#KeepPromises
Of course, none of this #Reconciliation mess would be necessary if @SenateGOP would just #KillTheFilibuster!! @realDonaldTrump
HFC knows how to obstruct. Really disappointed with HFC clowns.
@WashingtonDCTea @freedomcaucus this Obamacare is so bad we need to do something
@WashingtonDCTea @freedomcaucus my daughter in Minnesota to over six hours to find some dentist to take my grandbaby
@RandyCarranco @freedomcaucus Paul Rino appears to get his marching orders, not from the people, but big medical BUCK$. Is he?
Exactly Ryan is paid millions from Medical He is a joke Trump should have never put him in charge of bills He cuts benefits 4 old & vets
I dont understand how You Guys could pull da rugg from under @realDonaldTrump ! The Democrats applaud You! Great Job! #MAG
@jrileysnaps @freedomcaucus looking at the revisions are we closer?  We need to get it right. But let's open to compromise. #MAGA
Thank you Mr. Senator. This is the will of the people that you work for. You're a great leader. An inspiration!!
Please #RepealAndReplace
#FOLLOWTHEMONET with RYANCARE
Please B our VOICE

@HouseGOP Repeal Only. Alarming that @potus attemptd 2 persuade Conservs 2 fold instead of swamp estab. & Insurance
all of you look like a bunch of , just wanting to get TV time!! Pass the bill now so we can move forward!
A simple fact Trump is looking at 47% APPROVE ObamaCare. Sad but true. Move forward on a gradient. Trust @POTUS @RandPaul @freedomcaucus
You could speak to working families to understand what makes real sense for them. Imagine working together.
Get it Right. Purchase open market across state lines is a Must.  Otherwise government in control
you lost the election get out of the Presidents way either help or go home my vote is you go home
