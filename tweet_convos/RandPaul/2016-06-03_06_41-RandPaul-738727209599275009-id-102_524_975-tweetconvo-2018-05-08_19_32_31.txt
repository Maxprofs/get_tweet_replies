@alllibertynews ...because it has been successfully limiting government? Since when?
I hear ya but its better than nothin. Can't let em disregard. Let's revolt n make a better 1. Ready?
I am ready, and building paths from dependency to freedom. We don't need to be revolting, the ...
..govt is revolting enough without our help.
.@RandPaul gee isn't that oath of office?
Why don't your peers adhere to & honor that oath?
Please obstruct Garland till kingdom come. Both Democrats and Republicans should oppose him. A terrible choice for the Court.  @randpaul
Endorsing Donald Trump is a lousy way of defending the constitution. I'm afraid the Paul "apple" fell several yards from the tree.
@PRyan @MitchMcConell your YES vote for Trump equals America's NO vote for you! Support a crazy person and you too will lose. Done
Well who the hell else is there inmate Clinton or rich Bernie?
Tyler, Ms Clinton is not an inmate. She served this country her entire life like my father
great message, I hope everyone doesn't just hear it, but really listen to it. #LegalizeFreedom
the government is the biggest threat.
@LisaSmi30580467 Rand Paul would be a Great VP !! Watch video
People are strange, how can anyone have anything negative to say about this video? Blows my mind. #StillRanding #writeinrand

@Midgespeaks INCLUDING #BarackOBAMA who is #ProvenTRAITOR to USA,the FLAG & the CONSTITUTION 
He's a MURDERER & LIAR. MUST GO NOW!
@alllibertynews we must protect people in this country.
NO we must uphold th Declaration of Independence to  protect and defend Americans against all enemies foreign and domestic
Bet you didn't get this memo from @NRA What more guns really means for KY @MomsDemand #EndGunViolence
@freedomtex 
Yet Obama is still in office. Hummm

@SenatorWicker @SenThadCochran @HarperCampaign  Hopefully my MS reps will watch and support constitution!! I am watching them!!

The Constitution was spit upon, on 12/14/12 in Newtown, Ct. https://www.facebook.com/notes/sandy-hook-hoax/an-open-letter-to-fred-grimm-of-the-miami-herald/1 …
"we must defend a centuries old document created by white slave owners"
I'm scared for our nation.
We need to get away from where this man and our Government is taking us
then how about less rhetoric and more truth and more revealing of things the masses aren't aware of!?
sounds good in theory, why is Obama still our president? Shouldn't a congressman have stepped up by now?
I am glad you support #Trump the Paul family are #RationalLibertarians . We had some unique ppl at LP convention #SomeWereCrazy
@astroud7  .... NO MATTER WHO the enemy is even it is a USA citizen or not. I swore an OATH and only GOD is above that OATH.
Thank you Rand
I agree. I still do.  Let's all meet at 5:00 p.m. nation's Capitol flagpole on 6/17/16, to defend Amendment 9 - Unenumerated Rts.
Does that include when GOP Senators ignore Constitution & oath and won't #DoYourJob on #SCOTUS? #KYSen #Kentucky @GrayforKentucky
. Support the Constitution Party, Rand! #DC4DC
True BS artist. Actor. Unable to be real. Repeated talking points - hot issues only. No real core. Attention getter. Desperate.
What about a presidential candidate that supports broadening libel laws and belittling the first amendment?
Yes
there is a variety of pre knowledge of Sandy Hook. Hoax of our lifetimes. God help us.
Ralph Nader and your Dad courageously retweeted me. Federal Grand Jury, please
No. Sandy Hook was a not a live shooter, mass casualty event Was a DHS drill
gee, they received my certified letter and never responded. Imagine that.
pre knowledge of Sandy hook psy ops
damn!!!
read about criminal past of Sandy Hook coverup thugs in Lanza cremation farce.
I stand with you on that, Rand.
and from these guys as well
What does this mean to the people? I read support of this but get arguments when implementation is brought up
@JajsaArthur ..What do you suggest.?.How should we go about doing just that.?.Or are you simply "bloviating"..?
please run independent
@alllibertynews @RandPaul why? So people can waste votes and elect Hillary? Never trump needs to consolidate behind @GovGaryJohnson
And you support Trump who will do away with the Constitution?????

However, your the party that has given us Bachmann, Palin and now Trump...may be you are on to something with the enemies thing
Give it a rest. Just because coal is a dying industry does not mean the Constitution is in danger.
which is exactly why the established GOP must go down with the Liberals because you stood by and allowed us to be tread on
You got cheated for Ratings, my hope is that u and others side with morality over party can't say the same for @SpeakerRyan
Like Donald Drumpf.
as long as you stay Constitutional you will always have my support
@realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton both are domestic enemies of our constitution.
@RandPaul
Rat out all these politicians you know who are degrading the USA Rand! State their names so Americans know who they are.
- Thats why @BarackObama needs forced out of office NOW and @HillaryClinton not elected President.
#hitler used #atheism to create #libertarianism to protect Germany’s constitution! #StandWithRand
Except Libertarianism existed in forms before the 20th century, so no. Hitler did not.
#hitler? He invented #libertarianism.
*clears throat* YOU ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP
We must protect and defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
and Romney last time.  Too much of a GOP cheerleader with endorsements.  Good voting record though.
@cpacchioli @Reyes_Carlos_ 
need more like you so the constitution could win again.
um, i think you missed one of the domestic ones.  may i ask, do you not wring your hands every time trump unleashes a new zinger?
@RandPaul
Lets stick to domestic. Drug testing is unconstitutional and amazingly counter-productive.  #1 reason for the overdose epidemic

@RandPaul
thousands of jobs for the middle class and millions of dollars into our economy
I'm telling you what I see in west Texas and North Dakota if some one don't have a job that's there fault
@UNFORGIVIN_ @RandPaul
Isaac Newton Francis Collins Galileo where all Christian
Hammurabi was not.
where does that quote say anything about Christianity?
and elected
"Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet." General Mattis
how about the 3 branches actually follow it  first, maybe read it during a session of comgress.
"congress"
especially domestic
Rand for trump VP!!!
and illegals
.....Are you referring to @realDonaldTrump ?
your point? Random
, can't it just be a point? One I agree with BTW.
