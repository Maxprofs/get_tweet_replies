Trump/Paul!
hoping this is sarcasm or something
Why?
I'm in the #nevertrumporhillary camp, doesn't matter who VP is, even if it's my favorite candidate Rand Paul
Fair enough.
Too each their own. 

(Cheers)
trump is a fascist who wants to murder women and children
You are way off. You need to read up on HRC and see who take money from where
god why do people keep saying that? 1 trump wants to join them 2 she spends the money on like clean water not murder
Maybe true 150 years ago. Urban society requires bigger government.Infrastructure demands are too great. #BoycottTrump @Defeat_GOP
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @Defeat_GOP urban society needs more gov't?Doesn't get much bigger or worse than Chicago, NYC, LA!
Don't forget Baltimore.
indeed, can't forget Baltimore.
You support a bigot for President. Shame on you. What will your children think when they grow up? You put party above morals & USA
Hillary's crimes. Hillary's anti-gay funding. Hypocrite much? @alllibertynews @RandPaul
can't say much nice about HRC. She is a terrible choice; Trump worse still. Bigot for President?
loser
Liberty Thrives when our elected officials do the will of the people, not large corporations or parties #abolishpoliticalparties
I'm with you dude. Abolish by the year 2020. http://Project2020.wordpress.com 
@vine We need you in the White House! #StillRanding
Every day, 91 Americans are killed by gun violence. We ask you pass common-sense gun laws. #LALovesOrlando #guncontrol
@vine why are you fighting and for what
@realDonaldTrump for President
@vine it would be better off if it was small right now it is to large we need people who are smart in our government to run it vs
Dr Paul wants government smaller than his cock if that's possible. Hendrix would be appalled at this ad.You suck at politics
@vine make it happen Senator.
@vine I think I disagree with that.In my opinion it is exactly the opposite.
Let's stand together with a united front against big government and the democratic party.
good man!
please define the diference betwen small and big goverment
@alllibertynews @RandPaul well waiting for some responses here
I agree 100% and I'm for TRUMP ! His worst day is a great day for the people of America !!!!
No thanks you nutter.
let's start by cutting Congressional salaries and no more lifetime benefits. #SmallerGovernment
Government regulates and protects us from the criminals in your party, #racists, and the greedy. No thanks. I love our government.
This demand from major party just shows a lack of care for the struggling portion of our population. #BoycottTrump @Defeat_GOP
no freaking way.
I cringe when I hear "fight" from a politician. Even you.  I either want voluntary interaction or disassociation.  No fights.
@vine I wouldn't join Ur CRAZY ASS to fight so much as PICNIC ANTS!
@alllibertynews
@vine Does that mean taxes will be small also or just the return Americans get on their tax investment #DisarmHate #EndGunViolence
No way! I am with the Democrats 100%.
luckily corporate America can step in as government gets smaller... Healthcare, drugs, education...it'll be amazing
What you really mean is get rid of regulation, but make sure government is ensconced in our bedrooms and in our marriage decisions
@alllibertynews
Indeed.
Goverment should be large enough to protect the American people from corporations who wish to influence our policies. (1/2)
As an elected official, I expect that you will do right by the people and refrain from serving your party's corp. interests(2/2)
Honor your pledge to the American People, not your party.
America is more than parties, we are supposed to be United #unitedstates
Why not collaborate so elected oficials serve with integrity for the greater good of all the American people, not just the .05%.
4or5 replies so far, and no supporters. Your states education system is so bad that all they know to do is hit the "Like" button.
@vine don't know what fight but that was worst sound on a video I have ever heard
Rand Paul does this for the children of America. He loves children. He has the restraining orders to prove it.
I will join you in the fight. I will be the one cracking you in the the head with a baseball bat, then stepping on your nuts. Lose
Less regulations is what makes the difference in other words, yes less government
I think we need only to see how to help but not fight.
which type of fight do you mean?
which fights
thx for standing by your pledge !  You are a real and true patriot.
You signed that letter...traitor
that IS WHAT DJT HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG. GET WITH THE PROGRAM DOC
fight? You already do nothing in the senate, you fake 'doctor'
What fight?  To bring back feudalism?
Clinton(local & worldwide spending) vs. Trump(nativist bunker-mentality paranoia spending).  Your libertarianism has no anchor.
please tell me that you do not support @realDonaldTrump #LastUSPresidentOnEarth #BrexitWannabe #StumpSmarterThanTrump
It's nuanced.
http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/03/rand-id-support-disaster-trump-if-hes-the-nominee-but-i-wont-be-enthusiastic/ …
EXACTLY how #NeverTrump scammed his way into being the @GOP presumptive nominee #NuancedTrumpaloompa
Fair enough, but Paul made a commitment and is trying to keep it. I can respect that
@vine why are all politicians so corrupt that they can't put Hillary in jail does she have shit on all of you guys
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @vine Quite frankly, probably, lol!
I don't believe in anything you stand for. I hope you lose your senate seat. Don't ever tweet me again.
The fight is over. As a libertarian Republican, feel free to vomit at your candidates lies, bluster and dearth of specifics..
I remember the day that you said that Obama deserved his people. You forgot Americans deserve good honesty administration
What happened to your father 4 years ago, was disgraceful. Let's not repeat. BIG fan of you father :), but Trump is for 2016
@vine If only the apple fell closer to the tree. But I can tell it's hard out there if you don't compromise  #RonPaulForever
when government is small banks get away with murder, corporations pollute at will, average citizens pay the price.
..oh good... we'll all go play nice in Rand's utopian lala land
, against all odds, if you will be Trump's VP, I will be more than happy to vote this time!
What fight?  Why you fighting? Isn't there enough fighting?Why are you compounding the problem? Fight?  You're promoting violence.
So, when are you going to makje the Congress smaller and quit?
no thank you....
go rand Paul
Mexico has a real small government. Most times you can't even find it. And Somalia has no government at all.
No thanks, I don't believe in kowtowing to the NRA & I believe everybody should be treated fairly, not just the 1% .
@americasliberty @vine  Of course Mr.Rand you betcha #StandWithRand #LibertyMatters
@vine #StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
@vine  please endorse gary johnson
go and fight the convention. Stake your claim as the republican presidential nominee.
then why are you backing the fascist Trump?
If you have any principles, ur going to have to endorse @GovGaryJohnson and @GovBillWeld over @realDonaldTrump #2016election
Who ever said that Rand Paul has any principles ?
I will if you join the fight against Trump. In your heart you know that's right.
http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/04/28/watch-trailer-clinton-cash-movie-premiering-cannes/ …
Please do not send me that garbage. using breitbart says volumes.
You should move to Somalia, old chap. I hear Mogadishu is quite charming at this time of year. #smallgovernment
.@raymonddelauney Somalia doesn't have a small government nor anarchy but rather is run by several very intrusive governments.
RAND, have you taken a class on becoming DYNAMIC and HISTRIONIC yet?  You need to do that else never be President.
