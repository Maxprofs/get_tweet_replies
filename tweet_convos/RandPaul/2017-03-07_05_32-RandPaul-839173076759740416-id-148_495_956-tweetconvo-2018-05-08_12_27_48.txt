@gardenofthegods @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @FoxNews why does it need replaced? Free market, let the insurance companies do job
healthcare should be a basic human right, not slave to a profit motive
and we are not talking about health care, but health insurance.
health care is not a right given by our Creator, and is not covered
under the constitution. There are many problems with health care,
but socialistic policies will not provide better or even good care.
socialism is a dead end, destroying every shred of humanity in the
capitalism by itself will eventually lead to mass unemployment via automation
@realDonaldTrump  Just repeal the damn thing, then we can tweek the existing PRIVATE model.
if Republicans think they can get this done w out providing a benefit to the poor they're stupid
A benefit to the poor?  LOL.  You mean free healthcare right?  LOL
Ummm, Yes. You think I like or want it? It's the reality we live in bud
Repeal now. Vote. Negotiate the bill. Stop Ryan from ruining President Trump.
@fxnopinion @RepMarkMeadows. More input neeed
completely newplan passed and ready,then pull ocare and replace with new
.@FoxNewsOpinion @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @FoxNews YES!!
@realDonaldTrump  What the country doesn't want or need is Obamacare Light.
Obamacare should be repealed and replaced on the same day.If not millions we be left without insurance..
Repeal no replace needed.
Yes for full repeal the let the States handle it. It is NOT a Federal issue.
How can there be a smooth transition for patients if there's a repeal and then no plan in place?
Um, patients can still pay the premiums on current plans. What's the problem?
I can't even get insurance. It's $700/month & covers nothing. Except b/c pills. I'm 50.
It definitely won't be much cheaper if they repeal. Mine was $600/mo bf ACA.
@Gregory__Adams @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @FoxNews Kill the RYANCare bill. We want full repeal or rep's will lose seats '18
REPLACE only. HC is like food gas groceries housing. Why can we afford those and not HC? Hmmm?
NOOO! #RepealAndReplaceWithLiberty NOW!!!! #StandStrongRandPaul
so let's put millions in a place they have zero insurance so you idiots can spend ten years
they just want a repeal with no replacement. Not fooling anyone
#FullRepeal OF  #ObamaCare ONLY!
But 54% of Americans want O-care & even 42% of Republicans want to FIX rather than scrap it! See polls
@Dale_1776 @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows clearly said buy those with enough $ to avoid any negative effects of no healthcare
@ellerich17 @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @FoxNews I understand it's broken and GOP is now going to own it. It must be done right.
@ellerich17 @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @FoxNews Doesn't make sense unless he has an ulterior motive that would be bad 4 GOP & ppl
Of course he has ult motives-his CEO friends don't like ACA because it pus PPL over Profits.
Why not have that debate first before screwing over the lives of millions of people?
it's been 8 years since you've wanted to repeal and still nothing.. 'get rich or die trying' huh?
..95%+ of population doesn't receive healthcare provided by taxpayers, what do they do in meantime?
NO #RepealAndReplace at same time just Not #SwampCare #ObamaCareLite #FullRepeal & Rand plan
.@fxnopinion @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @FoxNews
@SpeakerRyan Is a RINO and traitor. We need @RandPaul plan! #obamacarelite
No no, let's draw something up behind closed doors nobody read then cram it through midnight
you can't do that without the press destroying @potus over killing people w/o insurance!!!

#ACATruthMB replace plan should not allow ppl 2 keep COBRA if covg is avail thru new job
It was already announced there would be vigorous debate. Why is there a problem with that?
There's been a debate since Obama&Dems Lied&shoved it down our throat over6years ago!
This! =>RT @fxnopinion .@RandPaul, @RepMarkMeadows
Let's fully repeal #ObamaCare, then have an open debate on how to replace it
#ACATruthMB replace plan should allow 4 elect of COBRA instead of Medicaid, which mostly suck
#ACATruthMB replace plan should allow extension of COBRA 4 ppl starting their own business
Stand your ground, Senator Paul!
#ACATruthMB replace plan should place tax credits n LOCKED HSA if exemption from COBRA is granted.
#ACATruthMB replace plan should allow ppl 2 req exemption if COBRA is hardship w/tax credits.
#ACATruthMB replace plan should allow tax credits based on income 2 extend COBRA
#ACATruthMB replace plan should provide FULL DEDUCTION W/O itemization 4 100% of the cost of COBRA
Hey geniuses, maybe have the debate before you repeal it so people don't die in the meantime.
cant believe how bad the replace is #ACATruth read my SIMPLE replacement plan at #ACATruthMB
Don't worry. Phase III is coming!
Thank you Rand 4 standing up for the Trump voters letdown by #obamacarelite

Pardon me, but WTF do ppl who get sick do in the meantime? Not everybody has a 6figure gravy job.
ABSOLUTELY!  YES!!!!  Or how NOT to replace it, even better!!
we fully support President Trump  American healthcare act repeal Obamacare ASAP
My 88-year old mother in law, with gold plated insurance can't be treated. They said she's too old.
Deductibles are to high! Most are $8,000 WHO can afford to get sick?
I guess you'd rather have caps where a hosp. trip forces u 2 file bankruptcy?
