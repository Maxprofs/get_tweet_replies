@RandPaul @DebbieJunePD "green energy" is a scam to destroy American free market capitalism.
@DebbieJunePD @RandPaul same anti-American scum.
@RandPaul @48THPOTUS The way governments let Uber destroy the cab business.
@48THPOTUS Well considering governments tell us what we must charge,and Uber can cut rates in half and monopolize the business,yes i do.
@48THPOTUS To get to the point,I'm on the verge of poverty because of Uber,and I had a thriving cab company.
@Yellowcabohio @48THPOTUS you were probably  charging to much for to little now quit crying lower your prices and rebuild
@ejosh1 @48THPOTUS We are charging what the city dictates,and would you like to be a slave to Uber.Would you cut your income by 75%?
@Yellowcabohio @48THPOTUS then the city is your problem not uber, it's probably run by unions and Democrats, get rid of them
@RandPaul    @MikeMark4pres   In this same logic, you don't have to smoke marijuana, but don't deny the sick access.
@MikeMark4pres @alllibertynews @RandPaul Assholes always banning stuff that doesn't even affect them.
@disturbedsauce @MikeMark4pres  How is promoting Marijuana for the sick, Banning anything. http://Mikemarkforpresident.com 
@MikeMark4pres As a libertarian I'm not for any bans.
@disturbedsauce As an Independent I am neither left or right. I support the Right to bear arms, but also support Ass. Rifle bans in schools.
@MikeMark4pres I don't support any weapons ban. I'd like to own a tank. Just saying.
@disturbedsauce So would I, but look at how Violent our society has become, I Don't want a bunch of tanks Rollin around my area, L.E.O. incl
@MikeMark4pres Why If I'm not bothering anyone. Peoples fear of potential violence cannot be used to control others.
@RandPaul USA must embrace new technology or be left behind. Coal is the way of the past; renewables are the future
@RandPaul Coal fired electrical power plants produce more pollution than any other type. It is old technology & in decline worldwide
@RandPaul -- why aren't more Americans aware of this?  A failure of education?
@RandPaul unless that industry is destroying the planet we all live on
.@RandPaul Mining executives raise coal production till price falls below cost. Solution: smarter executives.
@RandPaul Here in Ontario, the Libs closed all our coal fired plants; & now we pay the highest electricity rates in the country 
@RandPaul I totally agree with you on this, though; both coal industry workers & the electrical utility consumers should be protected
@RandPaul truly votes being counted correctly by Microsoft? allow independent auditing to prevent unknown backdoors in secure gov computers!
@randpaul Look into Tesla youll find the keys to electricity
@RandPaul Energy independence? Great. Correct for outsized profits caused by subsidies? No problem. Try to legislate innovation? You lost me
@RandPaul Your coal people need to move on, dude. Drop it. Industries come and go, and it has happened all throughout history.
@RandPaul you say this shit about coal and immediately undermine any claim to authenticity or reason. Coal is already dead.
.@RandPaul My electric company is shuttering 7 coal plants in April
I'll get back to you when everyone wants goverment to pay their bills.
@RandPaul @RestoreHistory  U R right plus 40 products are made from coal.  It's disastrous to America to close down the coal mines.
@RandPaul supports the child prostitute industry. Claims adult prostitutes are no substitute.
@RandPaul Some things must absolutely be destroyed!
@RandPaul  PLEASE LSITEN to this even if you don't like this guy.
@RandPaul whats wrong with trying to legislate away an entire industry? That can't possibly be a bad precedent, right?
@RandPaul nuclear power is the next generation, but the government shouldn't be paying any energy companies #nomoresubsidies
@RandPaul maybe someone should help out his fellow senator running for President
@RandPaul we have all the resources in this world in our own nation. We can depend on ourselves but gov and epa don't allow us. Stop big gov
@RandPaul maybe you should tell the people pumping all that cheap gas that
@RandPaul Especially when the "replacement" industry is a fantasy.
@RandPaul @BackOnTrackUSA   Then back #Trump
@RandPaul Coal can't last forever. The industry will eventually destroy itself. It's better to be proactive rather than wait.
@RandPaul Sure we can. Industries come and go in a free market. The important thing is replacing it with better, also profitable energy. Dur
@RandPaul if anything you should slowly train and integrate coal employees to renewable resource employment. Win, Win. To simple an idea.
.@RandPaul how about phasing out buggy whips slowly? Happy?
@RandPaul then endorse @tedcruz!
@RandPaul lot of respect for you sir, wished you would endorse @realDonaldTrump
@RandPaul same RP who loves the wind?
@RandPaul numbers of nuclear PowerPlant leaking at alarming rate up on that terror threat, still @BarackObama @HillaryClinton want it shame.
@RandPaul I agree however its best to let her run her mouth on this. Vote Trump so Rand can be Secretary of Treasury @realDonaldTrump
@RandPaul Not until the second industry can completely take the place of the first! Idiots do it the other way! Liberal idiots! Fools!
@RandPaul: Destroy that nasty antiquated industry and train coal miners in the clean energy sectors. Come on Rand... think outside the box.
@RandPaul Nuclear fusion energy will render fossil fuels, nuclear fission, solar, wind, hydro power as obsolete as buggy whips.
@RandPaul work towards cleaner energy, yes. BUT THROUGH THE MARKET. Not through government edict. And the jobs will move to the new industry
@RandPaul but that same industry has a responsibility to the people environment and the community
@RandPaul  AMEN Rand Paul !
@RandPaul Bring back jobs lower corp tax rates to 15% and if its made manufactured 100% in the USA 7.5% rate collect taxes from new workers.
@RandPaul inefficient production methods always fail in a competitive market
@RandPaul   Coal. Kills. Period.
@RandPaul  xxyyzxxzxzxxxz x,zzx
@RandPaul oppression of real alternate technology is never discussed
@RandPaul gold sir Rand Paul could you try join up with trump . and help USA together .no ones perfect .
@RandPaul Keeping coal-burning alive hurts every person on Earth, as well as our future generations.
.@RandPaul Besides coal is fine wth clean coal technologies or carbon capture & sequestration. Technically, gas still has the same problems.
@RandPaul tell that to @HillaryClinton she said, she would "put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""
@RandPaul is there still a chance for you as President? Our options are scary
@RandPaul Obozo must have stock in the failed industries so he is killing the coal industry to force people to use his failed sources
@RandPaul Ultimately coal should go away. But that should be through a phasing out process. Coal is filthy and way behind the times.
@RandPaul Exactly, this is what they are trying to do here in Oregon.  Just passed some crazy bill or measure during the short session.
@RandPaul Then do something about it! Talk is cheap.
@RandPaul when an entire industry contributes to the decimation of our planet. Yes the end goal is to destroy it,but not 1st w/o replacement
@RandPaul quit it Coal could have survived had they embraced the clean technology.  Maybe less polluting and less blowing off mountain tops
@RandPaul 
don't pussy-foot round the issue. coal plants were clean energy. this is a racket to move industry out of the US!
@RandPaul and Sanders wants to shut down trucking. Dems ongoing war on the private sector
@RandPaul Tell that to the buggy manufacturers. Remember them?
@RandPaul Agreed!
@RandPaul Keep fighting for liberty, Rand.
