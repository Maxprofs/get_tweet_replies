Sounds like you are a typical Trump hater. In case you forgot, the Flint water debacle was caused under the previous administration

Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

Mike Phillips, who lives w/ spinal muscular atrophy, on what losing Medicaid benefits would mean for his care. 
Seems like a grear kid, but what Medicaid benefits would he lose under TrumpCare ?
Depends on the states and his conditions. #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
1/ I haven’t tweeted much about healthcare because it’s a painful subject for me. But it’s important, so let me tell you my story 
Gimme, gimme! It's all free!

150% of poverty= $9/hr for 40 hrs/wk. $6000=ONE THIRD of pre-tax income. So, choice becomes hc or rent, hc or food. #BCRA https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/878605553705943040 …
Who wouldn't love a geek-out tour there!
We're doing health care, and myself is King,president,boss,leader,
Will be calling soon,myself is being trapped in area I'm in,fixing rip their root from my gound!! Glory
Lousy Christian bot?
Siemens isn't a real good example of a business needing help. That's one of thousands of global locations for the German conglomerate.
They have deep pockets, regulations are a way of taxing & making sure products are of good quality & consumer friendly.
Companies like Siemens don't need regulations to produce quality products (most are built in Germany). Quality sells, junk doesn't.
That and to try and get an update programming class for their products costs an arm and a leg.
Funny how taking a boot off the neck can allow humans to develop their ingenuity .
Just got off the phone with your priest. He's so ashamed of your health care plans. Abandonment of your fellow man is a sin.
Republicans need to get it together and Pass this health bill and tweak things in the second phase LETS ACT LIKE REPUBLICANS !!
Keep up the good work!
I love it!
Less government regulations will help businesses growth!
I am an engineer.  Most regs are about STUPID people mistakes not about engineering; forcing  crap designs from stupid gov is not needed.
Please @RandPaul vote NO on the healthcare bill America is depending on you and the few other senators willing to go against this bill
if u don't get on board with health care, u can b sure u won't win reelection
Kentucky, I hope you vote this man out.  He clearly doesn't care about the poor and middle class.
#FreedomWorks! TY for all you do to limit government. We need less, not more.
Let the healthcare bill move forward to debate-- pass the bill
What does that sound bite really mean and when will the outcomes be delivered.What is the 90 day target on jobs and revenues
So would relieving their nanny role on healthcare insurance. It's a drag on US biz. Ayn Rand fairy dust won't fix it. Single payer will.
Your actions are leading us to Single Payer THINk!!
Hopefully more jobs unlike @Carrier who ripped off #Taxpayers Lower Taxes for #MadeInAmerica Companies!
Thank you @RandPaul - thank you for saving millions of lives, moms, dads, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, family and priceless friends.GBY
Take the lead of Sen Susan Collins and do what's right for the people of this country
A woman of integrity
Siemens is a giant German company, they want money and tax cuts in the US
BTW, i don't agree with everything he says, but imho this guy deserves our support....GO Rand !
I work IT for a company bigger then them. Regulations are not an issue.
The Rand Revere Revolution!!! I stand with US Senator Dr Rand Paul s America Baby!!! Freedom!!!
Because Siemens needs the help? Focus on the little guy.
Hooray!!  Pollute air water and earth more more more!!
Listening to you on CNN your is idea is soooo insane. Tell people to get group ins. Really? Tell that to the people of KY. UR so delusional
Rand Paul your Republicans had 8 years to develop a great plan why didn't they ???
Less regulation would help EVERYBODY grow.
Drink the water in Flint. They had less regulations....
Well that's nice what you going to do about it, anything? All talk no action
As a ky voter we went huge for @realDonaldTrump  Pls vote for health care bill !!!
How about you all helping out small businesses instead of multi million corporations who complain they just can't grow?
You need to discuss voting Yes or Kentucky will let you know how they feel!
I live in Kentucky and your damn right we will.
So what regs are on the books that are inhibitors to their growth?
Tough to see you touring a company with such close ties to the Nazi movement. Still a fan, but not happy about this @RandPaul . Sad!
Paul sold out much like the rest of the GOP when their savior got elected
What ARE YOU DOING?  Why aren't you working on health care instead of just bitching about it?
Suggesting less regulations while wearing safety goggles? You are not very bright
Less regulation will hurt the consumer and the workers and the state in general. If you don't know this you shouldn't be in politics.
That has not been proven to be correct.Why do you make these inane claims?  Can't wait until you get voted out. Delusional like all the GOP.
United shades a CNN special shows most counties in ur state depend on Medicaid. You have no choice but to oppose the bill. Kill ur own. Sad
It would be even better if you would pass the healthcar bill and we would be able to grow
Because government regulation has helped businesses grow everywhere it has been tried. Oh wait.
Please explain to me how you rationalize the idea of fewer fiscal business restrictions to think it will kill people and make water unclean.
You didn't even notice I said fiscal regulations and not safety regulations. I work in a hospital, I understand safety.
I am glad you are taking time out for less regulation however why are you not at Capitol Hill fighting for AHCA??
Less regs not always the answer  for workers. All about less tax on co and ceos. German co worth Billons.
Siemens has long ago solved the problem of expanding-it simply buys political influence with $ $ $..Be careful associating with them..
ok...wheres the humans working,,,,that was an electric panel.

Great having you visit.
dear senator, please fight for coverage of preexisting conditions
yes, I agree! Insurance cost is just too high. It doesn't make sense to have insurance unless I'm gonna use it
7 yrs Republicans are screaming about reforming HC; get it done. No excuses.

I hope you can make some time to visit my practice in Crestwood KY to see how we save patients $ & provide better care with #DirectCare
In Britain, "less regulation" led to this #GrenfellTower
Swallow your pride and work to pass a healthcare bill. Its not just for your state. Its for the whole country. Stop acting like a lone wolf!
#StandWithRand

A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair.
