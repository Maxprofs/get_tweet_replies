@RandPaul I'd choose @Nickelback over Trump any day. Nickelback or fascism? Def Nickelback! 
#StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul  Hi, in 2013 Pres Obama refused to build a Death Star to strengthen US security & create jobs. If elected, will you build one?
@Scott_AW_Brown @RandPaul why build something with obvious design flaws like 2-meter thermal exhausts that can't stop photon torpedoes?
@PaulWartenberg @RandPaul That's up to the candidates to decide, I'm just putting the question out there...
@Scott_AW_Brown @RandPaul I'm just saying we're better off spending money on clone armies to occupy systems rather than gaudy superweapons
@PaulWartenberg @RandPaul Quite probably. I saw a recent estimate of a Star Destroyer, suggesting equivalent of just one year of current...
@RandPaul @feministabulous #nickelback is good music
@RandPaul @alllibertynews  republicans deserve trump, I am very happy for the Republican Party
@RandPaul maybe I have a bad taste in music, but I like Nickelback... I'm definitely pro Rand Paul though.
@RandPaul this reads that the choice is between Trump or Cruz...have you dropped out?
@RandPaul @feministabulous Throw in yourself as choice and answer would be shoot myself in the head!
@RandPaul NEITHER!  #CruzCrew
@RandPaul more likely to be president?
@BuzzFeedAndrew @RandPaul Someone alert press, Nickelback 2x more likely to be President of US than Rand Paul
@RandPaul @bennett_maddix Nickleback, dude Trump is the freaking anti christ didnt u know?>>>>ps hope u like the pic
@RandPaul "Would you rather elect Trump, or be forced to listen to Nickelback for a four year term? Vote now!" This an #EpicFail
@RandPaul Let's compare the stats:
@Nickleback: 750k followers
@DrRandPaul: 45k followers
#canpoli
@RandPaul @chaserson
@RandPaul que up Nickelback
@RandPaul I think we all know who loves Nickelback - #CreepyCanadianCruz http://cantstumpthetrump.imgur.com/ 
@RandPaul Better than listening to Mariachi music or the prayer call blasting five times a day... Manifest Destiny says Look West, not East.
@RandPaul @Pseudo_Abogado
@ItsChadKroeger @RandPaul apparently he's bored and has no one else to blame.

@RandPaul elect Trump sadly
@RandPaul, how fitting is it that this tweet currently has 666 likes?
@RandPaul @SMLXist I choose Option C) force Trump to listen to Nickelback for 4 years. But why punish Nickelback?
@RandPaul Trump fans are like Nickelback fans. There are supposedly a lot of them, and yet you never seem to meet one.
@RandPaul @RaymondStarks Nickelback wins... I would sacrifice that part of my sanity for the country...
@RandPaul @chazrohrman
@RandPaul @ChiefElk Is this The Onion? @TheOnion
@RandPaul Lol, nice try to harvest email addresses, I applaud the effort
@RandPaul rand paul is such a dip, reminds me so much of Barney Fife, no wonder he's where he is in the polls.
@RandPaul "how do you do, fellow kids?"
@RandPaul same goes for. @tedcruz #canadianCruz #CanadianAnchorBaby #tedcruzlikesnickleback
@RandPaul um...do you not have anyone in your campaign to proofread?  If not I'd like to offer my services for a "small" fee. #wordcrime
@RandPaul never thought listening to nickel back could make me feel like a patriot, but it would if it meant no Trump!
@RandPaul I like Nickelback They rock
@RandPaul still Nickelback
@RandPaul I cannot believe you have excluded me with the whole Facebook thing
@RandPaul since this a system of government that sometimes allows a third option, how about jamming a pencil in my eye.  Repeatedly...
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Xlate: If you elect me I will play @Nickelback non-stop for 4 years.
@RandPaul @BrandonWhite59 @joerenwick @BleharShane this is tough
Four years of Nickelback... or fascism? 
The fundamental dilemma of late capitalism
@RandPaul
Would you rather elect Trump, or be forced to listen to Nickelback for a four year term? Vote now! https://cards.twitter.com/cards/3l4ipl/1eyxu …

@RandPaul O.M.G. It's Sophie's choice. Both suck.
@RandPaul to quote Montgomery Brewster "none of the above"

@RandPaul @BecketAdams nickelback
@RandPaul seeing as how I have no idea what @realDonaldTrump would do if elected president it's nickelback.
@RandPaul if it's Trump and Hillary I might stay home. Who am I kidding? I'll vote for Anyone over HRC
@RandPaul nickelback!!! #StandWithRand
@RandPaul - here's my vote;  1. @realDonaldTrump 2. Nickleback 3. Rand Paul - given those choices
@RandPaul I'm really not sure where you are going with this. Both sound not fun.
@RandPaul Lol. Funny
@RandPaul ironic.
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  Forced to listen to Nickelback #StandWithRand Trump is Democrat period
@RandPaul both sound like hell on earth
@RandPaul @PurtellySwag @Zach_Noe gotta admit this is pretty hilarious haha
@RandPaul Not fair, but I'm glad to finally know the details of the Kobayashi Maru
@RandPaul Ohhh man that's harsh, Nickelback T-T
@RandPaul NICKELBACK ALL DAY
@RandPaul  that's a lose lose, I'll take Nickleback
@RandPaul maybe you should start working with @realDonaldTrump that way @HillaryClinton won't be president.
@RandPaul you really are as s@$₩% as your dad was when he was campaigning.
@RandPaul Elect Trump or 4 years of Nickleback. Hmm... Can I take the bullet now?
#RandPaul2016 @RandPaul more interested #WINNING #IowaCaucus 39% #WashingtonTimes #RandPaul http://m.washingtontimes.com/polls/2016/jan/28/who-won-tonights-fox-news-republican-debate/results/ …
@RandPaul I'd rather listen to only nickelback for the rest of my life than have ANY OF YOU become president
@RandPaul Best. Poll. Ever. #StandWithRand
@RandPaul I'd listen to Nickleback permanently if Trump would win and have you as VP followed by P in 8 years
@RandPaul Nickelback, because it cuts more than the penny plan #roncutmore #standwithrand
@RandPaul @mckaycoppins Your seem to be losing your mind.
@RandPaul @girlziplocked either would be better than having an incompetent twit in love with Ayn Rand in office.
@newtman @RandPaul @girlziplocked enjoy your tax refund. You're welcome. #payingin4life #winning #AudittheFed
@RandPaul Shame on you but if you're backing trump then I guess its #par_4_the_course #smh @Bhold226 @deneenborelli @TRobRadio @gnoteaparty
@RandPaul No reason Congress can't pass law to clarify citizenship like they did for McCain. Stupid to make this an issue anyway.
@RandPaul #NickelBackBaby by choice #BiggestBandInTheWorld
@RandPaul yikes neither... in the words of @LindseyGrahamSC "would you rather be poisoned or shot to death? the outcome is the same."
@RandPaul not a fan of Trump at all but if you force my hand with that Russian Roulette choice...
@RandPaul savage
@RandPaul @BecketAdams trump
@RandPaul So you think we need to get the Supreme Ct. to overturn the law that says ppl born out of country to US citizen can be Pres.?
@RandPaul @seanmdav an old conundrum, like the Scylla and the Other Scylla With Ridiculous Hair.
@RandPaul @GaltsGirl Cmon Dr Paul..ur better than this..this tweet is worse than anything Trump's ever tweeted.. #cheapshot #pandering
@RandPaul I kinda like Nickelback tbh....
@RandPaul @seanmdav to paraphrase an old Cheech and Chong bit: give me the cleaver.
@RandPaul @seanmdav How the hell'd we wind up like this?
@RandPaul WHO IS NICKELBACK?  IS THIS A RAND-Y-ISM
@RandPaul this is incredibly pathetic
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Whoa... Whoa... Now this is a really hard choice.
@RandPaul @mckaycoppins death
@RandPaul lololol both sooo bad
@RandPaul Nickelback. At least you can mute them.
@theassmanNY @RandPaul Rand Paul POTUS 2016!!!!
@RandPaul  TRUMP IS THE BEST..WE DONT NEED CRIMINALS CLINTONS ANY MORE..
@RandPaul is there a door number three?
@RandPaul lol...
@RandPaul #CantHandleTheRandal
@RandPaul Nickelback ain't so bad ...
@RandPaul Just say no to facebook. Trump over nickleback for sure. I've heard enough whining for 8 yrs. So we are screaming our contempt.
@RandPaul Your social media approach has been   just include Nic Cage and we're gold
@RandPaul Your copywriter should be fired.
@RandPaul R you, with Huckabee and Santorum, campaigning  for VPOTUS?
@RandPaul trump , that's a no brainier!
@RandPaul Makes no sense? What does #Nickleback have to do with any of this? I'd be pissed if I were them. I'm not a Trump person either.
@glenp @RandPaul He means that they're both forms of torture
I’d vote, but I don’t do Facebook. Sorry that @RandPaul does. >
Would you rather elect Trump, or be forced to listen to Nickelback for a four year term? Vote now! https://cards.twitter.com/cards/3l4ipl/1eyxu …
@RandPaul Hahaha yes!
@RandPaul uhhh. What about Avril Lavigne?
@RandPaul Lmfao!!!
@RandPaul As a Canadian, Nickelback is Ted Cruz's favorite band!
@RandPaul I thought you were against cruel and unusually punishment.
@RandPaul Dude you know Trump supporters would of voted for you for VP if you didn't keep bashing him?
@RandPaul that's pretty funny right there, lol
Isn't Nickelback Canadian, like Ted Cruz? @RandPaul
