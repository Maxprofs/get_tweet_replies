@zappin_liberals @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Obama polled high too.  Same morons who elected Obama support assclown Trump.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul what about your hissy fit with your debate go trump watching trump Thursday
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Another 2% candidate attacking Trump not realizing he attacks the majority of American voters.
@TheLeadCNN @cbinflux @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump now if only he would get out of the race entirely, and take all the trumpbots with him
@geek_king @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul  Let's not throw the baby out w/ the bath water.  Hearts, minds and VOTES.
@cbinflux @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul there's no baby...  IMHO of course
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump is at 41%, do you even have a whole %?  Remember, his support is made up of ALOT of real ppl. #Trump
@BruceSalvage @TheLeadCNN Maybe because right wing doesn't automatically = racism or douchebaggery.
@BruceSalvage @TheLeadCNN And also right wing and DT have nothing in common
@BruceSalvage @TheLeadCNN I believe in researching the candidates. Rand Paul stands for freedom & small govt & fiscal responsibility.
@BruceSalvage @TheLeadCNN No, he didn't. He merely stated that PRIVATE businesses should be able to discriminate on any basis they choose
@TheLeadCNN @katiepack @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Conservative debates are always like that.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump don't support trump, but he's attacked Clinton's on rape allegations. exists because gop doesn't win
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump RAND I WAS STARTING TO THINK MAYBE YOU WERE NOT THAT BAD AND THEN YOU GO STUPID AGAIN
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul  ...don't forget puffery, bloviation, gesticulation, hyperbole, hasty generalization, misdirection, and intimidation.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Show some respect. Buy a comb !
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump 2% in the polls is silliness.
@knightofgood @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump show's how dumb the country is, no?
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump At least he had a good reason not to appear. Rand cried because he was bumped to JV
#Trump2016
@retired_coach @TheLeadCNN I would say the reverse is true: Rand had good reason; DT is just pissed that he can't dictate who moderates.
@jean_laclair @TheLeadCNN And Rands reason was what? He got bumped in polls to JV debate and got his feelings hurt..
@retired_coach @TheLeadCNN Polls that were done that earned him a podium were not counted. To accept the kiddie debate would have been wrong
@jean_laclair Betting my next check he won't be around after NH.
#Trump2016
@retired_coach Well, we'll have to see how it goes. I hope that you're wrong because I truly believe Rand is just what we need.
@jean_laclair We have a seat for you on the #TrumpTrain if things don't work out with Rand.
#IowaForTrump
@retired_coach Yowch. I appreciate the thought, but no amount of money could entice me!
@WhosGoneGalt @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump He's NOT on 2nd tier. He's on main stage cuz BabyTrump said no.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump couldn't agree with Rand more on this
@TheLeadCNN @ElaineFox @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  Crazy!  You are the low man on the totem pole!
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump problem is Donald exists because of ineptness of GOP. Trump has shut down Hillary sexism talk
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  And I won't be watching
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul The real fighter for freedom.
Lot's of ignorant ppl who like gov't money yelling.Rand Paul fights for you,knuckleheads
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump and, you know, INTEREST! Bye-Bye!
@TheLeadCNN @AngieBeakley @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @CNN ~Yes, but the World's heard about Trump: Who in the Hell has ever heard about you?
@GarretLebois @TheLeadCNN @AngieBeakley @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @CNN if u don't know rand Paul you are definition of low info voter
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump EVERY Candidate is talking about Trump right now!
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand's like a backseat driver.Thinks he's bigger than he is & irritates the guy who's really driving.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump When you skipped a debate Mister, don't remember why, but you weren't dragged through the mud were u?
@TheLeadCNN @IamMonicaRae @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand who?
@LarryKutcher @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump

You're killin' me, Smalls!
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I suppose you weren't missed when you didn't show up for a debate, but The Donald will be missed.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @CNN #boredom
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump why didn't u show up Paul???? What's ur rating 2% go away!
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump my boy Rand said  Charlatan 
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @CNN well said!
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul When U PUT America's SAFETY 1ST is NOT silly! IF U PUT Ur MONEY 2run IS NOT SILLY! @realDonaldTrump SACRIFIES 4USA!
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul when U will talk about security of America as  @realDonaldTrump than U shd talk. Go Donald! Make America great again!
@TheLeadCNN @DebraPianalto @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump 
More liberal BS from the big left soap opera station ... Communist News Network
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump In less than two weeks, you'll drop out of the race
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul #hypocrite You sure weren't missed @realDonaldTrump @CNN #Trump2016 #GOPDebate
@TheLeadCNN @Nancywillask @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand  is gay , why don't that come out
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @CNN Tell us what you really think, Rand!  Outstanding comments
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand know because they didn't miss him
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump it is funny how Rand is digging Trump but threw a hissy fit on the last debate and didn't show either
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump He'll be missed by at least 1 viewer because the other career politicos aren't getting it done
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump - Hope you have a good night. We won't be watching.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump-let me rephrase. How could anyone fault Paul for care for those from 3rd world countries?
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @CNN Rand Paul will be at the end which is where he belongs . Outside looking in is where he will be
@TheLeadCNN @barbarabanke @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump and lunacy.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump All of that, but also tens of millions of viewers.  You left that bit out.
@TheLeadCNN @daltonsbriefs @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump oh grow up
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump And no one missed you last time around, Rand. But for different reasons.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump ... All those things you mentioned show what the American public is all about! Lol
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Rand you won't be President come on..let the Democrats talk about Trump! Talk about YOU not Trump!
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump right...
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump this will only work againt him if hes not mentioned
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump-agreed. Trump wants power & to stroke ego. He's extremely unstable. Yesterday he needed 2mg IV Ativan
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Please explain difference in your strategy of skipping Undercard Event 2 prove your poll # point?
@MHVChampion @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul Boycotting on the basis of fairness is not the same as boycotting bec your manipulation failed.
@jean_laclair @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul You r correct Donald didn't think the manipulation by Fox News was fair. I mean moderator talking trash.
@MHVChampion @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul That wasn't what I meant, lol. But Megyn Fox, prob. acting on orders, conducted herself poorly.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Did you say that when you asked him for donation to do eye surgery on foreigners, not Americans?
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Actually he's brought reality into the room. Washington is a failure and you're part of it.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul A Chance for REAL candidates to debate REAL issues without the WWE Sideshow attraction hogging all the talk time.
@TheLeadCNN @realDonaldTrump Will be nice to hear a response that's other than, "Well, I'm up in the polls, blah, blah, blah, they all  me"
@beingbreanne @TheLeadCNN @realDonaldTrump I hear that, Breanne!
@GrnEyeBuzzard @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump 
Check yourself... Rand put forth a bill to block immigration from certain countries.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Sounds like Curly is a little resentful.
@DumDems @TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Says the crybaby who didn't show up because he couldn't hang with the big boys...lol
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump You're wrong Rand. You skipped a debate recently. Don't be a Hypocrite !!!
@Brad_D80 @TheLeadCNN He may be low in the polls, but he makes some good points in the debates. Also http://randpaul.com/issue/taxes 
@Brad_D80 Auditing the Fed, ending federal prohibition on marijuana, cutting military spending, his tax plan
@Brad_D80 also acknowledging that the 10th amendment exists
@Brad_D80 Paul says the states should decide whether to make marijuana illegal or not. Other candidates will force states to ban it.
@TheLeadCNN @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump tee hehe. Don't poke the bear, senator!
