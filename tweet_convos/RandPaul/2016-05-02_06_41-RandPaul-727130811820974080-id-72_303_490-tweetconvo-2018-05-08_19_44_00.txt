@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Time way over due to put that woman Hillary Clinton out of business. She's annoying and a liar.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Yeah,she'll apologize right after all the coal operators apologize for skirting regs and buying off politicians
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Coal mining and its jobs are obsolete. Help Kentucky move into the 21st Century.
