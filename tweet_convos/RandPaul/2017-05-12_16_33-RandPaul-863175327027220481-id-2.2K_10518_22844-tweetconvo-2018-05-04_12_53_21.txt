you knew who he was and what he would do when you voted to confirm him. You didn't care.
Not true. Means hes qualified, and rand believes as should be the case, presidents have the right to have their ppl in cabinet. Idiot
Somebody hacked your profile and put a loser flag in the avatar FYI.
nice subterfuge,when u know i am right. U r a petulant child with no knowledge of history,it seems. I pity minute brained ppl such as urself
I know they lost. Loser.
We have risen again, in the face of Gov't oppression once again, but will never forget the oppression we fought against.
Sounds like loser talk from a loser who reps a squad of losers. 0-1 LOL.
You are nothing but a petulant child without a brain. i pity you. Bless your little heart, you hateful, spiteful, anti liberty sad soul
I am releasing my statement: When the hell did you decide people that break the damn law are not responsible for their actions?
"Unfairly and disproportionately Incarcerated Minorities" Don't break the fucking law. How about that?
What Rand says is true. Blacks get caught w/drugs - they go to prison. My white sons were caught and literally only got a slap on the wrist.
Complete nonsense. Read statutes Max and Min penalties. Says nothing about skin color.But that aside the simple fix? DON"T BREAK THE LAW
It's not really about skin color as it is more about the lower class, who tend to be black minorities, who are being incarcerated.
**sigh**  Don't break the laws. Not that hard to grasp really.I break laws, I go to jail.
**sigh** You need to go back to read and try to understand my comments. You flat.out.don't.get it!
Often agree w/ U but be honest: More minorities commit crime. Better to face truth & improve kids opportunities especially w/education #MAGA
Actually, proportional to the population at large...we don't.  I'm guessing you have no black friends?
Ur ignoring Truth Watch 11:00 o'clockNews n any big city. Unfortunately there's plenty of crime committed by others also #TruthWillOut #MAGA
The kinds of "tough on crime" policies espoused by Sessions do not work. They fail spectacularly. There's hard data on this
Lived in NYC in 80's city was riddled w/ druggies. Twasn't safe. Giuliani saved city with BrokenWindowTheory & StopAndFrisk. ItWorked!#MAGA
Stop and Frisk didn't save the city. It aggressively racially profiled people. It's an embarrassing policy
It worked! 1990 went to NYC took bus to PortAuthority which was lined w/ StreetPpl It looked like Dante's Inferno bunch of WalkingDead #MAGA
....Jesus Christ.
YES THE POOR MINORITIES WHO R KILLING OUR COPS AND BURNING OUR TOWNS, BY ALL MEANS
Portugal has done what you have suggested and they've seen a decrease in crime and drug use
Senator ,sessions is an ignorant, racist, pathetic human ! The only way to deal with people like him is by removing all his power ! Try it
As a fellow conservative I agree.  Now, congress needs to act through legislation to correct this.
Thank you for standing up for what's right. Please actively call for an independent prosecutor for Trump if you haven't already.
Sessions is on the wrong side of history. If he can't figure that out, he needs to go.
Myby u should change the laws, but we don't want more crime - violent or not. Like I don't want to be robbed, even if I'm not shot or beaten
Supply rehab while in prison,  2 birds 1 sentence?  Also GED's. Drug abuse and lack of education are the basis of poverty address both.
AMEN to that, sir!  Locking 'em away has been proven to NOT work.
Problem is that sentences get plead downward, drug offenses include other violent crimes like murder and  assault. Sessions is right.
That statement is painted with a very broad stroke and is not true.
Good on you, Rand Paul, but you know it goes farther than that. Gotta keep those jails full for the private prison industry they're pushing.
That is sad. It' s all about the money - in the end 
Private Prison Associations probably spent a lot of money in last election
Big $$ 2 lobbyists.
For sure, & it sux!
...and if I am kind to bears they won't eat me!
That's the best thing I've heard you say in a long time. Please keep it up
This is the reason why many opposed his appt. Well, I'll hate to say they told you so.
Wrong again. This is why you are always on the outside.
Senator Paul recently a illegal went to jail for robbery sent. to 364 days got out killed 2 doctors because liberal judge didn't want deport
You voted "yes' to confirm Sessions. Thanks to you, medical marijuana users like myself will continue to be demonized. You're an accomplice!
The dealers need to be locked up! Heroine is killing hundreds of Americans every year. Users need help. This protects Americans.
Need to change drug laws, until then the law is the law.
Marijuana opens up your minds eye. 
Alchohol alters your mind state negatively. 

Ever wonder why one is legalized & the other isn't?
Haha
Sessions is an ignoramus. I can't believe the President can enjoy his small minded thinking. Rather like. "He's good, he isnt!" God Complex.
I'm so with you on this!! Finally you gave me something I needed to hear. I am in a clinic which includes therapy. We need this.
Hey Jeff , the 1980's called, they want their War on Drugs back
If you want to change the law -- change the law.
Don't EVER ask enforcement to subjectively enforce, it is unfair to everyone.
Isn't it enforcement's job to use discretion in enforcement? Cops and lawyers aren't robots and shouldn't be.
When it gets far enough, I hope citizens begin to wake up to their responsibility as jurors and nullify charges when a law is unjust.
Unjust laws need to be changed by voters and lawmakers.
Jurors have always walked their own road.
It is called discretion.
I agree, they do and should, citizens need to hold legislators accountable, but bad laws can stop getting enforced and go extinct.
I have ALWAYS believed in enforcing the spirit of the law. But I never got to choose the law.
That is where cops go bad!
Perhaps you should educate those in the inner cities that dealing drugs is a crime! Not turning a blind eye, drugs cause pain and suffering!
@OFDHILLARY2016  Absolutely.  The mentioned approach is in our nation's interest.  More helpful. Less costly. Long term solution.
I'm impressed, for once.
Like he said during his hearing confirmation, he's going to enforce the law on the books, change them if you don't. 
Sorry, but I disagree.. Commit the crime, do the time.. No free pass because you're an addict.
I don't often ever agree with a dude like you but you are right about this. This is sessions bone to for-profit prisons.
Maybe you shouldn't have voted for Jeff Sessions to be attorney general
All that vote means is that the apointee is technically qualified for the job.
You're a Republican. You're responsible for this whole mess. Give it up.
"You knew damned well I was a snake before you voted me in" ~Sessions.
This is wrong on so many levels. MMJ is bad? but zoma ,cocain fields they grow to sell to the pharmacy to make the drugs that's not a crime?
100% agree with #Dr.Paul
Drug dealers are responsible 4 selling my brother the drugs that killed him, lock them up 4ever! The drug addicts are the ones needing help
I respectfully disagree but I agree with you most times democracy is wonderful when it is used correctly
As the mother of a mentally ill, currently clean drug addict, I believe Sessions is an out of touch bigot. Get Ms. Harris to talk to him
Yes our African American youth should not be languishing in the jails wasting their lives away...
Just African American?  Last I heard, white america has an opioid problem.
Just saying.
With street rugs, crime is rampant and needs to be rehabilitated.  The eyes must be opened to the danger, arrest is warranted
Actually it's plea bargains bought in fear.  Sentences don't lock anyone up, it's a time scale.  Mandatory for all crime would end bargains.
The primary opiod users are white males (35-54) who have lost hope in the American Dream.
This statement is bullshit. You knew this was his view when you voted to confirm him
All that vote means is that the apointee is technically qualified for the job.
WRONG
So tell him why then.
Valid point, but we are in a war against America and it's future. If you are serving hell in weight, life is not enough.
They should put me on the commission
**when one of your children is murdered by a druggie who was let out after 3 days from a 12 month sentence what will be your ?s b?
This is totally disingenuous. The AG's intent is to attack drug TRAFFICKING, not recreational use or people in need of medical help.
Can they for once, Rep or Dem, not politicize everything?  Disingenuous statement.
Rand Paul is kind of like Ralph Nader, or even Michael Savage: sometimes, it's just ginned up to show their outlier/independent "status" 
Makes sense, I guess.  But still, one minute I love the guy, the next I'm scratching my head with the nonsense spewing from his mouth.
That's how I--& as far as I know, most people, feel. And I'm so conservative some of my positions are libertarian, like on drugs.
I hope you guys are right.. enforcing mandatory mins could accidentally sweep up a lot of people..
Really guy? You didn't see this coming? Perhaps you should have your eyes checked...
I disagree! These people do need to be locked up! Many do this to make money off those that do have an illness.  They need prosecution.
Both a Criminal justice and public health problem.Both departments should work together. What is a good mix of incarceration and treatment?
This is why you can never be @potus
SIMPLE-----IF YOU BRAKE THE LAW YOU GO TO JAIL??????
Ever hear the saying if you can't do the time don't do the crime!! Crime =Prison no matter what color you are.
I would be slightly more impressed if you hadn't voted to confirm him. You knew his background and intentions to start with. #nicetry
I have said for a long time now, Lock up the dealers! Mandatory in house treatment for the users,with therapy . 
1) You end all that by legalizing. Just like alcohol. 2) Amounts by law are so small you can get labeled a dealer easily.
That's when the law on hard drugs should be applied as a dealer, NOT the herb! I feel like ur speaking of.
Opioids are hard drugs. Addictive. Legal for Big Pharma to sell. How come they aren't in prison?
And the limit to be considered a weed dealer is quite small. Cops or courts can write you up with "intent to distribute" for even an Oz.
True in some states..
YOU VOTED FOR THIS
This embarrassing for you: https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00055 …
Don't break the law - don't go to jail. Real simple concept.
White or black, if you don't commit crime, you never have to worry about any sentence. Funny how that works.
People who commit 0 crimes face 0 jail time. Hard to feel sorry for criminals crying about sentencing. Obey the law, it's really not hard.
Good. They shouldn't be jailed for unable to pay fines.
We have been doing that 4 yrs with negative results. Lock up the dealers and traffickers 4 life as far as im concerned.
Dude I'm sorry but this is some hypocritical horse shit. Jefferson's eyes light up whenever he talks about jailing people for anything.
@ImstukHere Respectfully: U mention nanny state THE prob. How 2 get minority comm 2 dev. self empowerment? GOVT programs failed generations
1/ We can't just pull the rug out from under them, so it would not be an overnight process nor an easy one bc of generations of dependency.
Been waiting since days of  Great Society of the sixties. Govt. isn't the answer. Nor prison. Education and role models for success 
Agree!
Where are you GOP brethren on this? It's a disgrace what @jeffsessions is doing.
Twisted logic: drug dealer (black or white) sells drug and user  dies. drug dealer not responsible for the death?
troll
Wow. So well spoken for a Republican these days. And I agree. Thank you.
We have 3 decades worth of data showing increased jail sentences are ineffective for reducing drugs.
And I'm definitely not a liberal. I think both sides are full of it. And bought and paid for by big business.
lol you know I was being sarcastic with you right? I know you know just making sure.
I'm aware. Lol. 
Haha. Obviously I have a little ptsd from previous misunderstandings with friends.
Maybe if you golf with Trump again it will help.
On this, we agree.
And you voted to confirm him.
If only somebody could introduce legislation changing the law...
Yep
In as much as I appreciate and respect your statement, I have to ask u, did u seriously expect anything different? He's a certified racist
RAND, DRUGS ADDICTS MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO DO DRUGS SO SHUT UP --I DON'T IF THEY ROT IN PRISON
Looking at the responses to this I don't know how you weren't closer at being the nominee #weneedaPaul
How true!!
Statements are so "effective." # votesmatter #dobetter
aw, a statement - how brave
Yes! Thank you!
Justice enforces the law that Congress passes. If you want reform, get to work on it! Also, drug dealers/sellers aren't heath crisis cases.
Well, something I actually agree with you on. The gates of heaven have opened if only, barely an crack.
Got to give credit where it's due. He's right
You really disappoints me, Dr Paul. Disproportionally committing crimes has minorities disproportionately incarcerated.
I disagree with you on 90% of issues but on this you're spot on. Get after Sessions, you have the left on your side.
Yet you are a Republican and a tepidly worded letter is all you can muster.
You knew he was a snake before you voted him http://in.You 
And you will do nothing other than release weak statements. Cause you are a crazy con man like your nut bag father.
Do your job and demand an investigation
Locally you are right. Federally the amount trafficked and the violence that accompanies traffickers is National problem.
Absolutely, the sentient response to Session's idiocy.
Hey quit your fascist party.
Great....but how about we just get rid of sessions?
Totally agree, Senator, but you knew this when you voted for him.
1. Sessions record clearly showed these tendencies yet you Voted for him! 2. You & GOP talk about the corrupt bs & Do Nothing
why'd you vote to confirm this racist piece of shit?
Agree! Thank you
Minoritiesneed job opportunities- shut the 'dam* Border!!! That will cut the drugs. 
I don't always agree with you, but you are dead on correct here! 
Mandatory minimum is wrong.  This not just a drug problem but injustice for bad laws.
@24baseballReed EXACTLY!!!
Thank you for standing up to the oft-misplaced "law and order" ideology.
@ggreenwald Where is that opium coming from? Drone-pounded Afghanistan!
Republicans want this. If black and brown people are in jail, they can't vote. And for-profit prisons need their slave labor to make profit.
People who break the law go to jail. Thanks
AND???
@ConradMBlack then change the law senator
Thank you Rand Paul....
I disagree with Rand Paul. If we treat drug use as an illness who gets the bill? Taxpayers that's who!
true, but overcrowding prisons for drug use seems is also a big cost to taxpayers
I do agree with you in the prison issue.  I'm honestly not sure how it should all be handled but I do know I don't like the disease idea
Senator Rand Paul. Thank you for your comment. I'm proud to call you a fellow American. I'm certain your family is proud of you, too
With all due respect you can't believe rehab or slap on wrist will work for hard core traffickers?!
Jeff Sessions reactionary, racist worldview has been on full display for decades. You voted to confirm. Empty words.
Shit. I agree with @RandPaul  on something. Times are weird.
Sessions lied @ confirmation-what jail term should he serve?
This guy wants to repeal Obamacare - completely. But reasonable when it comes to drug addiction. What one hand giveth the other taketh away.
Or we could just encourage them to OD and be done with their sorry asses.
I hope you fight this. The Commonwealth of Ky cannot afford to go backward. Neither can the rest of the Nation. Americans dying in record #s
But remember there's no reason for Repubs to investigate a Repub Potus...right?
Your words don't mean anything if you won't push for meaningful reform. Your statement doesn't mean squat.
Yet you continuously praise and do not hold accountable his appointer Trump!
But you still confirmed him anyway. You guys with your statements. Way to stand up for the country.  How about doing something for once?
Someone decided to keep private jails in buissnes so it's only to expect that he will wanna to have people to meet quota's .
lol
How progressive of u. Too little, too late. Unethical @GOP lawmakers like u let the racists run the show -- @jeffsessions #Bannon & @POTUS
Sessions actions could easily be interrupted as racism.
Im sorry, you dog whistled that "minorities" are the source of the problem? WTF
Your statement to Sessions might net you a few points with your base, but Sessions will wipe his arse with it and the Constitution, anyway.
Then why did you vote to confirm him, you stupid fuck?!
That elf is gonna be pissed
Shit...I've never agreed with @RandPaul - the world is very confusing right now
Your idea would make us like Canada. Shoot up clinics and spun out burnt out druggies wandering the streets. No thanks! We need to be harder
Wrong. Especially when it relates to hard drugs & dealers of cocaine or heroin always have a violent record.
I agree but the congress should pass new laws. The Justice department should not arbitrarily make those decisions. Back to basics
Why the hell did you confirm him? Damn you Senator I thought you were sincere but this is simply a disingenuous Tweet!
Rand Paul: the stopped clock of the GOP
Rand Paul good for that statment great response.
I told you that was the way he thought. You voted to confirm, now you also own this.
This is good, but you are ok with the Russians involved in our govt?
So now you acting like you had no idea who Sessions was you knew because it came out in the hearings but you we're all hung up on party.
You voted to confirm Sessions. You knew he wasn't a good man. You share shame for this. #TheResistance
still looking to be president. If Trump can finagle it, anyone can, amirite?
..Or you could change the LAWS. 'cmon Man.
You're a smart person absolutely. Do you know these laws were created in part by minority leaders that saw what the dealing/use was doing?
Do you ever actually get something done
I never thought I would agree with @RandPaul , but on this I do!
Just checked: Yeah, you voted both to confirm Sessions — *and* to silence Elizabeth Warren calling out his racism.
Today I released the following statement in response to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. 
Sen Paul- God please stand up, please be on the right side of history here & in all things ....remember when you believed in Ethics?
Eliminate the profit in incarceration you eliminate this scenario
Can you stand up to these doofuses as opposed to just to the party line please
Well really like this statement wish you other views were more palatable
I bet he is not in favor of locking up young white heroin, meth, and oxy addicts in NH, MA, WV, etc.
#bipartisanissue
Conversely many criminals off scott free as sympathetic prosecutors decline to charge them if 3rd strike
That's great of you to say. But what are you actually going to DO?
I don't always agree with you but on this issue I could not agree more. 
Common sense may help.....
.@RandPaul -- so, to deduce... if it unfairly and disproportionately incarcerated NON-minorities, it wouldn't be a problem. PLEASE RESIGN!
The problem is opiods.  People get hooked, abuse them, get cut off, then turn to heroin. People who do hard core drugs (not Marijuana) 1/
Self medicate due to mental health issues.  Treat drugs like alcohol abuse. Possession shouldn't be same as manufacturing.  Legalize it!!
Sorry sir but drug dealer Purposely break the Law. . . Mandantory for them Public health options for users who Really want off the drugs. .
Agreed. More than half our country is on drugs. Jail them all?
ha ha ha ha ha. That's bloody rich. Jeff sessions a racist?  Who could have guessed?
I dunno, Rand.  You knew he was a snake when you confirmed him.
I'm surprised your surprised.
We agree on 1 thing but too bad you voted to confirm him knowing his history on this matter. #CantForget WontForget
Hello? Do you hear only what you want to? Evidence was clear as to who Sessions is and how he'd govern. If you're shocked now, hold tight..
Well said future POTUS
And you continue to enable it, when the majority of Americans hate every policy and most nominees. But hey, keep making BS statements.
Has the law or those who violated law resulted in this"disproportion"?  If the law change it. Thats your job. If not law address the issues
Hey, you knew what you were getting. #sosad
Why did you vote for him then? #vichygop
Bravo!!!!
You voted to confirm Sessions.
You broke it, you bought it.

Maybe you should consult Aqua Buddha on how to atone.
There's never been a war on anything a lot of talk a few people get caught in the cure there's more money in the disease, nobody likeschange
Agreed.....
I don't agree with u on a lot but  agree on this. Thanks for your leadership on this issue. Plz continue to fight on this! 
I disagree with you on this issue.Drug abusers do need help. If they refuse it and commit crimes against innocent people. Serious jail time
I think Paul is authentic but I disagree.  Addicts wind up in prison for crimes other than drug possession.  Dealers should die in prison.
I think you are a horrible person but dammit I agree with you on this one.
You turned a blind eye to his bigotry already.
