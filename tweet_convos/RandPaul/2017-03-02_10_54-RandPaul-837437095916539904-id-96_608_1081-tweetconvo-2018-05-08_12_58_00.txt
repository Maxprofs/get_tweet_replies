We the People want to know! Something smells about this!
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul Republican in fighting is sickening.  What happened to transparency and TRUST?
For what?? So he can hand it over to the Democrats???
@GrainOfSands @RandPaul @WHAS11 The irony of a Congressman with lifelong taxpayer funded healthcare working to make sure u won't
Yep! That's our CONgress in action!
should've fixed the aca. Made it work.
Their new idea will hurt people. Not help them. Highly sad. Like Trump.
are they going to pass the bill without letting anyone read it? Hmmm reminds me of Republican outrage in '09.
Patience please.  You will get a copy to review before you have to vote.
Better the hell not be. Get Feds out of my healthcare. Allow competition, do tort reform, send Medicaid to the states to admin
The true is that Sen @RandPaul is overrated. His father is more smart.
- love Rand! it ain't the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog! Sic 'em Rand!
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 Ryan's rinos still in charge
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 maybe wait till bill is completed. Then supposed 2 b revealed 4 marked up adjustments
secret health care plan?  Secret passage and then,  "Surprise America!"  Is that the plan?
@s_rsantorini630 @WHAS11 Easy peasy: Just put 45's name on it in neon lights and he will like it.
Not at all. It's simply, #DonTCare
rand Paul is my hero
I agree 100% with Rand Paul!
You are at War fool, Pick a side or step aside.
@POTUS the new replacement ACA is not ready to be released to the public yet, Whose side are you on? ....
did you switch teams?  You looked like a damn fool going door to door with your copy machine looking for it. 
Hold your ground Paul, we want our choices back, beware @GOP
@TheTweetwit take a look here
I can't decide about Rand Paul. Government should have never gotten into the health care business.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 Read it, not the same BS with the establishment Politicians
@KeithOlbermann @chrislhayes @SpeakerRyan  Surprised? Haven't worked for 7 years!! Why start now!!!! WATCHING
You sir, got played!
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN ONLY HAS SOUND BITS OF COMPLAINTS - HE HAS FOOLED ME INTO THINKING HE CARED - AWFUL
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 @SpeakerRyan -NO ACA lite, NO Cadillac tax, NO MANDATE...Period.
Go Rand Go!
How the fuck is this our government? Are we 12? What is happening??
keep fighting for the people not the party thank you
find the ACA revision is it so bad that u can't even get copy ? So much for unity
@JBaker31826004 @RandPaul @WHAS11
  It would be better to put a match to it and have nothing , have not had care since passed
.@chriswnews .@RandPaul
.@WHAS11 Btw- unlike most people encouraging this foolishness, I actually voted for Paul…my mistake perhaps?
.@chriswnews .@RandPaul Rand needs to stop acting like an ass. No reason to release unfinished draft for Libs/media to lose their minds over
.@POTUS @chriswnews @RandPaul @WHAS11 VERY SUSPICIOUS. What are they hiding. Please VETO if no FULL review by all. No O'care Lite/No Mandate
supporters of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump expect a full repeal and replace We #StandWithRand not @SpeakerRyan
If you can't make them see the light, make them feel the heat. @TheDemocrats  @GOP
Found it. Now all you have to do is draft the legislation. http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/ted-cruz-obamacare-repeal-214854 …
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 the swamp is holding on with their lie
life
Thank you Sen. Paul Information  should not B kept from Americans That's how we got OCare
do they have to "pass it to find out whats in it"?
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 keep on it Senator Paul. I'm with you. Ryan is a snake
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 Rand Paul should be listened to. He know more about the ACA then all his peers period. LISTEN!!
I hope that @justinamash Rally's to his aid.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @GOP We The People don't want #ACA ObamaCare lite. Complete R & R!
keep fighting! Remind your colleagues #RepealOrBeReplaced
Senator Paul needs to do his job and ask Sessions to resign
were you going get the money for this?
He's a Senator, not a House member. He has no "right" to that bill nor anonymous leakers.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 Why?
What's unacceptable is your theatrics and attempts to divert attention away from #TrumpRussia. You're a joke.
.

    KEEP THE FIGHT SENATOR PAUL.
 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BEHIND YOU.

.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 Why can't Rand Paul see it? What the secrecy? I'd like to see it!
I really home he runs again in 2020
they don't have a bill. They can't get a consensus in the House among republicans. Obviously. anywho Go Cats!!
is right..use Obamacare repeal bill already voted on.. @speakerryan @tgowdysc @repjeffduncan @whas11 @seirra75
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul full repeal and replace only
You have to pass the bill to know what's in it. Isn't that SOP in DC?
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 Rand Paul has had bill ready for sometime & been refining it Would behoove  republicans to look
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 Perhaps they have to 'vote on the bill before they can read the bill'?
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11  Yo!  #Where'stheBill?
#StandWithRand
do away with after repeal keep out mandate and Cadillac tax!!
call your congressional representative demand a no vote on Ryan care!
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul @WHAS11 RAND PAUL DONT BACK DOWN!! PRAYING FOR YOU. JESUS IS NEAR WATCHING OVER YOU.
Paul isnt ever happy about anything.
if it's true that penalties go to Insurance Company... major party fail! #Swamp #Crooks
I agree with Rand Paul.   Lets see the new ACA replacement bill before it is voted on
Unfortunately once media gets hold of its We r screwed.
Weelll I keep telling you.. Hope you listen & start to #resist
He was my 1st choice
What he going to do if he get it Nothing but he knows his will not pass because his buddy don't want his His us better
I support Rand Paul.
