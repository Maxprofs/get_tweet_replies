@FoxBusiness @RandPaul  YES  #StandWithRand
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul We need to legalize all drugs. Prohibition just makes the problem worse and creates more problems.
@shicks_sam @FoxBusiness -  Democrats vs Ron Paul, who was right? Ron Paul on Morton Downey Jr. - 1988 https://youtu.be/GCxDrfs4GtM  via @YouTube
@_JeremyR_ @FoxBusiness @YouTube Drug prohibition thought hasn't changed much since then. Same authoritarian mentality.
@FoxBusiness @SuskySFR @RandPaul

War on drugs has failed. It's caused gun crime. It's allowed Gov't to usurp rights. End it

#StandWithRand
@FoxBusiness @Youth4RandPaul @RandPaul he is right. I totally agree. #RandRally #StandWithRand
@FoxBusiness @RichRagamuffin @RandPaul YES!!! #StandWithRand
@FoxBusiness @Lonestarmomcom @RandPaul My doc thinks ALL street drugs should be legal. That would effectively end 10% of the population.
@FoxBusiness @ChristianCalls1 @RandPaul UInfortunately, this issue is way to confused and gets inter-dimensional.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul absolutely agree. He's an eye surgeon. He knows something about its medical use
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul YES!! Legalize it, don't criticize it
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul of course!
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul  It's not a matter of agreeing or not. What he stated is a fact. It's like asking if I agree I'm posting on twitter.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Given our out of control debt. Yes I agree with Rand. The war on drugs has been wasteful an ill-advised.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul I #StandWithRand yes yes yes
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul @rosecitymatt
@FoxBusiness @MariaBartiromo @RandPaul Sad but true. Not on purpose, this is the sad result of a terrible policy.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul haha, I see what you did there....well played. Wink wink.
@FoxBusiness @MariaBartiromo @RandPaul from a retired metro cop. Absolutely!
@FoxBusiness @BaruchSFR @RandPaul yes I agree...!!!!
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Absolutly!
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Yes. Stop the war on drugs. Prohibition is a failure (like always)
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul It should have been changed 3 decades ago.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Very definitely. All we've been doing is waste money, including for supporting prisoners.
@FoxBusiness @SFR_UMD @RandPaul AGREE  make government smaller
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul we need sweeping #CJreform, changing drug policy but that is only part of the answer. Colson Commission has answers.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes absolutely
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yup
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes!
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes!!!!! Stand with Rand!
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Entirely, we as a country waste more time, effort, and money to hamstring our selves with unenforceable laws.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul 100%agree
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul clearly.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Yep
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Yes he is 100% correct
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul 
I agree we need a better drug policy. What is done now has not worked and will not. All that money wasted.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul #StandwithRand #VetsforPaul #RandRally #RandRising
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes! It is a waste of money and destroying generations for minimal reasons.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes I agree.  There's a lot of money being made from prison "investors" at the taxpayers' expense.  #RandRally
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul 
One of many examples as to why Rand will win a general election, the GOP better hope he wins.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul 110%
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul my gov't spent crazy amounts of money on this drug war and all I got is this crappy Police State
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul so what? Jails are meant to be dark.
@FoxBusiness @Clarknt67 @RandPaul I don't agree with him much, but he's the only Republican that makes sense sometimes! #Bernie2016
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Yes
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul hell yes I agree.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul it is past time to look at criminal #justicreform & the #warondrugs. #StandWithRand #GOPDebate
Yes. The government does not own our bodies. @FoxBusiness @RandPaul
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul, so if we legalize drugs who hear wants to work next to a Meth head or operated on by a surgeon on heroin
@MidKidSteward @FoxBusiness @RandPaul Why would that happen? If you go to work intoxicated, you get fired. Easy to solve.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul selling drugs is a colorless crime black on black killing each other should be the concern
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes. We do. It's a state issues not a federal one.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Yes, Marijuana should be legalized and taxed like Alcohol.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul absolutely! Time to end it. It goes against basic concepts of liberties and expands the power of the government.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul HES A GAWD
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes, end the nanny state.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Absolutely. America is about freedom. Marijuana prohibition is just as despicable as when alcohol was if not more.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul 100% agree.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul uhm yes, pretty much a no brainer
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Yes, we need to change drug policy, but not necessarily in the way he suggests.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul drug policy is a don't care.  Really we got bigger fish to fry
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Abosuletly, As usualy Rand is on point
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul who doesn't agree? The war on drugs is an abysmal failure and unconstitutional
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul I REALLY don't think drugs are the forefront of the problem here Rand. Fix the Great Society first.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul What has the war on drugs brought us?  Trillions in debt and drugs are more prevalent than ever.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Yes. We need less people in prison for ridiculous offenses and less of our money going to drug trade in other nations
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Yes, we need to encourage abstinence in African American communities, not leniency!
@FoxBusiness @MariaBartiromo @RandPaul Yes.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul the war on drugs needs to start with a new American moral compass! No family leadership equals drugs, crime, poverty
@Tdpt1T who's moral compass are you going to use?
@Zack_Vannatter almost any except the current administration's would be a good start.
@Tdpt1T when it comes to the drug war they're using the same "moral compass" Nixon used when he started it
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes! #randagainstthemachine #standwithrand2016
@FoxBusiness @pye @RandPaul yep
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes!! The 40 year old strategy for the war on drugs is not working. We need new ideas.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul tons of drugs crossing southern border every day!
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul I agree. #StandWithRand
@FoxBusiness @MariaBartiromo @RandPaul Sorry, watching Trump.;)
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul that was a perfect answer. Wow. Very impressive
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Yes I agree! #StandWithRand
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes - new drug policy needed.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul Malarkey
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul I thought question was about body cameras?
@Lwy1Warner @FoxBusiness @RandPaul he answered the question. Yes he supports.
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul yes #RandRally
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul I don't support pro drugs
@tomack24 @FoxBusiness @RandPaul How about pro freedom?
@FoxBusiness @RandPaul it was aimed at them that's your problem
