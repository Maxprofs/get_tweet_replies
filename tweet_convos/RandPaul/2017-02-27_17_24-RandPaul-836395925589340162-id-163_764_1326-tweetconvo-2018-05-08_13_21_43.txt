Joining my friends @SenMikeLee and @tedcruz tonight to say: no Obamacare lite. #FullRepeal
@NetworksManager @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz please keep fighting
@potus Stand strong & DO NOT pass RYAN's disastrous & deceptive plan. Please!
#ncgop @IngrahamAngle 
End of the day Meadows will cave on tax credits. 
One visit to WH was all it took
I'm quite interested in how you plan to replace the 56,000 jobs that KY would lose...
Curious -56,000 jobs?
How does this relate to ACA?
People in rural areas shld not b paying for healthcre for thse in wealthy cities
Do NOT cave, gentlemen!!!!!
I support President Trump's national mandate of cost cutting access to affordable care 4 all.
If you aren't mandated to buy healthcare, who pays your medical bills when you get sick ?
no penalty tax, go bk to indiv insur, collect for unpaid hosp/med via RE tax by county
WOW  GO 4 IT @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz dems need 2 release a single payer plan for all GOP plans to be compared to @DNC
Want to see that?
Easy-check out the VA-
B.Sanders-oversight committee
teared up cause dont want ppl get help & know they will have affordable access to care as do now w ACA apparently
@NetworksManager @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz - JC - just shut up and get it done - I'm sick of politicians talking
you guys are on the right track
Because popul in cities is more thn rural, a ins pkg local makes more sense w/out of state op
So what happens to the millions of people who lose their coverage?
GuessUGuysKnowProgressivesAreNotGoing2vote4UAnyway
The PeopleWhoDo-WantUn-ACA
FullyRepealed
@potus Ryan's proposal is wrong free mkt no fed in healthcare
hold your ground! @SpeakerRyan needs to be put in his place.
Please don't buckle to the RINO pressure.
Kind of like the 2015 budget Markt? This just another scam. You'll get something then fold.
You do know that your constituents are against this repeal, right?  You're out in 2018.
"Every tax, every mandate, every regulation needs to go." Fixed it for you.
Airlines offer insurance on ea air/tkt, do same for those needing out of state tvl health ins
@club4growth @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz  then why are u still talking?? Get that #goldenpen out and start writing!! Geze
@realetybytes @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz Japan has healthcare for 100% of it's people. They pay half of what we do!
ea state/county offers ins pkg w/one time purchase of out of state tvl as not all tvl
@NetworksManager @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz Then I suggest you all work your butt off to get the 60 votes.
this is all bull shit excuse, go nuclear, repeal and replace properly right now
. Will YOU insure the 10-15M who lose coverage if your intentions are met @RepMarkMeadows @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz? Didn't think so.
@1catherinesiena @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz There's also,the boards,counsels,guidelines,regulations,etc that need to go
U guys R bad @ math:3MM more votes for Hillary,11MM more votes for Sen Dems.
.@RepMarkMeadows @sartoris1960 @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz I do, as well.
@mamba1911 @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz DO IT! 
#Obamacare has #RatingSystemDeathPanel.I'll testify.Try #Bastard @BarackObama 4 #Murder
so all your rich pals can get a tax break; American deaths will be on your hands. sleep well
for profit insurance companies do not work. They will never have our best interests in mind.
how noble of you to take away our health care while you have some of the best in the world.
we've been calling & emailing, but u clearly have not heard us. We want #UniversalHealthCare
Rep Meadows, how about supporting your constituents instead of your friends? Listen to us.
Haven't you heard your constituents? We don't want to lose our health care.
HELL YEAH
we the people demand you guys give us the same health insurance that we provide for you..
What is it about the poor and middle class getting a break that makes you so uncomfortable?
@TheRightMelody @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz Thank you for your support of #FullRepeal  #NoExcuses
You need nicer friends.
@SovCam @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz  Is there a more humane program where people do not die because they have no care?
Health care has become a corporate PR program
 Do people need a doctor if a cold?
Corporate healthcare, Pharma has an agenda to promote their products
you should all be ashamed.  People before corporations!  We need health care in the USA
No. It doesn't. You aren't listening to us.

We pay for YOUR coverage. Fix ACA!
Thank you Sir, a 2,700 hundred page bill passed without reading it is Treason Against US All!
ACA repeal would give millionaires an avg tax cut of $50,130 and multi-millionaires an avg tax cut of $197,340
Thank you for your strong stand and leadership on this very important issue
Will you be attending all the funerals for people with preexisting factors after we lose ACA?
what a foolish thing to say. proof you don't give a damn about your constituents. #ACA
Please, please convince my IN Reps of this. Theyre all squishes
ACA has saved lives...your "repeal and replace" will be a disaster for us all.
@FreedomWorks @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz Factor our transit reform for #healthcarefunding w/ #Veteransonpatrol. No Uber.
@LibertyUSA1776 @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz thanks from those of us who had 3x price hike with Obamacare

.@RepMarkMeadows @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz thank u all for representing your district & states so well. God bless you all! #fullrepeal
Every thing is telling you to be careful.  Devise something to take its place.
Wear heavy shoes so you can come down hard on this. Thanks.
#RepealObamacareNow #badLaw 'O' in obama = zero.
look at your approval ratings. It will be good to see the Republican Party dead
y'all need to pay for your own health insurance, no free taxpayer ride 4 U anymore.
y'all had 8years & no plan? Losers!  You will B in 2018.  Enjoy ur last few months in office.
you're all idiots, especially Mark Meadows.  Try telling that to the uninsurable.
Your replacement proposals will kill the GOP. Trump voter - Check out Germany.
make sure everyone let's John Boehner know,the town crier
I could not help notice you put businessman first on your profile and not representative.
we have your back TN04
Repeal the insurance the Senate has or offer the same to the people you want off ACA.
Second & raise you one: No two sets of laws about ANYTHING. One country One law.
The American people have made it clear that you should improve the #ACA, not gut it #SaveACA
great then also get .@CAIRNational out of our government
I hope my @RepRatcliffe & @JohnCornyn  support them too !
And for the thousandth time, REPLACE IT WITH WHAT? Only one answer: single-payer healthcare.
your spewing & "plan" is diabolical & despicable- We won't forget #notmyrepublicanparty
you all need to go
TAKE IT AWAY TOMORROW HOSS AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TO @GOP NEXT ELECTION @nytimes @CNN
Yes, we all know you jerk each other off. Now let's talk about #TrumpRussia.
don't be ridiculous! get smart! @SenSchumer @CoryBooker @SenatorMenendez ...set them straight
Dishonest and cruel.
Friends? More like "honor among thieves" as if it exists. #RobertMercer
@SCF @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz It must #repeal100% Replace after! Uncovered can go clinics/ER like doing now! No diff
And every one of you will be voted out next election. The @GOP is a #death panel
how about if we call it the affordable care act? Is that better?
Ya'll are making a huge  miscalculation !! Best to listen to your peeps back home!!
YES. If you repeal, might energize libs and u might lose. Don't repeal and guaranteed 2 lose
When you give up your bloated taxpayer funded health plan you can talk.  #resist.
I keep asking because you all remain silent: Why do you hate America and her people so much?
This is the one promise that if broken will cost the Republicans majorities in 18 elections
do they vote for you?  A lot of voters do not want a repeal. You owe loyalty to voters not friends.
Dismal understanding of healthcare. As usual the PEOPLE are the last thing on ur minds.
your friends don't pay your salary,you'd do good to remember that
I support all of you giving up your fancy government health care. You all are disgusting!
when you paying for those who can't it will always be expensive. write off to one is a tax
EVIL! VOTE THEM OUT! You want us to die.
NO YOU NEED TO GO!  FIRE MEADOWS!
Sure - but what happens to the working uninsured?
people will suffer & die - shame on you all
ACA mandate Repealed NOT Replaced. Not Law of Land. Pvt Ins. Just like car
because who cares if 20 million Americans lose healthcare as long as you a$$ holes keep yours
#FullRepeal as promised.
you guys are bad at selling this to actual people. pls get Trump to give you some pointers.
people aren’t itching for ideological victories. they want healthcare that works. pls realize
@speakerryan #FullRepeal. #NoExcuses  "Replacement" not needed. Just get govt out of the way.
But you got nothing to replace. Easy to oppose.
Be a little patient. It's only been 39 days! I've been without insurance 3 years…
For 28 years I was able to afford my own. I'm willing to do that.
Actually it's been six year, not 39 days.
@speakerryan said 2 weeks ago that Obamacare would be repealed last week. What's the holdup?
Sorry that is NOT what Americans want.  #RepealAndReplaceGOP starts with y'all.  #SaveACA
.@RepMarkMeadows @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz primum non nocere
Try supporting your constituents first! Your so call friends don't reside in your district
honestly hope you have an elderly person in all of your families die because of this.
the people support you sir! #FullRepeal of #Obamacare we must act quickly!
without fail it has got to go fast yall need to work faster.  We must act fast get it done.
why because it says the word " Obama" and provides care to human-beings?
totally agree no one should ever have to pay for Healthcare again
Americans will not thank you for your anti-healthcare position. The GOP is a ship of fools!
not anti healthcare its anti big government
how about looking out for your constituents regardless of party affiliation?
without fail it has got to go fast yall need to work faster.  We must act fast get it done
Yes!
#StandWithRand
maybe you should support your constituents and expand Medicare to cover everyone. #easy @RandPaul @SenMikeLee @tedcruz
And we will do all we can to see you go with it.
Thanks to ALL OF YOU!  Obamacare needs to go,,100%!
