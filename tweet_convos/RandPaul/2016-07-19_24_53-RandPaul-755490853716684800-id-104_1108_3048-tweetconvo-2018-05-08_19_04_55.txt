@DavidIRamadan There's a whole convention full of blind people who needed you in Cleveland. #NeverTrump
--he tried, they didn't want to see
You should be the GOP candidate, end of discussion
@tgradous Did you perform her surgery?
he certainly did
You would make a fine president Dr Paul.
you the man!
another better choice for Republican nominee giving his talents to serve the "least of these"
That's fantastic! If we had single payer Rita wouldn't have needed your charity and you would get paid. #SinglePayer #Medicare4All
Assumes all the things Capitalism has brought us. Have you seen hospitals in UK? I have.
Have you seen people dying because they can't afford healthcare in the richest nation in the world? I have.
"Can't afford" is a relative term. I grew up poor, but my parents prioritized insurance.
Dr Paul: You need to see Hillary. Seems her eyes keep bugging out whenever she tells a big fat lie!
@WhittyMike God bless you Rand
Well god bless you Mr Rand Paul have a great day......
You are a great man & a true Role Model! #RandIsAwesome #RandPaul #RNCinCLE

@noprezzie2012 Just one more reason why I love Rand Paul.

@ReedRobertson That's awesome!
@gcamp4 technology is wonderful !!proud for her!! 
Amazing. Well done, Senator.
From a prior surgical nurse, its great to see you in the OR. I'm a bit jealous.
Cataracts? @RandPaul
You truly have a servant's  Thank you for what you do God Bless
@MZHemingway Such charitable work is indeed important but bragging about it exhibits a poor model of humility for our children.
@Torchie123 Fan-frikintastic
God richly bless you for your dedicated and devoted service to humanity. May you never lack in anything that that you you desire.
Aw.  Bless her!!  And bless you too! #RandPaul
God bless you Dr. Paul
You are awesome Rand Paul!!!
Is there a surgery to open the eyes of Hillary supporters to her corruption and lawlessness? #Benghazi #clintonemails
I think that'd call for brain surgery.
more presidential than Hillary or Trump.
Are you doing phaco or ecce? Either way, good for you! I worked with Vision Outreach for many years. There are many in need.
thank you sir. Will you please come to the Connecticut Mission of Mercy?  We give pro bono dental care to people for the weekend
@nschroeder_13 thanks nick that just made me cry
@TheRickWilson Y'all had that & you went with #Trump? #SMDH. A. Intelligent doctor or B. Egomaniac fascist? Let's go with #B.
what a blessing, thanks Dr. Paul and thanks for sharing!
#MakeAmericaSeeAgain
Great job, Dr. Paul.
Nice one, Doc
This is what #publicservice looks like!
You're the best Dr. Paul.  Wonderful.
could you take my case please?
Don't dislocate your shoulder patting yourself on the back.
Good work Dr. Thats why we love you. We know you are a good man, and an eminent physician. God bless you Dr.
@TheRickWilson you should do that full time.
wish you were our president. But giving sight to the sightless is a close second  #ifyouhaveto
finally something uplifting I needed this wee bit break from all the horror and drama that drowns us everyday!
@McAllisterDen You are a good man Senator Paul. God bless you.
@TheRickWilson Yes!!!!
@TheRickWilson !
I greatly admire your willingness to help other people so unselfishly. I can see why the people of Kentucky love you so much.
Yet another heartless Republican - this woman now cannot claim the blind persons tax credit! GOP War on Women!
If I ever have eye problems again, I'll know who to call :)
We really miss seeing you on a regular basis! Thanks for ALL you do
@McAllisterDen 

Well done Doc!
go go patriot rand !
thank you!!!
Wow bravo dr. @RandPaul
Good job Doc!  Now, if you could get our government to see like that, that would be a great surgery!!
can
Thank you for being a bright spot. A little prouder to be a Kentuckian today.
Beautiful. God bless you.
Hope you didn't break your arm patting yourself on the back.
America blew it not electing your dad and not giving you a chance.@RonPaul
ophthalmology is an awesome place to work sir.
.@RandPaul You are good man Dr. Paul!!
that's awesome 
@MattMackowiak Matthew 6:3-4  http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-3.htm 
@jumpn_jack_fLsh he does it all
@bloodless_coup wish he was accepting GOP nom at this point
#StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
#RNCinCLE STAT
I admire you; but you should be attending the RNC in support AGAINST Hillary. Time to get on board.
God Bless You!  This is what it's all about.
@h_tuomey @CameraLad1 @rydurant97 This man is a true hero.
So refreshing whenever I see acts of service and kindness. Thank you for sharing. So happy for her & everyone you helped.
thank you Dr Rand Paul!
Nice job, Doc.  Keep it up

You're a good man. Keep up the good work in preventing government from doing its part to make pro-bono surgeries unnecessary

You are one great guy
may God bless you and your family that God may use other men and women to help them.
GO RAND GO. WOW. YOU R THE MAN. DAMN U TRUMP FOR DEMEANING YOU!!!!
While I'm not at the Republican National Convention.
to be able to do what you do is a true blessing from God.
rand, you're too good to be a politician.
Like father, like son.
can you please be president
God Bless You.  I really respect you.
hope u could feel pain of kids being tortured and turned blind by indian army in indian occupied kashmir
Never give up your skills as a doctor. Thank you for your service.
It's odd to think that you're a politician.. heh nonetheless we love you, God bless you!
You were too good for us, too good to be president... :'(
you're for boners as well?
I think Bill Cosby may need some help
