i love the sound of that Dr. Paul. limited, constitutional government.
you are a very classy man.i hope you run again in 2020
I'll agree with you as long as the people don't get shafted, as what usually happens when it come to the government.

@GoTrumpWin looking forward to your run for POTUS! In mean the time President Elect Trump will point us in the right direction!
We're draining this swamp, one way or another.
This Libertarian wishes you well with this challenging task.
@RepThomasMassie @SenMikeLee @justinamash @realDonaldTrump

Thank you so much, Sen. Paul for never joining with #NeverTrump. You are a man of honor.
I like Rand, but wish Rand supported Trump harder.
congrats on your reelection.
This country is controlled by a group of parasitic psychopaths.  Stand with President Trump to wrest control from (((them))).
Unless you're LGBTQ+, right?
You are lying; you will pass an unconstitutional bill of attainder against @PPact any chance you get!
@Skytroop16s1p congrats to you as well Senator. Keep being our eyes and ears in DC!

Please influence @realDonaldTrump with your #CivilLiberties views!
Let us begin to practice #highcalibercitizenry and each of us rise by celebrating our diversity and sharing our gifts and talents!
Read cautiously Mr. Paul. We the people spoke loudly. Don't become irrelevant. We need you.
first, please make sure he actually reads the Constitution...
Trump doesn't stand for limited const gov. He's a fascist and you MUST obstruct him as hard as you did Obama. Don't sell out.
@SockyNoob I'm still disappointed that you endorsed a national socialist for POTUS.
Congrats on your win!  You are a fine man of integrity humility and character.
Hope Trump will be receptive to limited, constitutional government. His desire to get involved in more wars makes me doubt that.
still wish it was you
thank you... please work hard for our President Trump... he is the People's President and is going to #DrainTheSwamp
shut up, worse day ever you just don't see it yet.
congratulTions on your win
help him man. This is exactly what we need
love you Rand! Get in there and make us GREAT!
it started 8 years ago wit @RonPaul . This revolution has been going on a LONG time. Just finally enough people woke up
thanks for being a solid guy all year, man.
yes lets work together not lie in a puddle and cry like twitter and facebook
get em rand!!!!
I hope trump lives up to his promises of this year - despite the decades of his actions that directly contradict those promises.
regardless of who won last night I was holding out hope you would win just for that reason. #limitgovernment
Congratulations to you, Dr. Paul! I have a feeling you are going to do some great work in the next session. Can't wait to see it!
on the Larry Wilmore show you said: "A speck of dirt is way more qualified to be president."
Do your best; WWIII with Russia is at least somewhat less likely now.
good job Paul... good Job.
I have no doubt you&your fathers message and grassroots got behind Trump to push him into victory!A huge win for the constitution
Time to get to work on term limits, auditing the fed, and abolishing the IRS.
How much can be undone in 4 years? Let's find out...
But will you stand up for the Constitution?
Would love to see you get a spot in the new admin.
you are a gentlemen.
not sure Trump knows what "limited constitutional government" means...
now let's #AuditTheFed  #americalives
if you believe that @realDonaldTrump stands for limited government, you may be disappointed. Nobody really knows what he'll do.
@RobertA87413263 Thanks, Mr. Paul. God Bless America. God Bless Us ALL #Trump
Congratulations to you, as well.
DR PAUL, I'D CALL THIS A START TO US CITIZENS BEING FREE "OF" THE PRESS, SLANTED LEANING CORRUPT AXXHOLES

you guys did this to control the house and keep your job. Hope you are cool speaking Russian!
#FrankenTrump @GOP @bpolitics @MSNBC
you are living in a pipe dream trump is a big gov. lib.
you do understand that most of his stated positions are patently unconstitutional right?
I just love you! Thank you for continuing to be the voice of liberty!
Certain you have a role in U.S. future★ -KWTD™ 'first Est. Key West 1829' 'Words Gathered Together For Truth™' Key West Register™
You guys have done great with that. Failure.
Remind me, what have limited government sorts ever won. Legislation. Anything.
I was pro Trump from his announcement. Libertarians never delivered on anything. Like I said, evidence.
I forget sometimes that people that hate the RNC and Conservative Inc say they're Libertarians, but usually aren't.
@AliABCNews The people of South Arabian congratulate Master Donald trump for being elected the 45th president of the USA
