Couldn't Trump just pardon him?
Yes. He should be and Snowden too! Redic
Wellllll... Snowden is a Russian stooge
oh? but he worked for us gov, no?
he was a contractor, not a direct employee
I think you should check my recent tweets
.@RandPaul @JustinRaimondo Could @realDonaldTrump be floating Petraeus simply to troll media about Clinton email scandal?
Israel 1st US #media won't mention #Petraeus Israel emails:
@GenFlynn @realDonaldTrump #Broadwell not 1st time #Petraeus sloppy with email
Interesting @JustinRaimondo piece about #Broadwell as neocon agent:
It's hypocracy Trump style
You, the GoP let this administration happen.  Given the options this is the least objectionable.
does not look like he will drain the swamp but we wait until he becomes POTUS. From then on we fight
Hillary is moving around FREE and he is on probation with a fine.  That is crap.  Why doesn't someone lock that woman up?
agreed
@alllibertynews not if pardoned
@shotgun600 Pretty bad when Rand Paul and Lyndsey Graham make sense. Just saying.
Unfortunately for this reason, he cannot be SecofState. He would have been a great one. Romney will be also. Make Petreous advisor
@alllibertynews He's a proponent of gun grab and mass surveillance of the American public. Sociocommunist. Hell no!
1000 of the 30000 deleted emails were between Hillary and this man.
agreed
Rand Paul for Sec of State!
unless he pardons him first.
@alllibertynews Hillary mishandled Classified Info and had Corruption in Clinton Foundation, Why didn't she get prosecuted ???
I nominate you! 
Everything he does is a bad idea, Rand. He's about to get us killed. Fucking dump him already
You are Gabbard would be my 2 top picks actually wish @realDonaldTrump would look into this.
I'm almost certain the general would get a pardon from Trump before he got an appointment.
that's because it is a bad idea
#StandWithRand
he would be pardoned and then appointed.
summery probation, or email probation. .. I'll send you a song what I think about your statement
@Rparisee agree
Cute and unserious. Reminds me of most of your policy positions. 

@MBMc16 @cameron_fine @rwp1699
@NoahCRothman I bet even if the probation officer said yes, Mrs Petraeus might say no.
There's still a Mrs. Petraeus?
So are you, but, you're still here.
Agreed."Republic should be ruled by honors."
can't POTUS pardon him if he really wants to appoint him?!
He is also creating an anti-gun group.

Don't be a Republican.  Be an American.  American before Republican.
Dr. Paul, we are counting on you for accountability.  Please don't let America down.
what makes anyone think the next bimbo he sleep with not a Russian spy
Advisor for how not to mess up.
Rand Paul, you are just a nasty, hateful guy.
@SenRandPaul US #media still wont mention #Petraeus leaked emails re Israel scheming with neocon warmonger
#Broadwell scandal not 1st time #Petraeus sloppy with email scheming with neocon warmonger Max Boot:
@SenRandPaul Neocon warmonger Max Boot (#Petraeus schemed with) mentioned in following article as well:
@SenRandPaul @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn Excellent Petraeus piece by @CIA's @RayMcGovern 4 @ConsortiumNews
Bad idea...but Hillary was allowed to run for POTUS, and if she won election assume the office?? Give me a break.
All of his picks are a bad idea for someone who portrays himself as a nationalist who is out to help the average American.
This will only work if Petreus changes his name to Swamp Thing.
or #Trump can just issue a pardon. LOL
thank you for leading this charge
I agree, Rand.
The 5 choices we have now all are terrible. Rand call Trump and offer yourself for the job!
why.... why.... why... did you drop out of the race when you were in 4th place at the time? And why not run independent?
very good. I would be mad if he didn't let them know he have to leave the state. What's the point
I can't speak ill of Petraeus, I attribute his actions to his President.
Well, yeah...That isn't going to work.
you aren't quite as smart or in touch with the American people as you think you are or you would be President.
Trump could pardon him. He did nothing compared to Hilary's!!
I agree..not a good idea to appoint Petraeus Sec. of St.; Trump rallied against HRC re: mishandling classified info...
That someone as connected as he is was charged at all means something went wrong.  He should be pardoned.  Obviously.
Petraeus ANTI 2nd Amendment ! 
No Sec of State!!!!
The President could always pardon him.
you don't think trump would pardon him?
Petraeus appt. makes perfect sense in a cabinet and White House full of criminals. "Rule of law"? Meh......
maybe O will pardon him he has ignored what H has done.
Not if he were pardoned 
you think?
he's a huge liability
now that is just sad but made me giggle #NeverRomney #NeverPetraeus
sit down and shut up. You may be liked in your state but not in the rest of Middle USA. Get on board or go quietly in the night!
Ya think?
EXPOSE Lindsey Graham who's trying to legalize college illegals w new DREAM bill
Not if he got a pardon...just sayin'
@NoahCRothman That'd be like a doctor looking at a bullet wound and saying this seems like a gun shot
@bethanyshondark I'm going to have to check with the President and my P.O. That is flipping hilarious. And they cried lock her up.
@NoahCRothman Seems???
Well said.
Why is your dad not lobbying to be Sec of Treas? End the Fed?
For doing what Hillary Clinton did but to lesser extent
I don't think Gen Pet could even get a security clearance could he?
In order to have access to classified info, wouldn't Trump need to pardon him first?
.@RandPaul Perhaps that is the point - Petraeus being floated is simply trolling the media about Clinton scandals...
@woodhouseb Just one more of millions.
no kidding.
please put the country before party loyalty on some of these insane picks senator Paul
Please no $ to "vetted" Syrian opposition or Ukraine WE MUST FIX VA system 1st See Mccains  proposal
who do u suggest for SOS..your father @RonPaul should meet with potus too
We threw a fit over Mrs. Clinton's problems with secrets, now were going to be forced to say it's okay for another Secretary?
couldn't Trump pardon him?
Why ? Is it TOO fresh ? How is it that the entire Congress has let Clinton's murder, rape, etc?
Trump will pardon home even if he is not appointed. Even if ton just show that he is a good American and a patriot unlike HRC.
Nix him off the list.
It sure does.  Rudy is the best choice.
Well, at least he's not a senate treaty consent abolishing slimeball like Boob Corker.
- And how will he get security clearance?.  Yes - Petraeus is a REALLY bad idea.
If you have pull use it please RP. I don't want him.
I question the source @thehill
Let HIM run @DeptVetAffairs .
...but a very good General with a weakness for pretty female journalists. He should be given a job.
seems like. But killary doesn't have a probation officer so....MAGA.
agreed bad idea!
I'm surprised he's not selecting Hillary at this point. Lock him up?
Not if Trump pardons Petraeus.
agree. need more serious people who have heads on straight. and need a good deep vetting both behind doors and public hearings.
couldn't agree more. To appoint Petreus would be to ignore what he did.
My God Mr. Paul, PLEASE HELP! You KNOW Trumps TRUE PRIORITIES, IF NOT YOU THEN WHO SIR???!!
I hope so cuz I hate to think @realDonaldTrump is seriously considering Petraeus. I like the way you think! #MAGA
Rand, I have a problem with all of his pen pal experiences to Hillary's Secret Server, don't you? What were they talking about?
Petraeus + Mark Kelly's gun control alliance infringes on 2nd Amendment.  Just another elitist!
agreed It isn't right to attack HRC for mishandling classified info then hire someone to that same position who's done the same.
■■ HYPOCRISY ■■ REPs cannot accept Petraus as DEMs accepted HRC !! CLASSIFIED is CLASSIFIED !! 《《 BOTH are GUILTY 》》 ●● MOVE ON●●
what the hell?
Rand why couldn't it have been you
does his ankle monitor allow for foreign travel?
argh.    It's really sad.   I have great respect for him.  I don't know what the solution is
I know that I would vote "no" on this one.
@realDonaldTrump: Dr. Paul, I agree with u, Sir. There is only 1 man for the job to be SofS  @RudyGiuliani.
And hypocritical given the focus of the majority of Trump's rallies.
what's the difference between Hillary and Petraeus?  Not a lot.   He has more baggage than Romney
why not have a full pardon issued for his vindictive treatment  by Obama
@realDonaldTrump ■■ CAUTION ■■ he's sided w GUN CONTROL w/Kelly/Giffords!! TrustHim?? I say MOVE●ON  http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2016/06/10/general-david-petraeus-forming-gun-control-group-with-mark-kelly/ …
Petraeus knows far more about #Benghazi & #FastandFurious MidEast Edition than he's shared.
#Treason #NoPetraeus
shit.
which stinks. Guy is brilliant, but screwed up :(
just slap an ankle bracelet on him, would be the logical compromise I would think.
I dont agree w u on everything but I agree w u on this.
anybody who said 'lock her up' should hide their face for next 4 years.of course if at all they have any integrity.dumbest ppl.
#hillaryforjail #LockHerUp
it's hard to keep track of all the bad ideas.
#Petreus must be #incarcerated !
The "bad idea" is the fact that Petraeus needs a parole officer in the first place.
SECOND AMENDMENT
they all do
This seems like an understatement...
HOLY SHIT! THATS SOME FUNNY SHIT RIGHT THERE! 
I hope Congress is ready to fight to hold people accountable...
You're one of the few Republicans I still have respect for, thanks for standing up for what you believe in.
I second that
Where the F-K was your balls when Lynch was shoved down our throats & Obama packed the lower courts with lib judges?? Where Spanky
I guess nobody is draining the swamp
They drained it because there was too much water, not enough career scumbags.
Also a gun grabber with his BFF Mark Kelly. No friend of the 2A
seems kind of like putting Hillary in charge of internet security
can't Trump just pardon him?
Hahahaha. Although his parole officer must be military.
Charged as Director of CIA, a civilian org.  So no.
ok
How are you going to vote?
You are a bad Idea Rand. You were a Trump hater, you can sit this one out pal.
@DanaRohrabacher ? Corker?
Ron Paul for Sec of State
treasury?
so does this
Note that Mnuchin was Trump's campaign finance chair. That pick is as unsurprising as it gets.
yes aware
