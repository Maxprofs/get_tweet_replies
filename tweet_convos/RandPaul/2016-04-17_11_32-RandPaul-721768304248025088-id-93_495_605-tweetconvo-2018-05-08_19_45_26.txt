@RandPaul @alllibertynews why can't the goats just be goats?
@RandPaul @mrsdannyh Bet they feel sheepish!
@MamaBear4Cruz @RandPaul
@Ease_Private @alllibertynews @RandPaul @KevinNR CAN FEEL THAT SENTIMENT, 1 PATRIOT VS ENTIRE CORRUPT SYSTEM IS TOUGH. A LEADER NEED SUPPORT
@RandPaul @freedomtex @dcexaminer Does anyone in DC even care that I'm a widowed mom working my but off trying to survive? #GovtWaste
@Timpanist @RandPaul @freedomtex @dcexaminer 
I do as a fellow American! Ted Cruz for potus!!!
@justyce2015 @RandPaul @freedomtex @dcexaminer America NEEDS @tedcruz now more than ever! #CruzToVictory
@RandPaul @KevinNR @dcexaminer Wow Rand. As a Senator what did you do to stop it? To stop Ocare exemption for the aristocracy in Congress?
@RandPaul @alllibertynews what a Danny waiste and that's my money, It seems I have to call loudermilk and scream everu week to get back bone
@RandPaul @aduanebrown @dcexaminer 
They couldn't seduce a goat with $6 mill!?!...Muslims do it for free.
@RandPaul @NobamaDotCom this is why Trump says WAST FRAUD ABUSE
@PattyButts @alllibertynews @RandPaul @NobamaDotCom but he's gonna build a wall on the taxpayers dime. Sure.
I'm surrounded by idiots
@RandPaul Why should the government be involved in goat mating? (insight by http://commun.it )
@RandPaul @Ellie_Urban @dcexaminer  It's Goat and Pork-Barrel spending.
@RandPaul @Ellie_Urban
@RandPaul meanwhile, the Marines are having to cannibalize aircraft to keep helos and F18s flying. #priorities
@MJKrause @RandPaul ever stop to think those archaic machines are getting phased out for something better? That story is just politics.
@Cinci_Sapper @RandPaul phasing out is one thing. The f35 isn't fielded in enough numbers. We are still fighting wars if you haven't noticed
@MJKrause Yeah.. Because I would have no clue about that
@RandPaul #staringatgoats # government #cult #obsession@alllibertynews
@RandPaul @alllibertynews it looks like some people have an IQ of a goat. Guess who suffers?
@RandPaul were they looking to distract ISIS combatants?
@RandPaul @dcexaminer  ISIS whorehouse?  :)
@RandPaul @alllibertynews what a waste of tax payer money.
@RandPaul @NobamaDotCom Muslims do it for FREE!!!
@RandPaul @NobamaDotCom observing Cruz and a mistress? Fair question ...
@RandPaul @BarrieNJ @dcexaminer • Dammit.

I deleted my ISIS goat glory hole meme this morning.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Did the project involve refugees?
@RandPaul @KevinNR You are kidding me guys this is nothing than all the money we wasted on the corrupt warlords and Afghan officials
@RandPaul @KatTimpf What about Goat STARING? LOL!
@RandPaul @wmleemert What happened to OSTA?
@RandPaul Turns out cross breeding mooslims with goats was a bust eh?
@RandPaul @alicepa33372034 I'm sure we r all shocked right
@RandPaul @dcexaminer  What canwe get back too Gods way already govneeds to stop davialin in mother nature always got to mess with Gods work
@RandPaul @DanWantsFreedom $6M on a failed project. I could live very well off of that for the next 40 years!
@RandPaul (Y)
@RandPaul are you going to re-enter the presidential race? Please do...
@RandPaul @RestoreHistory Why didn't they just ask the perverts over in Afghanistan, they mate with goats on a daily basis...
@RandPaul @dcexaminer BAAAAD HA!HA!HA!
@RandPaul The government has  supported foreign governments supportive of U.S. multinational companies regardless of how tyrannical they are
@RandPaul The Reza Shah's government in Iran, Chiang's regime in China, The dictatorship in South Korea, are examples of this tendency.
@RandPaul It seems interesting that out Gov has no problem spending on project x but cannot seem to muster enough millions to pay our troops
@RandPaul every penny that i will ever pay in taxes is somewhere in there. #thrifty #FAIRtax
@RandPaul @GigiLs88  guess never thought check with a Vetenarian
@RandPaul Sometimes things are too stupid to dignify...I get it! . I pray you have some role in next administration.
@RandPaul @dcexaminer goats will do it for free.
@RandPaul @freedomtex @dcexaminer yeah poor goats were getting too many diseases from the terrorist volunteers
@RandPaul Too bad u don't worry as much about the 6 Trillion wasted on 2 ridiculous wars. Just sayin
.@RandPaul .@freedomtex Budget Cuts Grounding Marine Aircraft http://unclesamsmisguidedchildren.com/budget-cuts-grounding-marine-aircraft/ … #tcot @tedcruz
@RandPaul well where else would Hillary Clinton have come from?
@RandPaul Ah for the Golden Fleece Awards!
@RandPaul  Who in the heck is authorizing these projects Obama! We the people want our money back, thank elected officials for doing T jobs
@RandPaul The people on the shipment end claimed they shipped it, & those on the receiving end claimed they never got it. I claimed insanity
@RandPaul When I worked for the DOD, I investigated the alleged shipment of a two ton piece of equip., the size of a truck, costing 3 mill.
Is it just me or does @RandPaul look like the result of $6 million spent on failed goat-mating projects?
@RandPaul I will be voting for you on Tuesday in New York! #StillRanding #unsuspend #RandPaul2016
@ToniAnnCook @RandPaul #StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
@RandPaul that is just stupid and you can't fix stupid.   Thank God for Ky people.  We Are not that stupid
@RandPaul I thought you were conceived in a goat mating experiment.
@RandPaul half-man/half-goat super soldiers are the future of mountain warfare.
@RandPaul dad jokes...
@RandPaul it's funny and tragic at the same time. But these type stories have been around for decades and no one does anything about it
@RandPaul @KatTimpf Not to be confused with successful, goat-mating studies.
@RandPaul @dcexaminer Rand Paul please consider joining Trump as VP
@Davidcapi84 @alllibertynews @RandPaul @dcexaminer No Dr. Paul, keep your job and integrity - considering Trump isn't going to get it anyway
@Velanestar @alllibertynews @RandPaul @dcexaminer I disagree Trump will get nomination Rand would be good he's a real Constitutionalist
@RandPaul @dcexaminer Tired of gov wasting  $. How much education and health care could that buy.
@RandPaul not sure which is sadder: that they tried it, or that failed.
@RandPaul how much do you wish you stayed in the presidential race?
@randpaul skewed info
@KatTimpf @RandPaul why leave it there this just shows the wasteful spending compliments of our govt
@RandPaul  DC is full of IDIOTS
@RandPaul Thank you for Being a true Supporter of Justice , I have alot of respect 4 you & Supporting Mr.Trump , To victory ,Keep it Up
@RandPaul @dcexaminer #StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
@RandPaul I do not like green eggs and scam. I will not eat them with a goat, I will not eat this uge bloat.I will not let them take my vote
@RandPaul I, for one, blame the goats.
@RandPaul @dcexaminer goats kinda mate without the need of 6 million. Just saying
@AshRossbldgmom @RandPaul @dcexaminer and so do republicans unfortunately lmao
@RandPaul Seems better to use Reserve notes as Goat food? 6 Billion? Let that sink in to the hungry in our nation.
@RandPaul Dr. Paul, get us out of Afghanistan.  It's just contractor Bazaar with no actual mission. Also, keep the pressure on the FED
@RandPaul @dcexaminer Wow, some of that wasteful spending I would like to check when I am elected,Shame, shame.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Maybe someone at the DoD got sick of Afghans trying to mate with little boys and girls. But goats were already being used too.
@patechinois1 @RandPaul That's it!  Oh,  and Bernie is conservative...
@forrest_fire1 @patechinois1 @RandPaul How is Bernie conservative?
@Firebrass11 @patechinois1 @RandPaul Bernie & the word conservatism do not belong together
@forrest_fire1 @patechinois1 @RandPaul Exactly ;3
@RandPaul
@RandPaul I must b missing something here. U r a member of Congress right?
@MicheleSchiesse @RandPaul  Your genius obviously Michele.
@RandPaul Perhaps it was part of Obama's welcome program for Islamic Refugees that he wants to join our military?
- - -  @RandPaul do you think you will support a candidate for president at this point in time? what do you think about a cruz/paul ticket
@KC3CDU I like that idea, I like a Cruz Paul ticket for sure, I think I’d vote for the duel.
