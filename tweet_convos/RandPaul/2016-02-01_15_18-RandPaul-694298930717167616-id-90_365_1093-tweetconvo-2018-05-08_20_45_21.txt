@RandPaul woah the diversity is overwhelming
@RandPaul @VicBergerIV You guys missed the boat....Feel the Bern!
@RandPaul Wow. What an absolutely uninspiring statement. Your 80 year old Dad has more testosterone than you. #LowT
.@RandPaul That's like, 4 kinds of white people! How will you keep track?
@wguy13 @RandPaul The point is, his "diversity" tweet shows two white dudes and only mentions earrings/tattoos. Bizarre. Clumsy.
@KingAndJames I really expected your tweets to suck after that one, but reading your TL you aren't so bad.
@Shaydieblue Thanks. "Not so bad" has always been my goal. I even have "not so bad" tattooed on my back. Rand approves.
Sorry, sorry. @KingAndJames I just learned not to judge by one tweet & digging for timeline fodder yeilded feelings of admiration & shame.
@max_stiglich @GotchYaSon @RandPaul  #StandWithRand #RandRally #iacaucus
@RandPaul If only your party wasn't swarming with Religious Right fanatics, I'd find it far more interesting...  #theocracymustdie
@RandPaul & of people of all colors, all races, all religions - a party that embodies what #USA means 2 us today & tomorrow. #RandPaul2016
@RandPaul Im a gay conservative/liberal republican and I Stand With Rand because I love the U.S. Constitution.
@RathJames @RandPaul Thanks for standing with Rand, bro!
@RandPaul your like the village idiot ask the dude for some money you hillbilly
@RandPaul A political decision should be educated, based on relevant and practical considerations; not an attempt to conform to an ideology.
@RandPaul This is why your'e losing.
@jay6018 @RandPaul lol yeah, it has nothing at all to do with the current mindset of the electorate
@jean_laclair @RandPaul You support individual liberty, free enterprise,American sovereignty, you can have tats in your tongue 4 all I care.
"Whether with shaved heads or not, the Republican Party needs be open to racists & White Supremacists."--@RandPaul
@CarlNyberg312 @RandPaul seriously? He's this only Republican fighting for criminal justice reform. He thinks the party should be everyone.
@RandPaul @VicBergerIV could the party also have balloons and strippers?
@RandPaul No, let's just be Americans. It's the Democrat party that thrives on segregating its base. i.e.: blacks, Hispanics, gays, lesbians
@RandPaul with unconvincing and laughable perms, without unconvincing and laughable perms...
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Some #constitutionalists are covered in #tattoos . Me 4 instance . #StandWithRand #life #liberty #pursuitofhappiness
@RandPaul That kid looks like a douche.

@RandPaul True story! The "Come as you are" Conservative movement.
@RandPaul good lord! Contrived forced & phony. Yuck!
@RandPaul @VicBergerIV Ooooh, edgy!
@RandPaul I'd rather it be about ideals than physical attributes
@RandPaul What about gays?
@RandPaul You need to be a party that opposes Muslim immigration.
@RandPaul Why
@RandPaul @MrPaulotics I didn't think anyone could pander more than @BernieSanders I was wrong
Big tent @joshgoettsch @RandPaul
@lyz_estrada @RandPaul That's embarrassing.
@RandPaul @VicBergerIV @kevinmckenz @calebcworkman
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Thanks again for your endorsement @macklemore! I really like your song about shoes! #StandWithRand #macklemore #libertarian #USA
@RandPaul i mean you could be a party that isnt all racist asshats, but yeah, lets focus on facepaint, mmmkay?
@RandPaul wow you're really breaking down boundaries....
@RandPaul what about people who want to marry someone of the same gender
@RandPaul lol fake tattoos fam.
@RandPaul @VicBergerIV Dr Rand, which tat do u think I sld get, its a big decision... Wld love a real doctors advice
@RandPaul doesn't matter what you look like as long as you have good values, those who support you have good values!
@RandPaul @MurderBryan wait is Macklemore aging in reverse?
@RandPaul @VicBergerIV return of the mack
@RandPaul and with Rand Paul tattoos. #RandRally
@RandPaul @60kolex I'm sorry but are those tattoos on his face? Cause if they are that's not real bright!! Just sayin
@RandPaul it is #opossumable with your help. Keep on trucking in #Iowa my man
@RandPaul So you say!
@RandPaul who cares about earrings or tattoos, do they have a brain?
@RandPaul bruh how many years you gonna try and run for president lol
@SonsofReagan @RandPaul Nonsense.
@RandPaul Is this the most important and driving need in the nation? To have a party with body diversity? I'd prefer defense of freedom.
@RandPaul wigs, too, amirite?
@RandPaul 

"I like strawberry ice cream, and I like all non-strawberried ice creams."
@RandPaul That's very inclusive of you Dr.
@RandPaul Is that Macklemore?
@RandPaul HARAM
@RandPaul that's why I'm not a party advocate. I vote for people not animals. I vote for someone I can imitate.
@RandPaul A political party or leader that condones nose rings & tats doesn't love their followers in truth.
@RandPaul looks like you got all that...
@RandPaul Tattoos that say Rand, and tattoos that something other than Rand. And this one is recyclable.
@RandPaul Thank you! Too many intelligent, hard working people are discriminated against because ofTheirBodyArt
#StandWithRand #RandGirling
@RandPaul
@RandPaul hell yeh!  GOP #realkeeping
@RandPaul what
.@RandPaul policy, substance  and dignity of candidates without a Jheri curl matter more which is why you're polling as low as you are
@kurtastic @RandPaul if the GOP voters wanted a candidate with policies and substance, Donald Trump wouldn't be leading.
@kurtastic @RandPaul oh, and the dignity thing? That's a freaking laugh.
@JustinBonds20 @RandPaul it really is a laugh. Rand's greasy do is so bad people have quietly forgotten how bad Trump's is
@kurtastic @RandPaul since when does a candidate's haircut matter lmao
@JustinBonds20 @RandPaul when it looks like the candidate hasn't washed their hair since before Obama administration as a protest it matters
@kurtastic @RandPaul hahaha. It's not that bad.
@JustinBonds20 @RandPaul lol thanks all I was looking for was a concession that it ain't great. You're right, not 100% disqualifying
@RandPaul sweet Rand tattoos!  #RandRally
@RandPaul  Thats right all our peeps are welcome all come we need to do this together #StandWithRand
@RandPaul and we need a country without the federal reserve and a gold and or silver standard
@RandPaul You're a champion of our Constitutional Rights Rand !!
@RandPaul We're holding a party just like that this evening #ladsiowacaucusnight
Politics in the age of the internet is so entertaining! @theassmanNY @RandPaul
@RandPaul I don't think those are real tats, bro
@jamisonwebb @RandPaul You say that like it's a bad thing.
