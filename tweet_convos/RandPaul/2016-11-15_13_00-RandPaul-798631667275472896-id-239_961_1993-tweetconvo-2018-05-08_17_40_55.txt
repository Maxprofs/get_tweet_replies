at one time I thought you were a true statesman like your father. Now I'm not so sure where you stand.
because he opposes Neocons who opposed Trump?
no... because of his crybaby tactics during primary
"Crybaby tactics"? Like what, debating with facts & a handle of a topic?
no by taking the low road like Rubik and Jenny while debating Trump. That's how he lost my vote.
And what "low road" was that, exactly?
https://youtu.be/YtiiTe9onww 
Rand talking about Trump buying favors. Rand took handouts from Trump
Rand pointing out something Trump did, & bragged about, is d "low road"? Like Clinton, don't criticize him?
kelleyane Conway tremendous qualities of coordination can bring trump Putin Xi Nigel Kabila on one dias good secretary of state
after my explanation in 2006 John Kerry quietly uplifted 700 million backward suppressed middle castes of India. We don't know now
let Mr Trump do the job he was "hired" to do
700 million backward suppressed middle production castes of India kept away from ruling establishment may burst for rights.
monarchy made body slaves communism made mind slaves markets made dollar slaves kill or get killed for currency Rand find solution
I hope you vote no on @SenatorSessions for AG.  He wouldn't recognize the constitution if it bit him. 

@RandPaul @alllibertynews
look at the AG we have now, Sessions if perfect for the job
I pray continually for his wisdom 
@TheJayCalledLee 
Great job Dr.Paul
and you go on @CNN with the ever-trustworthy @wolfblitzer and you want us to think John Bolton is a wrong choice? SMH
Rand Paul is a fantastic politician making some good points, don't you think?
Racist. A racist can never see that from another from his same cut, because to do so he must also admit to his own similar beliefs as well. Its a pot denying that the kettle is black while they both share that same characteristic.
Those who are Corrupted will find it easy to Shield Corrupt leadership under Pres. Trump. America let me give example. This Senator accepted Trump's bribe for Free $100K membership fees for Mara Lag in exchange for his Loyalty. Kentucky why do you keep voting for such corruption
communism is bad but market economy become worst created greedy for dollars tax heavens and fanatic conflicts refugees.
Perhaps you should have endorsed him to grow closer to him. No reason to listen to a loser now.
I agree...hes a bit scary.....way 2 hawkish!!
He and Trump thought it to be hilarious!
When he had voted for Tax increases for those making under $72K a year. For Deductions to get phased out that were liked bt those prefering to itemize their Taxes. To be against Affordable Health care; Funding of Drug Addiction programs; Chip and Medicaid. To support a man who is
Thete is no Godliness in Sen Rand Paul. If hecdid hecwould inctease funding not vote to DEFUND social assistance programs that help the poor in Kentucky.
He also is bad at Golf which makes it easier for Trump to beat him. This Senator also failed to speak out agaInst that missile warning error in Hawaii that caused statewide panic.
America foundation is trade and no peace no trade. World peace is on trump shoulders.
- I agree and I hope he passes on Romney as Sec of State as well.
-
@realDonaldTrump Bolton is not what you OR America needs!
-
:)
You're just a sore loser The American people rejected you for a reason!
show why he was my early favorite among the Repub. candidates.
you're so right!
- I hope Trump puts You somewhere sweet where you can help make change
Change?  Wasnt that Prez Obamas Mantra?
#StandWithRand
@ElianaBenador 
I agree!
stands on consistency. Proud to have you as our state Senator!
get over it !! both of these men are great @johnbolton and @MayorRGiuliani and why are you on Wolf he is going to twist your words
Why not have @RandPaul as Secretary of State? Or his Father @RonPaul? Both share many of Trumps views on Foreign Policy!
While I do think now that @RandPaul would be better off in the Senate at this point, he does have the Potential to be a Great Diplomat...
In fact he'd be a much better Secretary of State than @HillaryClinton ever was! That's for Certain!
@SharonMcCutchan So very proud of BOLTON and President Elect Trump!  NOT Rand Paul's decision!! SUPPORT #Trump choices for America
i like Rudy
i would not think Rudy had the expience maybe over HS agree with Rand Dont know Bolton
If @realDonaldTrump Cleanses @StateDept Of #NeoConSins,only then we may hope for #GreaterUSA & #SaferWorld!
@orangesoda2000 @realDonaldTrump #Rand Paul needs to be the #SecretaryofTreasury. His waste report is spot to balance the budget.
I disagree, He's exactly the man we need.
Rand is the most honest politician in America. I trust his judgement on this.
Both Republican Senators from
 @RNRTennessee earned a BIG FAT "F" for FAILING American's Conservative Values.
Bob Corker
Rand go on @marklevinshow and defend your stance?? Show a pair a balls on gone on.
The Chicken Hawk President is looking at two Chicken Hawk candidates for Secretary of State.  All were Doctor shopping during NAM
john bolton is garbage. what about your dad for secretary of state
/Just another Republican slithering back into Trumps bed?
agreed we need Rand and Ron Paul in @realDonaldTrump cabinet! We must stick to the constitution limit gov less welfare and taxes!
Corker made Iran deal http://possible.Now  who's overreacting= you ! I can't believe you'd support Corker. Golly sakes Senator !
I hope you realize that you didn't support Trump and therefore should keep your mouth shut #maga
Take a back seat dear! you are not in charge.
, Y does it matter to U now? U didn't support Trump,If Hillary's cheating would have elected her would have appointed way worse
Thank you Senator. Keep fighting the good fight on Cap Hill and help P/E Trump. We want to see fresh and new, not retreads.
WHY DOES'NT EVERYONE LET HIM DO HIS JOB?  MAKE HIS CHOICES AND LEAD THIS NATION?  HE WAS ELECTED POTUS.
. @RandPaul And what about Bannon? Are you as opposed to him as Bolton?
depending on senators like you Rand to make sure Trump keeps his promises.
I like Rand but sometimes I don't get this guy
if you want the job, just fill out an application at the front desk
@realDonaldTrump #CLEANTHEHOUSE
#wewantchange #notthesame GO RAND PAUL!
The only thing more dangerous than Bolton is BANNON. Why have you been silent on that?
I agree - Secretary of State should not be Giuliani or Bolton.
How can you support the appointment of Steve Bannon?
ar_scotty# Your wrong on both accounts. President Trump has made to good choices. Glad he didn't choose you for anything.
it's the end of times when I'm actually agreeing with Rand Paul #Trumpocalypse
shut up Rand.
PLEASE, please, please put a hold on any nomination of John Bolton.
keep pushing
neither does Michelle Rhee
but Trump will be POTUS
who cares what you say.  You lost!
@constancesavage we want change
@realDonaldTrump No to Bolton...we the ppl have had enough of him. Use your better judgement!
Wrong, he is what we want!!
Bolton with his diplomatic experience is the reason we have the problems we have now. Get someone else, even crazy Rudy is better.
you wanted him over Clinton and now seems you want to control his decisions.Should he just be glad he won?
quit complaining and go put your name in the hat.
trump has touted bombing isis and expanding military expenditures. go read his website.
I know. I don't need to read his website.
and which of his staff so far actually does represent change?  Other than is own under qualified family members
not Steve Bannon. That's the most dangerous one. I did see he will veto Giuliani which is promising
clearly @tedcruz  and @SpeakerRyan have rolled over to Trump. Hopefully people like @RandPaul have more conviction
https://youtu.be/-rSDUsMwakI  also watch 16.40 to 17.30
already told the Times he would oppose both Trump's choices. Just an opportunistic move for showmanship imo
While we disagree on what Trump represents- we do agree that Bolton should absolutely NOT have this job! Thanks for speaking out.
You are reckless with your words!
is the GOP going to stand against this type of rhetoric
it's okay 4 U 2 bring a problem but U have 2 bring a solution 2 the problem otherwise U R part of the problem who do you recommend
your Bolton comments just show that U don't understand what REAL Americans really want!
@wolfblitzer Has a mayor ever become a secretary of state?
Donald Trump represents consolidating power in himself [or his puppet master(s)].
Bolton would be a good choice.
Do you have a list of anyone that you would vote for? If not, do you have a archetype of a specific person that would fill this?
PLEASE Provide a reasonable pick, who should trump pick????  @RandPaul
I'd like to think @realDonaldTrump has a well practiced head fake
Dr. Paul, please leave the lunatic to run the asylum, and join the Libertarians for the sake of your own sanity.
How anyone can even go on @CNN let alone speak to that SCUM HACK REPORTER @wolfblitzer who tried to steal the election astounds me
Say no to Bolton & Guiliani
I have disagreed with you on a lot of issues. However, I applaud you for taking a stand against Bolton. Thank you from KY!
love to see @BenSwann_ @SharylAttkisson or even @greta on my feed - hate to see you give clinton news network airtime though.
Aren't you part of the swamp he's supposed to be draining?
Rand, I've supported you my whole life and the time to boycott @CNN is now. Please support journalists who aren't out to deceive.
@potifar66  So, #Guiliani and #Bolton are the two choices -- both unacceptable ... What to do? 
I wish you were the president elect.
I respect your duty to support or not support any Trump nominee, but don't go on CNN to voice your opinions. #CNNsucks.
@onlyarianna Bolton is just what we need
I believe Dr. Paul is right. Bolton is not for change but pushes the globalist philosophy, not change in government.
Rand you need to be  vocal and call things out from both sides going forward.Always stay true to our nations checks & balances
Thankyou
I strongly agree.
I hope Trump picks Bolton, he is Intelligent.
Agreed Rand, I hope Pres-elect Trump goes in a different direction on this.
agree!!
Who actually asked you, Rand?!
That's they way things are.
Confirmation requires asking the Senate for confirmation & advice.
 @alllibertynews @RandPaul
Thank you! Forgot they had to voted on for Sec Of State.
defending Steve Bannon. Smdh.
I agree but would we expect anything different from Trump than these mixed signals? #hoping4america
Mr. Trump is outstanding at picking the right ppl. Sit back and let him do what he does best. Don't stir the pot.
please stop John Bolton he will kill all of us #StopJohnBolton
Thanks for your CONCERN Rand, but Trump is a smart man and he's got this.
no Bolton, no Giuliani, do you have a name?
@Dekedee  Bolton back in the Whitehouse GulibitchAnni,Newt,shows TRUMPSobsession of being in control he getSfuckUps4a few reasons
OMG not Wolf Blitzer ?
Rand Paul needs to get with the program really fucking getting tired of Republicans not having their shit together
we did not reelect u to go against Trump Your not to be his advisor U are to do as we elected u to represent us not go on your own
Keep talking. It takes courage. Both men would be a disaster.
keep retweeting @CNN interviews. You're really improving your position with your constituents . Go on @FoxNews and do that Oh wait
is a whack job!
why would you go on CNN? Pick up the phone and discuss. Yet you reelected Ryan. Not a good start all the way around. Shame on you!
It is true...Rudy has business ties with.. .TransCanada..being one
@DinduNuffinn Agreed.
I agree..NO to Bolton..a Bush Rhino...penchant for unproductive war..
If @realDonaldTrump appoints Bolton then we will know who owns him
this is why I love this guy! #RandPaul
I was fervent Trump but with Ryan he is not draining the swamp. I'll support you against insiders
Thanks for continuing to keep The POTUS in line whichever initial is after the name.
#StandWithRand push Trump towards patriots and support his low taxes non interventionist foreign policy and #MAGA
@learnpolsci I see Rand Paul has knelt before his emperor …
@mamoobonnie 
Is Wolf still on the air? I thought CNN put him on parking lot duty? Huh!
After Kerry, anyone is an improvement.
your Dad was spot on when he analyzed the two candidates on foreign policy and noted Trump and Bolton were advising Trump
@CNN NOTHING BUT LIARS!!!
Trump represents selling America to Putin. You're right, Bolton doesn't represent Trump's treason.
When can we stop talking to CNN and Wolf Blitzer?
BOYCOTT the failing CNN. Their stockholders should sell off their stock holdings while they can.
@WendyPrince2 @RandPaul @pwalkers80
Hey @CNN, were @wolfblitzer's talking points prepared by @TheDemocrats again? #WikiLeaks #PodestaLeaks #WeRememberCorruption
poor thing, you try so hard to be relevant...
So Bolton and Giuliani are bad, but you're cool with Bannon?
Exactly and I was thinking the same exact thing .  Because if he hires someone from the UN he'll lose a lot of support
#NeverBolton. TERRIBLE CHOICE!!!!!!!!!
Meh. Folks voted for him,  not you.  Be thankful you kept your senate seat.
and neither do you
haha no, He wants Bob Croaker
Corker not Croaker lol
Are you saying John Bolton doesn't represent change from John Kerry and Hillary?  This is why you never got on the debate stage.
Please don't even give CNN the time of day. They're ratings r in the tank! Let them stay there! You should be Speaker of the House
Cheer leading for Rand Paul- Secretary of State.
Quit making even more trouble, you are making me--and others--crazy!!  aargh
assuming Donald Trump represents change (hint: he does not) #spending #taxes #legislation #noliberty
BOYCOTT CNN
@obriensarahj01 I agree
please stop Rand.  Your just trying to get press.
U afraid to get ur hands dirty during election-now u want to have a say? And why a @CNN interview?? Don't u pay attention?
I'm trying to get @govpencein to stick with #Hoosiers.
exactly
for Secretary of State the next Thomas Jefferson  @realDonaldTrump @Reince @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump
In other news...

WHY THE HELL IS ANYONE LISTENING TO @wolfblitzer OR @CNN?!?!

#BoycottCNN #BlackOutCNN #TakeDownCNN
if you wanted input to who is selected for the presidential cabinet, you should have won the election
John Bolton is a great public servant.  Hope he becomes Secretary of State.  Trump won.  You didn't make it for President!
I don't think Giuliani was a neocon. He supported the war because he was attacked.
RUDY GIULIANI, not Bolton please!
@realDonaldTrump please take heed.
please read this Senator. It's very important these riots are stopped ASAP. There is definitely an agenda!
RIOTS ARE A FALSE FLAG
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/53429/14768 …   @cristinalaila1 @dbongino @TGowdySC @SheriffClarke @KellyannePolls @FoxNews @LouDobbs 
Notice how the media giving Paul so much attention were Hillary supporters.
either Dr. Paul would be a great choice! @RonPaul
Do not stop tweeting your views!!!!!
@a_place_n_time why don't u call and talk to him rather then running to clinton news network ?
just stop already. Stop undermining and second guessing. It doesn't make you look objective. It makes you look like a jerk.
Bolton is a interventionist and Trump has been pretty non-interventionist, so I hope you're right, Dr.
What would you know about it,, You reluctantly endorsed him and minced words.
Giuliani does? Do you have a pros and cons list? I would love to see it.
@McAllisterDen Walrus mustache, frequent entertaining guest on Redeye. What's not to love?(Don't bore me with this "policy" noise)
Thank you! Keep up the good work, @RandPaul.
Bob Corker is clearly the right man for the job.
Good for you for standing up to oppose him! Courage- we'll need a lot of it in the years ahead!
what nonsense
what change?  Priebus, Ryan, and maybe Bolton represents a change in what?
Why are you trying to act like Paul Ryan?
who would be an acceptable secretary of state in your mind? I want to hear some alternatives.
