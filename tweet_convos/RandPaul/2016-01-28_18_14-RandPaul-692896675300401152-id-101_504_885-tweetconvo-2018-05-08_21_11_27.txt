@FoxNews @RandPaul @megynkelly why is Paul on that stage at all. He is polling at 3%
@TylerBerardi @FoxNews @RandPaul @megynkelly I will give you that! Libertarians do care greatly about the US Constitution.
@TylerBerardi @republicandude @FoxNews @RandPaul @megynkelly well the Constitution  and the Bill of Right :)
@FoxNews @RandPaul neither did our weak congress and spineless president.
@FoxNews @nathirhussein @RandPaul Rand Paul is an idiot
@preueth @FoxNews @RandPaul lol why?
@nathirhussein @FoxNews @RandPaul because you need a huge data set to work with.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Needs more cowbell!
@FoxNews @RandPaul BULLL
How does he know?

@FoxNews @KevinNR @RandPaul

@FoxNews @sudischuricht @RandPaul What he won't say:  That wasn't the point!
@FoxNews @RandPaul I love this man he is spot on He has a bit of Forefathers in him for sure! He is the only candidate that is Presidential!
@FoxNews @RandPaul what sucks is you have you have to buy extra security on your devices to fend off .gov, but the security is useless.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @KevinNR Can this be verified? Stopped attacks arenâ€™t publicized
@FoxNews @tufailelif @RandPaul it helped CIA and Indian intelligence recently
@FoxNews @stephenstephan @RandPaul how do u know
@FoxNews @RandPaul If your not doing anything wrong why does it matter?

@FoxNews @alllibertynews @RandPaul Its the Nanny State complex. I'm scared of losing my freedoms so have to run to daddy govt. We need guns!
@FoxNews @libertydocKaren @RandPaul And they're continuing that plan with #commoncore for workforce development #liberty attack!
@FoxNews @tiffparrish Understand @RandPaul bulk data collection unconstitutional, use constitution then to defeat, rest politics
@FoxNews @tiffparrish Yes @RandPaul made a bold statement, but doesn't know that for sure, especially as it impacts the future.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Don't think we know that at all. Not something whose success s/b trumpeted, may cause terrorists to use other methods.
@FoxNews @RandPaul maybe if blacks were smart theywould not b selling drugs in the middle of the street an get arrested.u sould like Hillary
@FoxNews @KevinNR @RandPaul Do we know that for sure?
@FoxNews @megynkelly @RandPaul 
Paul's been misleading on Cruz-American Freedom act-Requires  Warrants-
Unlike illegal actions of NSA B4.
@FoxNews @megynkelly @RandPaul  #FoxDebate MK cheap bimbo.  Exposed all over the web.
@FoxNews @stephenstephan @RandPaul Is he sure? I mean, aside from the fact that many attacks have been averted, how does Rand know this?

@FoxNews #VIRGINWHISPER 
OMG This guy
#Bigit.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Follow up on this Fox, why are we doing it if it doesn't do anything for our security
@FoxNews @RandPaul Nor will Ted Cruz's arcane idea to duplicate Nixon's failed policy re Cambodia - carpet bombing.  Carpet Bomb terrorists?
@FoxNews @megynkelly @RandPaul Prove that please.
@FoxNews @megynkelly @RandPaul 
True. Even when HHS had the info. #GOPDebate
@FoxNews #VIRGINWHISPER 
All of em on CRACK, IN DENIAL, acting out, TURNING ON THE THE American men and women.that SAY THEY want to defend.
@FoxNews @megynkelly @RandPaul collecting bulk data doesn't stop attacks. The data is used to find the networks after a suspect is ID'd.
@FoxNews #VIRGINWHISPER 
That has Destroyed REAL THREATS. 
These RACIST SEPARATIST. The are WORST THAN TERRORIST. OMG
@FoxNews @RandPaul you sir are dangerous.
@FoxNews @RandPaul. How do you know
@FoxNews @megynkelly @RandPaul  as in the past, we don't live in a dream world. Why do we let the world know how weak military the military
@phelps9369 @FoxNews @megynkelly @RandPaul Perhaps, because, our military is not weak?

@FoxNews @megynkelly @RandPaul the sad irony of the party who authored the Patriot act talking about this ..
.@FoxNews @RandPaul Oh! So I see the #GOPDebate livestream and read #Foxnews tweets instead of hearing it?
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul  For someone who wasn't originally to be on this debate stage, Paul's campaign has won stocking of audience award. @CNN
@FoxNews @RandPaul is this speaking from ignorance or do you have any facts
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul I'm willing to give up some of my privacy in exchange for privacy.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Is he still honking his horn?

@FoxNews @RandPaul He CANNOT know that with certainty!
@FoxNews @RandPaul
Thank you, Sen Paul. But that wasn't the question
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul How does he know this?
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul nor did not having it REMEMBER 9/11!
@wakRtalley @FoxNews @RandPaul Perhaps you're forgetting, the Bush admin had advanced warning of 9/11 and didn't even heighten security.
@Anaxagorasx @FoxNews @RandPaul so did Roosevelt have info on Pearl harbor that is not the issue!
@FoxNews @RandPaul he has my voted because he is honest and true American.
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul Cruz argued against this too
