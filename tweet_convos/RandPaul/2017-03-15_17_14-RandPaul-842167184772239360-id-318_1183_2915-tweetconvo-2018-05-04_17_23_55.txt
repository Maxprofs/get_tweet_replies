We discussed how the White House wants to negotiate. And we brought some reading material to brush up on our negotiating skills
We must stand strong and stand together for real repeal.
@zoombouse -Repeal isn't the problem-it's the immediate replacement that can't wait 2yrs to implement-Put your terms in it
This is the Paul that should be trusted when it comes to fixing the ACA health insurance mess.
Stop!
If he thinks Conservatived are #NeverTrump...he fill get what he wishes for. He can side with RINOs
if that happens, no Obamacare repeal. No tax cuts. It's about American people. Not bruisex egos.
This is why Ryan as leader needs to sort tgis out behind closed door. Then present the bill
I agree..this should be behind closed doors. No more tv appearances.
That quote could easily be used as an example of how the OTHER party sees the GOP. They smell blood and see the infighting. Y'ALL ARE TOAST.
it's after 6, he's not a farmer
Trump is a pos- he has made plenty of bad deals- call his bluff- borrow some cohones from a Democrat.
Freedom causcus ...don't trust Mark Sanford...
But I thought Trump was the master!
Plz contact @AtlasMD 
His plan is so good it's politicianproof.
thx
@RandPaul @RepThomasMassie @freedomcaucus

Use it's proper name - Either Romney 2.0 or Ryancare.
I go with Obamacare 2.0
Too bad you didn't do the right thing and work with responsible Republicans to improve the AHCA.
The people are fed up with the Congressional grandstanding and no action.  Sick of this. Doing nothing costs $$$$$.
you are going to hurt millions of Americans. Why do you care about profit and markets before lives? unlike @RepThomasMassie
IT"S WORSE TO NOT BE UNITED. START HERE IT"S SOMEWHERE! SENATE CAN FIX. VOTE YES.
don't be marks.
I hope you are right. It is important to move forward.Do not fail. Dems have ruined us thus far.
campaign with this slogan next time we had it all and we failed you the american people don,t trust me I vote no
any bill that require 60 votes in the Senate is dead RYANS Bill doesn't require 60 votes
Thank you, now we get to keep the excellent ACA or as you rudely call it, Obamacare.  So glad you defeated Ryan-Trumpcare.
RIGHT ON!  USA HCAccess is the silver bullet.
You look like a freshman making a video to ask a junior to prom
@zoombouse @freedomcaucus -Defeating stalls and disrupts progress. Negotiate for the win with substance
@ladybugwann @freedomcaucus Why so much push back from Ryan,Price &VP? No negotiations? POTUS getting involved?
#FullRepeal  stop  #Obamacarelite  in new bill you are fined if refuse genetic testing
if that is the case...this is even worse. No GVT should have this much power!
Yeah, I think all our guys should try to make our president look bad. Just remember if Trump fails you boys fail
Have to agree with Rand on this. Ryancare is not the answer we're looking for.
Just seems 2me that republicans would rather fight with each other than get something done together
How did you expect with Ryan and Priebus? These two despise Conservatives
@jeffreyatucker @freedomcaucus You endorsed him.  You deserve him.
Doesn't require 60 votes  because of the budgetary nature of the bill.
You are NOT the President.  Get over it!
Let's listen to the man who came in like 10th place running for President over the actual President of the USA..
As the "Resistance" meets to discuss how to defeat republicans in the next election.
DISUNITY is not from God but the enemy.I pray God's wisdom to fix #RepealAndReplace,UNITY of MIND @POTUS agenda.
Write a new national pool healthcare bill now. Take the initiative. Don't just talk, write a better bill
Ocare was rushed thru w/o any repubs & lasted 7 yrs! Why did u call it Ocare lite? I know y but it's wrong. Dems feel right now.
I hope you can change Ryan's bill it will make @GOP & @POTUS a target & promise breaker correct it n house
We The People don't really trust you Rand. GET IT DONE OR GET OUT OF THE WAY! 12-14 hrs/day/7days/week.
You are a solid Republican party and not a democratic party, why act and go against your own Electorate and party??
thank you for your leadership on this.
Not desperate. Get it right. No Obamacare on steroids. No cuts to #SS, #Medicare Don't forsake the poor #Medicaid
@RepThomasMassie @freedomcaucus so hated
Maslow's hierarchy. Physiological needs are physical requirements for survival. If not met the society will fail.
Rand you are wise, creative, funny and effective! 
make a plan the you have had 8 years to get off your ass now do your job. Remove Obamacare now
stick to your beliefs
senator Paul you need to tell John McCain to step down he's lost his mind everything he speaks about is about Putin
#awesome
Way too big a compromise and sell-out. Just walk away - plenty of time left.
I can never get my curls to look so organized/cool messy look like yours
I really hate the ins company bailouts built into the bill. Whether control by ins companies or by govt - it's bad!
Wishing you good luck from TX, but if not this What can you actually get to pass in the Senate?
I like your persistence! Many of us are behind you and praying that your proposal gets passed. 
oh you mean Trumpcare?
big fan but whining without a solution is a lefty approach.
health care needs to go back to the businesses. Cut the corporate tax and incentivize them to provide health.
https://www.paul.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/StopArmingTerroristsAct.pdf … McCain will probably vote no...
Rand, Rand Paul!
@ajwitoslawski @freedomcaucus how about changing what you already got done though negotiations and get it passed and done
@jjmikemike @freedomcaucus get out Rand Paul. You are not part of the solution but the problem. Shut up and do your job!
that stack to the negotiations and give my regards to @POTUS. Thank you for your efforts. You will win.
Trump campaigned on special interest influence.  We are adversely effected in HC and it's in law. Bring
Is there a way to find all HC provisions that became law since Jan 2009?  We want them out as needed.
@hectormorenco @freedomcaucus Don't let Ryan's version pass!!!! Do it right!
ACA is entitlement Dud. Work together and fix it for those who truly need healthcare - without killing rest of us.
Don't listen to McCain Senator Paul, he's an extinct dinosaur and doesn't even know it!
@hectormorenco @freedomcaucus I am as conservative as they come but it is total stupidity to not get this bill agreed on and pass!
You've had years to agree on this and obviously set on your dead asses and now want to object!!
POTUS wants to do right by the American people! Fight for HIM!!!
true dat
@6ofmyown @freedomcaucus why defeat it, why not pull together and make some compromises
Sen @RandPaul is smart..butter up the boss a little bit and put a better option on the table.. Rand2024
.@RandPaul @hectormorenco @freedomcaucus @realDonaldTrump is willing to hear and negotiate with you. Your issue is w/ @SpeakerRyan not him.
THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR US!
@vjeannek @freedomcaucus Please don't pass that junk traitor Ryan is trying to push down our throats!!!
@theMagloughlin @freedomcaucus why is he in a tuxedo
keep the good work you are in my prayers.
you're only talking so that you can get reelected stop that support trump you can't get 60 votes in the Senate
if your bill require 60 votes in the Senate to pass you have no chance get behind Trump
Search all you want but I already have the perfect Obamacare Replacement - but no one really cares.      I CARE!!
Don't settle for anything less than Full Repeal!!! Then you can negotiate any potential replacement.
You better stop pussyfooting around, be BOLD, say what you mean! You have to break a few eggsto make an omelette.
Real question! Why not just fix the Affordable Healthcare Act?
NO DEAL is best-no fixing this turkey..Don't pass it at all-let it die. Healthcare entitlement globalist loaded gun
#Repeal
I'm a strong advocate for the constitution and the right way of doing things. Corruption must go.....
Rand for 2020. Save the GOP and America!
PLEASE MAKE SURE THIS IS CHANGED. THIS NOT WHAT AMERICA VOTED FOR. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN BAMBOOZLED !!!
.@RandPaul .@freedomcaucus #SaveACA
@TruthTalkerUSA @freedomcaucus we are with you Rand! We do NOT want rhinocare/Ryan or Obamacare lite  STAND STRONG 
Give'em hell fellows!
I'M WITH YOU. I JUST PRAY THAT IT IS DONE RIGHT WHERE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD IT THIS TIME.
Its called compromise Senator

#FULLRepeal

#Full Repeal #Obamacare

try to remember that you're all Republicans. Work to gather. Don't squander this opportunity
submitt your changes. You said @POTUS was listing get his help. Don't lose control in 2018 & 2020
Is it true 3 phases of this bill will come together as one?
For God Sake you have to use the system in place to get it passed
You know Dems WILL not pass anything. You have to work to make the bill right. Is it true or not?
How about how to make it right? Are you saying the way they are trying to get the bill passed is wrong?

Keep up the great work @RandPaul @freedomcaucus - you are a pleasure to watch work and a welcomed balance to this government. #MAGA
: Keep in mind President Trump can hold a recall petition rally in any state or district and garner enough signatures
please defeat RyanCare.  Ryan, like Boehner needs to be replaced.
Thanx 4 the FC the Rino's r selling us down the river,
Stop w the defeat Work on Winning FOCUS on positive Repeal Replace Stop wasting time & mugging for media maggots
Thank you, again, Senator Paul. I honestly can't see how you do this day in & day out. I am grateful!
You mean Trumpcare? You had years to propose a solution. You even ran for president without a solution. #unprepared
@woodseysmith @freedomcaucus thanks for standing on your principles
Thank you, Rand Paul!
#RadicalRightToolofConservativeElites

By holding a business tactics seminar?
The educated public doesn't want a repeal.  Listen to your constituents!
Repeal...no replace. Let States run the program as they see fit
myprem before ACA $324 60/40 coverage Now $977 RINOCARE says 15-20% increase for me! I was happy before ACA! FUBAR!
this pic is worth a million dollars. Stand strong true conservatives on health care bill
For fun, let's call it TRYANcare. Saddles Trump and Ryan with outcome, and bonus! Has a nice connotation.
@TadHasse @freedomcaucus  south Florida here to #StandWithRand on the issue of RyanCare/Obamacare lite & support The Rand Plan
YES!
@tom_trotts @freedomcaucus Now you just need #sorospuppet Democrat @SenJohnMcCain on your side.
Nice tux. Very "Step Brothers".
We support #RandCare but its meaningless unless it will get to @potus desk. We trust @potus' phase 1,2,3 plan.
Question is, what is the alternative? Current proposal bad. Will your plan assure care for poor,women & seniors?
You have to go for the whole enchilada-compromise is code for we are screwed again!!
Rand, keep up your efforts. They are appreciated, but not by the money chasers.
@Trumpwatcher @freedomcaucus AMEN - this Dr. Stands with that Dr. Give em HELL, Rand.
that's great but you'd better not leave us with Obamacare.  Find a solution....you had 7 yrs to figure this out.
Can you provide a copy of your plan?
Remember people need healthcare - you all are safe in your plan - do not screw with others
Instead of figuring out how to defeat why aren't you figuring out how to make it work - republican fights - stop
Excellent, don't let up...
whining
We could speed up the progress if we Repeal Congress and then Repeal Obama Care! Article V Convention of States.
We want Obamacare REPEALED-NOT REPLACED -Get Government out of Health Care! Laws applied to us should apply to D.C.
I support you and your fellow conservatives! Love Trump, but time for negotiations!!! 
Repeal, do not replace. Get big government out of our lives.
Please keep insisting on economic freedom.
you need to figure out how to have McCain exposed. He said you work for Putin! He is owned by Saudi Arabia!!
Not plzd w/Ryan's plan.
Remove (GINA) Genetic mandatory report to employers.
@RandPaul Don't understand yur plan.
@POTUS
while u show division w/fellow Repubs, Sen. Schumer is laughing at us
 https://youtu.be/FZ9_gbuy0_w 
@realDonaldTrump
Federal funds can be given back to states, free access to hospitals, clinics, less spend on military.
Whatever you do, ensure that no one from bottom 90% is worse off as a result. :-)
@DineshDSouza @ericmetaxas @DavidLimbaugh @tedcruz #MAGA Americans agree!!! #FullRepeal
Thank you Rand Paul!  Please keep fighting for #FullRepeal
@veganvecoh @freedomcaucus #StandwithRand

You don't have the votes. Explain to us how you can actually pass something that works.
LOVE IT! @RandPaul brings copy of @realDonaldTrump's 'Art Of The Deal' to the @freedomcaucus! Thank you, Rand for fighting for Americans!
Thank You Rand!!
Looking good in the bow-tie RP! #NextBond
did the American voters really elect the Outsider to get "establishment" policies?! No to #ObamacareLite #Ryancare
what the hell were you all up to the last 8 years?  You couldn't come up with a few ideas to pitch?
@RestoreHistory @freedomcaucus Please keep fighting. Government needs to get the heck out of healthcare!!!
@NoSurrender357 @freedomcaucus you can't just pulll the rug out from ppl on the plan - so amend the AHCA if need be
why do you think McCain is trashing Rand Paul today
Go Ran! We can always depend on you 
.@RandPaul @PinkwvPink @freedomcaucus  Form an actually CONSERVATIVE Third Party. MILLIONS of voters would support you. MAKE GOP move right.
@RepThomasMassie @freedomcaucus We need real repeal, not replace and rape Seniors.
Hate our laundry aired in public but I don't trust Speaker & other GOPs. Sounds simple: Repeal & replace.
Senator, you know it is  Unconstitutional 4 Feds to be involved in our healthcare...tell the truth! @KrisAnneHall
Theirs nothing to defeat!  You guys are on the same side, work it Out! How many years do you need ? You've had 8.
Why doesn't Trump listen to you...Ron Paul isn't on anyone's side but his own.
Kill that LOUSY RYAN BILL!!  GET RID OF THIS LOSER SPEAKER NOW!  I ADVISED CAUCUS YRS AGO NOT TO ELECT RYAN(DUNCE)
we need the party to work together, but I agree get rid of Ryancare and replace with Trumpcare
#RepealAndReplace #Ryancare before it's too late.
