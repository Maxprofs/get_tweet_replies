.@RandPaul And yet you said nothing when the #RNC used the same tactic in Iowa 2014  #GOTV? How are you different?
@SenFrankNiceley @RandPaul spin it how you want but this kind of corruption is exactly what we voters are sick of. #IowaCaucus
@LLH713 @SenFrankNiceley Corruption? Confused on how this is corruption.
@Rob_Huddleston @SenFrankNiceley vocabulary is our friend
@LLH713 @SenFrankNiceley Doesn't fit the definition. Perhaps you would prefer a different tact with Frank or myself? #Unlikely #Trumpster
@Rob_Huddleston @SenFrankNiceley no, thanks for the offer but Im good with my words ... If you aren't that's on you
@LLH713 @SenFrankNiceley Happy with my words. I know that Frank & I make a living with them. Nothing on your feed says that you're employed.
@Rob_Huddleston @SenFrankNiceley been employed most of my life two college degrees but thanks for the assumption which says mire about you
@RandPaul
@freedom3556 @RandPaul @tedcruz @glennbeck LOVE IT! At least this is more legit!   #BusTed #RejecTed #AbetTed #HumiliaTed
@thekillingcrew @freedom3556 @RandPaul @tedcruz @glennbeck While this lists Rand as #1, vote for #2 - Bernie
@RandPaul only a taste of things to come if this man gets more power which he craves above all else.
@RandPaul #TedShaming voters is hysterical. He has missed more votes. Time to #AuditTheTed
@RandPaul @NetsBench Then why NOT pull the form he filled out to renounce his Canadian Citizenship in 2014?? Canada Public Records.
@RandPaul @tedcruz showing his true Canadian colors!! Lying to the people of #IowaCaucus and the #USA
@RandPaul We are everything we say we hate! Thin skinned, wimpy "democrats"! Does anyone know how to throw away junk mail? So over this!!!!!
@RandPaul @Nic_O_tine And he's not?
@auntieamy90 of course he is... i am no fan of @RandPaul ... i still remember him running away with his hamburger!
@Nic_O_tine 
Ted Cruz is losing his ass. “@RandPaul: Tactics of a career politician #busTed ”
@breathereal @RandPaul Ya know if Iowa had a photo id requirement the Cruz brochure could have had pictures.
@RandPaul YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE MAILER DID NOT COME FROM CRUZ CAMP right?
@ApeeW26 @RandPaul Doesn't that photo make Canadian born Rafael Edward Cruz look a lot like Elvis?
@RandPaul @tedcruz I am sure @GlennBeck is so proud of his endorsement of Ted Cruz. Both sell outs to the cause of Liberty.   #BusTed
@RandPaul @blackrepublican judging by yours and Rubios attack Cruz is NOT the only career politician!
@RandPaul The only ones that ought to be shamed r those in the Cruz campaign in charge of this invasion of privacy
@RandPaul I don't understand why you are undermining @SenTedCruz. I like your philosophy/policy. You're important voice - no need for this.
@RandPaul Tactics of desperate little man?Supported you twice,but don't know if I can vote4Acoward.Voted4U2opposeMcconnell.Where R U?
@RandPaul Ureally are becoming a small little man.No guts to attackMcconnell but jealous AttackingCruz.Not voting4U2BPOTUS.Senator?Doubtful
@RandPaul Good job clearing the way for Trump!
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz not a natural born citizen. He lies about a lot of things.
@RandPaul Just goes to show a True American would know that. I would not expect a Cananden under stand.
@RandPaul which officially never came from the Cruz Camp. But you'll jump at any opportunity to smear your opponent. Career Paulitician?
@IronHide_81 @RandPaul it actually officially came from the Cruz campaign according to @politico
@RandPaul you would surely know as being the institution of career politics in your family.  Lowering urself is not becoming Rand.
@RandPaul  #StandWithRand arent yall tired of the lies n games we must break the cycle come #StandWithRand donate n lets save USA. Thxs
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  #busTed illegal as always everythin he does is crooked n yet they lkem travesty to America come #StandWithRand thxs
@RandPaul sue him
@RandPaul Thank you for posting this information, kinda surprised were not hearing anything about it on the news yet
@RandPaul You keep pushing your luck treating Cruz this way. Yeah you want his voters I get that but this is not a winning strategy.
Ted is no career politician! @RandPaul Maybe you should focus on your Senate campaign since your Presidential one is nonexistent?
@RandPaul @MichelleWSC glen beck advise
@jamestwiter99 @RandPaul Sounds like something @glennbeck would do, but it's so typical of a loser like @tedcruz
@RandPaul Huh. Campaigning against Ted Cruz, eh? Too bad you're not relevant.
@RandPaul These fliers are NOT from Cruz! We still don't know who they're from yet. #trusTED
You want to talk tactics @RandPaul? http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/rand-paul-2016-kent-sorenson-iowa …  What should #IowaCaucus #Iowa think about this?
@RandPaul So is show votes. planned Parenthood, Audit the Fed. And that's just two. I guess you're even
@coltonjbauer @RandPaul Audit The Fed he has been working 5 years for.  That's not a show vote.  And Cruz didn't even bother to show up.
@Brendan_Noble @RandPaul It's a show vote if it's bragged about and didn't pass
@RandPaul Rand Paul is apparently trying to secure victory for Donald Trump in Iowa by launching these attacks on Ted Cruz.
@RandPaul @PoliticalLaughs im guessing your dad wouldn't approve. So much for that.
@RandPaul Cruz is not what is being sold, he is a big Globalist and so is his wife - he will foment MORE WARS for his masters
.@RandPaul @Thomasismyuncle Gee, couldn't be part of an organized campaign to protect #EthanolSubsidies, could it?
@RandPaul @PoliticalLaughs Wrong, those are tactics of a dishonest person, not ALL career politicians are arseholes like #TedCruz
@RandPaul someone other than Trump needs to win Iowa.
@RandPaul wow!
"@RandPaul: Tactics of a career politician #busTed " OMG BAD NUZ 4 CRUZ!
Hope no elderly were intimidated by this!!!
@RandPaul @tedcruz is a untrustworthy manipulator.
Career politicians smear without evidence. Where's the "piece of literature"? @RandPaul @MomsDement
.@rumpfshaker already covered them. http://journal.ijreview.com/2016/01/252498-said-undecided-iowan-received-controversial-mailer-ted-cruz/ … @grassfed_butter @RandPaul
How about the text showing the mailer is in fact from the Cruz campaign? Still not buying it. @MomsDement @rumpfshaker @RandPaul
No idea. I'm just enjoying the show & sharing the entertainment. #BTFSTTG @grassfed_butter @rumpfshaker @RandPaul
Lots of shady shit. May be true, but no skirts over heads without real evidence. @MomsDement @rumpfshaker @RandPaul
@RandPaul @JimmyPrinceton well..."There is no worse blind man than the one who doesn't want to see." 
@RandPaul how are you not destroying these guys?
@RandPaul why are you not this sassy during KY'S elections? I'll vote for sassy Rand all day
@damnitscloudy @RandPaul Me from KY, Rand Paul has to go to U.S senate to work represent State of KY between trips,talk to KY constituents .
@RandPaul Complete desperation by @tedcruz
@RandPaul Appears to be a tactic of @glennbeck for @tedcruz .Honestly Rand is second choice to @realDonaldTrump Cruz was till Beck came in.
@RandPaul Seems he is attempting to draw attention away from him (TedCruz) being born in Canada. ... #unfollowtedcruz
@RandPaul Rand, two words of advice: smile more. Voters want to elect informed candidates for sure, but not the nerdy kid from grade school.
@hpjr @RandPaul   Read  Face book page  of Sec of State of IOWA
@dovelib55 @RandPaul  Would that be the same state led by a governor openly opposed to Cruz and whose son is an ethanol lobbyist?
@hpjr What does that this has do with ethanol lobbyist? Playing the voting violation game is even serious illegal matter coming frm Cruz's
@RandPaul That is so unbelievably stupid it seems like sabotage.
@don_myrick @RandPaul   Read face book page of Sec of State of IOWA
@RandPaul did he do anything illegal...you could lose your spot as VP...no meanness here I like you,,,my top 3 in Washington
@PenalopeH @RandPaul   Read Face book page of Sec of State of IOWA
@RandPaul @RandPaul Go away and do something more worthwhile like fixing 's.
@jbrambo1985 @RandPaul  Read Face book page  of Sec of State of IOWA
@RandPaul Poor choice on the part of his campaign committee. YOU, on the other hand, intentionally plagiarized. Glass houses and stuff
@gnemalie @RandPaul    Read  the Face book page of Sec of State of IOWA
@dovelib55 @RandPaul what does SoS of IA have to do with Paul's perpetual sanctimonious self righteous bunk?
@RandPaul  C'mon man, you (and Mr Pate) really should look into things before posting, it's already been proven False to of come from Cruz
@RandPaul I think Cruz/Paul would be a dream ticket
@RandPaul @tedcruz   If you hadn't been so buddy buddy with Mitch McConnell, it would be you near the top along with Cruz.
@newkirk_rob @RandPaul @tedcruz Cruz voted for Mitch McConnell for Senate Majority leader
@JustinSzew309 @RandPaul @tedcruz He most likely did. It was better than Harry Reid.
@RandPaul this is exactly why I'm voting for Trump!
@RandPaul I don't see you doing anything more than career politics and token medical work.
@RandPaul I would have gone with "tactics of a craven asshole" but that's just me.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Go around biased Media (fox). Next @realDonaldTrump rally is 3:30p CTl/4:30 East at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMffmPYPH-Q … .SOON!
