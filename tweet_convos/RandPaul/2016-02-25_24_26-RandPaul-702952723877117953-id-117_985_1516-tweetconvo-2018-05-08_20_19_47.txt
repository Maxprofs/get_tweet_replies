The United States has a complicated relationship with the Pakistan government...
Their gov has been considered an ally against terrorism. But they have been duplicitous, human rights abusers, and jail religious minorities
We give them billions in foreign aid while reports suggest they're helping the Taliban...
Enough is enough. I hope you'll stand with me against this ludicrous policy.
@RandPaul yes, agree
@yogendrasirohi3  read Kerry's watery defence? Literally admits know what they are upto but must keep them happy @desertfox61I @RandPaul
@RandPaul Great Resolution #RandPaul  Kentuckians r proud of this. No arms/aid for #Pakistan till they support any kind of terrorism
@RandPaul How much India paid you? What happened to the fairness? It's ok for Pakistani soldiers to die for American cause?
@RandPaul thank you! Is @marcorubio or @SenTedCruz supporting this?
@RandPaul @CChristineFair you cant do this bro
@RandPaul & for some utterly inexplicable reason the U.S chooses to look the other way on pak's continuing covert terrorism against India.
@RandPaul we should look further, Russia Could be a new reliable friend and Allie better than U.S
Remember when we fought the YOUR cold war
@RandPaul HOW YOU SUPPORT INDIAN GOVT THEY FUNDING TALEBAN AND ENVOLVE IN TERRORISM.
@saytriz @RandPaul is actually for ending most all foreign aid. I support this.
@RandPaul sir I wanted to see you as next President of the US. Unfortunate that you left the race
@Ashu16061969 @RandPaul @alllibertynews you can still vote for him you know.
@RandPaul Smh why didn't you win!
@RandPaul Good. Pakistan has their own JF-17. They don't really need F-16.
@RandPaul good,thanks.  That will save us from relying on American military gear,and we got our own JF-17.  Blessing in disguise
@RandPaul thank you. More power to you
@RandPaul with allies like Pakistan,  do we need enemies?
@Kalifornia_blue @RandPaul its another thing that all the supplies to your troops in Afghanistan passes through Pakistan for over a decade.
@RandPaul @Nickbt25 the arm sales is not to the govt of pakistan. It is with the military of pakistan. Period
@RandPaul try & introduce a similar resolution for India & Israel!! Oh Sorry! I forget they're not a muslim state!
@RandPaul Bravo you single handedly put them in Chinese and Russian hands  Just remember Senator
@RandPaul @JohnKerry  Pakistan would eventually end up in Chinese and Russian hands  China the most trusted versus us
@RandPaul Thank you Rand for #StandingWithIndia
@RandPaul Thank you from India, finally a sane voice in the US. India is alone in its fight against decades of terror, we need support. 
@RandPaul Hoping that you will succeed at your mission. The rest of the US govt is crazy to sell it to terrorists country Pakistan
@RandPaul @bhat_sadhana I wlways wonder why US citizens never question their politicians on Pak policy. Remeber osama.. who gave him cover?
@RandPaul Good 
@RandPaul Point to be noted... 
@RandPaul God bless u! More power to you!
@RandPaul @ExSecular @rajkarsewak @TelanganaRedux @mahesh____reddy
@RandPaul Kudos for standing against terrorism and showing spine to introduce a resolution
@RandPaul @sarkar_swati Thx senator for your quick action, please see to that Pakistan is declared a Terrorist state
@RandPaul @CChristineFair I can bet my salary that the 'force is not with you'. :-)
@RandPaul just to please the Indian lobby? We are the biggest victims of terrorism ourself! Need better equipment to crush Terror outfits
@RandPaul Pakistan has a terror supporting military and civilian ldrship
@RandPaul US needs a definite relook at it's Pakistan policy @ethicalman3
@RandPaul OBL harboured by Pak, Daniel Pearl beheaded in Pak, FShehzad Timessq bomber Paki, SanBern couple Paki. Sure, give them more F-16s
@RandPaul @dravirmani In geopolitics, it is na√Øve to expect wysiwyg but with current US admin, it is WYSIWYNG
.@RandPaul @Endless_War How about Saudi Arabia too? They're massacring civilians in Yemen.
@RandPaul @tufailelif And this will also make the world a bit safer. Thanks.
@RandPaul Thank you for standing up for righteousness.
@RandPaul A Big thankyou from India.!
@RandPaul @tufailelif
@RandPaul about time!
@RandPaul @tufailelif i think this lady's writing on it may be of great help -fighting to the end-Christine fair
@RandPaul Dude u guys have destroyed the middle east. What has Pakistan done? Your souls are stained with blood of million of innocents.
@RandPaul @tufailelif  Thank you for  your support for India Cause.
@RandPaul @tufailelif American policy against terrorism seems to be totally biased.
@RandPaul @tufailelif Halving the arms sold, Sir, would be wonderful. Give 'em the F-16s sawn in half.
@RandPaul @omar_quraishi who r the godfather of Taliban and who used them against who z written n history. Read it
@RandPaul @. Good luck buddy. The capita save frm this sordid bargain wud b nvested on the poor masses of pakistan
@RandPaul Great sir,we thought USA giving reward for keeping Osama @s_khushu
@RandPaul much needed, hasn't India and the US suffered enough from pak sponsored terrorism
@RandPaul  Pakistan suffered most from Talibans & what #Pakistan has got from "War on terror"? 
http://bit.ly/nTHdBF 
@RandPaul @ManikTyagi Dr. Paul, pray you succeed.
@RandPaul THIS was expected of US (as always) @Karachi_Post
@RandPaul No no no, we need to be a "better" ally to Pakistan. US hasn't a clean chit, either, and Pak needs real help to overcome. @y2raza
@RandPaul US shd also Consider the Relationship btwn India & US is also affecting by this deal.
@RandPaul Thank you @RandPaul for seeing the light. Hope better sense will prevail and American allies with like minded democracies.
@RandPaul Thank You from the bottom of my heart Dr. Paul !!
@RandPaul @omarali50 it is not arms sales, it is arms donations - Pakistan is broke and does not have money to purchase any arms
@RandPaul  rand Paul you are my favorite  candidates
@RandPaul @redrivergrl How can you not endorse @tedcruz  I guess the Constitution & Liberty are less important than your political survival.
@RandPaul who started selling them ?
@RandPaul. I agree.
@RandPaul good!
@RandPaul Is the deal suppose to happen soon? Why are we arming a nation that has never helped us in our fight against terror. #TRUMPyDeals
@RandPaul hope it gets passed.
@RandPaul this shows either your illiteracy or support for #Taliban an operation #ZarBeAzb has been launched by #PakArmy against #Taliban
Senator @RandPaul calls to halt arms sales to #Pakistan by #USA @meaindia @narendramodi @sushmaswaraj
I introduced a Resolution to halt arms sales to the government of Pakistan. If approved it will stop the sale of F-16s & other military gear
@RandPaul  Awesome good job Rand superb thank u sir! #StillRanding #StandWithRand
@RandPaul Good. Citizens of #Pakistan will only benefit if we don't have to borrow to buy these useless and highly expensive toys.
@RandPaul I'm with you. Just 2 days ago a Pakistani told me the people of Pakistan hate Ameica. 100% truth.
@RandPaul One more reason why Independent Conservative voters despise GOP & are backing Trump.@SenateMajLdr & his group are destroying US.
@RandPaul . Where did they find Bin Laden??
@UNOwen7 @RandPaul @Jason4Liberty care to elaborate? Perhaps with a link to substantiate your claims? I'll wait...
@UNOwen7 @RandPaul @Jason4Liberty ah. I understand. I hope you can understand that BC his office didn't do what u wanted isn't sufficient.
@RandPaul cool dude, can't wait until you lose you're senate seat
@RandPaul I pray it passes. How about 1 against #SaudiArabia ?
@RandPaul And to Saudi Arabia???
@RandPaul im definitely with you. its past time to stop sending Pakistan military aid
@RandPaul that is also the definition of duplicity, yes? By the way, big fan of your father! 
@RandPaul the United States has not listed the Afghan Taliban as a terrorist org. If so, then it is talking to this terrorist org as well.
@RandPaul as far as the Taliban support is concerned, the federal gov is also part of the team alongside Pak, Chia & Af to talk to Taliban.
@topgunn91 i think @RandPaul has deleted ur tweets from his page
@RandPaul From a Democrat: Good for you.
@RandPaul the United States gov is therefore obliged to come true on its agreement for which it also received a price fairly from the buyer.
@RandPaul I support you, but will the other senators?
@RandPaul the agreement was for purchase of 36 F-16s. Pakistan gov paid around $650 mil but never received the aircrafts due to Pressler.
@RandPaul keep at them Mr Paul.
@RandPaul Senator Paul, the sale of 8 F-16s is part of the agreement signed b/w two countries around 2 decades ago for which Pak paid.
@RandPaul what about Saudi Arabia?
@RandPaul What morons put forth a plan to sell military weapons to Pakistan??? No wonder the World is a mess...
@curtiswright @RandPaul it's the corrupt congress + lobbyists. Demand congress term limits now. Stop the criminal congress now.
@RandPaul what about the flow of billions to #Israel? How about curbing an apartheid states appetite for #genocide? #BDS
@RandPaul At least someone is trying to #StopTheMadness
@RandPaul free market bro
@RandPaul Thank you
@RandPaul Hey Rand, maybe you can start showing some integrity now that your campaign is over-stop arms to #Israel & #SaudiArabia
@RandPaul glad to have you in our government. Thank you for everything you do.
@RandPaul Maybe my ignorance but why are we selling arms to anyone?
@RandPaul please endorse #TedCruz... What are you waiting for?
@Justalakegirl @RandPaul Because Ted Cruz is a phony.  Claims to be a fan of liberty but is just as much of a neocon as everyone else.
@RandPaul Tell them to clean out the tribal areas and stop giving protection to the Taliban.
@MJKrause @RandPaul Telling Pakistan what to do is step one of what the US government is doing wrong. #NoTeamAmericaWorldPolice
@RandPaul good to hear you're still fighting.
@RandPaul any interest in a Bernie/Rand 2016 ticket??
@randpaul #Nigerian #soldiers, Are #BOKO_HARAM Their killing unarmed peaceful Biafrans every day in #Nigeria. http://www.igberetvnews.com/621 
@RandPaul go Rand go, fight Rand fight! #standwithoutrand
@XHeresJohnnyX @RandPaul not a chance
