Why pay back? Think about the causes, make a cut, throw away your FIAT-money (US$), and restart financial system! 
We definitely need to get rid of FED/Debt is $ scam.Default on non-USA held debt. Stiff Asia. FED will do it w hyper!
The FED debt money system brought the world to the point, where we are today, nearest to collaps.

Great Suggestion! Let's run the government like we run our household.
Thank You!

Steer clear of that nonsense that @SpeakerRyan is peddling. Make the tough cuts!

@SenSchumer @POTUS @NancyPelosi You want to freeze spending, balance budget, but back ACA Repeal, increases deficit by $390B+?
I agree with you that your party is hippocrateville!! They are literally running around with their pants on fire!
Did you tell that to the rest of the Republicans? It seems that the proposed budget is not going that way.
With all the demands for free shit, why isn't anybody demanding government be free?
Did your momma not tell you not to piss into the wind
please don't gut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security just to balance the budget!
Nah, they'll do that for their own retirement superfund
How about cutting the spending 5% per year starting NOW?
IF "ObamaCare" is repealed, may I please have a refund of my tax returns that were withheld for not having insurance?
No $ to "vetted" Syrian rebels or Ukraine DEFUND the UN we don't need them Cut $ to CIA Give $ to Border patrol until WALL is up
the country living within its means? Madness! Who could imagine such a thing?
and limit EO by president
I'm down with both of these ideas.
We don't want or need a "balanced budget" in 5 years. WE WANT A REDUCTION IN DEFICIT! #taxeskill#deficitssuck#drasticmeasures
Better u take care of the elderly, and refurbish the military to match putin etc.  !
yasss!!
Here, here!
I will put forward a budget that freezes spending and balances the budget over a 5 year period. 
#dontrepealACA
Although "Austrian" austerity was a terrible idea in 2011, with the economy near full employment it's now alright.
rand Paul 2024
Balanced budget in 5 years years of an 8 year term!  Under budget, ahead of schedule!!
Love to save money, cut the waste but don't cut military and intelligence, need to be safe
Starting wars makes me feel safe too.

Dems and GOP constantly point to a balanced budget as a positive of Bubba's term. Why have they both opposed one since?
Come on, you know @realDonaldTrump won't go for this. How will he funnel money to Russia? #nowaycomrade
No, we don't think he does. Why do you say that? @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
Not sure what RAM has to do with anything, but we checked and have plenty free, please explain.
5 years?!? 
How about tomorrow? And how about we cut spending to 1988 or maybe 2000 levels?
Balance the budget? That's just CRAZY talk, sir! Possibly even a little racist! :)
Go gettem!
