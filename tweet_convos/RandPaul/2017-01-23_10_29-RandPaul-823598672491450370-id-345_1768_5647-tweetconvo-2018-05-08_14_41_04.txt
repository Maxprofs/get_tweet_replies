#Canadadoesitbetter
but isn't that exactly what funds the Wars??? So now what??
I thought you were a Libertarian.

"Preach"...1 word, 1 meme reply.
I mean...mine at least had a meaning and voiced support for a good cause...yours was just a black twitter meme so gg
Mine had meaning. Judge Judy rolling her eyes at your "meaningful" tweet. 
"gg"? Jeez. 
Bye!! Lmao.
jesus christ you wanna be black twitter so bad lmao
I beleive I said bye. Nice how you want to bring lives into the cworld, yet your racist. Black twitter I am I guess! 
"PREACH"!
You do realize that the Hyde amendment makes it illegal to use taxpayer money for abortion.
Abortion is good for pop control
yes it is
They are only zygotes and if you are against it for religious reasons there are Bible verses that abort
or condoms, contraception, health clinics in rural locations. I thought you were a medical doctor, act like one.
@FoxNews I love all the MEN in a circle DECIDING on abortion.... idiots
Show me even one case where a medical abortion was needed to save a life!
What you are doing is grasping at straws attempting to justify the murder of millions of babies and the sale of their parts!
idiots
Hear Hear
This policy kills women. Are they not considered innocent life, too?
@FoxNews so you're not really for individual liberty, at least for women.
.@RandPaul it doesn't. That's what the Hyde amendment was for.
Did he just say taxpayer money should never be used to promote the taking of innocent human life? That's cute.
@FoxNews Why do men think they should control my reproductive rights?#ResistTrump
we don't. We want you to pay for your own birth control/ abortion. That's all.
This harms women.
USA believes in protecting, LIFE, LIBERTY and the PURSUIT of HAPPINESS. Abortions after 2 months are murder.
@FoxNews
thank God a rich white man like you  is here to voice his irrelevant opinion on women's health issues..
I can guarantee you that Rand knows more about the law/world affairs than you do
but please, feel free to respond with "but muh vagina"
not a law or world issue its a women health issues. Really tired of men saying they know more about
my body then me, so kindly go get pregnant and then decide if you know more bout this issue/
Then you understand that the baby has a separate DNA & heartbeat...not your body!
Americas women will abort you all if you dont cease and desist this fertility cult jihad against them. @RandPaul @FoxNews
Well that's about the dumbest thing I've read today.
Pardon my DOD education 12 schools in 12 yrs from Mass. Bay to Tokyo Bay. How would you write it Headmaster? @morgan_mc @RandPaul @FoxNews
Well, "America's" and "don't" first of all. I was talking about the statement.
God made me a man to love & defend women. I do against all who would impose a fertility cult State upon them @morgan_mc @RandPaul @FoxNews
God made man to defend children, too. Or are they just not good enough for you?
God gave woman all authority over the womb. Not to man, State, or hypocrites fertility cult religion.  @morgan_mc @RandPaul @FoxNews
Yeah, you're going to have to show me where it says that.
Except those organizations in other countries are using their own money with regard to abortion, not the federal funds.
Y’all claim to want limited federal government, but clearly you want federal influence on things that you happen to find importnt
yeah, but removing government money from abortions is removing government from abortions. How is it not?
Government money doesn’t go towards abortions.
@FoxNews abortions are a woman's health issue, not murder. It's foolish to criminalize abortions. Raising a child is life changing
what we need to do is support the minority of women that choose to make such decision. That their health is looked after,
that the procedure is done adequately. What do you want? women to use hangers? It's a public safety issue- not criminal.
what we want is for women to stop using abortion as Birth control. 9$ walmart & no one has to die
who the fuck uses abortion as birth control? No one wants to have to make that decision, but sometimes it's necessary.
Lots of people do I personally know someone who has had 3 for no other reason than she "wasn't ready to be a mom" it happens
Women's March Louisville.  Your constituents disagree with you
This country has a separation of Church & State, & there is NO non-religious reason for this. This order is un-American.
You are right! That's why the state cannot pay for Satanic ritual killing of the unborn!
and yet my taxes go to the military, prisons, salaries of senators like you who want to take away healthcare...incredible
@FoxNews Libertarians for forced childbirth at gunpoint!
It's the Age of Information; if you don't know about your 'options' by now, get a mental check up.
Then the $ would be better spent providing INFORMATION, birth control, etc. Ignorance is no excuse.
Abortion is a multi-billion dollar industry - those providing it can PAY for promoting it.
I reiterate; abortion is a multi-BILLION $ industry - let the providers PAY for access to info.
But you're OK with US forces blowing the fuck out of innocents in other countries, & taking health INS away from living people @RandPaul
Sorry, my friend, but this is false logic. You cannot justify one crime by another.
@FoxNews Then STOP all wars, dipstick.
you clearly don't know rand Paul he's fought against illegal wars try again
I know him well enough to know he's a hypocrite.
No you don't.
LOL.
Okay, hon.  What ever you say.  Thanks for adding to the conversation.
I certainly make more sense in this conversation than you do.
y’all make it very clear you’re comfortable with poor women suffering because you feel the need to be “right"
it's not ok for a women to suffer but killing a baby is ok?
A woman deserves control over her own body. The government should not be allowed to control it.
I agree 100% governments job is to protect the US citizens bottom line.
except, again, this is not about removing money from the budget. It’s picking different groups to fund
Saying they will not fund certain groups does not mean the money is just not going to be spent abroad
not yet it's a path in the right direction.
not on sme bck in the day old school no longer relevant ideology. U say liberty and freedom but there u are advocating its absence
what happened to all the innocent who lost jobs and homes because of a lack of oversight. Realign the focus on the real problems
taxpayers $ should be used 2 stimulate elitist pkts $$. Fed reg is a gd thing, lrn from the rest of the world. #Canadadoesitbetter
@FoxNews Isn't it bad enough that your views on abortion are wrong?  Now other countries who we help are forced to comply?  Idiots
@FoxNews but Senator you are against wick programs that help infants!
@FoxNews cunt.
Are we going to stop giving billions to Israel? I think they have abortions?
Senator, you are out of line. Supporting this ex. order is basically saying you don't care about women's health.
Sir, I thought you believed signing executive orders are against US constitution. What is your position now?
Gag order is not good. Telling people their choices should be promoted.  Zygotes & embryos & sperm are not human beings.
religious belief not rooted in science. Government not the place to legislate religion. best left to church. My body my choice
That is not the MCP....this prevents ngos to use US $$ if they have OTHER sources that pay for counseling or abortion. HUGE difference.
back alley abortions are real this is not the answer you know that your an MD for crying out loud! You lost my support
When up for re-election you have lost my vote!
It is so hilarious how you go hard on abortion, yet you do nothing about guns which by the way also take a lot of lives.
Most gun owners are responsible. It's criminals who break the gun laws. More laws means nothing to a CRIMINAL. However, as far as...
@FoxNews I agree.
This was a bad decision & why I'll vote against you.
you know USG doesn't pay for abortions; this policy just makes it harder to do the important family planning work we help support.
@FoxNews no one likes either of you
@FoxNews  @POTUS this is one that I actually agree. 
@FoxNews - TY!
We need to pull all funding for abortion period. We should demand this right now.
doesn;t matter that our country slaughters thousands of innocent women and children what a FKN hypocrite
6 billion people now inhabit the earth we need abortions to stop the unwanted from being born into a life of servitude. SLAVERY??
but is it  viable-outside-the-womb life?
This is going to give all the idiot female democrat supporters something to bitch over now. Damn Rand.
Aside for bombing other countries of course, I'm sorry: "Terrorists". 

Incidentally, we ran out of bombs last year! God Bless USA
it never was in the first place. Way to listen to the "people", not just "your people".
So, you are saying you will defund U.S. military?
you mean like wars do?
@FoxNews no they should just die later when there's no food, medical care or hope for the future.
Or be put in an adoption agency or foster care where there are hundreds of thousands of children that still need families & love!
@FoxNews this piece of paper like yourself is nothing but partisan politics and only shows how little gov't has progressed.
Hey I know you know this because you're not stupid like the @POTUS. "#Abortion can't be #banned only safe abortion can be banned."
Govt spends BILLIONS on wars (sanctioned and unsanctioned) which kill millions. A ridiculous comment from a privileged tool.
woman shouldnt be forced to have a baby by a MAN who FORCED HISELF onto her!!
@FoxNews So, what is the purpose of the military budget?
@FoxNews so can you please share The List of how our money is being used? We might all applaud you, or not?!
Disagree with this one. My choice alone. This will put women in poor countries at risk.
Poor countries...when is it ever going to be our own country we help??
we should take the #PlannedParenthood funding and put it in the adoption system. 
#AmericaFirst
Dangerously mendacious statement by Rand Paul. Funding for family planning around globe REDUCES abortions. This from libertarian?!
@FoxNews @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi "Global Gag Rule" extends beyond restricting women abortions. http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/trump-global-gag-rule …
Does this mean you will be withdrawing taxpayer money for drone strikes and military intervention that take innocent lives?
@FoxNews bollocks to you sir
@FoxNews hope your viagra fails
@FoxNews good to see patriarchal rule has risen again. NOT. 
Except in war right?
Best stop using taxes for military funding then e.g drones, bombs, bullets...
what about War and Invading other countries then you cockwomble.....
Unless you're starting a war, presumably?
@FoxNews what about all the innocent lives taken by war?
If taxpayer money should never be used to promote the taking of innocent life are you going to defund cops/military?
How about when you're repeatedly raped in Sub-Saharan Africa by entire armies? By your father,brother? This is the reality of many
Rand Paul if u were Russian u would be with friends but ur not and ur not Just Trump in a new suit
good to be voice for a voice less, #unborn kids. We don't hv the right to kill others even we are woman.
Stand your ground. You've lost a lot of it.
@FoxNews you're a twisted fool who is absolutely wrong.
@FoxNews Geez more lies I guess this is the alt fact world we live in now
@FoxNews our taxpayer $ goes to ending human life all the time #war
@FoxNews Yes young girls used for sex slaves and repeated raped should also be forced to have the rapist babies
Except when those innocent lives belong to little brown children killed by drone strikes, right?
can we please get an end to taxpayer $$$ going to factory farms? #vegan
only thing this will do is make birth control more inaccessible and increase unsafe abortions.
cant wait till we vote you out. Our bodies our rights.
That money paid for healthcare not abortion and you know it.  Another GOP liar!
: But the money is being moved
 and used secretly.
Taxpayer money should be used to stop overpopulation, women dying from unsafe abortions, and decrease the number of orphans.
This action defunds programs that provide free contraception in Africa which still has a major AIDS epidemic. Feel so great, now?
We shouldn't be paying for ANY foreign health care outside of disaster aid, epidemics/pandemics or providing vaccinations.
@20thcenturymora @FoxNews Rediculous! You will take more lives trying to save the unborn... # hypocracy #nonsense #staaaaap
If your mother thought of aborting you it would take your life&in some cases hers. Life is sacred
get mor creative comrade! Surely you can come up with better than that! It's what Putin pays you for!
Dear Hamster,Im working on my Ph.D. what high school did you graduate from?
I'm still in elementary school comrade! Lolz! #lovethetrolls
Shut up @RandPaul your drunk
@FoxNews and abortions will increase again by 40% like last time Bush reinstated it
now they will just pay to bury all these dead unhealthy women
also just read like any scientific article
AMEN.
@FoxNews     Wahoo! I  babies!
@whostheidiotnow @RandPaul *you're
Taxpayer money shouldn't be used to create laws to regulate our bodies. How about keeping government out of our uteruses?
then stop using my tax dollars to bomb other countries, taking innocent lives
Surely you have a basic understanding that that is a tiny portion of this? If not, you're not doing your job.
yes!!
@TlrWorldWidellc @FoxNews Of course, you can expect the rate of innocent lives being taken to go up after this, but whatever.
let's call pro-life what it is, "pro-fetus". With GOP, protecting the innocent doesn't apply once the child is born.
The Helms Amendment has prevented U.S. tax dollars from funding overseas abortions since 1973.
@FoxNews and yet you're the messiah of Libertarians...I don't get it.
You're delusional.

Aren't you a libertarian? I guess the government should get out of everyone's lives with the exception of pregnant women.
@FoxNews A very white male thing to say. How about women who've been raped? Did they make a choice to get pregnant?
@patrickmadrid @FoxNews Thanks be to God! 
@FoxNews the US does not pay for abortions. That is a LIE!!!
@DiAlegna @FoxNews  I had no idea. Bad enough for paying for our own, nevermind theres. Does that not border on genocide?
the one thing I can't back you up on rand :/
@FoxNews Thank you Senator
so no more drones either? How about police reform? Don't stop with the unborn Senator, please.
yes because when your government drops bombs on middle eastern cities that's not "using taxpayer's money to harm innocent life"
so you want to take away $ being used for life-saving healthcare, and not ever abortions.... ok guy
Then taxpayer dollars shouldn't go to police forces.
so you'll be gutting the drone program next?
I like how you said innocent lives because you fraudulent christians still support the death penalty.
@FoxNews he must not know about our foreign policy. good thing drone attacks only kill terrorists...oh, wait
Thank God I have a white, privileged, male speaking on my behalf because I can't make decisions for my body myself.
You have to start somewhere!
but it's okay to use taxpayer's money to go to war and "accidentally" kill dozens of innocent lives? Help me understand that.
are you ok with "military aide"
You would applaud that you miserable #sonofabitch.  Will send you knee pads so you can keep BLOWING Trumps WEENY. #TheResistanceGQ
@FoxNews Good thing we don't use taxpayer dollars to bomb innocent civilians around the world.
Yes, protection of the most innocent people among us!
does your "God" tell you that or do you not understand what abortion is for?
@patrickmadrid @FoxNews God Bless You President Trump for saving the lives of the unborn!
Ending funding to NGOs helping people is never ok.  You'll definitely be taking lives, now. #resist
Libertarian my ass
@realDonaldTrump Wouldn't want someone with a uterus to legislate uteri! Can't trust women to make their own decisions #sarcasm
@bp207crafts @FoxNews how do all these man haters get pregnant in the first place 
@FoxNews But taking women's lives is ok
who is taking women's lives?
If you refuse to give women information that can save her life then I believe you are colluding in her death
kill the forest to save a tree? Your health views are 19th century death by ignorance.
@FoxNews so concerned about the fetus but fuck em when they're born and living off the state. Am I right?
I tired of all these MEN deciding what's best for a WOMAN'S body.
@FoxNews but cops have killed black children and were on paid leave and no jail. Was that not tax-payer money? Aiyana was SEVEN
@FoxNews are u going to take care of them if they hv zika? You should hv ur dick cut off @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @VP
Yay @RandPaul!
what about lives behind the wall, the refugees, the victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault...are these not innocent lives?
@FoxNews Though definitely different but definitely related, why would we spend so much on our military? What about innocent life?
@FoxNews are u fucking kidding me
@FoxNews Better to use taxpayer money to have women die in childbirth - See Texas dear Rand
well, if ya aren't gonna take care of the kid and provide it with a good life without religious brainwashing, it might as well die
your father voted against civil rights tho
Planned Parenthood offers more than abortions, hence the PLANNED part. No one wants a surprise family, or be forced into one.
Women deserve better than the government enacting on religious dogma to infringe on their right to choose. #ProtectTheFirst
@kathrynprieto So lets stop funding Israel?
Why?
Because they are the #1 (after the US) terrorist state? They support endless war? They cause blowback on us? NOT our friend?
Trump, Use tax dollars to abort babies. Why not, libs the time is now to have this fight too. @RandPaul @PPact #abortionaccess
IS NOT FUNDED WITH OUR MONEY
@FoxNews - it doesn't work that way and hasn't since 1973, but interesting to know you don't care about women raped in war zones
@FoxNews then pay for them while they're alive. Sorry you like the pipeline to prison.
@FoxNews I am pro abortion, so I disagree with you on that; nonetheless, I don't like my money being spent abroad!
Amen 
And I applaud you @RandPaul! You and your father @RonPaul have always had our country's best interests ahead of your own. Thank you both!
@FoxNews Stop spreading lies b/c the HYDE AMENDMENT stops abortions from being performed w/ this law. Why is family planning bad?
.@RandPaul Um...What about US bombs that kill civilians and death penalty cases where innocents are killed? #hypocrite
Then wars shouldn't be financed by tax money either. Sell bonds like it was before.
