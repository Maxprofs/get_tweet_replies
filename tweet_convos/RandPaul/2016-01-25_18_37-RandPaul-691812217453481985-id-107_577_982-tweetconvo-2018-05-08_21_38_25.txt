@RandPaul @BernieSanders You can find a 'study' to back any point of view....
@TheJimLanahan @RandPaul @BernieSanders So let's ignore faux studies and be guided by the Constitution.
@rich_marie @RandPaul @BernieSanders We're discussing his tweet which included a study. You shouldn't be a politician. You'd lose debates.
@TheJimLanahan @RandPaul @BernieSanders Your tweet just negated the validity of every study by acknowledging they can be cherry-picked.
@rich_marie @RandPaul @BernieSanders No. My tweeted negated the validity of politicians cherry picking studies.
@TheJimLanahan @RandPaul @BernieSanders LOL Semantics. End result is the same. Are you against the Constitution? Or only for your own agenda
@rich_marie @RandPaul @BernieSanders It's not semantics. It's intent.  BTW - We're not discussing the constitution here, so stop trying.
@TheJimLanahan @RandPaul @BernieSanders This is Rand Paul. The Constitution (with a capital C, btw) is always the point . And should be.

hmmm, i see correlation here
@dL_1337 That's state gun ownership
@Sebastian_JKT the claim had no adjectives....relying on that type of argument is doomed to lose
@dL_1337 How long have you been following me?
@Sebastian_JKT ur position: right to self defense contingent on legal guns don't lead 2 mass shootings?
@RandPaul @jmm861 @BernieSanders It doesn't matter. People who do not need to have a gun should not own one.
@pamalyons  when our local Sheriff tells us to arm themselves becuz it takes longer than 20-30 minutes for them to get to you.... We listen!
@jmm861 In that case Jane I can see the point. I just don't have the finances to get into guns. Everything cost money.
Legal gun ownership is not the problem.  A society who values NO other person & with no guidance on morality IS.
How a Conservative-Led Australia Ended Mass Killings @RandPaul http://rss.nytimes.com/c/34625/f/640350/s/4bff0f4f/sc/7/l/0L0Snytimes0N0C20A150C120C0A50Cworld0Caustralia0Caustralia0Egun0Eban0Eshooting0Bhtml0Dpartner0Frss0Gemc0Frss/story01.htm …  #DemTownHall #p2
@Politics_PR @RandPaul That's a lie, the Cairns children stabbings was a mass killing that happened 18 years after the 1996 buyback.
@KlasikiEllada @Politics_PR @RandPaul ban knives
@thebenda @Politics_PR @RandPaul Ban fire, arson attacked killed 11 people again 15 years after the buyback program https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers_Hill,_New_South_Wales#Nursing_home_fire …
@RandPaul @ZachTMulcahy @BernieSanders I- Wh- HOW STUPID ARE YOU!?!
@MrUberCyborg @RandPaul @BernieSanders I retweeted it because I plan on reading it soon.
This tweet didn't age very well, Senator Paul
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Since when did socialists need real correlations? How's this for a correlation....socialism fails. Everywhere.
@RandPaul @mises @BernieSanders in fact the largest mass murders have been committed via explosives
@RandPaul @JunkScience @BernieSanders But there IS between gun free zones & firearms permitted areas.Gun free zones beg for violence, get it
@RandPaul bs - other countries that have major gun control don’t have mass shootings like we do.
@caleurogal @RandPaul Did you see the shooting in Canada School last week?  Stop listening to the fear factor.  Look up how guns save lives.
@ChiTownGirl48 @RandPaul That's one - we have tons - Guns are BS
#NomoreNoBrainers Dems need to stop trying to sell us out to the United Nations.#StandyouGround #Republicans
@RandPaul @BernieSanders you do know that australia gun crime decreased 50% and overall crime by 30% when they made guns illegal right?
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @BernieSanders Oh shit, I wanted to rt & like this but then I saw who said & changed my mind.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders So why are all your venues gun free zones ?
@RandPaul @TigCook there is a correlation between mass murders and liberal democrat  wackos
@RandPaul @BernieSanders then why are there no mass shootings in Australia? Where no one owns guns?
@RandPaul
@RandPaul @BernieSanders you like your 2nd amendment you can keep your 2nd amendment #DemTownHall
@RandPaul can you name a single mass shooter who was not a gun owner?
@RandPaul it's too bad we can't study gun related issues, because you and your buddies keep blocking research from happening
@RandPaul guns are killing machines. they are evil. sometimes they are a necessary evil, but they are undoubtedly evil
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Except that they owned guns or their family members owned guns...seriously @RandPaul?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @YerRamautarsing
@RandPaul @BernieSanders There is...it's an INVERSE correlation.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders and there's no correlation betw fossil fuels & climate change. And tax cuts for rich people improve the economy.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Really? But there is with deaths in the homes of gun owners.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders It's kind of hard to commit a mass shooting without a ready arsenal to draw from.
@RandPaul you can't fix stupid people...@BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders, Sanders is a run away clown.  Shouldn't he be in a nursing home?
@RandPaul @Wary12 @BernieSanders  Bkgrd  4 one- so bkgrd chks 4 all. Sen  Paul, you aren't suggesting no bkgrd chks, huh? #StopGunViolence
@RandPaul ....think this Libertarian nut would be tweeting this if he had a child killed in a mass shooting? #HellNo.
@RandPaul @Gun_Shots at least get the finger off the trigger please
@RandPaul @BernieSanders the shooters aren't using straws and spitballs, Randy!
@RandPaul @Gun_Shots @BernieSanders A negative correlation? I.E., you can predict that as ownership increases mass shootings decrease?
@RandPaul @Gun_Shots @BernieSanders hey that's an xds!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders so what's ur point? Oh right ur paranoid. The gov is going to take everyone's guns away!!! 
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Really? If the perpetrators of mass shootings hadn't had access to guns there would have been no mass shooting.
@theBTWprince gun are killing machines. that is their purpose. our counties obsession with them is not the sign of a healthy society
@theBTWprince our obsession with guns is as disturbing as my spelling
@RandPaul @BernieSanders pretty sure there is at least some, if you don't have a gun you aren't mass shooting anyway lol #DemTownHall
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Correlations between poverty and violent/gun crime, education/ownership, and education/gun crime exist, though.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Most of the guns used were registered in someone else's name.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders that's not exactly what he says
.@RandPaul but there is a very strong correlation between mass shootings and gun free zones @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders  The obvious response is you can't do a mass shooting if you don't have a gun.  #ImWithHer
@RandPaul Guns are legally purchased in 80% of mass shootings but that stat probably doesn't mean much to you
You don't get to participate in this debate either Randy. Go beg for crumbs from the RNC. @RandPaul @BernieSanders
@RandPaul The United States is #1 (by far) in terms of gun ownership, and we’re also #1 in mass shootings. That's objective a correlation.
@RandPaul What does that have to do with #gunsense ? Lord! @MamaRedfield @MomsDemand @sandyhook
@RandPaul @BernieSanders As long as there are gun shows, we will always hear about the infamous nonexistent "gun show loophole" from the Dem
@RandPaul @BernieSanders .....Rand Paul is on crack.
@AlecStopalec @RandPaul @BernieSanders Are you selling it to him?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders very wrong philosophy it dependents on mental health & intentions.... Do they can judge des in a going 2 b owner
@RandPaul @BernieSanders what I've learned is that Bernie should not be able to purchase a gun.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Audit Mental Health Grants
@RandPaul @BernieSanders liar liar pants on fire..
@RandPaul @BernieSanders so gun shop owners aren't liable-- oh wait they are my bad.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders but there is a correlation between gun availability and mass shootings.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Harvard University disagrees with you... And very partisan Mises Institute http://bit.ly/1frRK2W  #DemTownHall
@RandPaul @BernieSanders people with guns kill people. I bet if the NRA didn't give politicians money they would support gun control.
.@RandPaul @BernieSanders Harvard School of Public Health: "Where there are more guns there is more homicide."

@RandPaul @BernieSanders wanna bet?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Increase Informed Consent in Mental Health, Release the Mental Health Records of Shooters!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders no guns means no freedom,  slave to government.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders oh Rand. Come on. I like you sometimes. #openyoureyes
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Tell that to the nut cases in Oregon threatening to take out FBI agents if they go to arrest them #DemTownHall
@PaulRizzo504 @RandPaul @BernieSanders ....they're "patriots".  LOL
@RandPaul Quit intruding into @BernieSanders dream world with your facts!!
@randpaul @berniesanders @stevesgoddard there does seem to be a correlation between being a liberal democrat, and shooter.,...of masses
@RandPaul @BernieSanders this is an AUSTRIAN study?  Really?  How can WE fact chect that?
@RandPaul Nobody cares what you say dude. Give it a rest.
@RandPaul live tweet Hillary also.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders EXACTLY, DR. PAUL!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders So none of the people who have committed mass shootings owned guns? Seems suspicious but ok.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders why not get illegal guns off the street and the sons holding them in jail. End of story
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Straw Man purchase is already a federal offense.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie will save you $5,000 on healthcare, and will take the $5,000 you saved and more
US has more guns than ever, crime/murder rates lowest in 40 years. Gun banners don't care about facts. @RandPaul @BernieSanders #guncontrol
@RandPaul @BernieSanders There's no correlation between #FeelTheBern and common sense.
@RandPaul 45% of guns used in Chicago crimes come from lax Indiana gun laws.
@MillennialProg @RandPaul Chicago is not in Indiana??
@donniepolitics yeah duh, but its a 20 min drive away.
@MillennialProg different laws apply to different states
@donniepolitics I shouldn't have to explain how driving across a border works. My god.
@MillennialProg no duh... I hope you know though that most of the gun crimes come from the "bad" areas on Chicago... Getting it illegally
@donniepolitics I live in the damn city. I know the neighborhoods. You have to stop and move on to someone else
@MillennialProg huh?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders don't think that data hold true
@RandPaul This article's methodology is worse than Donald Trump's.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders  only thing the mass shooters have in common with each other is there all on prescription medication #MedMoney
@RandPaul @BernieSanders EXACTLY! Thank you Dr Paul!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Really? Ever heard of a place called Sandy Hook Elementary School?
@PostSurgeOp @RandPaul @BernieSanders Seriously? It wasn't the kids guns, he killed his mother and took her guns...
