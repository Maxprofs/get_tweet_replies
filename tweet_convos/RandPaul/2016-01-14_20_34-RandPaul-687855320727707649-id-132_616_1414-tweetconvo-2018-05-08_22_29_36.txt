@Trumps1stMember Clearly Trump's juvenile name-calling extends to the rest of his team. @RandPaul beat him without even needing to be there.
@antodav @RandPaul only thing rand paul beat was the race to see who can look most like a wet poodle
@Trumps1stMember @antodav @RandPaul If we're going to talk hair.... No too easy. #TrumpBecauseThinkingisHard
@CrackieCrackins @antodav @RandPaul yes and you are a deep thinking obama voting teenager, right?
@Trumps1stMember @CrackieCrackins I'm 100% pro life but you and the rest of your trump support friends make a case for allowing abortion!!!
@bighusker21 @CrackieCrackins excuse me...only for rosie oddonnell
@Trumps1stMember @CrackieCrackins we can agree that she fits the criteria.
@RandPaul @marcorubio  Only if Obama and Hillary get time to respond, too!
@RandPaul @marcorubio then show up and not back down
@RandPaul @marcorubio you've got to show up to be heard :)
@LauraBabcock @RandPaul @marcorubio clearly not, since more people heard him loudly and clearly here than any of the noise on stage.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState Rand is the only POTUS 4 me. Stay out of my business & stop blowing my $$ on bombs
@RandPaul @marylene58 @marcorubio You should have been there instead of @JohnKasich RINO stump. Would have been more interesting
@RandPaul No, as you chose to pout @marcorubio
@RandPaul @marcorubio  I like you don't ruin it! B Presidential like your Dad.
@RandPaul @paulcurtman @marcorubio @RedState LOL
@RandPaul @marcorubio Congratulations Dr. Senator Rand Paul!!! You won, again!!! Not only do we need you in DC, we need your Media Savvy!!!!
@RandPaul Hey Randall we missed you at the kiddie debate! Hopefully we see you at the next one, 6pm est!
@RandPaul @marcorubio
@RandPaul @marcorubio You could have been on stage. Where were you? Rand, Ted, and Marco failed leadership in House and Senate.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul @marcorubio @andria_diamond Lol
@RandPaul I heard @FoxBusiness invited you to their debate. Don't you think you need to be at the debate to respond? #GOPDebate
@RandPaul @marcorubio I think you have to be polling higher than I am to get on stage. Looking forward to your failed attempts for decades.
@RandPaul @TheMightyWord @marcorubio @RedState You should have had Bush's spot. They still would have had 3 Progressives. @DLoesch
@RandPaul @marcorubio no vote stay at home, that's exactly what most are doing anyways 
@RandPaul @marcorubio  That was a good one Dr. Paul.. as phony as Rubio is to me.. I wish you would have had all of his time
@RandPaul Of course Cruz supporter kind of waste in thought..lol
@RandPaul #RandRally #StandWithRand
@RandPaul @marcorubio All I wanted was for someone to call out Rafael for missing the fed auditing bill, but I knew only you would have. sad
@RandPaul @ImpactDemocracy @marcorubio @RedState no. You don't. Shut up.
Its a shame Cruz didn't show up to the Audit the Fed vote  @BarryMaicock1 @RandPaul @marcorubio
@RandPaul @marcorubio You Quit, Who Would trust you now?? #Quiter #GOPDebate
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState no you get 30 seconds of @marcorubio destruction!
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @marcorubio @RedState Guess people areslow here Randgot shamed if udont knowmoreonit keepyour ignorant opinionto urself
@RandPaul @marcorubio good one except you are on twitter duhhhh
@RandPaul you were so missed at tonight's debate, standing up for our Constitution when the others have plans to violate it.
@RandPaul @marcorubio RandPaul is a petulant child. I want center stage & if I don't get it I won't go. I'm taking my marbles & going home.
@RandPaul u made a mistake not showing up for 1st debate. You would have gotten substantial airtime. U cost ur self any chance
@RandPaul @k_mcq @marcorubio No sir, your little baby fit officially took you off my radar. Tweet all you want you are done
@RandPaul @marcorubio No one likes you.
@RandPaul @marcorubio Well I think you are more relevant than several others that's for sure.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState only in ths rebublic can you be a primary candidate and shut out because thats what the puppet masters want.
@RandPaul It's a shame the network didn't include you up there. Your perspective in this debate was sorely missed.
@RandPaul @marcorubio plenty of people mentioned Hillary, Bernie too. #justsaying
@RandPaul keep fighting the good fight!  Paul 2016!
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState They didn't give Cruz time to respond after dumping that load of horse shit on the table.Respond here
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState
@RandPaul  owned Twitter  and facebook tonight. Go away smelly trolls
@RandPaul @marcorubio you lost your chance bud
@RandPaul @marcorubio You are a quitter!
@RandPaul @marcorubio No. You took your toys home.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState bow out Rand, no one is listening anymore
@RandPaul Nope. You forfeited. Rather than fight you walked away tonight. @marcorubio
@RandPaul you're by far my first choice for POTUS. However, I don't think the "they took my ball on the playground" stuff is going to work.
@RandPaul give it up
@RandPaul your response about @marcorubio during your #RandRally Town Hall was all we needed!
#StandWithRand
@RandPaul I think it is time to get out. Good try. Maybe in 4 years.
@RandPaul @marcorubio if you had showed for the undercard I would've said yes, but you took your ball and went home...so no.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState People who support Rubio need to take a look at his voting record, or what little there is. #DoyourjobRubio
@RandPaul @marcorubio no you are done
@RandPaul @marcorubio Only if you're man enough to attend.
@RandPaul @marcorubio Rand wouldn't have been able to respond if he showed up. He was in the Undercard debate, not the main. #StandWithRand
I missed @RandPaul tonight. He always makes the debates better.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState Only on twitter, like everyone else who decided to watch it from home.
@RandPaul @marcorubio it's time for u to take the gloves off on these globalist bastards, happy to see ur reaction today.
@RandPaul @marcorubio , i used to think Ted Cruz was a great second choice to Rand. Its clearer each day that he has been bought. Scary
@RandPaul @marcorubio dude you don't matter, you weren't on the stage.. You were weighed you were measured and sir, you've been left wanting
@RandPaul @marcorubio talk to the boys at @FoxNews   Whining to the twitterverse doesn't change it.
@RandPaul don't worry! @marcorubio will be in senate next year using govt insurance to treat his bruised ego! You both can catch up then!
@RandPaul @marcorubio No, you need to poll better ...
@RandPaul @marcorubio  No you dont. You forfit that comeback.
@RandPaul @marcorubio No, you don't get to respond because you chose to rob the American people of your voice tonight. Poor sportsmanship!
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState No. No you don't. You didn't meet the guidelines. It's not "follow the rules unless they apply to me".
@RandPaul @marcorubio He got slapped down for it.

You deserved to be there tonight, Dr. Paul.
@RandPaul @marcorubio you snubbed the debate.... You blew it
@RandPaul @marcorubio 

No you don't #Rand! He was allowed an 11 point attack on @TedCruz . #Rubio is Jeb 2.0 & the media's chosen one.
@RandPaul @marcorubio Let's do a live debate. @RandPaul vs @marcorubio.  It would be over before it started! #StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul @marcorubio ummmmm. No.
@RandPaul @marcorubio no because you weren't there.  I do like that you boycotted the debate though even if you were at kids table.
@RandPaul @marcorubio One more outburst from kiddie table and no desert!
@RandPaul @marcorubio Guess you had to be there
@RandPaul @marcorubio Santorum trolled you 
@RandPaul @marcorubio write a letter
@RandPaul @marcorubio sorry.  But you quit.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @ComicDaveSmith @opieradio stomps homeless cakes #GOPdebate #trump2016
@RandPaul @marcorubio YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP
@RandPaul @marcorubio #GOPDebate #TedCruz yes Marco distorted your views desperate career politicians we need rand
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState you chose to not compete for the job
@RandPaul @marcorubio No seconds to respond. Home to Kentucky
#Trump2016
@retired_coach @RandPaul @marcorubio NO Trump!!!! period.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState  You sure do your still in go for it truth is the truth tellem #StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul no...JV games dont count
@RandPaul @marcorubio You missed the audience calling out your name? It turned into children fighting in a sand box. You didn't miss much.
@RandPaul @marcorubio grow up to show up #whiner #gopdebate
@RandPaul @XxLaVaxX @marcorubio Election year... you don't hear too much about the issues, but WOW, look at the mud slinging. #tiredofit
@RandPaul @marcorubio "You'll get nothing and like it," RP junior. #caddyshack
@RandPaul @marcorubio Rand u took yourself out of the debate. U get nothing.
@RandPaul @marcorubio Marco just slithered across the stage 
@RandPaul Yeah you do. It was at 6pm ET.
@RandPaul @marcorubio I missed you. Love your principled conviction
@RandPaul @marcorubio
@RandPaul @marcorubio no not at all baby
@RandPaul @marcorubio You shoulda been there, bro!!
@RandPaul @marcorubio Rand need to go ahead an pause campaign don't have a chance!
@RandPaul @marcorubio I'd rather have had you up there than Kasich, Senator.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState in the men's room down the hall?
@RandPaul @marcorubio You get a free pass home.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState you have ALL night.
Listening.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState no because Rand you can't handle the WH. #Rubio2016
@AshtenMartin @RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState Can't handle the WH?  your boy Rubio can't even handle the Senate! He skips work constantly!
@RandPaul @marcorubio let's hear your response! I believe you have 30 seconds sir!
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState you gotta show up first buddy
@RandPaul @marcorubio Yes, you should get more than that to be honest!
@RandPaul @marcorubio I thought u were gonna stand up in the crowd!
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState Nobody was listening to him anyhow! #RandRally
@RandPaul @marcorubio Why would you respond to a turd who is not eligible to be press. Scrubio should not be on stage or Cruz.
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState Please respond @RandPaul
@RandPaul No.
@RandPaul @marcorubio The crowd was asking for you too.  : ^)
@RandPaul @marcorubio @RedState Prosperity is not free.We have to work for prosperity.
