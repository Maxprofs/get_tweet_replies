@RandPaul @BernieSanders's plan actually DOES make healthcare cost less.  Check it out!  https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/ …
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Incorrect. Private insurance operates at 30% overhead, Medicare 3%. Diverting $$$ from care to profits means < care
@randpaul @berniesanders Have you ever been outside of the USA. They’ve already accomplished this.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders it works all over the world but no keep telling yourself you're right if it helps you sleep at night
@RandPaul @BernieSanders except for all the literal historical times it has worked. Sure, if we ignore those, then yeah, that argument works
@RandPaul it seems to be working out pretty well for the rest of the world. #socializemedicine
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @BernieSanders  #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul @RestoreHistory @BernieSanders he believes in the stuff, pure socialist

@RandPaul @RestoreHistory @BernieSanders Big govt programs in US generate profits for Corporate America, Big Pharma & SCREW THE MIDDLE CLASS
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Have you heard of Medicare?
@RandPaul @mickk1954 @BernieSanders It's certainly a way to make it worthLESS.
@RandPaul @RestoreHistory @BernieSanders 
Obama care Sanders  care
@RandPaul @BernieSanders the result of more govt money like you see from the dems. More spending = lower scores
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Except in virtually EVERY other industrialized country on Earth.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie thinks healthcare is a right for all. I love it when people get rights and needs confused.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders it has worked in every country with government run universal health care who have lower costs per citizen than U.S.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders No Rand....Wrong!! #FactCheck #Misleading #BernieSays #EliminateInsuranceCompanies #GetTheProfitsOutOfHealthcare
.@RandPaul @BernieSanders No, Rand, his plan is to get PEOPLE more involved in GOVERNMENT! That's always worked! #FeeltheBern #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie promises for a few billion more in taxes they'll get it right this time without any mismangemnt, pinky swear
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Democrats have made it worse,  republicans have made it worse.  Prices have climbed since Government involvement.
.@randpaul It’s never worked in the United States, because it’s never been tried. It’s worked everywhere else. #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders We have NHS in the UK and it works! #DemocraticDebate #DemocratsStandTall
@RandPaul @BernieSanders PLUNDER!!!

@RandPaul @BernieSanders Mr Paul, until you have lived as a middle class citizen, reach out to us first before you voice that opinion.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders real solution = compitition
@RandPaul @BernieSanders eliminate all competition will help reduce cost???? I don't think that's how it works!!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Coming from a doctor?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Republicans are happy for government to control women's bodies and availability of safe and legal abortion.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders What's the GOP's plan? Insurance companies out of control, for profit. That's not ok, healthcare is a right.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders More Medicare & Medicaid = Hospitals/Physicians make no money, loose jobs, and worse service. Do people get this?
@xtravar @RandPaul @BernieSanders Paul has covered his health care ideas extensively
@RandPaul @BernieSanders the government is out of control and they can't be held accountable for anything!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders No? Seems to work in many other countries just fine.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders at least they propose a solution. Your party is helpless
@RandPaul check your facts, Rand. Senseless spending on an ineffective system.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders look what the government has already done to us!
@RandPaul whats your plan- nothing ?
.@RandPaul @BernieSanders is pointing out every country that has a national solution for healthcare has a cheaper and more effective one
@RandPaul @BernieSanders I don't think he has seen or read Atlas Shrugged
@RandPaul I have micromyiasis. I can not even get a DX although I have slides photo samples & have pulled maggots out in Dr office!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Thank you Rand let everyone know who is going to foot the bill we the taxpayers!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders then win to debate him
@RandPaul @BernieSanders the government should never involve any thing in our lives
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie Panders bases his reasoning on false logic. He is a Generalist. We pay the most we get the most and the best
@RandPaul @BernieSanders with the exception of Canada, UK.....
@RandPaul @BernieSanders look what taking government out of the equation did for Flint. #DemDebate
@RandPaul literally thinks laissez faire works lmao #socialism
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Government should stick to National Defense, building roads and bridges, tax collection, and handing out welfare...
@RandPaul not yet in the US anyway. But it will because it works everywhere else in the world where people want it to

@RandPaul @BernieSanders government subsidizing corn has made that price go down. Corn syrup for all!  That must be his plan.

@RandPaul @BernieSanders The government needs to get out of our lives
@RandPaul @BernieSanders the Republicans haven't proposed a solution in 8 years
@RandPaul that has always worked #Medicare #Medicaid
@RandPaul liberals don't understand economics
@SteelDan86 @RandPaul really, is that why we invaded Iraq, because GOP understood economy?
@emiroseli @RandPaul no, just false information. Need a balance. To much of either ruins it
@SteelDan86 @RandPaul agree with balance, also agree to have the country run by competent people who want progress
@emiroseli @RandPaul to bad we can't just hit a restart button. To many morons on both sides of the aisle
@SteelDan86 @RandPaul I agree with that statement
@RandPaul @BernieSanders It's worked as well as government trying to make anything else cheaper... Like education...
@RandPaul @BernieSanders It has in literally every country with universal health care.
@RandPaul can we jail hillary
@e_franklin13 @RandPaul I hope so
