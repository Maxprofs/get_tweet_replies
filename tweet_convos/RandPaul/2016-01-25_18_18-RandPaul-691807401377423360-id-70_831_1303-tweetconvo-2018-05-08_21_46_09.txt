@markusgarvey @cfcpac @RandPaul @BernieSanders so is it dangerous or needed by Bernie ?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders someone should really tell Bernie that the top 20% of earners paid 80+% of individual income tax in 2014.
@SlightlyPoetic @billpostmus @RandPaul @BernieSanders someone should tell you that the top 20% probably earned more than 80% of all income!
@pratyushkamal Considering 40+% of Americans paid $0 in income tax, I should hope so. Don't disparage earners.
@SlightlyPoetic  come on! those 40% probably didn't have enough for two meals, you expect them to pay taxes?
@pratyushkamal No. You're missing the point. They qualify for SNAP.

You disparage those who earn for earning and excuse those who don't?
@SlightlyPoetic @pratyushkamal The entire SNAP program costs less than what Pfizer alone is dodging through its Allergen holder
@hatt1 Pfizer, one of the firms behind the objectively-bad-for-consumers ACA?

Not saying SNAP is bad. Just that those people get help.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders I will HAPPILY pay taxes for healthcare and education - thats what I pay taxes FOR.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders i already pay $14k/yr on obama care for family insurance. telling me i can pay $5k and save $9k? #nobrainer
@koviomx 14k? Dang I thought my 6.5k was bad. No benefits at work? I'm an independent contractor and paying that much for 1 person.
@DailyOkie missed this one. wife and i are both small biz owners. rates for where we live are insane. that’s still with $3k out-of-pocket :(
@koviomx yeah, no one thought to add credits for small business and independent work... It was more affordable before...
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @graham_coleburn
@RandPaul @freedomtex @BernieSanders Hasn't anyone told him someone has to pay? Usually by force?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders And the YOU He refers is anyone making over 250K a year.. #Halfthetruth100%ofthetime #GOPfail
@RandPaul @BernieSanders it's obvious that you're jealous of Bernie's ratings. You'll never be president but Bernie has an excellent shot.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders yes help and chip in selfish man, my ancestors did
@RandPaul @BernieSanders yeah,we are paying for wars,insurance comp, WallStreet bail, oversea jobs. It's time we do something for ourselves!
@RandPaul @Orpi35 @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Correct. That's how government works. The difference is that we might actually benefit from our tax dollars.
@DannenShawn @RandPaul @BernieSanders  Socialism  sucks,.What if  Trump turned socialist? Tyrannical dictatorship!
@Rhinoeatone @RandPaul @BernieSanders Socialism is all around us in the services we already benefit from. Demagoguery isn't an argument.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders I pay taxes & have 0 worth to our rigged billionaire elected  politicians- Bernie is for us!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @sebuczek ya...that's the point buddy
.@RandPaul This time substitute "billionaire" for "you", right before "pay for that".
.@RandPaul @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @MFC_AL @BernieSanders Yes, that's how taxes work, genius.
@MFC_AL @RandPaul @BernieSanders Taxes are a problem? I guess roads and such should just come out of nowhere?
@MFC_AL @RandPaul @BernieSanders Of course not. It's cool, I don't have the patience to put up with such contradictory nonsense.
@RandPaul are you polling at all Ran #demtownhall #standwithrand
@RandPaul @BernieSanders no, by making YOU pay for that. Corporations and the millionaire lackeys must pay their fair share!
@VLHammett @RandPaul @BernieSanders I'd much rather everyone just pay Rand's 14.5%
@RandPaul @BernieSanders so tired of paying for others. Talked about expat but govt immediately takes 50%. Taxes any higher may be worth it
@RandPaul @Bobby_Feld I've got a great idea: let's all not pay taxes! Yay, anarchy! Screw social programs I need!
@RandPaul @Bobby_Feld Funny how you only have about 13 supporters. And your dad isn't one of them. Clean up, go home Rand Paul. #DemTownHall
@RandPaul @vanamanic @BernieSanders I will pretend we don't need that but when we do I'll make the middle class pay for it #RandPaul
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Let's not be bitter, Rand.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders BREAKING: SANDERS PROMISES TO STEAL RAND PAULS MONEY FIRST!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders yep - i hate to say it but that's what it sounds like to me too.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders even Putin said socialism didn't work. denounces Soviet founder Lenin http://wapo.st/1nu9CDA?tid=ss_tw …
@RandPaul @BernieSanders what does he mean by removing tax caps? Like the middle class pays more taxes? I thought the rich would pay for it
@RandPaul now @BernieSanders thinks he's Oprah! You get free stuff, and you get free stuff and everyone gets free stuff...
@RandPaul @BernieSanders By making the corporations who make too much profit off of us pay for it
@RandPaul @BernieSanders like the middle class doesn't already pay for crap
.@RandPaul @BernieSanders Boom! Spoken w/ truth RP. Everythin government funded is taxpayer funded. More taxes = less $$ in people's pockets
.@RandPaul @BernieSanders Yes, we should definitely keep subsidizing record profits for corporate polluters instead.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Go away
Unlike you #FeelTheBern hasn't sold out his core principles
You two have more in common than you'd admit
@RandPaul @BernieSanders speak. Speak!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders And the Reps love "socialism" 4 the rich ie tax breaks corp subsidies
@RandPaul @CatholicClassy @BernieSanders I read an den spouting article about the entitled middle class today that enraged me #NoBernie
@RandPaul by making your secret corporate donors pay for it, Rand.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Hey, if things don't work out w/ ur practice..or senate. you could #moonlight as a political comic. great zings tn!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders heaven forbid we pay for other people education. God public schooling is an awful idea #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Because we're not paying for anything now, right? 
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Apparently Rand Paul has decided to troll the #DemTownHall?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders HA! That was awesome Mr.Paul.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders shouldn't Rand be at the kiddie table? Drop out #ramenhair.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders lol Rand enough already, you're irrelevant. At least someone's looking for positive progress
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Yes you and your Ayn Randy crew - or you could go Galt. Please.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders lol! So true.
@RandPaul Yeah,  we all chip in, Senator Feudal System. 
@BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders - LoL. No he said he will pay for it. I think we should hold him to that!!! Thanks Bernie!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie wants in your pants.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders can it rand
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Dude Bernie, can you even compete with Rand?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders really avoiding that question about "the era of big government. "
@RandPaul @BernieSanders NO - your puppet masters the corporate donors to your political career ! #CitizensUnited #money #greed #lies
@JerryOD do you really think he's getting big corporate donations. I bet most people think he's dropped out of the race.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders You mean we should pay for ourselves?! Blasphemy! #StandWithRand #NotFeelingTheBern
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie is a communist
@RandPaul @BernieSanders the top 64 billionaires can pay for it #NoMoreEatingCake
@RandPaul @BernieSanders if you are going to troll at least get it right.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Got eem!!!
