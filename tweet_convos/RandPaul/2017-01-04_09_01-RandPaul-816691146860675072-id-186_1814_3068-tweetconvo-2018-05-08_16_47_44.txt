@Zanting @realDonaldTrump didn't uh, JFK want to audit the fed?
No, JFK wanted to end the Federal Reserve and restore gold and silver.
JFK wanted to audit the Fed and everyone believed he wanted to close it too.
He also wanted to disband the CIA
yeah. That's why the theory goes that Bush father and LBJ plotted the murder.
There you are thought you got lost under the repeal AHCA paper work of your friends the Freedom Party, your silence was ominous?? Audit Fed
Cant wait to see if that happens you going to run away and hide when that dirt flies and it will when people learn how Dems made their $$$$
@insighter007 @realDonaldTrump Please #DTS and big government. Audit Pentagon & Federal Reserve.
Defund all non-government agencies. Im tired of paying special interest/function groups.
No audit will be permitted. The biggest rigger of the US stock market will not be allowed to have their methods questioned. #fact
@_kladik_ @realDonaldTrump the last time a president tried to #AuditTheFed he was welcomed with a bullet to their brain 
I am so glad to hear this.I have wanted this so bad.
Indeed!
For you Soros PAID Trolls on this thread....

Go win an election. You LOST the last one...!
LOL
Rand, While you're at it, Audit the Gold in Fort Knox!! @RandPaul @TheDavidMcGuire @realDonaldTrump @AppSame @DrMartyFox @ArcticFox2016 @WSJ
Even IF the fed allows the audit, the books are already  COOKED seven ways to Sunday. #Fact
Audit the Fed....?
We need to SEIZE IT
It is PRIVATELY OWNED
they have printed money, and KEPT IT FOR THEMSELVES
any organization as important to the American people as the Federal Reserve needs accountability to the people
BUT make sure the bill is perfect for 28 people before making any decision
, We must audit the FED...
Audit the Fed from an asshole that will not release his taxes.
need to let it go. He's audited every year and nothing illegal happening.
Keep believing.
Rand, While you're at it, Audit Gold in Fort Knox!! @AppSame @RonPaul @RandPaul @LouDobbs @FoxNews @FoxBusiness @foxnation @realDonaldTrump
@SenTedCruz I hope Ted supports this. It's our money after all, not the govt's
@patrickshaheen @realDonaldTrump I wonder who he'd get to do it if he follows through!
you go!!
let's abolish the damn Fed if you ask me
Rand, While you're at it, Audit Gold in Fort Knox!! @RandPaul @larry_kudlow @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @BretBaier @ericbolling @LouDobbs

Fed secretly gave $16 Trillion of Taxpayer's money to Global Financial System.

Ronald Reagan printed US Treasury Dollars; currently uncut on deposit w/ @UBS in Switzerland.

@aduanebrown @realDonaldTrump Agree,  Trump & Gov can Multitask 2 accomplish many things at once. New Healthcare in 4 mos not 2Yrs
@therealroseanne @realDonaldTrump does that mean Obama refunds his vacations ?
@therealroseanne @realDonaldTrump Why has such a policy not been in place all along? Businesses are mandated to such.
@Chrocadas4 @realDonaldTrump And Mr. Paul, why are you against this?????
Mr Paul wants to audit the fed. He & his father have been requesting for yrs. Trump's for it too.
My mistake. I misread that he was against it.
I've done it myself more times that I want to admit. Happy new year, Lou Ann.
Same to you and may GOD bless you in this New Year
Thank you @therealroseanne ! The people of the great state of Kentucky and the USA agree with you. #Trasparency
I want #AuditTheFed but I also don't want an audit. We're gonna not like what's been goin on.
@therealroseanne @realDonaldTrump rand paul please get hold of McCain before he dives in with obama and starts ww3
isn't this the idiot who ran for president a lot of times and lost
Let's do this!!!
Yes, but only upon absolute and total transparency
also lets dismantle EPA too.That would fix Obama's newly signed regulations!.
Would be money better spent than funding Iran and ISIS terrorists. Get your priorities straight!! @joannabalesca @realDonaldTrump
Any audit should include the DOD. No bigger culprit when it comes to misusing tax payer money.
:  I always wondered why the Treasury gets to be so secretive.
The Fed should be treated as organized crime and brought down by the @FBI but they NOT too much help lately
Great idea and while you are at it audit the Pentagon as well.
good for him. Do you still question his anti establishment stance? He needs to get your dad to head the Fed
side. Sing present in some form within their argument
lets make them accountable to American people
@AprilHayes_ @realDonaldTrump please!!!
don't play games with us on Obama care- repeal
@RandPaul @KarolevVladimir @realDonaldTrump
Why one more audit? Tells us nothing the annual audits do not. Costs a few million. Stupid. @RandPaul @7h0th @realDonaldTrump
This is great, but we're up against a lot here. Are you sure @realDonaldTrump is really for auditing The Fed? I want proof!
@MarkeeceYBR @realDonaldTrump Your buddy McConnell is not going to end the filibuster. He again will stab GOP in back.
'SimmerDown' @RandPaul @aduanebrown We've A Way To Before Posturing 4Next Election @realDonaldTrump
You cannot even be playing like that Rand. Time to mobilize the dank memes to accomplish this political goal.
Let's audit the expense accounts of all Congressional members and have the members pay back any wasted money.
.@RandPaul @MarkeeceYBR @realDonaldTrump #repealandreplace first Senator
We have a chance to accomplish something, don't fuck it up Rand!
HELL YES! I would prefer "eliminate the fed" but this is a step in the right direction. #UniteAndFight
Rand, While you're at it Audit the Gold in Fort Knox!! @AppSame @RandPaul @RonPaul @DrMartyFox #TRUMP #MAGA @WSJ @AP @FoxNews @foxnation
Rand, While you're at it, also Audit the Gold in Fort Knox!! @AppSame @ericbolling @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @LouDobbs @Reince #MAGA45
There has never been a better time, than now!

Wow...think of it....Audit the Fed....but get lots of overly qualified protection for Trump 1st

@SurvivorMed @realDonaldTrump
Can't wait for @RonPaul's life's work to come to fruition.
The price of gold spray paint just shot up 30%

Type Harry Reid Filibuster into Google,and do some reading.Then will see how upside down your tweet is.Not being mean
Holy shit.

Now your talking our lingo!
Hell yes!
IT'S HAPPENING
try stop being crooked lying thieves and you won't need a baby sitter
please push the audit the Fed's bill through and sign it.  Very important for Americans to see what is happening
I support this completely.  Our federal government is incompetent, criminal, and should be held accountable.
awesome!!!!
Find out how the 118 of 120 counties in Kentucky who voted for Trump feel about the audit.
Senator Paul. I live in Kentucky and support auditing the Fed. Time to end the waste.
.@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump #AuditThePentagon is next!
#AuditTheFed becomes #EndTheFed soon as the bean counters count.
Please, please, PLEASE let this happen!  Thank you Mr Paul.  We trust you PE Trump!  Please audit the Fed!!!
Mr Trump - I will gladly donate to any audit the fed costs
it would be worth the price to see the looks on all your faces when it finds how bad you folks mismanage shit
LMAO - and all you lifetime political hacks are scared shitless. I hope you do send him the bill & he pays it
awesome!!
AUDIT. THE. FED.
lets work together to #MAGA
Do it!!!
Keep up the great work @RandPaul and make sure there's some weight behind the @realDonaldTrump promises. #AuditTheFed #Libertarian
@flatwalk @realDonaldTrump Send him the Bill TO SIGN sounds better than "send him the bill hes going to be footing" it's semantics
yes, yes, yes!!!!! Audit the fed! $9 trillion given away! Who got it? What did they do with it?
I was seriously just thinking about whether you'd push for this again under Trump! It's time.

End the private bank! Don't publicize actions against them though...lowers life expectancy.
HELL YES
Work with him Rand. We ran your dad and created the Tea Party to take the Country back. Audit the FED!!!!
Federal Reserve is a private company owned by the shadow government, Rockefellers. Why are we even discussing?
Do it!! Time to become transparent.
@HRC4Prison @realDonaldTrump Even Rand Paul wants to be on a Trump train now
Step 1 towards the end goal: #DismantleTheFed @realDonaldTrump
@StefanMolyneux @realDonaldTrump please please please
The  Rothchilds & Rockerfellers will have the CIA Shoot Trump as they did Kennedy in 1963!
@pink_sprnva @realDonaldTrump  AWESOME IDEA!!! 

Jihadi-Cartel Alliance in MX Ready to Act Against US --
why do all sexually confused SJW's have green hair?
im starting to like you again rand paul
great idea
Do you have something to hide @RandPaul ? Sounds like it to me. Audits are healthy & maint. honesty
I understand, Trump supports auditing the fed. Rand does not so he wants the costs for the audit billed to Trump
If he audits the fed could he even trust the secret service to keep him safe?
YES!!!!!!!  END THE FED!!!!!  The creature from Jekyll Island must die! #FreedomFromCartelBankers!
@StefanMolyneux @realDonaldTrump Rand please get on the Trump train! Working together in DC you two could accomplish so much.
Radical, bold, fresh TRUTH on Banking, Central Banking, Political Banking
Do it!
hmm #AuditTheFed then shut it down!
YES
ohhh a bill that has even less chance of passing than #DrugTestCongress
@StefanMolyneux 
At least wwe bring these up for overall common sense
Just spell crap before
A lot of money has been stolen, way more than enough to justify this audit. Just wages of fired employees for the
Do you have the bill already written, Paul. Can you post it somewhere casual and easier to access?
YES!!  But don't just aduit the Fed.  ABOLISH it.  The international bankers control the US Government!!
Ready let's go.. #StandWithRand
Awesome, finally we might have a transparent government.
@patprobably
It's about time, big win Rand
I would like to see that.  I could def support him on that!  Let's not stop at audit but go to End the Fed....
well see if @realDonaldTrump puts his money where his mouth is when it comes to this bill. #AuditTheFed
he will end up dead Paul....
Better yet, abolish the FOMC and get the Fed back to lending against high quality collateral, not "managing".
Politicians Rarely talk big picture, it's not sexy. Guy who made this chart thinks it's the year 20,015. Fact checker?
you miss the part when he filled his staff with people who had their fortunes financed by the Fed?
Yes!
Audit the Fed then abolish it.
It has got to be undone and repealed
Get 'em Dr. Paul! #EndTheFed
Yank the FR charter. It was created by an act of #Congress and can be revoked. Start acting like MEN
Rand quickly becoming a twatter sensation. Get the MAGA energy going early and often. Nice to see support for DJT
DT needs to start printing treasory notes to replace the fed notes. JFK did and I believe that got him killed
Audit the Fed.  Let's give Trump a chance to govern...
: Clean out the corrupt.
Well we all know the Fed is where the high level manipulation takes place...Nothing more anti-freemarket than Fed
let's see his #TaxReturns he is getting billions in write offs! #NoTrumpNWay
thats a rumor. the Fed on the other hand is fucking you over and every other american. pettyass,Sad.
maybe so on audit the fed, however we still haven't seen the mans #TaxReturns he said after audit!
it's all very sad!  I believe #Trump did write off billions!
YES!!!! Audit the fed and wile your at it audit ALL government offices.
And Check The Vault 

#FortKnox @WishDivine @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
I'm sure not having to pay for obama's multi million dollar golf vacations will cover it.
@bamboo_ya @realDonaldTrump definitely!
Well, Trump! At least address this accusation!!
why waste time w/audit, reform Fed by returning monetary policy to US Treasury with fixed gold exch rate on USD
Most of us know by now that #auditthefed will never happen. Love to see it but they're too powerful. #provemewron
Awesome. Please do it right this time?
#AuditTheFed ASAP!
Do it!
I'm praying for the safety of those seeking the truth.
Let's, and by that I mean Congress!
Sigh. More liberals will be melting due to this. Who is going to clean up all this water?
He has done more than state it. He picked people who have voted to audit the fed.
Have you googled their voting records yet? This should be muscle memory.
Rand, we know the guy only has three priorities:

1) Help his biz
2) Cut his taxes
3) Grab some ...

#GetInLine
Wait, I thought he didn't pay taxes? Why would he need to cut them? Pick a narrative dipshits.
he should give the job to you no one better
yes!
it will expose Obama administration and it's ills.
