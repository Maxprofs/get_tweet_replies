free market solutions only,  no government control or cronyism
Obama care was the same as romni care. Its a pro corporate deal. Single payer is the only option that makes sense
ummm wrong. Single is worst option
It is if you own an insurance company. Do you?
do you want the government to run everything?
I just want them to run or subsidize human necessities. Too bad though our gov is actually a revolving door for corporatists
ok, now that you know they are corrupt & to involved with big business, why do you still want them run human necessities?
This is an age old disagreement that honestly makes 0 sense to me.
.@RandPaul I will tweet you every time I see a patient who slips through the cracks of repeal and replace. @realDonaldTrump
How many tweets have you sent so far every time a patient LOST his/ her doctor?
.@BHappy_4Now none of the patients I've met who have been due to my practice lost their doctor because of the ACA
Liar!
.@BHappy_4Now I didn't say it didn't happen anywhere, I just said it's not what I've seen on the front lines caring for my patients.
How many times have you heard patients complaining about the increasing costs of their health insurance because of Obamacare?
.@BHappy_4Now Quite a few times. I've never said the reform gave us a perfect system.
Did u tweet about it? Like ACA wasn't great, its replacement couldn't b perfect either but what u want 2 do. It's called hypocrisy
What about the ACA did you not like?  Was there anything that you did like?
Did you prefer how it was before?  Were the prices lower for you?
it needs to be better than before, allow competition and not limited to the state and drive prices down.
I would DEFINITELY like prices to be down.
almost all instance of the market more choices leads to diversity in prices and quality. We would control qual. of health care.
Would that work with people who have catastrophic illnesses?
Sen Paul, just be sure to remove the yearly carryover limits of Health Savings Accounts and Flex Spending plans.
If you don't kill ACA "tax" penalty then ANY "Repeal & Replace" will still be a "mandate" from the Govt 2 buy!
Nice interview w Cavuto!                        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fEn15hVvOh8 …
Where is the plan?  Will it cover as many as Obamacare?  Will it make Healthcare as cheap as Obamacare?  Show us Now!
It's Thursday when are you planning this unveiling?
As a Republican all I hear are the same ideas as before ACA. State Insurance monopolies will not lower prices
Before Obamacare, as an SMB, I could buy insurance from associations. Tiny price breaks. Same old ideas! Disrupt!
Week is almost over Randy
 ready, breath holding,  to see which conservative talking head spins at another Gov health program...

Rand Paul is a good man and I believe he is doing his best for health care in the US!
Did you forget about all the DEMs pork in Obamacare?
where does this agreement stand?
does it gut Medicare or SS?  Prevent those with pre-existing conditions from being covered? Lose cover. If sick?
please vote to confirm senator Session and mr. Tillerson
MARKET REFORM FAILED BEFORE THE ACA. IMPROVE IT: DON'T IMPOVERISH AND THREATEN THE MOST VULNERABLE WHO NEED ACA
thanks! The simplest and most effective thing would be to bring everyone in under Medicare
we are all for fixing affordable care you righties don't have a corner on it.
Please quit Twitter they're throwing Donald Trump off
hell yea rands the man
Where has replacement been? How will u address that 50% costs spent by 5% peep with no insurance???
IF YOU HAD A REPLACEMENT PLAN, YOU HAVE ALREADY RELEASED IT, NOT SAY YOU WILL.
WHAT'S YOU PLAN, MORE HSA'S THAT POOR FOLK CAN'T AFFORD...
Senator, quit calling it Obamacare which is the name republicans gave to discredit!!!! It IS the ACA!
Eliminate insurance middle man, pay docs 4 every healthy patient day, use premium $s 2 provide services as-needed
Didn't Trump call him the little man on the end?
I got a phone call from SEIU to attend meeting to plan attack to keep ObamaCare. I said No: ObamaCare sucks.
Please make sure that all providers allow access to patient records. Eliminate unnecessary tests, control costs.
Just to confirm you are talking about ACA. Stop confusing people. So misleading and honestly, evil.
about fucking time
we had a "real market" before the ACA.   That's why so many were uninsured.
By replace, You mean deregulating the Health Insurance Industry and demonopolising nat'l & st insurers? Freedom!
thank you!!!
@Rodrigo_9_7 @realDonaldTrump I'll listen, as long as it doesn't remove the interstate competition. You're solid Sen Paul...
Sure thing, Rand.
@JackoffJosh711 @realDonaldTrump Thank you, Sir. Obamacare just makes full-time jobs not feasible for companies in the US!!
@Jody_Rossel @realDonaldTrump I'd rather u fix, not replace! A lot if $ & time already into it.dont throw baby out w bath water
@Jody_Rossel @realDonaldTrump at least libs finally understand our concern on cyber security!
really? you're going with the "let's just eliminate health insurance" plan? didn't realise recreational cannibus was legal in KY.
can privatize #Healthcare w/ grants for people to purchase their choice privately like college No gov-run needed
Admit it. You didn't invent healthcare. You may improve on it but it was still originally provided by Obama.
Can't wait to hear what it will be..I know many people suffering under huge premiums and deductibles...Thank you!
Can't return to pre-existings, but w/out mandate, pre-existing break the ins. companies. Curious about your plan.
Holy crap, the Republicans finally have an original idea to propose? Wait, #believeitwheniseeit
Call it by its name: AFFORDABLE CARE ACT You are a murderer trying to take away MILLIONS' health care @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
Why not just,I dunno, fix the law? Oh, that's right. This isn't about the law. It's about the President who got it done.
just repeal it we don't need another government option, just leave the free markets to it
Meryl Streep Farting at Golden Globes
The ACA must be repealed and replaced. I don't care how or even how soon you do it, but DO IT or you're TOAST.
You have had 6 years to release details on a replacement. Why eliminate PPACA before you have a replacement?
Don't 'bring' details. HAVE details. You've only had 7 YEARS to come up with a plan.
@AlexJaensson @realDonaldTrump good to see an actual alternative
Absolutely.
are you going after ins co , lobbyists for these co ?
can't wait.  stop hyping up the media and reveal your plan already.  you sound like a wanna-be reality star.
@KassyDillon @realDonaldTrump Don't need a govt program. #FreeMarket Take away state boundaries for health ins, competition
Single payer is the only thing that works. PS do NOT call urself prolife cuz u are not
I hope @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y9vdJooccLw …


75% want obamacare to stay-Kaiser Foundation


I'm looking forward to it. In the meantime you all are just full of mouth.
Try Tuesday or Wednesday like when trump said he would explain Russian hacking and that didn't happen either
Shouldn't the details have been known and a viable replacement discussed BEFORE the ACA was repealed?
we need real insurance!
@crowbarsnest I'm always interested in hearing a MD's opinion on health care. Rand's book had good ideas!
#StandWithRand
Thank you!! We Stand with Rand!! So happy to have you on our side and thanks for all your hard work.
You cant polish a turd. But you can flush it down the toilet where it belongs. #Statism #Flushit
We're gonna need more than the EPA's regulation toilet. I suggest the free market's power flush model!
tell US about your health care.
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT let your constituents know GOP is repealing  the AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. #partyofnoprinciples
monthly premium should be a flat $100 with $250 deductible. No mandate, just buy when sick.
of it is market based no details.  Just buy and sell insurance as you please.
Trump promised better, cheaper health care. Just use his plan.
that is great!!
real market reforms... details are, me & the Medical professionals are only going to get paid, if Ins Cos gets pd
@SenatorLankford @jiminhofe yes votes to add 9.7 trillon to deficit. Yay votes End Obamacare expanded the budget bill. Back @RandPaul plans.
Replace, not repeal. Please stand up for us.
Women should ponder a dark  empty blood filled womb before they decide on abortion.Hard but should be done.
@aterkel @realDonaldTrump Wow, a real plan? Better not put Obama's name on it, or you'll vote against it asshat.
Senator I really hope/pray you show compassion for us working poor.
Hope you're right.  The heath care industry needs more free markets, not restrictions and government programs.
skeptical @RandPaul is it minimum 10% monthly cost reduction and 50% out of pocket cost reduction? Need numbers to decide. @realDonaldTrump
@Stand4Liberty_ @realDonaldTrump - Tort reforms!!!
We need the details now, not later. This affects people’s lives.
California has the economy of France, and 20 mill insured, be careful not to turn us back to Californios
Unveiling a replacement is not enough. The replacement needs to be in place before the ACA is repealed.
All this talking about you guys not having anything, and there you are working behind the scenes! So cool, thanks
thank you, repeal and replace at the same time or risk being vilified
do notice with GOP and Donald its details later…later never comes. Why wasn’t this work done before the election?
where can I go online to see your new plan?
Than Please Do Not Renew The Federal Reserves Charter Remember Kennedys Exec Order 11110 Is Still Active JFK 2
that's good...as a Republican I dont totally agree w/ ACA, but it is a good idea but Americans wont participate
Not interested in real market returns, uh, reforms. Interested in real humanitarianism.
Don't screw the millions now on Obamacare. Without tax credits, they can't afford insurance.
Do not come up with something that passes the buck to the states, and please get out of family planning.
repeal it and replace it with nothing ;)
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pDDLHCQMDBo …
What good will HSA accounts do for Americans who cannot afford health insurance
Go Rand! But please, please don't offer anything worse than Obamacare!
please consider no replacement, just a repeal. People shouldn't be forced to make any purchase.
looking forward to a plan  that increases access and decreases costs !
Why - IF #Obamacare is so BAD is the #GOP promising to #Replace it? @SenWarren @SenSanders
keep up the good work on repeal AND replace at the same time. Also, keep fighting for a balanced budget.
As a private practice administrator and a family we thank you, THANK YOU!! Obamacare uninsured the insured PLEASE FIX IT
Ppl will pay for rising premiums as long they can get very low deductibles for JUST the coverage they want.
I can't imagine much of a replacement coming from a libertarian
Please Senator promise in your Replacement plan the current Patient Protections of Obamacare will be preserved.
Outstanding news Senator!Those liberals will be going crazy with news,Repubs in disarray NAH!
Wish #TPGOPEG Christians cared about sick and poor as much as money. #GOPlies
Thank you.
please have pharmaceutical drugs from developed countries be sold in US. #freemarket
if people can't afford it, then the markets will not matter and millions will lose their coverage.
Gd @RandPaul @JoannaWoman991 @realDonaldTrump NO TO MANDATORY INSURANCE !!! Thank u
I'm so excited to see the last 8 years FINALLY END! 
Can't WAIT to watch you guys get to work!
Intrastate restriction has to stop!
@Timothy_Elkin @realDonaldTrump Good luck. We need it.
Where's plan been LAST 8 yrs?? Come to you in a dream??
@Depasquallers @realDonaldTrump we need tort reform and limits on insurance company profits based on coverage denial
I hope every single page will be red out loud as demanded by the voters. #norepealnoreplace for #ACAisheretostay
Allow INS purchasing by clubs, churches, trade associations or any pool of people aside from just your employer
@aterkel @realDonaldTrump Your naivety that Trump agreed with you is so cute.
Please raise taxes on the rich so you can have money to build new schools and water pipes. above 400k, 95% tax
Yada, yada. The usual nonsense. Race to the bottom on coverage across state lines, tort "reform." Deny reality.
THANK YOU FOR BEING IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLES' CORNER!!!
@BENLINDEY @realDonaldTrump we only had to wait like 8 years for an alternative.
Killing the sick & poor! Pathetic $$ grubbers.
Have you given thought to the plan proposed at http://sites.google.com/site/tbepporg ? It's the talk of the town!
AMERICAre?  I think that is what you should name it.  AMERICA first right!!  Just came to me last night.
Let me guess... Tuesday or Wednesday
Get rid of the mandates!  Not everyone needs maternity care. Thank you!
it's nice that @realDonaldTrump let you in the door. Did he refrain from making fun of your looks again? Coward.
Looking forward to finding out what insurance YOU folks will grant yourselves. @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
offering an alternative? Why hasn't your party done this instead of symbolic votes to repeal?
please make it worthy of all patients and don't allow the insurance companies to continue to get rich off the sick.
Please recognize the role of Nurse Practitioners and don't bind our hands with unnecessary practice restrictions
let us know when you "have released" - all we've heard for years is you "will release"
I hope it's a FULL replacement and does not leave intact Obama care's regulatory & insurance coverage mandates.
is say it again. You're the only republican proposing anything afterwards.
do it now everybody's talking no ones doing
What will happen to Medicare and Medicaid?
Will birth control be free? Pre-existing conditions covered? Dependents covered under their parents until 26yo?
hope it's good stuff!
Trump making good on his promise, real people! America!
You have the greater good in mind, no doubt about it. Thank you, a Dem.
No more forced government healthcare! Quit taking money out of our paychecks and let me buy antibotics w/o script
Hey, I guess you are saying let's let the insurance companies go back to denying care and taking 50% off the top.
Thank you sir!
Good; must repeal and replace simultaneously. Block grants to states, across state lines..good start
I'm excited fham!
Thank you Senator, we the American people look forward to your proposal.
gkad to see the Senator working with president Trump. Tume to get the country moving up.
To stop all this misinformation by Democrats, suggest audio version too.
repeal don't replace!
Why didn't you reveal your plan when you 'was running? You know Congress does not like you. They won't listen.
@realDonaldTrump
Yay
@aterkel @realDonaldTrump single payer, right? The only thing that works.
thanks Rand
Then please AUDIT the FED!
@leapgerbils @realDonaldTrump You had 8 years, what took you so long?
@leapgerbils @realDonaldTrump
You must have a crystal ball. Can I borrow it?
I am looking forward to it. Keep up the great work!
#Greatly looking fwd 2 your legislative response 2 debacle of PPACA which'll #finally see sunlight \0/ HALLELUJAH
free market! Replace it with free market! Did I mention free market?
behind you 100% Dr. Paul!!!
@KassyDillon @realDonaldTrump good, but this plan better do more than just get rid of the individual mandate.
@aterkel @realDonaldTrump there is no simple answer to health care so I'd just leave it
@aterkel @realDonaldTrump free markets won't cover people who can't afford it nor take care of those who can
@daveweigel @realDonaldTrump Lethal injection?

Maga means coverage for ALL. Quality of life in usa must not get worse on your watch! Be prepared with proof
What's been holding you up? You people have had 6yrs to come up w/something.
Oh, why didn't you ever tell us before?
#StandWithRand
After trying 60 times to repeal, you still have nothing to replace it?
https://www.healthinsurance.org/obamacare-repeal-votes/ …
I live in Sturgis, KY, and I think you are doing a great job.  Go UK!
run it by your pops please. @RonPaul
you do realise that whatever you replace it with will skyrocket in prices due to the moneyprinting from fed?
Whoa, whoa... have you cleared this with Vladimir Putin?
#PutinsPuppet #TheResistance #GOPIsCompromised
Will plan add 350 bill 2 deficit,will it secure 3 mil jobs @stake w/Ocare repeal-after 8 yrs of no  plan,suddenly y'all have 1?Doubt it
I think both of you can help bring real change to DC and more importantly the American people. #MAGA
If I can't switch plans or companies without losing coverage, there's not really a free market.
And Obamacare lets me do that.
@daveweigel @realDonaldTrump I'll help subsidize others. 1 day maybe I'll need help! Til then maybe I can help someone you love.
fix, not replace. People don't get sick so that insur Co can make more profits!
Since youre rich you dont care... but those of us who need this program are HORRIFIED at your callous disregard.
Talk is cheap.  Hope you guys get this done!
@daveweigel @realDonaldTrump People can grumble about helping subsidizing others, until they lose their jobs & healthcare!
