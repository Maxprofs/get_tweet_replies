I would say Mr Senator that YOU are part of the failed Washington elite! #JohnBolton for #SecretaryOfState 
#PresidentTrump #MAGA
@alllibertynews @RandPaul lol, are you kidding? Paul is more an outsider than cronyist Trump.
Sorry I don't argue with liberals. Most have been indoctrinated at an early age=brainwashed #maga
I'm a libertarian and US Army vet. Try and not make stupid assumptions.
actually Trump is full outside, Rand on the other hand does have a lot of good 1/2
full outside until he hires cabinet full of neocon pukes, buuuut we will see I guess
he hasnt been wrong so far, gov of the people not politicians and its still strait 1/2
forward if things fail under him we would've been screwed either way so nothing new 2/2
@Eyes_of_justice @Rare John is very qualified & would work in the perimeters of the Trump admin.
@JedediahBila @Rare There is a reason you have a very "thin" base outside your state.  Hang in there cupcake.
@alllibertynews @Rare paul stop trying to make political points for next election nobody wants u as potus. Support your prez elect
@Eyes_of_justice @Rare TRUMP HAS SAID OVER&OVER WE NEED TO STOP THESE WARS AND REBUILD AMERICA--DO YOU HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM??
@Eyes_of_justice @Rare When appropriate. He was not pushing to tumble down Iraq.
Trump is anti war but knows we need defeat isis. Obama is war hawk that has continued was for 8 years. Barking up wrg tree
Alive is #noisis. @BarackObama handlers provided assistance @jqasociety inauguration of #AnimalFat Happiness.
DontFarmMakeWar? I & most @kkk having mete #CastIronSkillet #AnimalFat from He'w'man
Love Career PoliteScience students, never farmed? Live in Comfort until Dinner.
@ks44 @RandPaul Informed Consent to @jqasociety WARS? @stmeinrad STEP Px Still kills His Family & ALL CurlyDNA! @USNavy SLW_C.
Ok we don't bomb just anybody. We wouldn't bomb Italy so to that extent we have thought about it. Cant waste bombs
@alllibertynews @Rare let the man Hire whoever he wants.
@alllibertynews @Rare maybe we're tired of being pushed around?  Maybe we want to be respected and feared again?
@alllibertynews @Rare , Dodged that bullet, Trump won.
and you shouls resist spreading fake news about industries not going there Mexico
@alllibertynews @Rare but  YOU helped let the pimp elect t_RUMP in and he love$ war...
like MY VOTE... !T didn't count either? I guess my opinion is like American democracy non existent!
So is truth, justice and nope we can't say "and the American way"? The "nazi way" for 4 year'$!!
more into fuel grade h2o2 and a crazy little engine with o2 into the atmosphere and h2o recycled
@alllibertynews @Rare like trump empty tank
@alllibertynews @Rare over-thinking problems has not been the issue the last 8 yrs.
U mean like #Hillary & that Nobel misstep #Obama?A pair that has set t mid east on fire,literally! Didn't hear ur mouth then.Hmmm
I seriously doubt Trump is even considering John Bolton for anything.@RandPaul @ChristophHeer52 @realDonaldTrump
who is your choice?
Wrong on @AmbJohnBolton. He's exactly what we need in a SoS. The contrast between him and Kerry/Clinton sends the right message.
not a bad thought but that bad little sick rich boy is going to have the nuclear code$ anyway?
BAZAAR?
@alllibertynews @Rare no abortion... more babie$ well done on a $pit for the next republican party!!! bucket$ of beer for the red$
we elected someone w/ that very mindset. Please stop pretending that the problem is with the cabinet and not the man himself
thank yoy for soeaking out against Bolton + Guilliani.
Pls No Bolton or Rudy 4 Sec of state too old & rigged..Newt is well versed than him.Nikki is too new & inexperienced.Find a Fresh
@JonShearin @Rare So we just ignore or cheerlead as vicious dictators continually gas their own people?
Yep.
Senator Paul should be Secretary of State
Don't agree with you , like Bolton just fine .
Thank you for speaking up.
John  Bolton  is a neoconservative  who is  war first  diplomacy  later.
@alllibertynews @Rare Trump seems to be surrounding himself with insiders, Wall St players, religious cranks
just say NO to John Bolton !
please please block him and Steve Bannon if you don't mind.
@Robbo1992x @Rare Opposing quality people like Bolton is the reason youre not POTUS material
.@RandPaul @MrNoahItALL @Rare 
What, when, if, maybe? People need a vacation! 
They were not that worried when an imposter won in 08

Glad to see some common sense on the appointments
Especially since that later bit is rather unlikely. Ever.
@TheDanielMarch @Rare 
Rand, why didnt you talk on CNN MSNBC 7 yrs ago abt Hillary aiding arming nations using child soldiers
. Why can't you and other Republican give Trump a chance!?  Why don't you write an article saying how you can HELP TRUMP!?
this liberal agrees with that for sure.
our government has let things go too far we need to crush IRAN
@CraigRBrittain @Rare I hope not!
Thank you, Senator
I agree.
@CraigRBrittain @Rare What like Obama using drones in the middle east???
Bolton may possibly be the only candidate Hillary could have beaten if he were running.  What a dirtbag.
I can think of 2 more she might have beaten: Kaine & Pence.
Don't speak for us, we didn't vote for you.
@johnbolton he is a great man with very intelligent
@ks44 Informed Consent to @jqasociety Silent WARS? @stmeinrad STEP, Px Still kills @RandPaul 's Family & ALL CurlyDNA! <- @USNavy SLWC
War Propaganda's Many Y's, Yet Goal Always = Kill @RandPaul Remove #BlackHair for JQA's "Miliary" Sperm War. @Rare @ks44 @stmeinrad @USNavy
Watching 13Hours, They look better than 1 in 100,000 US men? Thus Fitness & False Foundation Skin. @RandPaul @Rare @ks44 @stmeinrad @USNavy

Started before @jqasociety inaugural Speech, yet my 1st introduction to "polite white" war is 1991. @RandPaul @Rare @ks44 @stmeinrad @USNavy
@realDonaldTrump listen to Rand Paul!!!! Hell, make him Secretary of State?
@JedediahBila @Rare
@realDonaldTrump No John Bolton please
thank you for speaking up. Now will you please deny Stephen Bannon as Chief Strategist?
Thank you.
John Bolton would not have the power to bomb anybody.  He will take his orders from President Trump, just like everyone else.
you should make suggestions for alternatives
please god no please tell trump do not DO NOT HIRE BOLTON PLEASE HE SUCKS
I cannot support this choice and i hope this is a smoke screen for the real choice
Thank you, senator.
He called Paul Ryan trustem in Bolton America Rand will not lead us astray Trump plz take into consideration tuxs
He is with the UN they're not on our side n all through this election ..#StandWithRand and trust him n his judgement thxu
Irony here is he is a chicken hawk war lover that avoided the Vietnam draft. #coward
Wars take ourPeople/$$$ 2 serve... 
Agreed. It would be like giving Al Sharpton his own show on MSNBC.
you told us, that's great. but do you get in contact with @realDonaldTrump to tell him personally? please do!
thank you @RandPaul for standing up for our country
Hell no to neocon Bolton.
John Bolton? That is exactly the kind of person Hillary would have picked for SOS.
RAND PAUL FOR  Secretary of State！
Witness Facts. In addition to kill all #BlackHair StMeinRad ArchAbby 1940 #KillAllCurlyAfricanHair Too! Kill6Dof12 @QuantaMagazine
Is  "#war" #unconstitutional without Art. I, Sec. 8 #Congressional #DeclarationofWar and rules eg #covert #contractor armies? @Uri
-This message is an automatic reply.- Hello."@Uri" is my user name.Please make sure.Thank you.
Say NO to John Bolton！Bolton is an establishment hawk  who wants to bomb now & think later & will lead the country to stupid wars
what's still is people expecting Trump to be different because of his words. He used talking points to get elected
Just War theory @TheKingDude @VeritasRadioNet
Shut up, Rand.
as citizens of this country we should do everything we can to not ask our solders to do what they are willing to do for us.
Oh you again? I thought you went away Mr Two Percent
Isn't that a description of the impulsive, vindictive Trump?
Bolton would be a nightmare as SOS and goes against all that Trump the anti war candidate preached
Hey, here is an idea: how about @RandPaul for Secretary of State?
@grannygethealth @Rare 
War will always be last on everyone's list
Thanks Rand, keep fighting.
most of us are sick of the third world terrorist nations and thier affect on the rest of us. Bolton is a good statesmen
The big question that should lay it to rest. DID BOLTON KNOW that the information presented on Saddam have WMD was fake?
With all due respect, sir, John Bolton is a realist. Forcing a war is bad for all. Stopping a war from without is often necessary.
What are you on about? The man has no judgement - look at this nonsense:
@marklevinshow Mark, what gives? You seemed pretty convinced that Bolton is the Best choice.  Is Rand wrong? Are you right?
My apologies to Rand Paul, I believed some media lies about you and discounted you as just another warmonger. NAP.
I think that is why Obama failed, too many IYI Neocons whispering bad advice into his ears.
Major problem for any administration is Neocon contamination. 20+ years of Neocon failures, 2+ million Muslims dead.
as a dem I don't agree with many of your views but happy you r not DT's puppet. Wish u were pres
@StarAnderton @Rare Yes if our country is under threat the last four interventions have destabilised the ME why were we there ?
Glad you'll b back. We've elected the Trump agenda. Hope you will help him get it done.
@JedediahBila @Rare 
Bolton almost as scary as Bannon.  Excessive war hawk
Whom would you select?
@justinamash @Rare So you are saying we should have resisted Obama?
why haven't you been asked for sec of state yet?
I hope you will stand up for freedom and BLOCK nominees like this scum Bolton.
@justinamash @Rare dream pick for Sec State would be Rand or @RonPaul but a realistic pick @JimWebbUSA
War never goes away & our role should be carefully considered. We're world ldr&have many tools other than boots 2 defeat the enemy
If Bolton is genuinely being considered & not just had his name put out there as a sop to the establishment - very bad sign.
@Elise_Jordan @Rare OMG I forgot Paul was alive.
Not once did Bolton say bomb them or anyone first. How about some Honest Truthful reporting for a change!!
I AGREE. WMD??? NOT BOLTON!
I hope not. Need to comment on @transition2017 and voice opposition.
Senator Paul, this Massachusetts liberal thinks you are right to oppose Bolton.  Congress does need to address Syria though.
What do you think of @MayorRGiuliani
Bolton reeks of logic.
@JedediahBila @Rare Sometimes you have to go to war to keep bigger war from starting.
OOPS... Dr Paul... You worked HARD for that and I should acknowledge that .. Sorry
@JedediahBila @Rare John Bolton I said a while back would make an excellent sec.of state.
ffs Rand; we've had 40 years of bushclinton for-profit wars/prisons/policing/racism/division FEC=2parties/1master.
As an aside Mr Paul you didnt exactly make the final cut so your opinion is .... welcome but unimportant
It is ODD that the body politic can elect someone based on almost nothing and then tell him what he should do
has the president elect reached out to you yet? He should have more flexibility in who he appoints where
i want you on that Cabinet!!
I still think @AmbJohnBolton is the best choice. He understands how the world works.
I'm not to happy about Rudy and Christie also being thrown around.  Both are enemies to the 4th and 2nd amendments
Iran–Contra affair should disqualify him.
@Elise_Jordan right now I see more votes against this guy in the Senate
would be a huge betrayal to his voters knowing he said he wanted to stop sending so much over their
love ur politics but this is my worries with libertarians. Waiting to get involved leads to WWI and WWII. other than that, perfect
and that's not counting the thousands or millions of innocent people we watch die when we can help prevent that.
domestic though, libertarians are the best.  It's where one day I hope becomes the norm for our country
Both Richard Grenell & John Bolton are both strong "moderate rebel" supporters @transition2017
and belong no where in a Trump admin, Grenell even recently rt'd Julian Roepcke. that should disqualify him alone.
Your gualification 4 US Pres must! Now we ended w a echo maniac of power hunger...
NO to Bolton!  Neo-Con Warmonger.
Respectfully disagree. I think Bolton would be a great pick. Thank you for all you do Senator. Help us on the ACA
@JPAndreas1 @RandPaul @Rare Rand Paul lost respect when he endorsed mitch!
.This election threw such leaders in the dustbin. ...already done. Trump hopefully won't be led by military-industrial complex
I just don't get this at all. He owes nothing to the military-industrial complex or the neocons. Why would he even consider???
remember when the media hosed you for having a 'bad temperament' with reporters, and then we got Trump instead? #Hindsights2020
I like Bolten. Peace through strength.  Also JB isnt a fan if the UN...and neither am I.
Inverse it and make "think now, bomb later" a liberty movement slogan?
was just thinking the same! So he's saying wars and bombings can be justified!!! That's evil.
Continual state of war for past decades has bankrupted us morally.  We spread democracy through conflict. This should end.
I'm sincerely hoping that this is a case of Trump employing A-B testing to help determine his pick for SOS & Giuliani is favorite.
HERE IS A BULLETIN FOR YOU RAND NO ONE IS ASKING OR WANTS YOUR OPION ON @realDonaldTrump PICKS!
some will believe the lies of CAREER POLITICIANS. I chose to study myself.  WHY DT had my vote for POTUS
I believe there 17 choices. From DT announcement he was my choice. I have a feeling NOT yours!
since voting for DT I will trust his judgement. Time will tell who got it wrong.
good luck on next 4 years.
I thought he was tipping the hat to Rudi?
Why would that be a betrayal?  Why even ask the question?
