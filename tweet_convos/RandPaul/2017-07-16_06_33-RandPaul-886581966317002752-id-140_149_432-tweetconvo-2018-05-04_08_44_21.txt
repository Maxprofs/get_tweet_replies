@RandPaul You need to meet with Trump pronto to get a short turorial on negotiating& compromise skills. WE arent going goin down bc of U
"We" being "socialists"...right?
IDC what political affiliation ppl are with. ACA needs repaired or replaced. IDC which, but  GOP need to help ppl who are victims of it
"We" were promised complete REPEAL, root and branch.  We WERE fighting against further socialization.  Looks not so much anymore.
No, Trump promised repeal AND replace, within hours if not days so NO GAP would occur for victims. Only recently has Tump said repeal
Rand Paul is attempting to keep the thieving government OUT of our Health Care.
The problem is, Americans, small bus in particular, had ins b4 all this ACA crap, free market doesnt give better rates for pre existing NOW
Then soon we will have no healthcare ...Obummer care is imploding
Yes, I hope it takes the insurance companies with it.
And where is @RandPaul DETAILED plan that DOES have the 50 votes to #RepealAndReplace #ObamaCare? Easy to toss bombs & sound bites to .
He's actually offered several alternative plans but leadership ignores them so no traction.
That is the exact point. If his plans could get 50/52 votes, they would be on the docket. As is, they only attract a handful of supporters.
@RandPaul is obstructing for future career ambitions. Getting lots of airtime but no constructive ideas to give to the American people
He's offered plenty of alternative bills, actually. Leadership ignores them so no traction.
That's because grandstanders like you want attention more than you want to help the American people! Get off your ass and vote with the GOP!
That's not why he was elected. He was voted in with the tea party who wanted a clean repeal. He's offered plenty of alternative bills.
He better enjoy his "Tea Party" position because he will be voted out!!
If that's what happens then it's a shame. He's one of a small handful of leaders who stick to the principles they were voted in on.
While I will not be directly affected by the GOP bill, I am against its passage.  Bad public policy.  Healthcare should be a right.
You people in Congress make trouble for Americans because of your petty differences. You don't solve problems, you thrive on them. Sad bunch
Great news!!! It isn't that we don't want democratcare...WE DON'T WANT GOVERNMENTCARE PERIOD!!! #GETOUTOFHEALTHCARE
#FullRepeal of the #ACA Death Spiral #Obamacare is Dead disaster designed to fail All Americans into single payer GOV Bigger Nightmare #MAGA
Same story week after week. Need to get it done they say. But still nothing but hot air.
Someone with a little fire in his belly needs to take over the lead role for Republicans. We also need to replace some liberal Republicans
#Obamacare  only has a major effect on about 2-3 percent of population. Let's quit pretending the world will end if it is repealed.
Just go back to the time when all employers provided health insurance for their employees. Medicare and Medicaid took care of the rest.
Good!
@SenateMajLdr Mitch, WTH are you doing? Noooo!
Get it together GOP or you will loose biggly.  Stope being self serving A holes.
While McCain is recovering from his medical treatment which was paid for by Americans they are crafting a bill that will limit our treatment
And he will never have the votes for a bad bill. I don't understand what Republicans don't understand. People WANT the ACA, period.
#FullRepeal and then get out of healthcare!!
You should be a part of the Senate's solution rather than constant negativity for the efforts of the Senate.
Rand honors his word and oath of office. I'm sorry that offends the big govt. RINOs you support. #FreeMarket #StandWithRand #GOP
I support steps to less government involvement in all aspects of our lives. unfortunately, decades of entitlement take steps to unwind.
Then why aren't you supporting Rand and the #FreedomCaucus
I support progress. The pre O'care insurance mkt was destroyed. We all need to support progress with repeal and replacement. Needs stages.
Then why oppose #RepealFirst ??? Let the market data help evaluate next steps... #FreeMarkets #GOP
Because the government program destroyed the market for American families. We need a transition back to the free market.
Repeal is the first transition. Let's work together and not cast stones. #FreeMarket #RealReform #GOP @RandPaul #StandWithRand
you should be worried.  Worried about handing Congress back to the Dems.  DO SOMETHING! You had 8 years! Enough Pontificating
No #repeall would be bad for #GOP at election time, but the #FakeRepeal #ObamaCareLite that the #RINOs are pushing will be even worse.
I am a Reaganite, take what you can get and shift the baseline
If Republicans don't want to fight for #FullRepeal now, what makes you think they will fight for it later?
If they pass McConnell's bill they'll say they repealed ObamaCare (lie) & move on.  Except GOP will own all of it.
https://twitter.com/Federalists_USA/status/878526889471516672 â€¦
If it were me I have it repealed only
I agree
He better get it done or resign.
Unfortunately Rand Paul that only makes you an obstructionist in my eyes. No better than the Democrats. Sorry!
How is stopping a bill that keeps Obama care in place obstruction? He's offered several alternative plans but leadership ignores them.
He's not going to get 'everything' he wants in ONE fell swoop. Rome wasn't built in a day. He must be willing to take the first step.
Don't make me angry. You won't like me when I'm  angry 
...than all of them combined !!
The problem with these incompetent Dems & Republicans is that they can't get over the fact that a NON-POLITICIAN us doing a far better job..
Tired of screwing around with this stupid healthcare,its garbageDump it.Allow us to buy what we want at an affordable price,how hard is that
Just forget all this bull go medicare for all and force medical institutions to except

Oh really? Ya think? If he had the votes America would be screwed already. Turtle head would wipe out healthcare for millions like it was ok
7yrs and these idiots can't get anything done!!
You need to vote YES ON HEALTHCARE BILL
No state lines, free market
Perhaps he Pres should consider a new party and leave the democrat and republican idiots to fend for themselves
Given the level of support and watching the republicans act like fools, if I were Pres Trump I would switch parties and join the Democrats.
It's up to our legislatures to create honest, helpful laws. Listen to Ted Cruz.He's got it right.
The people who want Obamacare are the ACO's. They are squandering important healthcare dollars. Let's discuss their lies/propaganda l
If take time to LISTEN to Ppl Mitch's health care is NOT what Ppl want. Stop saying we voted for this "crap roll". Wanted bipartisan input.
Shame on you, @RandPaul

Mitch McConnell has to delay taking healthcare from American taxpayers until after John McCain has surgery, paid for by American taxpayers.
WE THE PEOPLE need the same healthcare options Congress has.
Senator Paul, Please, please, please, repeal Obamacare!!  that is why the GOP was voted in.  Please stick to your guns with the president.
Of course u dont Rand bcause u r not goin 2vote 4 any bill but 1 thing is 4 sure u ought 2think about another profession other than politics
marijuana would bring disease down,according to scientist.Put weed on all 2018 ballots to lure #Millennials to the polls &toss out shady gop
No 1 answers what this bill would do for Nursing home services& Group homes.So thinking it sinks them...
#StandWithRand
@BretBaier @SpeakerRyan when the Federal  payments are reduced.
@BretBaier @SpeakerRyan under   Obamacare as  it is right now. The CBO need to compare  coverage under new plans to the reduced coverage
@BretBaier @SpeakerRyan nothing else  is  done. No one seems to be  talking  about the  people who are at risk  of  losing their coverage
No more bail outs; let Obamacare fail if you can't replace or repeal
@BretBaier @SpeakerRyan after he left  office.  All of those covered by the  Medicaid  Expansion are at risk of  losing  their coverage if
@BretBaier @SpeakerRyan of the expansion and   they cannot afford to do that. Obama  knew  this was going to happen and  set it up to happen
@BretBaier @SpeakerRyan government for a limited number  of years. When that time expires,  the states would have to cover much of  the cost
@BretBaier @SpeakerRyan changes? The CBO does not even consider that. The Medicaid expansion  under Obamacare was paid by the Federal
@BretBaier @SpeakerRyan  Why doesn't any Republican talk about the people who are at risk to lose their coverage under Obamacare if nothing
Hey Rand dont make us stay in ACA until u get replaced. Thats whats gonna happen. Repeal & replace u and all who wont vote YES.
Keep beating the drum Senator. There are a lot of us waiting for our Senators to deliver the same message of #Repeal
Come on  Rand Paul. Get your concerns addressed and make this a great bill. We have to repeal  this  Not Affordable Healthcare Act
Good! We don't want that bill. We want FULL REPEAL w/a phase out period. Then left free mkt HC work. Next reform Medicare/Medicaid. DONE!
Let's HOPE NOT
REPEAL
REPEAL
REPEAL 
Sometimes.es Senator you have to give a little
Please don't support anything but full repeal. It is like a cancer you must cut it all out. Gov is problem not solution.
Rand, why not listen to Huckabee? Repeal and let each state do their own thing with Healthcare.
Believe We had a good healthcare system in place Why did someone change the system Why have We not FIRED all involved in creating this mess?
If this passes shame on the entire Senate you need to work together to stop this and the lies spewing from @SenateMajLdr @VP @POTUS
Voting for this bill = voting to cut $700M from Medicaid = giving top 1% big tax cut = 22M loosing coverage = 208,500 dying = American shame
Because he doesn't want to piss off his liberal brothers
At this point in time go to tax cuts and let obamacare fail on its own, dimms still own that health catastrophe
Thank you @RandPaul you are a paragon of honesty in the swamp known as Washington DC
I agree, but there is zero chance your plan will happen. We have too many RINOs. Let's salvage what we can before Mitch sells the farm!
If they pass this now they will never fix later.
GOOD!
I believe "we the PEOPLE" voted for TRUMP & You REPUBLICANS NEED TO GET THE JOB DONE!!! PAUL,FLAKE. & yes even MCCAIN!SHOULD BEEN BEEN READY
I'm all for it failing as long as the next step isn't keeping ACA and working with Dems to fix it.
Thank God above. It is cruel beyond description.
Had 7 yrs to get plan ready, WOW!!! Makes you all look like rookies. Mr TRUMP deservers better from own party.
Simple change it to 52 !!!!
@SenateMajLdr, REPEAL Obamacare. @SenMikeLee @RandPaul @tedcruz @SenRonJohnson. Be men of your word--for a change.
And he won't gave them, also Trump can Veto his negotiations , and make McConnell look more stupid and weak , maybe that's what he needs
We need to support this effort. Get on board or don't get re-elected Rand.
Repeal and replace ,so Trump can sign it he's waiting with his pen in hand nothing else will do,anything else will be the end of republicans
Lets hope not
That's why it needs yo go to vote so changes can be made.  Rand be a team player for a change.  Let it go to vote.
I am a
Is @RandPaul the only one that understands that Insurance companies are the problem. More subsidies? Really?????

@FoxNews @RandPaul Sen Paul you will singlehandedly destroy the Republican party in the Senate.
I think he does.  It's just a matter of timing.
Best of luck in 18 for your GOP. At least we can get some fresh Independent blood in the Congress/Senate
GOP needs to get their shit together and give the people what they promised
Yes,yes
Please speak to your constituents. I don't think they knew what repeal would do to them. Have a heart and forget your grudge against O.
He was elected by the tea party at the time who only wanted a full repeal. He is listening to his constituents.
He had best not or the @GOP Don't GAS
Take #ACA and #FIXitDontNIXit
Be Our dam Heroes 4 once. ..please?
Let's get all of these lying politicians out,
Ever midterm election they lie to us,we fall for it,and they do nothing, vote for new reps.
GOP has had 8 years to get this right
Rand Paul need to understand TEAM - his actions help Obamacare supporters
Because you pretend and love Obamacare Mr Senator
He better or DNC n GOP present members will be weeded out starting in 2018
has 50 which is all that is needed.
REPEAL IT
McConell is just doing throwbacks. Leave him be!
@FoxNews @RandPaul so why don't u get the corporate tax done u can't walk and chew gum at the same time
So @RandPaul will fuck the whole country.... thanks Rand.
As soon as we get @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @POTUS republicans will do something, thy promise. Looks like 2016 never frickin happened. Ass clowns
Mostly b\c of Senators like Rand Paul!
Repeal first. Fix later
Sounds just about right
Good,
Stopping a bad bill is often more important than passing a good one.
@AP4Liberty 
#AP4MO
We can only hope "Mitchy" does not have the votes. You are right Rand. Repeal then replace. That's what we were promised!
Even if they come an agreement ,Trump can still Veto, I don't think Trump will sign anything else other than Repeal and replace
The real reason why 45 wants repeal and replace is bcuz it has the name of a black man on the bill and tax brks for the wealthy.
What an ugly divisive thing to say!
The truth can be A SOB sometimes.
In my opinion it is not the truth, nothing but race baiting hate!
That's all they have, so they stick to it
@FoxNews @RandPaul All those votes to repeal meant nothing. I'm sick of y'all doing nothing. @SenateGOP @RobWittman
Let Obamacare die & hang it around the necks of Democrats like an anchor. They passed this w/o a single Republican vote make them own it!
@FoxNews @RandPaul After 7 years how do @SenateGOP not have a plan agreed upon? What the hell have y'all been doing??
Well....... Collins & Paul can stay in the "lime light" for another few weeks, you would think after 8 years they would have done more :( :(
I hope he doesn't. Mitch is the whipping boy for the Koch Bros $$and will do anything for them and 45 and not give a damn about who suffers.
Give up
Keep fighting @RandPaul we want the bill to pass but in a responsible way. We got ur back
DRAIN THE SWAMP
You will be voted out if you do not vote to allow the discussion to go to the floor perfection is not what we will get but it's a start
obamacare is not a mess this administration is, one needs tweaking other one needs to be overhauled its full of
Unfortunately, Trump Russia lies distract from how Trumpcare is a JOB killer and will hurt millions of people - esp in Red states.
We won't find out this week
