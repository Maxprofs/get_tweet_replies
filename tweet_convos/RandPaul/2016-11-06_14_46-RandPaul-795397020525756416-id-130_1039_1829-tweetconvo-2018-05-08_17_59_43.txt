u called it man. Now investigate the director and throw him in the slammer
he used a software program invented by a Democrat to search 500,000 emails.
you fight for the righteousness but the world seems to be sold out. Although you have wide support from those who are aware.
release the emails if there's nothing to see. Let the American people decide.
follow @wikileaks start reading.
disappointed with the others. When FBI Director politicizes the office, he needs to go. so does Loretta Lynch
.@RandPaul's response to the FBI
@alllibertynews @RandPaul Edges frayed and writing fades of constitution as the parallel law has rooted in public view. #Sharia
Thank you, @RandPaul & also thank you for being a man of your word & living up to the pledge you made w/ 16 other GOP
You were right @JamesComeyFBI belongs in PRISON
Rand, Ur the real deal! They will NEVER tell U what they r doin w the drone program bc they r usin drones 2 spray us w chemtrails.
: @FBI Dir. has again failed his oath of office to defend the constitution against our foreign & domestic enemy @hillaryclinton
Cruz (R-TX), Yea,, Coburn (R-OK), Yea  Scott (R-SC), Yea|
Usually the crowd is wrong, unless they can galvanize on a brave idea or person.
Here's something you should watch
like the Zadroga Act?
@Zagotti @WashTimes
Today is OUR #IndependenceDay. Today is the day #WeTheVoters take our country back. #VoteTrump #Election2016 #DrainTheSwamp 
that's a big amen
I disagree with @RandPaul on many issues. But i admire him for relying on principles instead of cravenly chasing ephemeral poll numbers.
Yeah, then you sided with the establishment GOPe like a total loser. Especially shameful given your father's principles
I always liked @RandPaul! I was really surprised by how poorly he did in the primaries after a great start early!

twitter said I should follow you rand, but you belong to the Generally Oppresses People party.  Why would i. Silly twit
Your not a lone wolf , it's just we the people don't matter
Like your father.#standingRand
@DkneuteSJU I hope Everyone NOW understands how Mr. Trump feels. Trump is 1 for ALL of US(A). We Must ALL VOTE for him.#America1st

.@RandPaul I am so thankful for your grit and fight and I will never forget it!
everyone, including me, wants you to run in 2020
so do we!
Why arent u showing open borders,mass Syrian refugees influx looks like. Paris https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RScj18u_QCM …

#IToldYouSo
Cant you all stop the clinton pedo ring?
@RandPaul @WashTimes
ROFLMAO if the FBI can't how can we?
Can you filibuster HRC every time she opens her yap? Here's the latest Clinton/Comey scandal http://tinyurl.com/j4hfth6  Explains, no?
Kudos Rand. That's in the past. What will you do NOW to save the country?
- it turns out Comey Is a stand out only because he's so tall.
Too bad you are not still in the running.
You  and Ted Cruz.  You were right.  And Cruz was right with his filibuster.
@lyz_estrada @WashTimes I'm in Kentucky and now u definitely have my vote
BINGO CAN RELATE ITS SICKENIN THE NERVE OF THESE CLOWNS...SHE IS A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL AMERICA.. #kysen #StandWithRand
How did the FBI go through 650,000, 59,090 emails day, 2462 hour, 41 per minute in 11 days Something not right
please God let us see clearly in 20/20 *wink*..you can use it @RandPaul 
you certainly proved this fact Dr. Paul
But ..you didn't stand up ..only long enough to give ppl impression, then u gave up after #FBI "explained"

#RandPaul
"Mr. Paul announced he had gotten more details from the FBI and was dropping his blockade effort"

#RandPaul #RINO

Good instincts. Voice of reason in a sea of confusion.
This "corruption machine" needs replacing. Lets make a difference the day after tomorrow!
well said Senator Paul.
where now then? FBI caves in . Clinton child abuse links
Everyone else was MASSIVELY wrong.
NO you're not wrong!  I've had Enough of HER!  She's a DANGER to this NATION. Comey blew it twice! he should go too!
you were right Sen Paul!
that's why I love you Rand. You were also the only candidate to call out both parties for gross overspending
The whole Government is corrupt. so it stands to say, that they want a Follower
If Clinton wins, don't let her get anything done.
that's why I love you, baby. Even if I disagree with you a lot.
Ron & Rand have never steered anyone  wrong
@FBI it's better to see how James B. Comey is part of their bribe and so with that what else are verdicts yesterday.
I know u are in a race in KY but America needs to hear from u. How can congress ensure Lynch is held accountable 4 obstruction??
why does nobody listen to the truth? This country frustrates me anymore
Dr. Rand Paul you are a better man than most in Washington, with good instincts.
Why don't you get the hell outta the GOP & seriously start a Libertarian Pty. The teabaggers & crazies have taken over the GOP.
.@RandPaul There are two more days to go, you may come around again to like Comey.
Sometimes when you're the only one standing up for something, it's everyone else who is wrong. http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/29/sen-rand-paul-is-lone-dissenter-as-james-comey-con/ …
Comey knew he couldn't get an indictment with the current AG still shows killary is dangerous to US security

You just locked down my vote Dr. Paul. #draintheswamp
2020 Rand for President
hogwash #nevertrump
OK, but I don't recall your vote against Comey having anything to do specifically with Comey.  So, nice shot man?
I wish I could vote for you  twice on tuesday, but that would make me a demokrat.
Oh, Rand. One day people will see you for all you stand for. We are fortunate to have you on our side.
thank you sir for the sane one in these insane times.
That is the "New Rule" of "LAW"
also sometimes when all other people and facts say you're wrong...you're just wrong
So....
BZ to Dr. Paul.
you were right about this guy
Did you have issues with Comey beyond his drone policies? Not saying you didn't end up being right about him, just curious.
you are absolutely correct.
James Comey, (future board member) of Apple or Google or Facebook or Twitter, in the news Sunday afternoon.
Rand Paul is one of the only politicians to b trusted.
We need to demand that all 650,000 emails be released immediately, after all there's nothing to see.
I want Comey to explain how he did a full investigation & went thru all 650,000 emails in a week's time. What a SHAM. Shame on the FBI!!
As Mel Brooks once said (of James Comey?), "We've got to protect our phony baloney jobs gentlemen!!"
man... You should have gotten the nomination...
Today, I know how you feel, Rand.
ITS KINDA LIKE..... @RandPaul no one cares if J.Edgar Hoover was a closet tranny...he was a jerk straight or crooked.
#draintheswamp if my husband did an ounce of what she has done he would be in prison!
Yes, indeed.
sorry Rand, need more men like you
