Her failed war in Libya & arming Syrian rebels allied w/ ISIS, made us less safe. It appears she has not learned anything #DemDebate
Twelve Years Later, @HillaryClinton Is Still Defending Her Iraq War Vote http://slate.me/1JbDNZX  #DemDebate
@RandPaul  @HillaryClinton u pledged to support racist, xenophobic Trump if he won the nomination & u have the audacity to, well.. TALK?
@ChrisTanasoff @RandPaul @HillaryClinton watch a friend die by not sending security or help
@mommags2579 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton republicans: removing intense complexity from issues so it's fits their simple minds. U guys: RIOTS!
@ChrisTanasoff @RandPaul @HillaryClinton for security and u want to talk Gop no her errors
@mommags2579 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton we're just going round in circles now. Again, ur intentionally simplifying complex issues.
@ChrisTanasoff @RandPaul @HillaryClinton nope just repeating what she testified too check
@capnjoy @RandPaul whoops, looks like someone only reads headlines of partisan rags, or you would know what he actually said. Nice troll tho
@capnjoy @RandPaul if you 'heard it' on Maddow, I guess that settles it then. Unless of course you understand context.
@capnjoy @RandPaul you didn't seriously attempt to use salon as support did you? Sorry, I dont click on partisan trash, left or right
@capnjoy @RandPaul you really are ignorant on the topic & all over the place. White supremacy now? Good luck w/ Salon and confirmation bias
Nice try. The wars were started by @GOP pres. in #muslim countries. Own it.@RandPaul @HillaryClinton #DemDebate
@RandPaul @Rockprincess818 @HillaryClinton  You are sinking as fast as your support base is dwindling. Now only FBI wants you... for Prison!
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton Ahh Rand just STFU!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @jeanee5TAM say NO to Hellary
@RandPaul @freedom3556 @HillaryClinton
.@jamezdhawaii So there's a fairly strong causal link between Monicagate and 9/11
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton she has all the dirt on her conspirators so she will not be indicted for crimes against humanity
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton why isn't she being charged?
@RandPaul @Rockprincess818 @HillaryClinton 
Hillary Clinton you are sinking...
Almost as fast as your support base is disappearing
@RandPaul @Kim_Perryman @HillaryClinton WHOSE wars? Rumsfeld, Cheney and Bush should be on the list... come on.. be honest, Rand
Adding to @RandPaul, Rand Paul ranks 5, won 1, of GOP field last 24h on Twitter mentions #demdebate https://goo.gl/a1uNyx 
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton MEANWHILE, you, Dr. Paul, voted in support of both of those wars? Why are you being such a hypocrite?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Her wars? Hello? I beleive that GWB started the war in Iraq? Hello earth to Rand Paul? Hello? Wake up? Paul?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  Hillary Clinton: Turkey???
@RandPaul Her war in Iraq?  Are we rewriting history and leaving out that President Bush started that war?

DID YOU GET HALIBURTON$ ?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Iraq was/is Bush-Cheney's "Mission Accomplished," War! : (
@RandPaul you've lost so quit whining and do the job the people of KY elected you to do. I'm still dumbfounded as to why they did.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @billpostmus cause she has no clue about foreign policy.  Except taking money from foreign countries.
@RandPaul @billpostmus @HillaryClinton good point!!!
And the winner of the #DemsDebate is => @RandPaul. Entertaining and making his case.  Glad to see him coming on strong!  #tlot #tcot

@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Absolutely correct, Sir.  Although audacity is not a strong enough word.
@RandPaul @MHowerton45 @HillaryClinton When's the hanging? Let's not forget her buddy in charge.@JudgeJeanine @JudgeTedPoe @GovAbbott
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Hillary was taken to task by Rand years ago over weapons going through Turkey, we now know it was true
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Stick to boycotting the debates. You weren't invited to this one either. Work on your Kentucky campaign.

@RandPaul @HillaryClinton evidently was surprised that Maliki continued 1500 years of conflict between Sunnis and Shiites. #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Dude are you trolling dude?  You've been relegated to the B team. Your ploy is obvious.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Rand Paul get over it-She was drilled and drilled and nothing found-in fact #GOP said they went after her
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton RP, you fool! It was GWB invasion of Iraq that destabilized the region which is why ISIS was formed.
.@RandPaul @HillaryClinton : "America Should Not Settle for #HillaryClinton" -http://bit.ly/1yluJf2 
#Iraq
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton agreed!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton It is the war machine that motivates both the #DemDebate and last #GOPDebate.
@RandPaul @Colton_Grace @HillaryClinton - I agree. She talks as if she actually helped the situation when in fact she helped make it worse!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton' 3 point plan 1) Advisers on ground 2) deny them security 3) Blame the results on a video.
@randpaul @hillaryclinton ISIS WAS CREATED AT LANGLEY,TRAINED IN JORDAN BY THE MOSSAD/CIA.BLACK WATER IS INVOVLED ETC.
@RandPaul @DukeofGangnam @HillaryClinton - and Iraq did nothing . okay,lol.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton my ears are bleeding listening to this debate. But I promised I would. Ugh!!!
@jrael20141 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton  It's better with the sound off and if you squint your eyes a lot while watching
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Pay attention and you will learn that ISIS was created with Baathe fighters from Saddam's army GWB did that-Own it
@deck449 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton perhaps you & Hillary shld own it. Unlike her, @RandPaul never supported the Iraq War, or Libya or Syria
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton This is a battle of the heart and soul of Islam. No American boots on ground. Muslim powers' responsibility.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Two drinks and now your tweets are making sense
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Wish we could have you on this stage tonight.. #WeStandWithRand

#Randpaul #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  Rand, nope Bush did that!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I am a veteran, they only thing I can say that I am tired or those places, tired of seeing fellow veterans die
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  you are absolutely right Rand.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton What did the Repubs war in Iraq do for our security?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton seriously?! Hillary Clinton's war?! What Twilight Zone nightmare are you from?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton She should go see that movie about herself. #13HoursMovie
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton and what president led the charge on fake pretenses about nuclear weapons in Iraq? Oh right  George W Bush. Repub
@RandPaul @jjauthor @HillaryClinton how are they her wars?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton NOT Hillary's wars. GOP wars.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton her wars? What an idiotic statement from an intelligent man
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul The administrations lack of leadership in US has translated to creating power vacuums in all our engagements abroad
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Because that's her strongest selling point (aside from being a woman).  Her experience with foreign policy.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I think Bush invaded Iraq not Hillary
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Dr. Paul admit you kinda #FeelTheBern 
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Hillary's work while Secretary of State assisted in the creation of ISIS! #StandWithRand #RandRally #DemDebate
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton excuse me... HER war? Let's not forget who started this WHOLE thing. Think further back.
@RandPaul @BeachinFree @HillaryClinton HRC owns Arab Spring & Libya/Syria disasters. She wants to give us more.

@RandPaul @HillaryClinton #Benghazi #ArabSpring = #EpicFail
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Sorry Rand, no ball. The war in Iraq was a Bush legacy, or did you forget that purposely...don't lie like others.
@RandPaul go home
@RandPaul Do you think they will ask @HillaryClinton about the arms her administration let loose in Syria, Libya, etc?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton What else do you expect from a pig with a grunt?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton what is your experience in the issue?
@peruanitofeliz @RandPaul @HillaryClinton He's actually on the foreign relations committee and opposes American citizens getting killed.
@JustinSzew309 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton One thing is to be in a committee, other to be in the field.
@peruanitofeliz @RandPaul @HillaryClinton But Rand opposes American forces dying...you're saying he should support it? I'm confused.
@RandPaul SAVAGE!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I was waiting for that
