@RandPaul And yet, you sit on the sidelines when Cruz needs your support. He is only one with chance now and you hand presidency to Trump.
@JeffEdwardDumas @RandPaul Cruz is tied to the problem; look it up.
@TheWatcherSeven @RandPaul Cruz is only one left in race that even comes close to addressing real problems. Best chance we have for change.
@JeffEdwardDumas @RandPaul Find someone who says what Cruz says, but without history of political ties.
@TheWatcherSeven @RandPaul Tell ya' what. You find one and let me know who that person is. If he can get on ballot and have a chance I'm in.
@JeffEdwardDumas @RandPaul I meant his specific ties. Bush/establishment/WallSt. No way around it. First term senator. Who is he? Too risky.
@TheWatcherSeven @RandPaul so your preferred choice seems to be Trump? Insanity.
@JeffEdwardDumas @RandPaul Anyone w/ Bush Republican ties = insanity. Their policies for the last 25 years are borderline treasonous.
@RandPaul @MamaBear4Cruz than quit with the sideline game and get vocal for Cruz
@dknight716 @RandPaul @MamaBear4Cruz >implying Cruz actually cares when he didn't even show up to vote on the bill
@cxnscixus @dknight716 @RandPaul kk kinda hard to be in two places at once, dear. Ever think it was planned that way?
@MamaBear4Cruz @cxnscixus @dknight716 @RandPaul Rand fought to vote all he can while he was running for prez, why can't Cruz or Rubio?
@flowingsolemnly @cxnscixus @dknight716 @RandPaul He does. Why aren't the debates on the weekend when Congress isn't in session?
@MamaBear4Cruz @cxnscixus @dknight716 @RandPaul He missed the Audit the Fed vote too. This is not an isolated case.
@flowingsolemnly @cxnscixus @dknight716 @RandPaul Audit the fed was doomed to fail with or without his vote.
@MamaBear4Cruz That's a complete non-excuse. He abandons a vital bill because "it was doomed to fail anyway". How unfaithful.
@RandPaul idk why you don't like Trump, you should have been his VP, either way God bless you for continuing to fight to save America sir
@therealryaneddy @RandPaul Rand is a purest and doesn't like Trump's arrogance. But Trump is our best hope. @tedcruz is tied to the problem.
@TheWatcherSeven @therealryaneddy @RandPaul @tedcruz Trump is tied to the same people Killary is tied to!!!!  Get a Clue!  Rand knows this!
@Michele_Gman @therealryaneddy @RandPaul I understand concern, but rest of GOP are proven liars. Who has the balls to take on globalists?
@RandPaul America is not "crumbling". Stop with these scare tactics to get voters and support -_-'
@MontrayDavis @RandPaul you should take an economics class. And decline of Roman empire. History and math disagree w you. #Liberty
@RandPaul What do you think of your own regime?? The US is duplicitous, has betrayed every ally. Maj. of US politicians are corrupt.
@SSGPA1 @RandPaul you shld follow him more closely. Both he and his father, @RonPaul agree thatany US politicians are corrupt.
@FUEstablishment @RandPaul Trump IS the shitstorm.  #NeverTrump #CruzCrew
@RandPaul @thedirrtyshizno Way to go Alex, we need to share the word.
@RandPaul what about when Washington govt helped to toppled the democratic govt of Bhutto and who helped you to tackled soviet union in Afgh
@RandPaul Rand Paul I'm impressed, you have a future in America office, hopefully VP.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Merkel has fallen! Her left wing lunatic party has lost 66% of it support base! http://telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews …
@RandPaul Right on bro. keep telling on the idiots. maybe someone will take notice.
@RandPaul Hi Mr Paul. Called Heller on this. Not sure what 'Tabled' means in the long run but hopefully Pakistans NOT getting those F16's
@RandPaul I wish you hadn't dropped out. I was going to vote for you...
@RandPaul @alllibertynews I have felling for you rand Paul
@RandPaul @alllibertynews i,m in  with you  rand Paul 
@RandPaul @alllibertynews I  you rand Paul 
@RandPaul For the US its just taxes,for India it could be a hightech attack aka Mumbai. Can US stop supporting Pakistan as they dont deserve
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Is Rand Paul a politician or not?He has to tax people either way Also,corruption starts at home,expanding globally
@RandPaul Appreciate your work.
That is so true that they take your arms & money & they laugh at you & on the other side support terrorism.
@RandPaul Our money should be spent at home, not overseas. I agree.
@RandPaul  Thank you Sen Rand for TRYING to get this voted down. I'm shocked & mad as hell it was voted for. You're the only one that cares!
@RandPaul  Still love your principles, @RandPaul. Keep protecting America!
@RandPaul I wrote this comment in notes, due to the characteristics limitations that Twitter has.
@RandPaul @meeelissax3 we didnt deserve him
@RandPaul .. What are your views on billions of $$$ of your tax payers money spent on supporting an evil #Israel regime? ..
@RandPaul .. #Pakistan lost so much in your war on terror. Shame on you and ppl like you.. Who turn their backs on your allies.  Disgusting!
@RandPaul  @MikeMark4pres  That is why I am Running, I can't watch America fall, without trying to catch her. http://Mikemarkforpresident.com 
@RandPaul 
Sale of ARMS 2 PAKISTAN 8x F16 Fighter Jets to a Country almost AMERICA'S Friend
ARE GOVERNMENT LEADERS 
IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
@RandPaul @realkodybrown
@RandPaul Pak's suffered immensely due to US' Afg involvement - against Soviets in 80's and since 2001. Ron Paul had more class!
@RandPaul @SillsCraig Thank you Senator Paul!
@RandPaul Just jump on your daddy's coattails
@RandPaul that seriously makes so much level headed, intelligent, sense...it's no wonder we can't have you as president.
@RandPaul This nonsense has to stop. Should be a no-brainer but when the American people aren't watching, the machine keeps humming along.
@RandPaul maybe we should charge them 300 million instead. And then make bundles more on service contracts for them.
@RandPaul damn I hate that u had to drop out... You are my hero
@randpaul Why in the world we would be giving our lives to fight your war??
@RandPaul thank you for being the only one on the national stage making sense! #nojetsforpakistan
@RandPaul There are 4 provinces and 48 Terrorist org's in pakistan,strongly oppose trading arms with them.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul I appreciate your wise comments on this issue. I hope you'll be able to stop this aid to the country that does not deserve it.
@RandPaul 

Trump’s “WE” pin is replacing the American flag lapel pin. The
“WE” pin unites. Flags separate.
@RandPaul Why does the President decide how federal money is spent now instead of #Congress? 
#Constitution anyone?
@RandPaul Pakistan loss and efforts for U.S in war of terror  is more than 30 billion dollars.Be realistic please
@RandPaul so what about Pakistani tax payers money spend in war on terror?in supporting U.S?its all 2way.seems u need to learn from senetors
@RandPaul "Sale of arms" and "taxpayers footing the bill to give those arms" is two different things. What is the truth?
@RandPaul Americans cannot look away anymore period! Big gov must be stopped they're destroying our nation lets get back to the constitution
@RandPaul why'd you dropout? Your unique voice could have changed the national dialogue.
@RandPaul that's why you would have made an excellent president. I am still a #RandPaul supporter!
@RandPaul Senator Paul is the only one that I hear telling Obama how He is screwing our Country.Take a look People wake up it's the time.
@RandPaul What stop us to make Rand Paul our President for 2016!!!.Trump and Cruz.Seriously..I don't buy for a second these liars.
@RandPaul keep up the good work!
@RandPaul @JoeNBC wish more conservatives would follow Dr. Pauls lead
@RandPaul y isn't the money going to help the American people? We can't support the world enough is enough
@RandPaul I hope you mean the US puppet regime in Ukraine corrupt to its very core?
@RandPaul then why did you drop out?
@RandPaul you can't seem to draw significant support either
@RandPaul finally, a voice of clarity, reasoning and common sense. Wish you were still in the race for POTUS.
@RandPaul It is time to make some changes. #TIMEFORACHANGE
@RandPaul America & Free World need #PresidentPaul2016 to survive. Least of 2016 devils still evil & 2020 too late.  #UnSuspend & save us.
@RandPaul God bless. It is irrational to take American tax payer dollars just to send it to other countries. Kentucky, re-elect this man!
Why can't enough of US see that @RandPaul & @RonPaul are exactly what we need to get back on track?
@RandPaul yes we the  paycheck to paycheck folks have to foot the bill.
@RandPaul stair it in the face and put the smack down
@RandPaul I  you rand Paul 
@RandPaul Excuse me, and how is ISIS getting it Toyota vehicles/parts? Maybe via Saudi Arabia from the Hebron, KY Toyota plant??
@WeAIIWin @RandPaul The volume out of Hebron, KY is significant.  @ToyotaALJ @toyotaqatar @Toyota_UAE
@RandPaul @TheLibertyMove that is true and I agree you need a better spokesman
@RandPaul #TedCruz was the other Senator voting with Paul.  I am for military spending, but not for stupid military spending.  They waste.
Love you, @RandPaul Thanks for always standing up for what's right.  Your service to our country is appreciated.
@Gunntwitt @RandPaul.  2Nd Chronicles 7:14
No idea. Send link (or don't) @RogerHFrost3
@RandPaul Why did you drop out of the race and why did you run such a shitty campaign? We deserve better from you. #BADADVISORS #TONEDEAF
@endprism @RandPaul stop complaining and keep fighting, he is still running for his senate seat and he continues to fight in the Senate!
@RandPaul Stop obama giving free F16's to a terrorist nation that will reverse engineer the F16's and build more to shoot down US planes.
@RandPaul  Please do not Rand your my last secure hope for this election. #StandWithRand #RandingStrong #LibertyMatters
@RandPaul so get back into the presidential race and stay until then end so we can believe your statement!
@TarekFatah what's your opinion on @RandPaul with this statement.. He is the only politician speaking about this
@RandPaul  STAND WITH RAND!!
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  what are your thoughts on Senator Paul's statement?
@RandPaul Here's another example of foreign aid waste, and bad foreign policy too. #FiscalConservative #BudgetWaste
@RandPaul What does it matter? If we try to spend it on programs here, you just scream "SOCIALISM!"
@RandPaul so do something!!
@FlaniganVarina @RandPaul you mean like getting this sale to be blocked right now on the Senate floor? It just passed.
@RandPaul @dknott409 You should be more concerned about the corruption in Congress and their attempts to ignore the anger of the voter
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Same team
@RandPaul wish you were my state senator. Keep up the good work!
@RandPaul 
Rand is a good man I hope in the future you run again for president 
Trump has my vote this year
@RandPaul You are unique among your GOP counterparts. Keep up the good work Dr. Paul. Wish you were the front runner in GOP race but ...
@RandPaul agree with you. Plz support Trump he agrees with you on most points. We can't have another robot of spec int. in WA #Trump2016
@RandPaul rand you are the man
@RandPaul we dont have a chance until we seperate money from politics/government
@RandPaul great to have you back. Now go do the right thing and join the @LPNational  to make it official please! #Freedom #libertarian
@RandPaul We shouldn't be forced to vote for someone we don't want as our POTUS either, but YOU don't care!  Go Away!
@DPat1430 @RandPaul what have you done
@RandPaul unless you're talking about infrastructure, we're not crumbling, see: stocks, unemployment, inflation, CPI, housing, wages, etc
@RandPaul    [ PAKIES DONT NEED OUR JETS !   THEY GOT NUKES ! ]
@RandPaul you could come out against Ted Cruz and back Trump... maybe even talk to Trump about running as VP it depends if you love the USA
@Tids1960 @RandPaul Although Trump and Paul don't get along, they do have a lot in common, both recognize the DC corruption
@RandPaul No one is jailed because they are poor & No taxpayer should be on the hook for posting criminal bail #EnoughIsEnough 
@RandPaul Sorry, you have become irrelevant by not endorsing @tedcruz Rome is burning! Are you OK with Trump/Hillary? #Cruz & USA needs you!
@NancyMcAnally Why should he endorse anyone? He'll be attacked by either Trump,Cruz,or Rubio fans. He represents we the people.
@RandPaul Like the US military?
