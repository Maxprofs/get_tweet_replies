C'mon, join the winning team! You know shes better than the guy that ruined your party!!
simply wrong brother.... simply wrong.
Just because you keep saying it won't make it true. All of the taxpayer $$ you spend won't make it true. @HillaryClinton
@GovGaryJohnson 

I agree about Hillary but the phony Trump is a joke too.  

I will be voting for GARY JOHNSON!
@SKB1967@SKB1967 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton @GovGaryJohnson WASTED VOTE. WAKE UP.
Voting for the lesser of two evils or for someone that you do not believe in is the wasted vote.
Been voting for "lessor of 2 evils" for yrs! Romney v Obama in 2012 PS I did NOT vote Obama
If you always do what you have always done, expect to get what you've always got. Vote Gary!
Hmm, thanks but no thanks! An Anti-American open border dope smokin' Pres is not what I have in mind!
Well then by all means, go vote for a racist, anti-everything else, hateful, draft dodging Trump.
Not a politician or a racist, seems to care about America(ns), respects sovereignty, willing to try.
@JudicialWatch 'New Evidence' that HRC winked at a Judicial cover-up & BLUDGEONING of 2A
@freedomtex @HillaryClinton Get some sense, man! She is abv the law and beyond trivial stds applicable to #BasketOfDeplorables !
And those attacks emit lots of CO2 - climate terrorism, unless she refutes Gore & repeals all tax measures.
@PJStrikeForce @HillaryClinton Hello Supreme Court of this Land and DOJ FBI you all are included in this statement
@tomborelli Then will you endorse Trump
Totally Agree!!!
get off your high horse rand, you sound like a clown.
great, but *who* should we vote for? The two party system is failing Americans.
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @HillaryClinton Your Conscience. 
there are no conscionable choices in the coming presidential election.
The official choices are terrible. So right! I'm writing in Dr. @RandPaul.
Can you please become friends with Donald? I love your ideas and think you would be great as part of his team.
Yes!!
@freedomtex @HillaryClinton That includes dog catcher.
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton
I want a president who can give the inaugural address standing up. @realDonaldTrump #Deplorables #ClintonCollapse 
Dereliction or acts of terror? (Attacks on Libbya etc. etc.), don't know which is worse!
Very well Rand, then lead the charge. Oversight Committee is slow as Xmass.
#KYGOPLD
@PJStrikeForce @HillaryClinton Hillary is going down, literally. It just happened today. Down. @HillaryClinton Withdraw ASAP
We the "Deplorable Americans" will take back our country from you & all those who are like you Clintons!
Same goes for Clapper Obama Lynch Comey & every elected POS official in sanctuary cities
you also ran
help Trump win and stop the Obama third term
She is either stupid beyond belief, criminal, or both. Either way shouldn't be allowed to give tours at WH.
Apparently nothing can disqualify a person from running for president...
So what are YOU guys going to do? Use your powers if Executive is corrupted.
Rand Paul is totally confused.
why didn't you take your run as a libertarian?  We'd have a sane choice   #paul #nochoice #2016election #LiarHillaryorLooneyDon
So should Trump's absolute craziness.
Trumps BLATANT theft from the working class should DQ him as well... @realDonaldTrump
You are correct, sir, but Democrats don’t care.
@pmuldoon21 @HillaryClinton Ouch
And this guy got what, six delegates?
Thanks for speaking out.
Rand Paul you are the only politician out there that would make Thomas Jefferson proud. AUDIT THE FED
. Yes it should!
big fan, but putting party before conscience is not cool.

@itsJustBClark @HillaryClinton RIP HRC Campaign

Her dereliction of duty is just One of the Many reasons she should be disqualified from holding Any office
thankfully, you Sir, will never be President.
Rand is so truthful just like our Trump.
then you would be left with the Derelict, we need all 3 godless democrats to make it look like we have a "Choice"
Absolutely Correct. Above the law Hillarious Rotten Clitnon..

Even the deplorable ones? only cares about self. I did like her in the wizard of oz.
