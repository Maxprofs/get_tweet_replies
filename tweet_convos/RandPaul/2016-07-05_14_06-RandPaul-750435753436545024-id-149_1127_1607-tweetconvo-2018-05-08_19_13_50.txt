I'm in UK and this has reached us now! Keep up the good work. Good to see some ppl still care about us "folks".
And he's back…and then it happens…zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
The only reason you were objecting was due to drone surveillance program questions..not the man. Typical politician spin now.
thank you
Very sad that our laws don't apply to the political elite! How will Americans ever trust our Government again?? @lightlady
Dr. Don't you think at this late in election cycle & Tarmac meeting he was left with no choice. Had to lay his case out in public?
as always, Rand is on point. So wish you were the nominee
@alllibertynews 
Auto correct turns COMEY into COMEDY every time.
GOOD IDEA RANDY - FIRST THINK YOU'VE SAID THAT MADE SENSE
@SurvivorMed Now that was smooth, have to hand it to you. Seems you may be the "dark horse" for Trump's VP. Care to comment?
@aduanebrown wonder what rand knew???
are there any other descendants of our founding fathers if so please tweet me
so your dissent at the time had nothing to do with the man himself but now you're taking a victory lap? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Watch his record. He did state his reasons for casting a no vote. Comey should never been made director w/ his views
is there any hope for this country? Its crystal clear the @FBI Is as corrupt as any institute. #Comey clearly has no integrity.
@FAMDOC7 *mic drops*
@ckchumley So you are saying we are correct by chosing @realDonaldTrump over Duped @SenTedCruz and @senmarcorubio !
@MZHemingway
BRIBE IS RIGHT...OK SO ITS FAR FETCHED. OR IS IT. HILL AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT DONT TRUST THEM
@JerichoRevoPlan I will give him that.
@RadicalRW @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump
I'm just gonna leave this right here. http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/29/sen-rand-paul-is-lone-dissenter-as-james-comey-con/ …
What was your reason?
@WashTimes
@WashTimes reeeeheeelly
Comey should be impeached.  An independent prosecutor should be assigned.
@rahulvarshney what did you see that others didn't?
You are a legend
@WashTimes your record of principled, thoughtful and consistent service is why I remain a huge supporter of yours
@baileyjer well yeah, but not because you objected to the appointment. Simple blackmail for drone info.
@WashTimes please run in 2020 someone has to put a stop to the Clintons
You mean you didn't buy the boy scout act?
@crookedhillary Who is going to hold her accountale?
wise man you are!Never have thought highly of him and Orlando was a disaster and they dropped the ball so many times.
@lesstaxingcpa Good call Sen. Paul!
U were right @RandPaul Now u need a spine of steel to fight :) #MAGA
@WashTimes thank you Rand for doing what no one else would, stand up to tyranny! #standwithrand!
has been vindicated today @derekahunter @WashTimes
@WashTimes you were Right..like @realDonaldTrump is Right a LOT. Set aside pettiness & be the VP!
#DemandRand #Unsuspend
#StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
isn't it though 
It pays to be a Clinton!
you make don Quixote look like a guy who could really get stuff done.

@TexasJew What are you prepared to do?
@WashTimes #StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
@mkibbe the John Roberts of the FBI? "Incentives matter" economics 101 of what I learned from U of Chicago Nobels
Oh what a hero you are.  Don't think your objection was anything to do with the man himself, just something to do with drones.
@survivecollapse At least someone had it right.  Too bad lawmakers cannot make him do his job.  #tcot
@RealBillyGrant This guy did EXACT same as Hillary-but much smaller scale. Comey prosecuted. https://m.fbi.gov/#https://www.fbi.gov/sacramento/press-releases/2015/folsom-naval-reservist-is-sentenced-after-pleading-guilty-to-unauthorized-removal-and-retention-of-classified-materials …
@WashTimes #standwithrand #stillranding #RandRally #unsuspendRand
You dissented for drone program info, not for his record of impartiality.  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/29/sen-rand-paul-is-lone-dissenter-as-james-comey-con/ …   #ronsajoke
So what? Do you want a fucking cookie or something?
@WashTimes "Dr"??  Yeah, you're a DOCTOR, like Dr. Seuss is a doctor you LOON!
he is a pathetic coward.
@WashTimes.
Well, @RandPaul, when you're right, you're right! 

Right?
you were the one we needed but I guess we got what we deserved
@WashTimes  Im sure you are disappointed to have been right as rain. What have we become?
U voted against him b/c of the Drone Program, not because he seemed like he wouldn't prosecute felons who undermine natl security.
.@RandPaul kudos to you, sir.
STOP HILLARY --

STOP wells fargo --

STOP joe heck --
.@RandPaul if only you would stand as strongly against Trump, who wants to "open up" libel laws.
Comey is buddies with Justice Roberts, they think alike
@WashTimes Thank you Dr Paul. Knowing you have The People's back speaks Volumes. Your colleagues have forgotten who they work for.
@RandPaul
You can criticize the old-school Catholics. But at least they make sure that their Popes have testicles.
Back in the race right now Senator Paul.Let's see what the politician and media will react.You got my vote!!.It's about time.
Please team up with @realDonaldTrump and stop this Washington wool-pulling over the eyes of the American people! Unite Now Damnit!
This Government is so corrupt that the only thing that can straighten it out is a repeat of 1776. #hillaryclinton #fbiwithher
hahaha
Comeys a disgrace. 
18 U.S. Code § 1924(a) alone should have brought charges.
@WashTimes This proved your judgement correctly. You are a beacon of light in a corrupt political system
@LynnKuennen Hopefully it wasn't political theater because we've over pretend outrage with no consequences.
Poor Randy, trying so hard to appear relevant. All this whining indicates you need a nap. You big baby.
Surely your not implying some form of impropriety senator...
Just like the American people and especially Kentuckians left the box next to ur name UNCHECKED! #ImWithHer & so is United States.
Not so
@JoyR16
Your smug language is meant to imply you objected to Comey, when in fact you were just making a point re drones. Slimy, bro.
Is your dad a time traveller? Did you inherit his "Things to Prevent" list?
you need to be VP
@WashTimes something his father did on many occasions when a yes vote was the wrong vote.
@WashTimes Didn't know he could change the law.
you only vetoed about the drone issue. Don't start being like @realDonaldTrump and claiming fake victories.
@WashTimes
Love how you break it down ..I agree it's a lowdown dirty shame that we have no accountability in Washington.
Dude, you rock!
keep doing your thing rand
Sen Rand Paul voted against COMEYs nomination didnt agree with unwarranted FBI use of drones. CFilibuster https://reason.com/tags/rand-paul/940 …
statements like these from you are the reason I am seriously considering Jim Gray in Nov. Your conduct & votes matter. 2/2
Please seek VP nom from Trump.  Then I might actually be able to stomach voting for him.
Please don't allow the #clintonmachine to become even more powerful. This is ridiculous!
@derekahunter You called it, Rand!
you keep doing you, sir!
If this Government's history keeps repeating itself, we're doomed. Would love to see you as @realDonaldTrump 's VP!
your dissent was with drones, not Comey. Stop misleading these people & trying to make them think you did more. 1/2
@WashTimes President Paul 2020!
Obama appointed him as a favor to Hillary after he received nomination in 2008 so she could run above the law
@WashTimes When prevention fails, there is only cure. #impeach
#riggedsystem
I don't think he tried them shoes on... He  must be wearing the the shoes Hillary bought him today.
@WashTimes #TrumpPaul2016 PLEASE!!! @realDonaldTrump  @RandPaul
The American people could not be more discouraged than this moment multiple levels of corruption were exposed.
can we clone you and populate the government?
Very tragic that you were the ONLY one who got it right. Too bad everyone did not see this disaster coming.
I'm so disgusted right now, I might actually vote for Trump.
and we would welcome your vote 
If Hillary is elected, we will suffer blackmailing from the nations that got her leaked national security emails! #StillRanding 
wish we could clone you. 
Thank you for doing your job.
I'm just gonna leave this right here. http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/29/sen-rand-paul-is-lone-dissenter-as-james-comey-con/ …
Lack of stopping Obama nominees really coming back to bite the spineless GOP leadership.
Dude, you don't even have enough integrity to comb your hair like an adult.
@LumpyNewsCom The whole BHO admin is corrupt.  As will the HRC admin.  Sad.  Rough period for the US continues for years.
Yeah, the Trump administration would be a bastion of decency and competence. Said no on ever.
@WashTimes. Good call he is another dishonest non public servant.
Love it @RandPaul. "93-1 vote — Mr. Paul was the lone “no” vote." You are the voice of the people.
You sure called this one right! 
did you see something we didn't?
please prepare Impeachment case for @HillaryClinton now
they didn't even impeach Obama. Give me a break
Difference; FBI already laid out case, just couldn't pull trigger
I have no faith in the GOP cept Paul, Lee, Cruz maybe 2 more
false choice.  Besides, 3 parties in the race on all 50 states
#LibertyRepublican base needs to grow, need more ppl that will take a stand. What happened today is an atrocity to Rule of Law.
we are all so impressed
THANK YOU, SIR!!
@WashTimes
Hillary lied under oath said NEVER sent/received classified emails, except 100++++ so WHAT is SENATE going to DO???????????//
Haul his ass up to the Hill and demand answers!
Wow!
says the dude with 17 followers
I just left this on my fb wall with the same line. Oye
