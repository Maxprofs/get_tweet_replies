You don't  believe in enforcing laws, as does Obama?
He sure did @realDonaldTrump
@BKcolin HRC has convenient amnesia about her husbands policies. Does HRC think voters are STUPID?
Most of them are! Especially the refugees they're rushing to registered to vote.
a true man of dignity and  class always hard at work , never misses a vote  in the senate! Thank you for being you!
Dems created most of the Entitlement programs which destroyed "Traditional" Family Lives/Values!
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton  Oh yeah. Free stuff, money, & the continuation of the racist/victim mentality. That's why.
Senator, if you go fishing in Alaska and catch the wrong fish, protected species, it's a federal felony? Not Right
Please provide your record on protecting the rights of African Americans.

And Trump will double down on that, Senator. Law and Order. I wanted to vote for you. Do the right thing.
.@DannDeMaina So what you're saying is you don't believe in law and order? @RandPaul @HillaryClinton
Sen. Paul is saying that those "Law and Order" bills that put a generation of men in prison are bad policy. I agree.
He has proposed a number of new laws and policies; from expanded stop and frisk to a ban on Muslims.
I thought it was Muslims from any terror-related countries? Regardless, the point stands.
@BKcolin can we talk about what she will do? Or should we also hold @realDonaldTrump to task for his wife's record
@murmiles @bi_politics rhen please throw your support in with @GovGaryJohnson and get real CJ reform!
lets not let facts get in the way, remember he did not have sex with that women
@bi_politics good point. However, the drug war is squarely a bipartisan human catastrophe.
What law is it that keeps that Ferret glued to your head?
Why didn't House & Senate STOP Obama's giving away OUR INTERNET! Guess we have to totally clean hous in NOVEMBER!
@bi_politics  we love you Ron Paul and Trump will need you to get things past you and him will get along very well you both great!
@bi_politics She's ok with "Super Predators" when it's time to vote. Don't be fooled by this con artist!
@o4america @HillaryClinton @BKcolin
Assuming that's true, you're saying she is responsible for his actions? Really? Sexist much? @RandPaul @HillaryClinton @bi_politics
She's the one who called blacks "super predators". Dolt.
Ahh . . I think it may be you that is lost, John.
how so
Paul isn't exactly a Trump fan.
okay then i misread that if this is the case, but as for Trump he is not fit to be president
Well Thought trump was in too lose to Hill from the beginning So not as much a trump supporter as I am Anti-Hillary! She's worse!
well me i would prefer HRC she show me she is human and had made some mistakes but accepted responsibility w/ what happen
I know too much about Hillary to ever support Her. She is like a Crime boss, but with way more power.
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton @bi_politics WOOHOO BAM you go Rand
@alllibertynews Finally it's being put out there! I don't understand how the Black community can vote 4 Hillary & democrat party!
Not to mention NAFTA! Another Dem disaster!
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton let it go
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton @bi_politics I agree, but you forgot to add your Party.
@bi_politics And a Republican Congress liar
@brianleary @HillaryClinton @bi_politics blacks have never really been told this kind of truth.
@BKcolin OTOH, violent crime did plummet. Seriously.
@bi_politics 

Her Party pushed welfare programs that kicked fathers out of the black family unit.
@Trump5254 @HillaryClinton @bi_politics "Mass incarceration is an invented concept
This is so interesting. Here is the PDF file. https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Solutions_American_Leaders_Speak_Out.pdf …
.@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton @bi_politics 

Oh, so we shouldn't pass laws?  Did her husband make them break those laws?

@bi_politics DEA classified Marijuana so that the FDA can't test it. DEA directly profits from MJ being illegal.
@bi_politics If you want to help Blacks, decriminalize MJ and stop Civil Asset Forfeiture. Shut down the DEA.
@bi_politics Civil Asset Forfeiture violates Civil Rights and robs the powerless. AG Lynch and Hillary love it.
Pretty sure Rand wasnt siding with Trump on this issue. Trump wants more of  this "Law and Order" ..
"Law and Order" translates to more brown and black in over flowing/crowded prisons.. and build more of them
Are we talking about the , "Super Predators", that need to be taught to, "Heel"?
.@RandPaul @NewParisite @HillaryClinton Only Clinton benefit from PIC is it?
When they try to individualised systemic brutality against their black countrymen.....
Hillary will change tune but will continue to do same old thing. These are just her campaign tunes.
#Hillary had coughing fit on the plane. Pneumonia again? Off IV too soon? cc: @randpaul @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @ScottAdamsSays
My president! I wish he was the one on last night!
Who wants to go to Europe? #refugees #tourism
@Portosj81J -Tnx for that. She raised the subject. Trump should have mentioned Bills' draconian drug laws
@BKcolin @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity clintons hand in jailing blacks
He also started the beginning of the mortgage subprime bubble.
No. personal choice, poverty, and multi- generation institutional racism did that.
@JahMekAWail that's so sad that none of them probably committed a crime.
@USAHipster @HillaryClinton @bi_politics @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
@bi_politics this is so sad. And true.
@bi_politics 
Dr.Paul, is there a link on your reform plan specifically for #3StrikeRule reform?  I'm interested.
rand who passed the law that bill Clinton signed?
@bi_politics @TeamTrump 
Thank you Rand Paul way to go, now we are coming together as a party... LET'S! GO!!
@Connectionary @HillaryClinton @bi_politics someone should tell HRC that coattails cut both ways.
Excuse me, ppl. but put their selves in prison.
@bi_politics you know u were my preference for Trump's VP..along with Cain..well said
@Mommamia13My @HillaryClinton @bi_politics Exactly! That's what I was tweeting and yelling at the TV!
•ME TOO!
Uhh yea if they brake the law
@Carolde @HillaryClinton @bi_politics that's true
@bi_politics 
The only guy who knows what he's talking about, and America was too blind to see the greatness
Thank You Senator Paul. Thank you for stepping up and being a man and keeping your word unlike @JebBush
@bi_politics  your awsome
@bi_politics Don't forget the CRA, which caused the housing bubble...
endorse Gary Johnson, you know he's the right choice
Rand Paul did not graduate from college.  He forgot that there was a GOP congress.
@bi_politics They will remember this in November.
@mattlockeshow
@TheGMShow @HillaryClinton @bi_politics Yes he did!
@bi_politics Thankyou Dr Paul for exposing the democrat plantation.
@bi_politics Hillary worked hard to promote the Violent Crime Act. https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/times-change-heres-hillary-clinton-in-1994-talking-up-tough?utm_term=.xnLkwj6D7#.ooOz58gRl …
@bi_politics true and she supported it.  Too bad that wasn't brought up tonight.
@EvaLB5 @HillaryClinton @BKcolin Trump blew that issue by not pushing it.
reps pass the bills crazy
AND, WHEN SHE IS ELECTED, SHE WILL LET THEM ALL OUT!  YOU CAN BANK ON THAT!
@pink_lady56 @HillaryClinton Of coarse the fact that Bill Clinton put laws in place that put more blacks in jail was not discussed
how tall are you Ayn?
@justalkwtraci @HillaryClinton @bi_politics 
Doh!
I'm pretty sure Hillary's the one running, not Bill...
And didn't she say she recognizes now & needs to be reformed?
I'm sorry but she is not her husband
https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/times-change-heres-hillary-clinton-in-1994-talking-up-tough?utm_term=.xnLkwj6D7#.ooOz58gRl …
@BKcolin  HillaryClinton for President... Trump is delusional & catastrophe
@pink_lady56 @HillaryClinton @bi_politics yep.
sounds like that's right up your alley #debatenight #pickingsrslim2016
@VerbalJouster88 
A woman is not her husband. We have brains of our own. You're a doctor. You should know this.
@Trudymarlenew @HillaryClinton @bi_politics right. Because youve passed laws that helped afr-amr. Good try tho
@mattberg11 @HillaryClinton @bi_politics Hillary isn't billy. Move on
Donald Trump is not the answer.
@bi_politics Just because she is a wife doesn't mean her husband dictates her opinions. It is not 1950.
dude, the other guy called you ugly in a debate and you support him?
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton @bi_politics To be fair, it all started with Nixon. Clinton was the hammer, Nixon was the nail.
, @HillaryClinton is her own person and leader, but it's thousands of leaders that are responsible for injustice #Debates2016
@bi_politics @AnahiHansen You have to look beyond what is in front of you... Do the research.
She Is not her husband, evaluate her on her own terms. It's disrespectful to do otherwise #debatenight
@bi_politics she armed ISIS http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/wikileaks-confirms-hillary-sold-weapons-isis-drops-another-bombshell-breaking-news/ …
didn't realize Bill started the war on drugs. Can we get some specifics on ur claim?
and your party resists criminal justice reform
Didn't know she married Reagan
@Lee0456lee @HillaryClinton @bi_politics THANK YOU RAND! Now, why did #Trump not hit her w this in #debates??
Hey kook, go plagiarize another article for your made-up "doctor" status.
Of course, and he'd do worse if he was there. He was never against expanding punishment.
ought to be you up there not this gasbag.
@newsmax @HillaryClinton @bi_politics so did all the past republican presidents.
@newsmax @HillaryClinton @bi_politics 3 Strikes?
@bi_politics even Lester agreed with stop and frisk in 2013.
so, she's her husband?
@bi_politics there it is!!!
@bi_politics she was all over screaming super predator
@bi_politics #debatenight
@TrumpFL @HillaryClinton @bi_politics great going Rand Paul BillClinton did that to black smericans
@BKcolin Rand Slam
@bi_politics Hillarys super predators?
.@RandPaul @HillaryClinton True but Trump sounds like an idiot on this issue.
@bi_politics who is running for president? White male bias!
@bi_politics holy crap, Rand! Hillary stole your idea for criminal justice reform
#debatenight  Criminal Justice Reform is complex.  Pendulum swings over decades. Stuck in the rut of retributive
But she is NOT him, Rand! Compared to Trump, Hillary's crim just platform aligns a lot more with yours.
@bi_politics @GOP Your Party created privatized prisons for profits to lock up People Of Color, @RandPaul
@bi_politics , Amen!!!!
@BKcolin your party (republicans)won't let us take your guns that kill people!
Oh. You're politicking. Not fact checking. I should have known. Failing at this just like running for president.
I wish you'd have spent time coaching Trump on the subject of the justice system.
Truth! The Clintons had their two strikes. Putting the country at risk via email was the last strike.
you do know her husband is a different person than her -- or are women to be judged by their husbands?
she didnt think she's need their vote. that wall st and foriegn govs paying for her campaign wouldn't be enough.
Do you realize that @HillaryClinton and @billclinton are different people...? #debatenight
Well, Mr. Paul, having a Republican-controlled Congress hasn't helped our country at all, thank you very much!!
@bi_politics yes and he corrected and apologized you should know about making mistake and forgiveness
yea? Well look atother choice "Bad People" Stop and Frisk Seriously? He has real estate in the Carolinas which is why he is upset
@bi_politics. Folks in those communities asked for help !  What would You have done to help?
@bi_politics True Rand and I find you ok but Bill isn't running my friend. #NeverHillary #NeverTrump
likely at her request
@bi_politics and the ones that were not jailed were given enough welfare to keep them in the slums.
@bi_politics I WISH you were in this race....
Look at you Randy, a lot of material right there!
@bi_politics - like he gave a fuck + the Republicans supported those policy.
@bi_politics shut up Rand. You lost.
That does not affect his ability to tell the truth.
you need to shut up and go back in your cave idiot! Go find your integrity somewhere! @HillaryClinton @BKcolin
be quiet.... you looser
shame on you. Sell out
@bi_politics so true
Truth
@bi_politics wish you won...
I wonder how many times Hillary has laughed when a rapist has gotten off
this I agree with
, and put more than 100,000 officers on the street.  @CALEA_org
