@oreillyfactor

@oreillyfactor
Good Luck Getting Her In There!
@cej5001 Thanks for speaking out!!
rand go to work
@USAneedsTRUMP @RandPaul @oreillyfactor Let's see how far he is willing to go in indicting her. Sorry, I have lost all hope.
@USAneedsTRUMP @RandPaul @oreillyfactor  Rand Paul along with the other conservatives elites are helping to bring Trump down
looks like he hasn't got enough sleep.
Who in the Hell are you
EXACTLY
naw-she was deliberate help Saudis & China donations-go figure HRC does-every dime in to her
most politicians should be in jail in reality
#HillaryClinton believes she is #QUEEN
He is one very smart men too.
Agree
I totally agree w/Rand Paul on this one!
#StandWithRand
We need you Rand!
@DebAlwaystrump @RandPaul @oreillyfactor way to go Rand Paul
@veganvecoh @RandPaul @oreillyfactor
LOCK HER UP!!!!
I support Rand Paul.
That, and (imo) the main motive; concealing clandestine Clintonionism activities.
#IndictHillary #HillaryGuilty #HillaryTreason #HillaryEvil #HillaryForPrison
all her money should be confiscated
Her @HillaryClinton  bad judgement has and is killing people.
men Presidents have been lying to America for years now because Hillary is a woman she can't lie get a lif
rand Paul almost 7 thousand soldiers died in Iraq because bush abused his power as President
for what explain what about Edward snowden and Christie, George Bush administration
CROOKED CLINTON'S OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE GUILTY AS HELL! LOCK THE WITCH UP!  @oreillyfactor
will she won't be people will never move on from this may God help them
and we the people of the United States are merely a doormat for the clintons
Great inter iew yesterday Senator...you really speak the truth
roast
jail or white house we will continuously have to pay for criminals to stay
@FoxNewsInsider AGREED!!!
Teflon Hillary
But you support her by not supporting the T Man.
Didn't Trump talk about this man's face?  Suck up to Trump after calling ugly.
Is this that Aqua Buddha dude?
A lot of people at FOX should be in jail...starting with Roger Ailes
@Callisto1947 @RandPaul @oreillyfactor OK!
.@FoxNews @RandPaul @oreillyfactor Worse than "convenience". Clearly to prevent the US citizens from ever seeing things. #ClintonFoundation
Lock her up
she was trying to avoid FOIA. Basically illegal anyway you slice it
#Hillary had a private server so she could bank on all of those documents for her future memoirs.
Some of her lawyers and advisors should share the same cell block as Hillary.
Some of these crooks go back to Arkansas & Whitewater investigation.
Oh, Oh, BS
@FoxNews @RandPaul @oreillyfactor
@FoxNews @RandPaul @oreillyfactor
how about Trump's Tax Returns , paid no taxes
I thank RAND, for being one of the only SITTING republicans who is calling Clinton out for criminal acts!
@FoxNews @RandPaul @oreillyfactor
I guess you needed to jump on the wagon but can't talk real issues for America
Those who ignored what they hear and see about the real Hillary needs to see a priest or a brain surgeon
I want to know why a name was redacted from recent UNCLASSIFIED emails, who it was and if he got a job.
uranium one follow the $$$$
OBAMA DOESN'T LIKE BEING CALLED FOUNDER OF ISIS. WHAT ABOUT ASSHOLE
Rand this is dangerous and you know it. This is not the way forward for our party.
Good luck with that!!
Afraid to pick on Trump like you were in the election? You now have a first row seat to an ass whipping!
now rand paul trying  to dnake his way intonthe wh on the back the donald and his screw ups
"she behaved stupidly" is not standard for a crime
that is so TRUE, why US people are ignorant and polls show great support for Hillary.
Interesting. Paul must have evidence that no prosecutor or R congressional committee has had
You're right Rand, but she'll never receive punitive action. And 50% of US will still vote 4 her SICKENING
Lets go Rand! Speak up!
This had nothing to do with convenience. It's about hiding corruption.
YOUR COMMENTS DONT COUNT RAND BECAUSE YOUR A NOBODY, A NOTHING..CRAWL BACK IN YOUR HOLE.
but the little * next to her name means shes not responsible for anything, & that she's above the law.
you are nothing but a straight up redneck. And yes i said it.
Indeed, Hillary should be in jail as well as disqualified from being the POTUS.
but, she still lied to congress on the record and on live tv.  Where's the warrant for her arrest?
@LindaSuhler @RandPaul @oreillyfactor It's always been "me first" mentality with the Clintons. No responsibility for their actions.
that is so true, she is only for her self.  VOTE TRUMP
HELLary always puts herself, AND ONLY HERSELF, FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!
Indeed, for all the lies she has told
Yes!!!!
you and FoxNews need to be investigated just like that perverted CEO y'all call a boss .
The GOP thought Rand, Rubio or Crus will be president. You lost badly to Trump so give Hillary a break!
Not charged, not tried, not convicted but should be in prison. Rand, what planet do you live on? #Idiot
so true
WRONG as per usual: Comey said, “Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.”
Rand Paul is now a has been. No one cares what he spouts.
reading the tweets on the fox site are like watching Saturday Night Live skits.
why are you not reporting on the emails that caused a murder by Clinton and how she opened us up to terror she buying u also?
nonsense
Really don't care what he has to say. Hope he loses next time he's up for re-election
Rand your a perfect replacement to Ailes, self righteous peddlers of sleazy.
I have been saying that forever. She is a demagogue interested in herself and bank account only!
Except it wasn't for convenience in the manner it was presented.
Thank you Senator Paul for standing up for truth and the law.  Not many in Congress do it.
there's definitely conflict of interest violations and theft of service crimes committed by Huma Abedin
So True.
I'm  glad  other  people  feel  the  same  way  about  Hillary!
I agree with Rand Paul on this one! She is more important, she will never change. It's all about her.
Unfortunately...Paul has absolutely ZERO say in the matter...#PatheticWitchHunt
And she stays on the run in PLAIN site? World's easiest to find fugitive!!
The GOP Presidential candidate and menstruation expert Donald Trump should b shown the door back to Russia
agreed
she bought the Attorney General on an airplane with Moslem blood money from the foundation. Who will stop?
ty for continuing to report this as a crime
@RandPaul absolutely correct 
@oreillyfactor go get her
couldn't agree more
Indict! Nation Wide Class Action Law Suit?
#sotrue #hillaryforjail She lies every second of everyday. #TrumpPence16
this stinking congress won't do their job, and we know obamas administration WON'T!!
WHEN U GOT SPKER OF THE HOUSE  SAYING HUMMM SOME THING SHOILD BE  LOOK  AT
Don't you realize the Clintons are above the law? Also, why are the 4 DNC murders/deaths not publicized?
agree,to bad this government had no spine
put her in prison your self since you want her to be in prison. Rubbish
@FoxNews @RandPaul @oreillyfactor
Are you serious? The biggest e-mail exaggeration that is ever made.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @oreillyfactor
whatever you expect to come from " god of water "
but Hillary greedy crooked selfish supporters r reckless
no shit she should be in prison. Loretta Lynch belongs there too for not prosecuting her.
Wow your about ayear behind the News. As Hillary would say that's old news. I'll move on and make more
YES TRUE THE HOUSE   RYAN SAY THE SOME THING SIR  WHAT U SAY      CLINTON SHOULD BE IN   PRISON  WHEN
With Clinton mentality why don't we eliminate all the cybersecurity we have implemented across Gov?
you know it is easy to criticize when you have not been in the same position.  Not that am supporting her.
please stay on it Mr Rand Paul ! Somebody has to hold her accountable.
thank you for your hard work #RandPaul
Convenience or secrecy?
