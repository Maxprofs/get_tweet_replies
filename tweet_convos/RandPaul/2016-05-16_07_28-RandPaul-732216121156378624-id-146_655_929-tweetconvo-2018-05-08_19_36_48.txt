YEAH, GOOD POINT
EVERY WHERE .........
@Bwdreyer Bill the rapist?
The only Bill is going to fix is his fellow inmates supper.
@RandStudents she hasn't even seen the inside of an international conference on email addresses.
@AmericasPower Coal-related employees need re-training to solar, with government assistance.
@brendanoe60 
Vote for the first woman president so she can have her husband do the work...
*Scratches head
which First Lady ever ran the economy? I understand Hillary may be in prison, but Bill can't be President again.
@BrendanGiesick
@rockynickydog 

I won't vote for either corrupt liar!
@SportsGuyLance One must who really is running for pres.....Bill or Hillary 'cause she keeps putting more responsibility on him.
And after Bill fixed it, which Bush is gonna fix his probs? (I wouldn't vote GOP, btw)
is it too much to ask that we fix the problem instead of demeaning others attempts to help?
@alllibertynews Did she just actually put "Coal Country" and "Inner Cities" in the same sentence as equivalent? #Panderillary
it's pathetic..#makingwomenlookweak
It may. Never under estimate slick willy. He won your state as a Dem...
@marty713 : Who's running Bill or Her.
@TrumpPatriot4 #BillClinton had his chance. He & #Hillary sit down & shut up. #HillaryKillary is never getting back in WH. #Trump
Can't wait till "Bill" gets his third term. Hillary has nothing to do with it.
@alllibertynews So this is a way to get around the 8 year rule?
@Gospel_is_Light what's the point in voting for a woman if the woman is just going to give the job to a man?
CONGRATULATIONS on your primary win in the Kentucky Senate race!!!!! I really wish you had won the POTUS primary. #TCOT #PJNET
@bcnaturelady WTH is the FBI doing? Loretta Lynch should have never been confirmed. But doesn't matter It's Obama protecting her.
@alllibertynews #Predator Bill to oversee her screw ups...like he put #enabler #Hillary in charge of quashing his bimbo eruptions?
flipflop snagging her " coal out of business"  line, into the dark. she hits all the wrong keys N is working damage control
Senator your pitch and rhetoric nationally was a big fat failure.  Rethink it
@marvin_hill123 I work with coal miners all over the country & the rage against the democratic machine is real y'all.
@JewelryMadness Only if he finds female coal miners. #Hillary #BillClinton
Didn't you lose to Donald Trump lol. whether she wins your state or not, she's the Democratic Nominee unlike you who lost to Trump
that comment is irrelevant to the point that Rand is attempting to protect his states best interest.
perhaps the coal workers   Could be trained to do jobs that are being outsourced to other countries
@KYGOP #StandWithRand theman is leadership and knowledge abundance solveit all with Paul Rand Paul vote for Liberty #StandWithRand
. No Hillary and No Bill
@FriendsofCoalKY hahahahaha she's a joke
@Wisdom2Masses She thinks they are dumb
@HomerWhite He gonna fix it with more lies? lol They been lied to for years like many of us in both parties.
It's hilarious that the only person honest about the industry gets hosed for it. Want to serve the people? Get a clue, fuckwad.
@jmurphree47 #Hillary is unpopular everywhere they just don't read the ones who are voting for her check her background crooked
Yes she's Crooked and Evil! #HillaryforPrison
Pres. Trump
You guys have Trump!!! hehehe what a joke!
sounds like desperation to me.
@pikester45 Hard working people all across the country heard her dismissive words towards coal miners & shutting down mines.
You still on about coal? Get real!
Thanks  Senator, I already have water and tissue.
@jarod_russell17 WOW the I am Woman hear me roar candidate has to ask her male, husband to help her? Whuh?
@AlexisinNH Listen to this talk. She was just shy of incoherent. She doesn't seem present, or authentic. Very disjointed.
@dw_dianna Trouble is  it wasn't Bill that fixed the economy but Gingrich n the Republican Congress. Bill was smart enuf 2 sign it
That is like omitting she is incompetent to do the job...
Hasn't #Hillary ever heard of #CoalGasification?
@Billhic02785574 Bill had his four years during the internet boom... he also fixed fannie mae and freddie mac - ALL CLINTONS GTFO!
@GunnetteP H: Just joking abt hating u guys n bankrupting u k plz vote 4 me now promise not to do what I said I was gonna thanks!!
don't trust her.  Bill is not going to fix anything but his pockets. They will be bigger
Every time I listen to her I can tell she is either Lying or telling a bad joke.  Please America I cannot take four years of this.
Bill is too busy having sex with kids on his buddies private plane to fix anything
So she admits that she's incapable of doing it on her own.
so she's going to give jobs to family? Politicians need to go
oh please this liar will say anything to get a vote she is toxic keep pressing on Dr. Paul
she needs to join the justice-involved folks.
this form the guy who allowed a Tiny Hand Vulgarian to beat him. You could not even get 5%. Even you have to bend over for Trump
She can't be nearly as unpopular as that orange-wigged walking freakshow you're supporting. #ImWithHer #HRC
says loser
oh so now Bill's running or just someone to blame? Can't even imagine THAT fiasco! Pathetic - this woman is in trouble
you are unpopular everywhere.  How is you run for prez going.  #loser #ignorance #NeverRand
she sounds like Miley Cyrus
@michaelbeatty3 feminist are going to live this  what a hack
As in legislation; or as in Slick Willie?
If he's as successful with Coal as he was with Women...
Close, but NO CIGAR.
Why don't you head back over to your optometry practice and deny a few more patients some care - elitist wanna be.
#nothisdadatall
@CASEYANNETTE bill's idea of help
Hahaha. The Clinton ship seems to be taking on water; it's starting to sink. Will the anti-Bernie rats start to leave?
@mj_barton Pathetic!
Who this Bill? Is this the face of a robust thinker ready to tackle her work? I think not#HillaryforPrison
@kevincorke Remember seeing bumper sticker in WV when Bill was running which said, "Anybody But Clinton".
wow!!! That's sad. At school you said " I'm going to tell daddy !"
Excuse my vehemence, Bills going to fix coal the same way Hillary fixed Bills rape problems
PS: Bill has no authority as First Husband. Hes just a 'dude' living off the taxpayers
tell it my great senator
@HaydenT_
I cannot believe this person.  She is a joke of leader
#neverhillary Correct @RandPaul, Hillary Clinton places 1 among Dem. candidates last hour hyped on Twitter http://j.mp/usa2016 
i want you to shove a copy of Atlas Shrugged up my ass
@alllibertynews @RandPaul Ouch. It's a thick book
one page at a time
The WOMAN points to the MALE to save her. Ooooops  @Billhic02785574
"Bill will fix it"?????? So, is she running or is she running as his surrogate?
@dblozik WTH?  Isn't she running for President, not Bill?!
she's unpopular in more than just coal country
@Sanjay25_ - she should have "fixed" bill; that's neutered.
Her entire career has been on Bill Clinton's coattails. She memorized everything he told her to
so MR and MRS president? Will @vp Have to answer to Bill? How about #termlimits? I bet #Bill thought he was going to party instead
Clinton=delusion #govtfails
How is @billclinton going to stimulate the economy? He can only give out so much money to so many girlfriends.
you dropped out the Presidential race so that you wouldn't see how unpopular you are in your state.
@HillaryClinton and the @ClintonFdn DONORS demand end of Coal. #LIAR #FRAUD
#StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
Don't worry.  @BernieSanders is going to win.
How is it that this woman has any credibility left?
#StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
@mariannecope @dougstafford @kelseyc00per I proudly voted for Senator Paul in the MT GOP primary today.
Coal miners will not be played for fools! Like all real patriots they know an Asshat when they see and hear one! BYE BYE LIAR! 
#Hitler used his #atheism to invent #libertarianism to conquer! Not mine coal.
that's because coal country doesn't matter. Anyone dumb enough to elect McConnell doesn't deserve our consideration
BJ would be too busy chasing White House interns
How many flip flops did she do in KY? Is she a anti coal environmentalist that is pro coal now?
LOL.  She will honestly say anything to get to become president.
Bill can't fix anything as proven by his presidency
Not to mention, the truth about the Clinton economy: @newtgingrich led House, Internet boom.
The question is what are you going to do Rand? Those coal jobs aren't coming back. Where is your transition plan for these people?
Hillary said some bad things to those people and it cannot be taken back.  She meant what she said and basically screwed herself
You're forgetting that's she's an anti-coal environmentalist that supports the coal industry
Thank You for supporting Trump.
No more #Globalists running America, and you and your colleagues need to pull your collective heads out of your asses.
so you're suggesting people vote for Trump?
Why the fuck would Rand Paul, a fucking libertarian waste his breath supporting a piece of shit like Hillary?
didn't answer my question, does that mean he's suggesting supporting Trump?
No, that means he's suggesting Hillary is dishonest and untrustworthy, how do you get Trump out of this?
welp you gotta vote for one, there is no none of the above option
Who the hell says I have to vote for either of them, Hillary will never get my vote no matter what
He's part of the GOP with libertarian views, he's likely going to push Johnson rhetoric, but *oh noes* "non H-vote"
both her and Bill would be in prison if America really had justice for all.
I like how she went from them all being out of work to "we're going to help with their transition".  Sounds like out of work to me
she's stealing slogans from Jeb?
So she really doesn't have an economic plan except her husband figuring it out?
this is comedy, lol
Her economic plan is to tell people to look the other way
Billary
