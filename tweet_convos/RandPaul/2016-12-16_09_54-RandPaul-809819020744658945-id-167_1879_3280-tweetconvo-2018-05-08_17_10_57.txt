Pls demand Electors vote against DT & Congress choose another Republican, someone normal!
Given that we couldn't get that to happen at GOP convention there's not a prayer now.
I know. I'm grasping and praying
Our best hope is early impeachment for an offense so clearly treason that even Trumpbots are in support.
That is my next hope. So many reasons for it to be feasible.
@alllibertynews @Lynn_Rose1 @RandPaul @mike_pence You would rather have a treasonous murdress?!?
No, I don't care for Sarah Palin either.
When Trump is impeached Pence becomes President & Paul Ryan VP @alllibertynews @RandPaul @mike_pence @Dakini_Maria
what's up with the jeans?
This was at a local office & not in D.C. Congress is recessed for the year.
Still, he's meeting with VPOTUS & in Jeans?  Almost as bad as zuckerburg & his stupid hoodies. Grow up.
You must have a lot of unused energy to be incensed about this meeting between @RandPaul and @mike_pence
Zuck was attending a formal biz meeting; he's a jerk but wore his "regular" attire; nobody cares.
Were you upset that Kayne West wore his sweatshirt to meet with Trump or did you miss that one?
In this case @mike_pence stops in to see @RandPaul at a home office during Christmas break; it's an informal meeting and >>
> they may well be friends... but it really doesn't matter; it's a non issue. Last weekend people were up >>
@Hope012015 @KevinDarryl @puppymnkey Our economy IS on track thanks to a President who stopped its freefall.
Obama created the problem! Go to a grocery store to see his made-up figures.
Non-existant problem????? That's a real-problem.
So based off ur plots looks like we lost lots of jobs
I see too many leave, not enough come to think automation is the only reason.
@FLConserve941 @mike_pence Why did you vote with the Dems today?
Because a repeal of Obamacare would cost 9.7 trillion without a valid replacement.
I believe they should repeal and replace I think this pushes them to get it done
I'm telling you why he voted against it. He said so himself.
And I don't like it You do because you dislike Trump
Fair point. But you asked him a question that he already answered. Also he is MY senator not yours.
I like Rand P He was on my list for President I just think My party needs to stick together
I'd rather we all do what's best for our country regardless of party. I'm an Independant.
Love that waste report and give it back to the #CitizensFirst by increasing their #welfare, not #refugees!
@robcarlson20 @mike_pence 
Go stuff yourself Rand. You are a wacko too.
Rand is probably the most sane senator in our Congress.
If you think that, then you too are certifiable.
what's so bad about Rand?
His budgetary policies, his fringe associations, and his genetics.
if you believe that it's depressing to think what you taught your pupils
what is depressing about the Rand Paul discussion? Who's teaching.
That lady that blocked everyone defending Rand was a teacher. Lord knows how those kids turned out
M. Pence's new name should be Renfield,- Dracula's fly eating assistant.
fuck that, the man is disgusting and is not fit for office
our economy is on track thanks to president Obama. Yes it can always be improved. Y not say that so we can respect u.
Oh in the economy is doing better now because the anticipation of Trump coming aboard
he was handed a strong economy now let us see how he screws it up.
You are crazy if you think Obama started this strong economy right now it was all Trump sorry for that last text screwed up
stop with the name calling.  I don't have conversation with those who don't use facts.
you mean the economy with the Longest period of job growth and the lowest unemployment rate! You will get it on track?
part time jobs at quickie Mart don't count.
Youve sold your soul to the Devil. At some point he'll want to cash in.
those federal positions are unconstitutional: we are being led away from The Bill of Rights Mike Pence Amendment # 10.
Glad to hear it @RandPaul @dawterofliberty @mike_pence
Sen. Paul: Can't you honor your office with something other than faded jeans.
I ship it
@alllibertynews @mike_pence Good luck.
many diverse opinions here, even regarding clothes, but it seems clear that liberals are very bitter and lashing out.

why such violent tendencies when liberals are so lovey dovey?  where's the PCness?

sick shit.
TRUMP FINALLY TAKES UP RESIDENCE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, by Nicholas Wolfson
is that a Neil hauge illustration?
the economy is still going to crash as soon as Trump gets in. Tax cuts will help people try and slide by nxt recession
economy is on a good track, don't screw it up with tax breaks and increase debt.
Excellent!
Watch out Rand. That guy thinks you can reform sexual preferences through brainwash camps.
I'm gonna start rocking the green sport coat with jeans, Rand!
Problem is,coastal"latte-sipping"#Dems who believe #CNN,think the economy IS on track;Try living in the Midwest,voters
I notice that you are always working. Please rest for the new year. news articles always discribe your hard work.
no rest 4 the wicked
@datrumpnation1 @mike_pence Thank you!! Our country is in a really big hole. It's going to take lots of work to recover it.
mike only knows how to take women's rights away, don't bother asking anything else.
My testimony on drug testing needs to be heard in Washington.  Huge economic drag on the economy

@RandPaul @alllibertynews @mike_pence
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @mike_pence Scott, they're speaking to those of us who don't collect a welfare check
@cousinit3 @mike_pence #MAGA!!

@JuanOcampo41 Great honor sir president pence Blessing

wearing Kentucky formal.
Our electors are being harrassed big time. Is there any way yall can get law enforcement escorts on Mon for Electors?
I mean for all states.  Electors should turn over all death threat emails & phone numbers & ppl should be arrested.
@ralphshields313 @mike_pence Rand is a smart man we need to recruit him for something 
@katmancon @mike_pence 
Pence is also guilty of treason. Don't speak with him or General Flynn about anything besides the weather.
@RightWingAngel @mike_pence - We the People are Sick & Tired of Obama's lies. We the the People have made our Choice. #TRUMP
I hope you asked @realDonaldTrump to hire your father! @RonPaul is a man Trump and Pence should be listening to.
Amen!
- AWESOME~ Can't wait to see what you gentlemen have in store for us!
This is Good news, We need more good guys like you Dr.Paul !!
We're all  so glad that congress will have a White House that they can work with! Merry Christmas America!
Liberals almost destroyed this country. I am so glad Trump is at the helm.Look at Merkel and the mess she is in #MAGA
We'll see
Make Trump more liberty minded. Hook him up with the @MisesInstitut
@RandStudents @mike_pence Two great men right there. Will always stand with Rand.
rand paul you were cheated not being allowed on debate stage you have most common sense of all except Carson and Trump
we need to work on getting to gov out of our lives period! No more property taxes no more renting from gov it's BS!
thank you it's about time
If that was really his agenda. But he spends his time on bathrooms, bogus conversion therapy, and letting an AIDS epidemic unfold.
@SenatorSessions @SenJoniErnst @Cernovich @KellyannePolls @OANN 

KILL THIS AND KILL IT NOW
Glad to hear you two put heads together. We did need a tough guy start, but there needs exfiltrat'n strategy in 2-4 yr
would be wonderful to dump trump and work with Pence
@mikecrooks @mike_pence It's Ryans GOP agenda and platform. Trump won't have much say it sounds like
How about you convince him and Jeff Sessions to respect states rights, quit growing the fed DEA, it's a fallacy.
Rand is a upstanding senator willing to work together to get things done!Wish for the best Rand
Back on track?? 4.6% unemployment with jobs unfilled cause no applicants. Record S&P. Deficit reduced by $1 trill.
Read "Draining the Swamp" Dr. Harvey Barnard. Read his bill for economic reform and stabilization.
Frothy and Frothier...
35 days to Inauguration! Campaign look-back: Grateful 4 @RandPaul's spirited DJT outreach to fellow libertarians @mike_pence
Hopefully, you didn't shill for #GOP too much, but laid out #libertarian ideals
@COSProject 
#LGBT 
Nix fiat currency
the skype infiltration of the govt makes it worse than it could b we need #pogrom
@BarbMuenchen @mike_pence 
I like Rand Paul, he's a great guy! He has heart! 
. I like Rand too, good guy !
excellent! Good riddance
Love the casual Fri. look. 
two fine Soldiers !
sure wish @randpaul could have been sec of state!!
Stand with Rand. RAND2020!
if you want to get the economy back on track just look at California.
@veganvecoh @mike_pence put rand in charge of the federal Reserve he will be great
get government out of Americans lives return power to states
you should be more like your father, he constantly denounced the Zio mafia that control th US foreign policy
we need Ron Paul on the Federal Reserve
#StandWithRand
are you all on the Kremlin payroll?
Yea. Does that mean you and your girl friends gonna quit whining about Trumps picks and get down to work?
indeed
Glad to see that, but I hope Pence is TRULY free market. Not too sure about him.
yeah, this where we find out the real allies from the phony RINOs!
Please Dr Paul be an advocate, not an adversary @NewtTrump
Well he has certainly changed his tune... And THAT's a good thing... for him. And for the USA. Thank you RP & MAGA.
Say MAGA, Rand, you know you want to! :)
@ChristiChat @mike_pence what's the new look now jacket with a turtleneck shirt
ew

You plan to return the economy to the heady days at the end of the Bush administration?
wear a suit Rand! I agree with your political views but you look like you're a cowboy on date night!
: Rand I like you. But you recommended Iran-helping Corker and bashed Bolton for SofS. This is bizarre thinking.
@EricJWest @mike_pence 'GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY.' Now there's a phrase to behold!!!
good luck with that!
: Thank you Rand Paul for blocking NASA supercomputer hacking system that Hillary would have used against Trump/Pence
In most instances I appreciate the voice of @RandPaul but he'll never have huge support. @ChristiChat @mike_pence
Big fan of your work, Senator, but like wasteful govt spending, the turtleneck/blazer outfit should also be eliminated
rand Paul head of the V A sounds good right
Best of luck.
Suggestion: keep Trump busy talking to Kanye while you achieve your goals.
Butcha ARE the Government.  Ya Are!
I think libertarians will be pleasantly suprised with Trumps motivation.
@aduanebrown @mike_pence 
Let's keep them on the correct path to true freedom and liberty! #DrainTheSwamp NOT #RefillTheSwamp !
I sincerely hope you run again in the future. You were my first choice, Rand 
hope you punched him for me
I respect you, sir, but there are more pressing issues...right now
Make the economy better for whom? Stock mkt is doing fine, it's regular ppl who need help. Most folks don't own stock.
I am so glad rand, We are getting Good men who will be doing good things for this Country and out of BHO Hillary wars
so now you will vote for Bolton??? lol
what I wouldn't give to be a fly on the wall.
if you stop pretending Obama was catastrophic I might take you more seriously. It's kinda like crying wolf.
We need your dad, Ron, running the Federal Reserve to shut it down in a responsible way.
@JenniferJJacobs @mike_pence So sorry none of u can read or u would know that's ignorant statement.  Which is kinder than lie.
Two good men.
why didn't you put on a suit man? Are you being disrespectful to the VP?
seriously, look forwards being thrown out of politics,you are the enemy of the people
The economy is pretty strong. You guys will ruin it. Millionaires will rejoice. The end.
you really dont understand how wealth is created. Heres a hint, Not government programs
Trickle on down! 
Can you please explain how our economy is off track using numbers relative to another rel. data point
too much to fit in one tweet post.
I suppose it depends who he is talking to. Who is it off track for?
there is a reason the fed has been afraid to raise rates for years.
Who do you think low interest rates benefit, and what about the raise?
Excellent, we need both of you guys in these strange times, we need to unite and make changes needed..Strong again.
Hope he heard you...
@JenniferJJacobs @mike_pence "Back on track."  Lol liar
the economy has done really well since we got away from conservative policy
I guess u haven't been payed off lately. Job market sucks
it's better than it was in 2009
can't see that. No improvement
Rand Paul = 5-*****
Thank you all we need all the help we can get.  Please get rid of Obamocare, I can't afford it. Hurry
What state and your annual salary?  I can help.
please we need big help
Glad you have an open mind. I think you and Trump can find a lot of common ground.
dig that Friday casual attire!
Because Pence will be doing most of the work anyway, right? #probablyagoodthing
you clearly don't know that @RandPaul is the hardest working man in the Senate @mike_pence
Paul wasn't the person I had in mind when I mentioned Pence. #DJT
ahhh well now it makes more sense..
Love the dress-casual look. It works for you, and sends a great message. Relaxed and in-control.
REMEMBER THEM?? :(
You're so fashionable Dr. Paul.  Love the blazer and jeans combo.  #CasualFriday
Back on track? Do you not see the stock market???
That's one step. The next could be our Constitutional rights.
glad you won senate Rand!  you're a great guy
#ALEPPO <3  :(
Unfortunately, people were appointed to head departments that shouldn't exist.
did you guys talk about a government so small you can fit it in the bedrooms of each US citizen?
if you're referring to mass-surveillance Rand is opposed to that.
no they are referring to how Pence wants to control our sex lives and outlaw homosexuals
I don't think he will get very far with that in spite of a republican senate/congress.

please discuss big pharma monopoly. It's an abuse. We need drug importation.
