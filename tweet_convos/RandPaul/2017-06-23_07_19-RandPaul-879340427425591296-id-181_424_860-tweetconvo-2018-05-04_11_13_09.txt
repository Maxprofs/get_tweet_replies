Hospitals & all Medical centers should have 2 post there chgs. on line. Let patients shop 4 best price & ins. must go with what u choose!
If we actually opened healthcare insurance market the way car insurance was sold all the prices would be driven down dramatically
Difference is ppl are legally required to have car insurance so good drivers subsidize bad ones. Poeple don't value healthcare the same way.
That is not even logical, Dr. please get off your high horse and vote party line! Otherwise switch parties.
You're for a partial repeal then? Not a complete repeal of the ACA?
Make it into separate bills if you have to but it has to happen and soon.
I'd hope so but that seems a bit too optimistic. If that were the case I'm sure Rand wouldn't have any problem with the bill.

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
Why are you opposing repealing Obamacare? We need this done now.
you say this needs to be done now. ok then. what do you think will happen to your HC coverage following a repeal of the ACA?
I can try to get on board with this if you can guarantee people would have real coverage & not artificial and cover prenatal no matter what
Because little babies and children shouldn't have to suffer and die because parents can't afford insurance or weren't insured in time
Before Obamacare a woman had to be on special maternity health insurance before conceiving. Sometimes pregnancies aren't planned.
Not sure about that in New Jersey. UnFfortable for most unless your eligible for Medicaid where the fraud & abuse is rampant
Can you name 1 Country where the free market works for healthcare overage for all? I didn't think so... don't be delusional.
My grandpas bladder infection isn't a car. It's to late for free market Econ. Er visits can't be shopped. I like the idea just not on HC.

#SinglePayer payroll taxes in Germany

15% individual
15% employer…
Rand Paul on right track!@SenDeanHeller not raising Medicaid as high as the Dems want it; is not a cut. No funds 2 Planned Parenthood
@senrobportman #StandWithRand #FreeMarketHealthcare!
Here is my take:  Rule Of Law means NO ONE IS EXEMPT so make ACA all inclusive without exemptions and watch how fast it gets doomed.
@POTUS #WeThePeople do no want a government run healthcare system. We voted 4 #FullRepeal #FreeMarket healthcare. #GovernmentGetOutOfTheWay
Another huge problem blocking inovation in techhealth industry,is NOT releasing specific disease data so that AI and algorythms actuallywork
@DeniseTheFish1 @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee you mean to tell me inexpensive insurance in ILLEGAL?!!
B/F Obama we were just fine, I had a bcbs policy $150 per month. Political class has been pushing for socialized medicine confuse ins & care
You are out of your mind! Check out the cost of Dental Ins which is a free market. Check out the cost of meds. Wake up and get to work!
I don't think inexpensive insurance is illegal. Just not profitable. Repealing the ACA won't help.
I must be the only person who shopped for insurance according to your comment in this article
#StandWithRand
The medical field makes it hard to price check because you need to know the codes. It depends on the code.
U know zero on HC except wanting to give rich big tax breaks poor sick old disabled n babies will die still not cruel enough for u
Senator Paul Support Our President! Pass the Health Care ! - The American Ppl 
2/2 @RandPaul ER is NOT HEALTHCARE! U don't go 2 ER 4 a cold or a check up! #SAD ER cost is high & bills get passed on. ER is not an answer.
1/2 @RandPaul most of what U say is realistic BUT the #GOP & your excuse of "emergency room for care" is so lame! Who pays that bill?!
Seniors can't afford to pay 5x more, it won't happen. What happens to them?
Government should not be involved in our healthcare. My deductible is $3000 i can't afford my doctor anymore.
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump we want repeal reform not a tweek #getitright #HealthcareBill
Where is yr bill then? 7 yrs 2 get bill ready Fed up w/all Congress Get this bill passed
@randpaul please don't back down.  VOTE NO!  Stand up for the American people

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …
@RandPaul Get behind our @POTUS ! Ur with us or against us' 
Get off soap box...u can't get Dr appts ..Dr's are the worse.,unless u live in a big city in KY, it's like the VA..KY has the worse in DR's



I don't want to navigate The Health NOcare system.   I want over 20,000 or 50,000 etc. my choice when i need/ want insurance to kick in.
Free Market works, it is magic
Do not vote for This bill.Not best.Elder high price,NO cancer cov.10% higher prem 2018
So proud of you Rand!! You have blocked the mess that is Trumpcare!!
The Bill is MEAN like President Trump said please vote NO.. Thanks.
Please vote no on the Health care bill.  It is the wrong one for America
VOTE NO ON THIS DUMPSTER FIRE OF A BILL THAT MITCH WANTS TO RAM DOWN YOUR THROAT.  WORK LONGER TO GET IT RIGHT.  DON'T LET TRUMP BULLY YOU.
Trying to reconcile w "premiums are never going to go down". #aca premiums inflated & can be brought down by attracting healthier population
Need #FullRepeal of #Obamacare ! Better off with nothing than #Trumpcare .
Duh less insurance = less money $$
Remember your Oath
FIRST DO NO HARM
No it doesn't.  Had friends who couldn't get insurance before ACA.
'Health insurance' $1 a day. If true everyone would be on board.  Rand, define 'health insurance'.
I'm very skeptical on new #HealthCareBill Get government out of our healthcare also allow Insurance Companies to cross State Lines! @POTUS
I'm confused RandPaul.  The free market part of the ACA (added to appease Republicans), ISN'T working in the ACA. Why repeat free market?
This explains extremely little. Disappointing.
Mr. Paul did you present your plan to McConnell?
Healthcare Prices should be like Any Other Product! Like groceries etc HC costs High bc of Insurance Co & Medicaid. Get Gov out-Competition
Not if government stays involved.
Listen to Hannity today had on Drs who ar e doing  this now

your ideals over the health and well being of the rest of the human race. Do not vote for this bill until it is done right.
blind simply because your party made a promise and tried to rush it through. Can you live with that decision. If you can then you value
promise for political reasons. Take time to get this right. People'slives depend on it. You're an eye doctor, would you allow someone to go

Any healthcare plan will include pieces of Obamacare because it did have good improvements. It also had bad ones. This plan is bad from the
Screw the poor the folks with pre conditions . We are America and folks should just buck up . Pre conditions heck too bad they got sick
Shilling for the rich, you are. Just smoke and mirrors to cover for the fact you don't care for regular folks.
Senator Rand Paul exposes his total ignorance of what it's like to be a sick person navigating the healthcare system.
And no exemption for Congress. They need to be subject to the laws they make.
Vote no on senate bill..stay strong
Ha heard On CNN highrisk should be grouped together kinda like single payer add everyone else cost would b even lower! Great Idea Rand!
Senator Paul, if it's so easy, can you give up your taxpayer funded health insurance?
Sure . $1 per day huh? Are we seeing the "Dollar Store" doctor? Or is it one of the Three Stooges?
Autumn Dawn Price - who the F___  are you ? And stay out of my Twitter !!!
So Rand... sell it baby!

The Senate healthcare tax cut is STILL a big government insurance mandate. Stand by your principles Rand. VOTE NO.
Please don't vote for this plan...Goverment shouldn't be in our health care and this is no change to Obama care
I hope@RandPaul and others stand firm...
#fullrepeal
Does that mean that seniors will pay $5/day?
Our $20Trillion debt means additional expenses are paid with borrowed $.
Who borrows to donate to charity?
Non section 8 bills are charity.
And what will one get for $1/day?

#YouHaveThePowerToSaveUs #VoteNoAHCA #TaxCutNotHealthCare #peoplewillDie  #help #findFundsNegotiateDrugPrices #RegulatePharma
no other country uses the free market for health care wake up.  Go look at other countries, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, UK, Australia.
Is @RandPaul the only one speaking out on individual market? After-all, that is the killer with Obamacare.
why is the senate in such a ruch to get the healthcare bill done/  did you read it?
We all know you will vote a great big and proud YEA for the BCRA of 2017.  Your PR game is lame.
Healthcare Bill MUST allow ppl 2 buy  insur across state lines creating competn tht MadeAmericaGreat & will keep Making America Great #MAGA
Stick to your guns.  Just say no to MitchCare.  Not repeal and replace.  It is Tweek & Keep!
Sick of the deadlock
Please don't give in on this. Hold on to your stand of NO to this healthcare bill !

You do realize u didn't win the Pres election. Stop derailing health ins reform.
It's not about you, although you said you would do it! Stop talking & fix it. You can't get everything you want, welcome to the real world!
Keep fighting against OBAMA CARE LIGHT!  We need to repeal it. We need across state lines choices for health insurance.
I agree completely
To fix insurance: stop Hospitals from owning doctors, cap non profit CEO salaries, regulate insurance profits, extend the drug patent.
@RandPaul Please explain how you explain to a person that their $1/day insurance won't qualify as pre-ex coverage once they need it.
Let's have your insurance
The examples he gives are outpatient elective procedures and do not apply to hospitalizations.
Senator Paul, like most physicians, knows very little about the economics of healthcare.
and we need perfect HSA.  HSA promotes many good things
If it's that easy and cheap why can't this govt provide this benefit to taxpayers? Just more lies from Paul.
So take your ideas and compromise!!! Otherwise we will end up with single payer!!!
Let's talk about government operated businesses - USPS - Broke; AM Track - Broke. Congressmen $ millionaires - Pd by lobbyist 4 lobbyist.
Govt s/b running Medicare/Medicaid, regulate InsCo/HC/Pharm industries to reduce cost of services+fluff and open free market.
Basic health ins charged like a full gold package but catastrophic deductibles. Forced 2 pay 4 diamonds but given ugly cheap glass.
WOW! you truly care about American people. You DO what is right for American people. You have a lot of wisdom. Sincerely thank you.
But a system designed to give that price-point hits older or unhealthy people very hard. Easily be 500x as much for them.
Medical care is expensive. For 1$ a day, you will get peace of mind until shit hits the fan. Then watch insurance company deny you
Very nice presentation of the facts by Paul ... how the hell did it get on Fake News MSNBC and Morning (full of  )  Joe !!
Time for words is over.  Get a repeal/replace passed.   Results matter....
I agree that a $1 a day is great but the question on CNN was the short term impact. You avoided the question.
Should be ? Without a solid plan as to how, it's nothing but a nice wish. So work on it.For now better is better! Got to start somewhere!
Health insurance cannot be looked at with the capitalism lens. You cannot compare prices when you need care.
Anything can be improved by the free market. We wouldn't have healthcare period if the free market didn't spearhead medical development.
Thank you so much Senator for actually standing by your campaign promises. We need more like you .
#FullRepeal
Bull rap 1 $ gets you nothing huge deductibles etc people are not stupid senator
#SinglePayer #NonProfitHealthcare
Get Done Rand 
Why can't you just get it as part of the package. GET IT DONE RAND
how do U compare prices when U are having a heart attack and ambulance is called an they take to closest H?
4 years republicans complained even said they had better, should have had Ferrari of HC ready,you did not put up,so and get 2 yes ! #MAGA
doesn't seem possible but would be great! Why isn't @RandPaul sharing this plan w/ @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer ? How could Dems not agree?
If you can cover everyone for that cost no one would disagree, but of course that isn't what is the in AHCA
Rand is a jerk for not supporting the President! This Health bill is NOT perfect but it is 100% better than OBA-C! It could be revised later
Why not fix it before making it law to ensure that people's healthcare is safe? If it kicks ppl off insurance it's as bad as Ocare is
Rand Paul needs to get off TV and get to work.  Go find a solution that works for America.  Stop grandstanding and preaching.
We could have all gotten it for free if Obama just gave everybody a portion on what was wasted with all the expenditures in ACA
why isn't that in the new healthcare bill?
Real World! Real Problems! Real Solutions! Real Leader! @RandPaul @Elise_Jordan #RealisticRandPaulShouldBePresidentOfTheUSA #RealityIsSexy
Holy cow RP just rt'd you
Some working people can't even afford $30 a month.

So, doctors would only be making $100/ day seeing 100 patients a day?
@RandPaul I am grateful for all the efforts you are making on Americans' behalf to get affordable coverage for us all.  Thank you!
Competition would be good for Americans that don't a lot of money to spend on health care.
Utter garbage.

The US hasn't had anything close to a free market for centuries. Paul often says as much. Yet he wants people to trust it.
He should take his own medicine!
He's watched too many Sally Struthers infomercials.
Better shape up to stay in office in 18. Stop obstructing
Any #crookedElites or #obstructionists will be voted out of office in 2018 whether they're  Repubs or Dems #TrumpTrain #Maga #HealthcareBill
So why are Rep having a hard time
Rand Paul is a tool.
