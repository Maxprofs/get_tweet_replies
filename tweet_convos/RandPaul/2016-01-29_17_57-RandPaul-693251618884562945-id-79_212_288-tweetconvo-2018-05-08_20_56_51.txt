@RandPaul This is a violation of my constitutional right to not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.
@2dAmMuslim He has an actual poll about this on his web page.
@Palle_Hoffstein @2dAmMuslim holy fuck, they canâ€™t get stupider.
.@RandPaul I wouldn't vote for you or that other buffoon Trump. @BernieSanders I could live with.
@NickelbackWorld lucky for us, you can't vote. Go back to Canada
@gdvizier I'm from Ireland you twat.
@NickelbackWorld point remains. You still cannot vote here
@RandPaul I love Nickleback! :)
@RandPaul I can't decided which form of lying would be worse. The choice really comes down to Blatant lying vs. sly voting lying.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul now this isn't very presidential like of you... Posting something like this on your Twitter won't do anything anyways cuz you suck
@RandPaul I'd choose Nickelback. Atleast Nickel Back sounds fiscally responsible.
@RandPaul What?! There are a few people who genuinely like Nickleback! They're both super obnoxious...
@RandPaul I'd do neither
@RandPaul If given that choice? I'd have to vote for Trump. Sorry. Nickelback isn't even American. Hahaha. At least congress can limit trump
@RandPaul Nickelback...anyday
@RandPaul id take 5 yrs....as painful as that would be. #StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul who is winning? lol
@RandPaul  There saying there will be a big snow storm just in time for primary. Reminds me of when they robbed your father in maine in 2012
@RandPaul and to think I was elated when you declared, you're such a disappointment and so damn pathetic, lest not forget a  boring egotist
@marcuswildhorse @RandPaul Ooooh someone's a touchy Nickelback fan
@RandPaul Hardest decision of all time!  Great poll!
@RandPaul You will never be POTUS. Hope you lose your Senate seat. Then run for Congress. It may give you a second shot.
Missed chance @RandPaul this is Twitter. I don't have and never will have Facebook. Please post a twitter poll next time. Thanks.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews i like both. ..
@RandPaul @alllibertynews ur poll number so low because u attack #Trump very wrong way. Before u understand him, shut up, ur dad is better
@RandPaul Jokes on you , you only said forced to listen to Nickelback for four years, not forced "to only" listen to Nickelback for 4 years
@RandPaul saw bernie moving in on his daddy's meme game had to act fast
@RandPaul Log off
@RandPaul I actually like nickleback
@RandPaul NO not nickelback....ever
@RandPaul I've never heard nickleback but it has to be better than trump. And I'm a fan of apocalyptia
@RandPaul wow great poll, very tough decision.
@RandPaul Can I have 'Rand as President' for my choice? The other 2 are too much to bear!
@RandPaul little bitch boy rand paul careful whos name comes out that purdy mouth of yours . sweetpea
@RandPaul Dr. Paul, you clearly underestimate how much average americans like myself hate #nickelback... not an easy choice, at all.
You make so mad @RandPaul ! You know... the people who love Trump are-many times-the same people who love you. You are sullying yourself. 
@RandPaul You are alienating your possible voters!! You can change trump voters, but not by a bad smear campaign! You're better than that
@RandPaul I watched your live stream, your music choice isn't much better than Nickleback
@RandPaul childish antics like this is why I switched from @RandPaul to @realDonaldTrump !
@RandPaul I take Nickelback
@RandPaul This is a stupid poll. I would not want either.
@RandPaul I love Nickelback!

@RandPaul I appreciate you didn't end this with "Please send me $3.00 for my campaign" There's a 1st time for everything!
@RandPaul I think both have to be some kind of war crime
@RandPaul  I like Nickelback.
@RandPaul Trump is really a liberal in disguise you Trump follower fools
@RandPaul that's a no win scenario right there
@RandPaul I guess this means if he wanted you as his running mate you'd say no?
@RandPaul Sounds like you're making us choose between Trump and Cruz. I prefer Paul (obviously)
@RandPaul I'd choose Nickelback, Tiny Tim or Milli Vanili first. next question......
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Elect Trump!
@RandPaul @Nickelback Hands down!
Four Years or more of @RandPaul and Nickleback on infinite loop is a worthwhile trade off.
@RandPaul Nickelback rocks,....still
@RandPaul I was good with following you until this spamming crap & mud slinging someone needs to grow up Good Bye
@RandPaul Hey, at least Nickelback has some variety.
@RandPaul painful question. Is there a third option? Ripping my ears off? Nickelback would be doable if so
@RandPaul Nickelback is Canadian you should have used them for a Cruz poll
@RandPaul NICKELBACK
@RandPaul If there was a gun to my head, I'd take the nickelback.
@RandPaul Death. I can't choose either.
@RandPaul disappointing
@RandPaul yes I have
@RandPaul holy hell what a decision.... nickelback? This is how you remind me...
@RandPaul come on... I love nickleback but hate trump :/ why you gotta do this to me rand
@xtractartist @RandPaul lol
@RandPaul Funny but some ppl do like them.
@RandPaul I expected better from you. Don't fall victim to the ploys of your other fake-politicians.. keep on track with the real fixes
@RandPaul
