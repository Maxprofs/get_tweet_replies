what's the deal with the logos on your pickup and golf cart? Sponsors?
Turn the windshield wipers off. If it was raining you would have the top up. Maybe you should give me the keys and I let me drive?
that corvette better be a manual.
nearly all convertible C5's were automatic so my money is on "no"
I wondered if you stopped by there, I like the 69 yr stingray hard top convertible!
Can you republish your quote in the debate "Cities and States run by Republicans have more jobs, less crime and income inequality.
love the golf cart matches the convertible!
