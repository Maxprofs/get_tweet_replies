Aetna CEO: Obamacare in 'Death Spiral' #RepealAndReplace 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-15/aetna-ceo-says-obamacare-in-a-death-spiral-with-sick-customers …
It's more like freedom from healthcare, rather than healthcare freedom.

Every other first world democracy does it and it costs less and produces similar or better outcomes.
Well, then by all means, move
I'd rather make our country better. Even for shitty people like you. <3
no you don't, you want it better for you and then dictate terms to others. Do what you want just leave me out of it
Not at all. I have good insurance. I want my countrymen to not have to suffer under a shitty system.
yeah you're so altruistic you're going to force things you want on other people because you think it's good for them
Patient entered sounds good as does competition - what about tort reform, inflated costs, more paperwork than care
ever occur to you that it's your lunacy destabilizing the market? Of course they're leaving.
no the lunacy of meddling in the market place with 50 years of anti competitive regs did that
wish my HFC rep @RepAndyHarrisMD would bother regulating drug prices, but big pharma is in his pocket
maybe actually try investigating why big pharma can what they do and the protections govt & @US_FDA give them
@kathie_adler @freedomcaucus thank you @RandPaul
freedom? You mean make my own decisions? Personal responsibility? Who do I blame if things don't go my way?
@realDonaldTrump @business don't give up. PUSH your healthcare package. Eliminate Obamacare.
. Obamacare dos not work
We need 2 stop giving benefits to illegal aliens; Mexico needs to support its own people; we are broke.
you need to have a sit down with VA congresssman Dave Brat!
I still stand behind your plan Senator #muchrespect
Take the lead and kill the ACA ASAP! No one else seems to b stepping up.
we will never waiver in our support if Congress quickly gets POTUS Domestic Agenda done asap! #weneedhealthcare
.@RandPaul @freedomcaucus So you agree with two proven liars: Aetna and Trump? Is that right? http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/24/investing/aetna-obamacare-humana-merger/ …
Obama Care has Crashed and Burned and Everyone knows it !
that's an alternative fact.
health savings accounts are NOT the answr most Americasn can't afford to save in general! #repealobamcare
But they can afford ridiculous Obamacare premiums and huge deductibles? 
I HAVE MINE- & IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD YOURS-DROP DEAD! ALL THE COMPASSION IN THE WORLD!! TABLES WILL TURN!IDIOTS!
Your vote for Sessions should disqualify you from joining the freedom caucus.
@uniquedeehan1 
@DebFreedomVoice @freedomcaucus 1st and foremost...drain the swamp...the lawless liberal communists must face justice!
You go, Senator Paul - know you can do it!!
Freedom? millions of people will lose medical care maybe their lives if ACA is R&R'd by hacks like u. GOP=ignorance
@POTUS 

Not loosing medical care, it's insurance, just insurance. Medical care still available!
Whatever. I'm sure you're buying all the BS they're shoveling your way. Rand the healer? LMAO
We're all going to be okay, don't worry so much. #MAGA
Oh I don't worry. I wait.
Well, that sounds productive, but not surprising.  Health and happiness to you and yours.
PUKE!!
can you hold a CNN town hall & get people from both sides to your q&a?
who are the ppl saying they like it? la Raza?
on life support, are you going to be calling around for the best price? This claim of Dr.Paul's is nonsense,
Here's to lower prices and better health! Cheers, America!
@realDonaldTrump @business change Medicare age to one minute
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump #ObamacareReplacementActS222 #StandWithRand #RepealAndReplace #Obamacare
@WayneBogda @freedomcaucus nice job walking out on Ryan
@realDonaldTrump @business it's about time you've had 8 years
man you are a massive disappointment. #RepealAndReplace will lead to real deaths but hey it's politically expedient
Can't afford to use insurance you already paid to much for! Obama care gotta go!
and you expect this crew of self-serving hypocrites to give you something better? Wow
Nothing is perfect, however, ANYTHING is better than SOCIALISM!!!!!
um, providing healthcare is not socialism.
!! BS!!  PIGS!!
All we want is what you have, Senator...
HOW CAN AVERAGE AMERICANS SAVE ENOUGH $ IN HSA OR TAX BREAKS 2 PAY 4 MAJOR HEALTH ISSUE?PRE-existing must b covered
Why is there no talk of tort reform in discussions about healthcare?
@In66gal @freedomcaucus @realDonaldTrump R Paul is a get it done kinda guy. Showing leadership skills. Thumbs up.
Best thing to do is ins across state lines, help for preexisting conditions, Done that's all we want
Losing respect for Rand, party over people. Republicans can, and have done wrong, investigate regardless of party.
It's a pity your constituents are demanding that you serve them now instead of your rich donors. #Obamacare
Or you could just fix the problems you created in trying to make sure it failed. #ACARepeal
Get it done.   No more talk talk.  Just get it done now 
@DisDemsDaily @freedomcaucus Git R Done!!!
Awesome. I support your plan. Hope it passes soon. We do need these kinds of choices. Good work.
@lore_johns @freedomcaucus get rid of it, we the people need relief
GO FOR IT!
Aetna CEO and others should be prosecuted Stop illegal price fixing and collusion. No antitrust exemptions!
now why don't you join the caucus of democracy and find out what's up with Trump and Putin
Great plan -  everyone will just save 100k in their HSA account in case they get cancer.  Foolish idea!!
it won't work. ACA is absolute minimum. They will come 4 U with pitch forks and torches.
I agree that Drumpf will be impeached after the mid-terms
you are becoming a sycophant and capitulating to the liar and chief
Should be concentrating on investigation of Putin collaborators in the White House.
then get busy investigating Republican Admin connections to Russia.
Do you have a plan or just meaningless slogans? #freedomfrompoliticians
you need to investigate the ties between Trump and Putin
great! so i can be free to die bc i can't afford healthcare. neat!
I've read your plan and it sounds good, hope your fellow republican feels the same.
Stop talking and get it done!
KY had a pretty successful roll out, thanks to a Democrat governor.
you mean you joined fuck the people and help the rich club
@nancydmoore25 @freedomcaucus Repeal & Relplace as promised! Nothing else acceptable. No compromise!
Thank you for supporting POTUS
Very unhappy that those who exempted themselves are making decisions. Need insurance experts & Americans affected.
@Depasquallers @freedomcaucus Repeal send it back states over next year. Feds out. Unless your all find 4 single payer Trumpcare
You should be focusing on White House leaks.  Disgraceful
do you just add the word freedom or liberty to things you promote, and oppressive to this you oppose?
I want a freedom pizza, with no oppressive mushrooms
Repeal!  Don't replace!  In other words...repeal! Repeal! Repeal! Repeal! Repeal! Repeal! Repeal and don't replace!
#RepealTheEmployerMandate and you should be good. Let all the healthy people buy WHAT THEY WANT on the exchange.
Enough of the BS! Investigate trump & co. for ties to Russia. Leave healthcare alone & defend us against Russia.
You people are in charge of everything now. Get it done!!! @simplylorilee @freedomcaucus @realDonaldTrump
Yes keep it up @RandPaul #repealobamacare !!!
To lazy to over the past 8 years to actually fix it. So you want to trash and rebuild. Real Smart Randy!
@realDonaldTrump @business let's get it done ASAP!
@aduanebrown @freedomcaucus
Please Rand stand up for WE THE PEOPLEWe voted for POTUS Trump.against NWO/Globalists. 
Russia
you're killing me. I've been a fan for years. Don't destroy the party to push a temporary agenda. Investigate Trump
What about your Conservative plan to curve President Trump's weekend getaways?  @freedomcaucus
first things first, all Americans should be free to get sick & die w/o dr's & ins getting in the way!
lobbying money > life expectancy of anyone who makes less than $55K/yr. @RandPaul @freedomcaucus
#ProLife
Freedom from healthcare coverage? Americans without healthcare insurance?
Great work Mr. @RandPaul
For two years Paul Ryan has said he had a replacement for Obama care. Where is it?
get rid of government health care to..as a tax payer I Cannt afford it NO fucking more
Get it done!
Can we get more tests and medicines OTC?
where is the plan? We need details!
And what plan would that be exactly that doesn't bump preexisting conditions off insurance?
i dont  want to be forced to save in an hsa. Forcing that is worse than an irs penalty for not buying.
We all know Humana and other health care orgs at ALEC are pulling your strings
you are talking about killing people - not healthcare freedom. Freedom is working with Obama Care
Aetna is still part of Obama care??
#RepealAndReplace.  #StandWithRand
thank You Senator Paul
Agreed, but from my vantage point, big pharma needs to be tackled. It is completely asinine.
.@RandPaul "I'm with stupid" -Rand

@freedomcaucus
Did you read the article? If so you would know WHY this CEO might be inclined to say this.
@POTUS @seanhannity Bravo Rand> Hell With @GOP Establishment ! #RepealAndReplace #GOP Puts Band-aid On #Obamacare 
As you are removing health ins for 20M people, when are you going to put country before party @RandPaul & investigate Trump & Russia?
Make your fellow Republicans keep their words.
How do metrics chng with @CABFund replacing grnd transit Uber types w/ #veterans on patrol and generates $M month
"health care freedom" Is that like access? Can't afford it but you're free to look at it.
hi there! Can you please first handle the trump/Russia issue?! Thx in advance!
Sen Paul I respect you fully!
Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia
And to think I believed you'd be the GOP's voice of reason fighting this corrupt administration.  So disappointing.
your bosses are colluding with Russia and you pretend that repealing obamacare is a priority you need to focus on?
@SpeakerRyan Ryan pay attention.
would love to see this new bill any day now...since you've had 4 yrs to work on its replacement...just sayin 
@ClassyLady4DJT @freedomcaucus do it but keep the infighting down please Rand. One enemy at a time.
Please don't abandon your independent way of thinking.
giving @freedomcaucus a look.  Fellow #KY believer in Small Government  @realDonaldTrump #CivilDisobedience #Thoreau #MAGA
open the markets let competition take hold, cross state lines expand medicare to a sliding pay scale for ppl below
Let's start by repealing your free govt subsidized healthcare. No one should be forced to cover another.
Repeal & Replace!! @SpecialKMB1969 @freedomcaucus
Please include massive tax cuts for the rich! Ending covering for the working poor would be icing on the cake! 
Great job Senator Paul! You have a brilliant mind. Period.
repeal and replace Trump
Pls Sheep'o You lost. This is Americatime to wake up join MAGA
Timing is everything, @RandPaul @freedomcaucus.  Of all days to agree with the POTUS.  Sad!
just fix the existing law! You'd have to give up the political showmanship but you'll kill a lot less people!
Repeal with capitalism. Competition. Especially when one may want to just have HIS name on it.
Stand up to Trump on Russian ties.
I left the market because I'm healthy/workout. I won't pay high premiums and let others freeload off tax payers
what role would employers have in providing health insurance, under this plan?
what measures in this plan promote cost control of health care (as opposed to insurance)?
you need to stop talking and trying to kick the can down the road..man up!..do the right thing for us
hey!! Are you a #leaker @RandPaul ? We want to know
it February 15th. Where's the bill? By my count that's 46 days of pay for work on this phantom legislation.
Plus 7 years
@realDonaldTrump @business How many times is this now? 62? 76? 114?
I think that if it wouldn't hurt the GOP, you'd repeal without replace and let people die. Mainly your supporters.
great! Soon Americans will be in a #deathspiral
are you going to become a #Libertarian no time like now @LPNational can help, right @nsarwark
In the post-truth Trumpian world, "freedom" means "access", which means "no insurance for about 20M Americans"
Who besides Ted Cruz wants to repeal obamacare without replacing with another stupid government plan?
But you guys have had so long.  What 6 years? If there was a solution, wouldn't you have found it by now?
Yay! Repeal and Replace! Many of us, incl me, can not afford to tow the country! High premiums 4 us that work!!
Broken record. Flip side Benghazi. Only two themes for this guy. Nothing about incredible disaster roaming WH.
@realDonaldTrump @business how about that Russian spy ship off the eastern seaboard...should that be repealed?
not to worry, they'll park it in your back yard @RandPaul @freedomcaucus @realDonaldTrump @business
Get going!
Rand, if you take 20M people off #ACA, they will die because of you.

@cspanwj #UniteBlue #NotMyPOTUS #humor
@POTUS administration is in a death spiral.
Repeal and Replace must be emphasized. Repeal only isnt an option.  Make it work.
In other words, constitutional over reaches are good as long as the Republicans are doing it. Not for me!
Over reach? In what way?
You want to replace obamacare with another govt plan. How's that not an over reach?
Medicaid Expansion, which is almost 50% on ACA are now, thanks to Obama, guaranteed to have a plan
Either you want to restore constitutional integrity or you don't.
Illegal to withdraw the Medicare Expansion part of the ACA. PPL have no recourse to get ins w/o ACA
Can we just repeal without the replace? We did fine for 200+ years before the ACA.
you're joking, right?
Not even a little bit. Get the gov't out of the way and allow people to buy plans on an open market.
that has never worked anywhere.
YES YES YESSSS!
I hope you replace it with..... Freedom.
But you haven't managed PE conditions or lifetime caps. All you've done is screw people.
If you listen to trump, you too have mental issues.
