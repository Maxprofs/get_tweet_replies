Sorry but I just think it's weird they are still playing this game.
Weird is letting the whacko win. Lot of strength in continuing on.
It doesn't seem brave to me it seems like escapism. But I get the other argument.
so continuing to play a charity baseball game is escapism.. they were going to do it before. how's it anymore escapist today than yesterday?
Just a hypothetical, if Scalise would have been killed instantly would you have wanted to play? What if he killed 4 Congressman? Still play?
I personally don't care that they are playing right now and would be fine if they chose to play, or not to play in that situation as well.
I'm just curious what the line would be. To me it's a pretty big tragedy to be escaping from. It was cool they honored the police officer
for me there is virtually no line at which I would say that them defiantly playing the game is wrong.
@ChauvinistPigs  If all ya'll can get together and be civil to each other, then how about being civil to American citizens.
who threw out the first pitch?
oh, it was Capitol Police Officer hero David Bailey throwing out 1st pitch..so awesome to watch!
#CongressionalBaseball.  #StandWithRand  LOVE U RAND HOPE YOUR BETTER GOD BLESS U SIR...
Less baseball.
Less DC BS.
More ObamaCare repeal.
More tax cuts.
More regulatory relief.
More criminal justice reform.
Get real.
The time to play is done. Stand up for all the people who voted for our president. The stakes have never been higher.
Did you ever suggest people should shoot at the government?
make it realistic and give republicans a majority in both the house and the senate and also give them for 100 years the district line design
Calm down. Its a baseball game after a tragedy, their was no need for politics.
even tho is true, i just wanted to pull a politic joke out of my ass, which tragedy? waht happened?
He is now in critical condition as well wounded 2 officers and a assistant.
you know that there is a 100 Milion dollar assassination contract on @realDonaldTrump trump right?
Wait what? TBF why am I supprised.
yeah, it was set by El Chapo last year, i would have taken arms and shot trump just because i hate him, but So much cash for it, Geeez
I really hope your joking cause that's the Rhetoric I'm talking about.
Where have u been? You need to get out and defend Trump! Obama spied on everyone, and now u go quiet? The rethugs r cowards!
Happy ending
@MELANIATRUMP we need more intelligence we are been reactive we need to be proactive and preventive
Much love Rand!! All Star #8!!
Play ball!
Where are the Hollywood stars & CA Billionaires donating $ to this great cause & timeless & revered American tradition!
Senator, what were you swinging at?
better question: how did you get picked off by a righty?
Go Tops! #WKU
Maxine Waters is instrumental in convincing President Trump to throw out the first pitch.
LOL. How can you tell who is on what team? The uniforms are a bit random!
what happened to the days when people with different ideas could sit down & come to an agreement on how to move forward peacefully?
Rand Paulthis follows a trend of escalation
The game was great and all, but it's time to fully support @POTUS
The irony here is all you guys do is play. More work is needed. Individual liberty loses everyday to #collectivism. https://tinyurl.com/ReadRCW 
This exemplifies what's wrong with Washington,hypocrites on both sides
Game would have been better if we knew, who was who!  No announcer?
Good game all!! Next year, we're driving up!Just got back from r @WhiteHouse tour.Nice signs for @SteveScalise.Major Network should cover.
Fun watching you out there, Sen Paul! God bless you!!
You tried your best ! Keep fighting we are all shocked at least the people who are aware
Thank you!
Thanks! @RandPaul for sticking up for the American people and trying to stop the arms deal to the guys that hit us in 9/11 and create terror
Do you guys ever actually work?
Hopefully you're wearing @BGHotRods gear!!!!!!
great sportsmanship so could you transfer this attitude to the floor of Congress
I expect bipartisan good behavior, but you should throw at @SenSchumer if he pinch hits late in the game.
I love you Rand
NEED MORE LIKE YOU IN THE US SENATE,YOU ARE AS GOD IS MY WITNESS A TRUE PATRIOTIC RED WHITE AND BLUE AMERCAN
YOU ARE LOVED SEN RAN PAUL,JUST WISH LIBERALS WOULD SEE THE LIGHT,NO DESRESPECT TO YOU AT ALL,LOVE  YOU VERY MUCH SEN RAND PAUL
God bless.
Rand, what's up with that baserunning?
Loving the WKU jersey.
I hope you win.
Totally inappropriate game not cancelled as would've highlighted seriousness of sick left nuts. Pathetic @GOP wimps again.
Have funnnnnn!!!!
Good luck!!
AMERICAN NEED SUBTANCE,NOT SYMBOLISM,A FAKE CAREN CARPENER GAME OF MASCARADES IS NOT GONNA FIX 1 SINGLE US PROBLEM
JUST LIKE WHEN OUR TWIN TOWERS FELL,UP TILL THEN NAIBOURS LIKED NEXT DOOR FOR 20-30 YEARS AND NEVER SPOKE TO EACH OTHER
IM A ROMPER ROOM KID,AND THE MAGIC MIRROR ONLY WAS GOOD FOR ENTERTAINMENT,AMERICANS WANT TRUE UNITY AND LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER
BLUE AND RED POLITICIANS HAF BEEN STRIKING OUT FOR 40-50 YEARS,WE NEED 1 TEAM ,NOT 2 TEAMS
AMERICANS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN CROCKADILE TEARS,BUT IN "MY COUNTRY TIS OF THEE SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY FOR ALL
Hold up!!  All male?  Where are the "progressive" and otherwise women?!
I hope none of the Russian ambassadors are there at the game. We'll never hear the end of it. Go out and make a touch down !!
Enjoy
News media both fake and fair tv feeds never show the scoreboard. Reminds me when same media not showing crowd size on campaign trail.
swing batter swing!!
Hope it wasn't party vs party. Need to be on one team.

ó¾“¦
It's all eyewash. Tomorrow back to same BS;  Scalise shooting changed nothing.  Autocorrect keeps trying to change message.  Work of Devil.
it will likely change the security detail for groups of congressmen or concealed carry to individuals to defend themselves & others.
And then after, beer, pizza, and talking about how best to strip healthcare from everyone who isn't a squirming, wealthy little parasite
When will you & the sane senators , house of rep say enough is enough of this Embarrassing harassment drama team of the left & the media
And I'm from Louisiana
Good Luck! So happy you are ok. 
BLESS YA'LL HEARTS Getting crazy out there I don't own a gun but by golly you sure should carry#HERO'S SON
