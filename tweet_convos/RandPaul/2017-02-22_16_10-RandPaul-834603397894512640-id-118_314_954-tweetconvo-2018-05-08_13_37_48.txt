Your constituents don't support those programs. We won't forget you're too scared to talk w/ us now.
Dont lie!! ACA's initiatives ARE focused on patients. All of our outcome measures focus on patient. @RepMarkMeadows @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC
Why do you support health industry exemption from Fed anti-trust law? Enforce the Rule of Law!
A Repub. replacement will put the focus of healthcare back in the hands of the Healthcare Ins Corp.
SHAME, NO REPLACE...OUTRIGHT REPEAL.  We want no part of Obamacare left, not one shred!Get GVT. OUT
we should be able to add on your specific children we want to cover, not "all children".
You have great insurance that I pay for. Protect and improve ACA!

You work for me. Town hall!
Stop telling Americans where we can buy healthcare, with whom, WHEN (M-care, HMO, etc.), what types
Only Big bloated gvt. wants power to get their hands on our healthcare. IS NOT YOUR JOB
IT iS NOT GOVERNMENT'S JOB to manage our healthcare,GET OUT.
@FreedomWorks @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC / I support Repeal first! ...We can't try to bundle a replacement with repeal! #MAGA
Some1 needs to be sure @SpeakerRyan & @MitchMcConell heed the will of the people not own interest.
What about pre-existing conditions? Focus is on your donors. #boughtandpaidfor
Show support by pledging to sign up for the new plan.
Hurry Please! We can't even afford to pay for a doctor's office visit!
@SpeakerRyan @GOP @realDonaldTrump  Thank you from #WeThePeople! #RepealandReplace #StandwithRand
DEATH PANELS AT AGE 75 IN OBAMACARE/MEDICARE.  WHY IS THIS NOT TALKED ABOUT?
#pushforPaulplan
if people w/o 26yr olds knew how premiums are effected,  they would not support it.
Plse Mr. Meadows provide more substantive answers on talk-shows, instead of a bitching-fest!
Insurance co has changed care to pts  Focus on pt not money to provider/ hospital
-WALE UP CONGRESS AND SNAKE RYAN. THIS IS A GOOD PLAN. TWEAK IT AND LETS GO ON TO TAX REFORM NOW
#FreeMarket & #FullRepeal
Make sure it lowers cost for everyone
Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/RepMarkMeadows/status/834555978578350080 â€¦ (Ranked 14th for Feb 22.)
Let's do it.  @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC
Would you care to meet with your District 11 constituents & explain this in detail? We're quite eager to listen. #28806
can you tell where one of you leaves off and the other starts.  You give up@your@ins.
I'd like to make 26yos an "option" for insurance. My 22 yo has her own emp Ins, but I pay for her.
The proposed plan has more holes than Swiss cheese.
Great!  But enough talking about it.  Time to do it!
@FreedomWorks @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC Just do it!
you mean focus on the patient paying
when was doctors' focus never on the patient ?
How can you "support" a plan nobody knows anything about? Present it to the people, not corporations
screw a new trump care. Where is trumps taxes? What he owes would balance the budget.Wealthy thieves
Rep. Meadows:  when is your next town hall meeting?  Where are you?
Have u seen a replacement plan?  How can u support what you haven't seen? Does this spell hypocrisy?
the question is though, will you raise taxes on the middle class to make it work?
YES GOOD PLAN LET MOVE ON IT....
y'all are still want gov involved which is a disaster from the get go! Get gov out of health care!
How about presenting it, with full details, to your constituents at a Town Hall?
how about streamlining and bringing in competition for insurances
it's what the insurance cos paid you to draft. We lose big time, go cash your check.
By "patient" you mean the 6.4M ppl currently enrolled in Obamacare, yes?
where can we find details of the replacement plan?
took 50 years to get off their ass. No details till it's done and too late
Thank you, @RepMarkMeadows, for supporting my Senator @RandPaul and @RepSanfordSC.
why don't you repeal your health care 1st? We didn't vote for that either!
yeah, and kick 30 million to the curb. Take away their food and health care. Cure the population?
Enough to use it instead of your current benefits. Lead by example!
wasting your time.  Please, disappear again Sanford
so will we all have the plans you have and them paid for?
How about using the original ACA before the Republicans edits? Yes I read it! #notsocialist
@TheVoiceOfPaulR @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC I want to know how Rand Pauls plan is going to help me 918. month 6500. Deductible
and leave the poor uninsured.  You are supporting putting citizens to death. Shame on you.  #resist
bc ACA has saved so many people in the three years it's been forcing people to buy it?
When will American people see it? I believe it will lower premiums, lower quality and raise profits.
gvt out of HC,free market choices,State assist to poor/ low income that carries prsnl responsibility
Where can I find their plan?
except for those who really need it apparently
I don't support their plan
we'd all like to know exactly what that plan is??   Or is it a figment of the republican imagination?  Like democracy is.
TY for doing what the GOP leadership refuses to do! Now, Vote THEM OUT so real work gets done!
when the hell are you guys going to REVEAL the plan publicly? We've had enough partisan BS.
#resist
.@RepMarkMeadows @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC @JohnCornyn I as well!
Support normally 2-way street! Can all of UC destruction of US core values @ D hands of instability?
did I miss something? Because I have yet to see an actual plan.
This particular plan was revealed in January. They're consolidating support before a vote
thanks Jim I will check his website.
do we all keep our insurance?
High risk pools are a proven failure.
your efforts are appreciated, all of us would like to keep our insurance. Thanks.
so you support voucher programs? doesn't lower cost if you have a preexisting condition or accident
#StandWithRand
#showusyourproof
You people need to get finished with this.
with so many 3rd worlders entering the USA bringing back Leprosy, Mumps, Ebola, Edit the Fed say no to Refugees
This is ignorant.
it will eliminate many people that most need it
there r many.ways to kill people this is one
Thanks for your hard work!
#FullRepeal #FreeMarket I should not incur #medical #debt 2 subsidize others #PersonalResponsibility
No one should have to deal with medical debt. Healthcare should be a right not privilege.
Did you say " on the back of the patient?"
get it done
I can't support it. The pre-existing conditions clause is a big deal for me. And I hate Obamacare
If it means the government can come between a decision between myself & my doc, it goes too far. @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC
Who will pay for the uninsured being treated in the ER?
Let's get er' done! Repeal this disaster Obamacare!
you people really don't care about others, do you? 30 million without HC? Your goal?
Don't talk about it do it! All those statements are easy actions clearly are not!
where is it????? I'm waiting?
I support you 100%. Obamacare is the WORST!
in what way is it the worst? Have you had direct involvement? What went wrong?
have u? I make slightly 2 much for subsidy. Rent or HC.
& honestly I don't want other taxpayers funding my HC. Drs take $$
that nice ideals the reality is without a subsidy my family is 1800 month!
When can we expect it on @POTUS 's desk so he can sign it?
Pls tell your constituents about your Obamacare plan! Taxpayer funded, low premiums, 0 deductibles.
Here's the plan: Expand Medicare to cover every American. Looking forward to the town hall meeting! @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC
They'd better not. I want the government OUT of my care. It's between me & my Dr. @RepMarkMeadows @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC
By focus, do you mean financial burden?
get the  DEA to reschedule marijuana and make medical marijuana legal
We pay you. We pay for your healthcare. You should be making every effort that WE are protected.
That's kind of exactly what he just said
and rip coverage out of the grasp of the poor.
Town hall! Stop hiding from us and forget that stupid email you sent. Phone calls won't work.
NOBODY is messing with YOUR healthcare! Leave ACA alone! Protect and improve it!

2018 2018
Beg to differ. My premiums have tripled, deductible up 5x w/o critical doctors.
Meadows:  -  I am a stupid man with half-baked thoughts.
When are you meeting your Weaverville constituents for a Town Hall to talk about it?
You we're eloquent  today but need to get on it!!! @RandPaul @RepSanfordSC
Hold a town meeting and explain it to us.
Cost caps R the key to fixing healthcare.Why does Congress avoid the root of this man made problem?
I also support this bill
You are probably one of the few.   Ryan Catholic.   Pope gives Ryan orders.
