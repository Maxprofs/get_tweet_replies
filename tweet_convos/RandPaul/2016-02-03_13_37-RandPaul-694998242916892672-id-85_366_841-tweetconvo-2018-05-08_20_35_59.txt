@RandPaul @RestoreHistory keep fighting Rand, freedom needs you!
@RandPaul @RestoreHistory
@RandPaul I just don't think it's your time, i hope you try again on the next election.
@RandPaul sad news... you would have done well in Florida
@RandPaul The only Republican I could vote for...once again the media blackout of a Paul candidacy succeeds. Dishonest & disingenuous media.
@RandPaul You still have my vote int he primary !
@RandPaul @reason RP is my personal fave, now moving onto Rubio. Really enjoyed watching #RandPaul fight 4 fiscal conservatism.
@RandPaul please never leave me
@RandPaul Its horrible to see you go Rand, hopefully we'll see you again in 2020.
@RandPaul oh come on rand you were doing better than failed governor Christie. I thought you did alright
@RandPaul Really unfortunate news today. Best wishes Dr. Paul, you will continue to have my support on a number of critical senate issues.
@RandPaul You made my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1MYwRvl 
@RandPaul @reason Gott bless I will always stand with him He was the only my hop.I change to vote for Demo for sure not Cruz and Trump.
@RandPaul #QuitPlayinWithYourDinghy and keep running!!! @HillaryClinton can't be our net Cuntmander in Chief
@RandPaul NO !! Get back in there !!!
@RandPaul You were one of the few good ones, sad to see you go.
@Tinawanis @RandPaul He, like his father, is extremely naive about the threat of Islamic jihad.
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @reason  No other compares to Rand Paul the best no others know apinch of all Rand knows of gov so much coulvebeenfixed
@harleygrl3465 @RandPaul @BaruchSFR @reason Rand will continue to stand apart for #Liberty. Seeing the media & candidates actions=scary.
@ohsofarmygirl @RandPaul @BaruchSFR @reason  I still #StandWithRand
@harleygrl3465 @RandPaul @BaruchSFR @reason #stillranding #StandWithRand Liars liars everywhere.
@RandPaul @reason don't goDr. Paul. We need you!
@RandPaul @RestoreHistory I pray Dr. Rand Paul and his father continue on! Thank you sirs, for all you done and do!
@RandPaul @marcorubio @megynkelly Thank you for your your devotion to our Constitution. Please support Rubio. He'll protect our Constution.
@RandPaul if you'd have been more like your dad.......
@RandPaul supporters could now be the critical voters in a tight #GOPprimary. We'll see which candidate courts us. @marcorubio @tedcruz ?
@RandPaul You are a great man, sir, with great ideas.  The country isn't ready for brilliance right now.  Maybe next time around-
@RandPaul Highly admire him.  A great man
@RandPaul you tried, Senator Eraserhead https://youtu.be/q4EiBFUpFXg 
@RandPaul @reason did you ever find out who robbed your campaign headquarters in NH? I'm still voting for you in the primaries.
@RandPaul sorry to see you leave the race, but understand. Guess I'll now stand with Marco.
@RandPaul whatEVER just go away
@RandPaul I'm sorry to see you go, I always looked forward to what you had to say - will continue to watch you in the future. Good man.
@RandPaul So what he was going to fight on and now he gave up?
@RandPaul the voting populist of America isn't one who supports the True values of Liberty and don't understand you'd be the best President
@RandPaul why did you really drop out? New Hampshire is Libertarian heaven - why not wait for at least that?
@RandPaul I appreciate your class in suspending for this election. We are lucky to have you in the senate continue to be a strong cons voice
@RandPaul @reason still #StandWithRand he's the man
@RandPaul I still think you could've won
@RandPaul @reason Great article worth sharing. I still can't believe you're not running anymore. Thank you for being the voice of liberty.
@RandPaul Although I align more with Rubio, I liked some of your views also. We still need you. Thank you for your service Dr Paul.

@RandPaul ...U know DR Paul...u have to now work on your reelection...its going to be close..Our Internals show this ..
@RandPaul I am literally beside myself.  You have soured the libertarian name in ways I cannot measure.  I have no choice.  #FeelTheBern
.@RandPaul was the sanest of the Republican candidates.  Only short bus is left.
@RandPaul WE talked about this...'that RPaul should Run and Run, and in 2020 as well'...now there is no SenateFed election run PR problem
@RandPaul I hope you get a VP nod...America needs a warrior of Liberty in one of the top offices

@RandPaul @reason From a program dem: Tyvm Rand 4 bringing sanity to forpol, defpol, civlib & mass incarceration.  You will be missed!
@RandPaul @reason at least we still have you fighting for us liberty lovers in the Senate
@RandPaul You should've waited until New Hampshire. You would've won that shit.
@RandPaul I'm proud to have supported you in the primary, now I hope you'll endorse the only other true constitutionalist left, #CruzCrew
@RandPaul Keep up the good fight!
@RandPaul Maybe If Had Done ANYTHING, But Be A TeaRed POTUS Basher, He'd Have Had Some Achievements BEFORE Running ...FedSheep,SowedNone
@RandPaul Rand is a great patriot and is good for the senate he is what we need
@RandPaul you can't leave us with these idiots
