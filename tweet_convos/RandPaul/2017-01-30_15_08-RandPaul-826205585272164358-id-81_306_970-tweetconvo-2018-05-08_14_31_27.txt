Why do we only hear silence from you on #MuslimBan and reorganization of NatSec Council? Thought you were at least principled
Maybe because there is no Muslim ban? Maybe?
Not in name, but in fact. Continue enjoying the taste of sand, your head is buried in it.
If there is a Muslim ban why aren't all Muslim countries banned? Ah that's right. Bec it's not. 7 cntries listed of concern by Obama admin.
HR 158 was part of legislation, not an EO, introduced as a rider on an omnibus appropriations bill. Voted on
by Congress. It required additional in-person interview for visa purposes. No ban.
Secretaries of DHS and State can grant exceptions on a case by case basis.
@blbannan here we go again 
back off my Rand
Maybe if Rand understood economic policy 
Wait, and you do?
she's literally an economist lol
And that is suppose to men something? LOL. Especially if she is a Keynsian. Which is highly likely. That's worked out so well....
Tying the dollar to gold is about the most catastrophic thing you could do to the long term American economy writ large.
so continuing the Defecit spending and debt in perpetuity is a much better option ... have you ever heard of interest
It's not ideal, no. Regardless, there are much better ways to reform than the gold standard.
oh due tell ?
OK. There's this. http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/why-the-gold-standard-is-the-worlds-worst-economic-idea-in-2-charts/261552/ … Then this. http://investorplace.com/2012/09/7-logical-reasons-a-gold-standard-is-the-worst-idea-ever/ … Also, see below.
Hint : why Krugman criticized Trump economic team 
Krugman is an idiot and demagogue .He's irrelevant at best
true, but that doesn't mean what he noted about Trump economic team , is wrong 
otherwise I would have neverr quoted him 
i really thought you were a principled conservative but your silence this past week is deafening
, please vote " No" on Mrs. DeVos. I teach English Language Learners.I spend more time on my plans than she did on her prep.
no worries. Fed Dept of Ed will be going away or downsized and your state will doing what's best for your state.
,@SenRandPauI , I have more faith in Gov. Cuomo than Ms. DeVos.
Cuomo is a pompous fool..But I believe in State's rights and small Fed govt. I wasn't being facetious.
I do not usually agree with Cuomo but #Devosisadisaster You should be thrilled with what is going
I'll be thrilled when the federal alphabet agencies are downsized or disbanded...
PLEASE HELP US! Our country is being taken over by Bannon! Please stop this before it is too late! HELP!!
what do you think about bitcoin senator ?
then vote no on Rex. You know this Russia deal would be bad for the American people
I stand with Rand, in either '20 or '24 
put America back on the gold market @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SenateFloor @congressorg
It's time to worry about the #MuslimBan right now. Do something about that before we listen to your ideas on fiscal policy.
um..There is no Muslim ban...
end the FED and let's get back to the gold standard.
the gold standard? That's what you think people care about today? At least you stick to your beliefs... 
@realDonaldTrump MAKE OUR MONEY GREAT AGAIN. Return to sound money
Show solidarity with #POTUS or you'll be voted out come next election @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @RandPaul @WSJ
hey senator. Be a man. Stand up for what you profess. Don't be a hypocrite #StandUpToTrump
How is It fiscally responsible to spend Billions on a wall?
my taxes would go up under the flat tax concept of yours.  I don't think you thought it through.
it's beyond time.
the solution is to dump the Fed
I have said for years that I think your ideal job would be to audit the Fed. It needs done and I know you would do it well.
defend the constitution! this nutjob is shitting on it like he shit on you last spring. Get your GOP to wake up NOW. Save USA
Yes. But the failure of POTUS Trump to have his cabinet nominations confirmed is very troubling.
Best democracy money can buy-Trumps sells America to billionaires-he lied to Americans, alternative facts are lies
Ha! Then maybe Republicans shouldn't have all gotten in line behind Trump.  Most fiscally irresponsible administration ever.
will you please run against this buffoon of a man and Donald Trump in 2020 or are you just a fake conservative
your right so curb Trump's poodles, Ryan and McConnell, and stop them wasting my money on a pointless wall at 15 billion
that's the dream good sir. Maybe one day soon.
sound educational policies #noDevos
then let's not waste money on a stupid wall and a trade war. Robots will replace many manufacturing jobs. We need to stay global.
And where does Trump's worthless wall fit into that? Do tell...
God bless you! The administration has a million stupid distractions and you can look past it and point where the REAL problem is.
it's time to represent KYians. NO to #Devos, NO to #MuslimBan, YES to #fixnotnixACA. #MakeKYproudagain
It's time for patriots to stand up to @realDonaldTrump

Are you up to it?
Can you be more specific in 140 characters or less?
Then start by looking at the benefit package you very deserving people get vs what you think evidently undeserving get.
It's time you stood up to tyranny. How do you want to be remembered as history? #appeasor ?
good luck
too bad you have no idea what that is.

don't confound money and currency!
audit the fed!
fixed exchange rate with gold for USD. repeal humphrey-hawkins and all other FED which allows FOMC
GOLD STANDARD!!!
Exactly.  Everything's inflated including sub-prime auto loans, mortgages, student loans, bonds, stocks, currencies...kaboom
it's time the GOP grows a pair and fixes the mess that @POTUS has inflicted upon our country in less than a week's time.
Are you sure we shouldn't stay focused on squabbling over men in dresses using the lady's room and preferred pronouns.I'm Xir, btw
. I am praying for you and our great president. You have a tough job.
#StandWithRand
You would have us bare a cross of gold?
agreed Rand. #MAGA
Bringing back the GOLD STANDARD should help that. Work to HELP the PRESIDENT instead of bad mouthing him in public.
Goldmoney!!!
Mr. Senator, What is happening with HR 5321?
it be nice to see his taxes.. before he runs off on a shopping spree.
Consider supporting breaking the government's monopoly on money.
#AuditTheFed ...
