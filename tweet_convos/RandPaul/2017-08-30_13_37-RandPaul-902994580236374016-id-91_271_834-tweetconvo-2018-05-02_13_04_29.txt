And remove Tax Incentives for those who pay nothing into our Tax System
@RandPaul support S18
Best president ever. He's doing it for the right reasons. What's best for America. Not a self serving typical politician. He has work ethic
Not Trump.
You damm sure don't pay tax's!!!
San Diego One of the highest child Pedofiles Numbers in the country
Cali teaches homosexuality & gender swapping in elementary school ! Should anyone wonder why ?

The poor don't need a tax cut. The rich don't need a tax cut. All need a relief from this clown car presidency.
IRS spend most of its budget auditing brackets below 60k leaving the top earners.
How about the Fair Tax so the millions who contribute NOTHING can help for a change.
Tax cut will be successful if we cut benefits. Fifty percent Taxes Fed, State and local goes to hand out.  Give these people jobs.
T-AXES ARE NOT LEGAL. WE ARE BRAIN WASHED TO THINK OTHER-WISE.
Not what 45 is going for- he continues to play for Goldman Sachs & you & @GOP allow him to threaten all of us. We won't forget at elections
<--- IS ALWAYS RIGHT...( OK..EXCEPT ABOUT MCCONNELL)
PPL NEED TO LISTEN TO HIM..HE WATCHES OUT FOR US..

 @Rare
It should.
Yes and if you are making less than 60k you shouldn't pay state or federal tax period
#StandWithRand
Tax Cut before Tax Reform.  Repeal Obamacare before Replace Obamacare.

does 45 pay taxes? Who knows?
I wish these Dems would stop saying it's a tax for the Rich it should be a tax  for all who pay taxes they don't get the word all
TQ Sir....keep fighting for d people
Not sure your opinion on the "Fair Tax" but from what I've read it may not be a bad way to go. Would like to know your thoughts
Political posturing or grand standing ? 
CORRUPT PUBLIC SERVANTS IN THE CESSPOOL THAT IS WASHINGTON !
What, no tax cuts for the huge contingent who don't pay taxes?  How arbitrary, unjust, and un-inclusive!  
Yeah Paul that's the general idea. Good job buddy! Brilliant!
As it should be!
Repeal Lautenberg now and help thousands of LEO and military restore there careers.
Even BILLIONAIRES???? OMG, @NYCMayor is gonna crap his pants! 

He wants 1 more tax bracket added... 80% for Trumps friends.
Anyone else sick of seeing people make more on a tax refund than they actually earned the entire year?
So what I get like $200/month cut at the expense of what. .. Increasing the national debt and the interest rate it comes with?
How is he going to pay for it?  Bury our children in more debt?
It can't happen and still keep massive local state & federal gov'ts running, esp since wealthy & corp having highest cuts...who will pay ?
Mr mouth should put up or shut up. # all negative nothing positive
Randy has no idea how to pay for it, it's just what he wants! Typical; no plan, just nonsensical speeches. Repeal and replace rand.
I think taxation is theft and that income and property taxes are unconstitutional, therefore, we should no comply.  Abolish the IRS.
2020 plz

http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-doj-nominee-helped-russian-bank-2017-7 … this scares me. #trumprussia #treason It is hard to believe @gop @senateGOP will OK this, obviously blatantly wrong.
Good luck. Won't happen. 1% run the show. American dream is dead
Quit running for president and help the one you got. You are growing tiresome.
Past time to make this happen
Government stop stealing from the American People!
#AbolishTheIRS! Corporations should not pay less than individuals.
And, it will adversely hurt the poor the most. Even Ayn Rand knew that before she died -she was on public assistance, you fool.
Crooks want more Greedy

Can we make every working American pays a at least a minimum tax of 1%, so that everyone has buy in to the system?
YES, 2 CENTS FOR YOU & 24 BILLION FOR HIM!! HOW NICE!!
Tell me about this

Randy, u lost ur moral supporting Trump
Without morals u can't do a tax reform
Make Trump shoe his taxes then we talk
Wow what a revelation 
Who PAYS taxes. Not those who hide assets from the IRS to prevent themselves from paying taxes.
Your message unfortunately falls in deaf ears. Much like your healthcare plan.
Pre-election Trump said he's smart not paying taxes. Does that cut include Trump?
Love! Sounds good to me!
Best way to help out. Take note, @SenSanders?
Looking more presidential every day Senator Rand Paul. 20/20...
Enough talk, if you don't get tax reform done it doesn't matter what is said. With all do respect Republican Congress has just been talking
5% across the board?
Let's make it happen!
Actions speak louder than words.  Get it done!
Make that net taxes after accounting for welfare received.
Perhaps best to wait until the bills are in for the floods, the war activities, the necessary infrastructure upgrades etc. Help the USA now!
Pls listen speech @POTUS gave today on tax reform he's for tax cuts to ALL tax payers not just the wealthy. Don't listen to others only
Sounds good but #Dems will just raise rates back up later. Why not disband the #IRS and pass true reform instead?
Multiple investigations by TIGTA, multiple infractions by IRS & 6 more laws to "fix" it. #FAIRtax fixes the IRS by ELIMINATING it & #MTFA. 
That's why we must enjoy it when it happens because if the Dems regain control of congress and the Presidency then we're f**ked
Instead of tax reform how about government reform that will instantly lead to lower taxes with a decrease in gov size
Flat tax
Emphasis on the "pays taxes"
But if my taxes are consigned to Pentagon RAMP
UPS, or Trump's Rallies, or his kids' world vacays,
Then NO NO NO Rand, Paul, & Trump!!
If my taxes will help folks get educated for jobs, help with the health & child care needed to THRIVE-not just scrape by- I'm proud to pay.
It's called charity
"build it+they will come?"..
A little Tax Relief first for Mid Class will improve spending+spur demand for market=>pressure Biz Tax Relief
Its the #SplashUpEffect in Economics-Stir the common waters to create an Atmosphere of Financial Humidity which Encourages Rain to Trickle
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @VP @freedomcaucus @WSJ @business @MONEY @PhilsGang @ericbolling @LouDobbs @ASwoyer @marcorubio @FinancialTimes @slone
Good start. Keep going AND GET IT DONE.
That would be the top 53% or if you're nutjob like @NancyPelosi you think bottom 47% deserve cuts.
I guess this doesn't include #45 since he doesn't pay taxes.
And you have proof of that? Stop listening to Al Sharpton
"I'm 12 and I want to MAGA!"
Best news I've seen all day
Also wants to not compromise and willing to shut govt. dictate not legislate that's his motto
With that I totally agree let's just get it done tell Mitch  I said so
well done Senator @seanhannity
