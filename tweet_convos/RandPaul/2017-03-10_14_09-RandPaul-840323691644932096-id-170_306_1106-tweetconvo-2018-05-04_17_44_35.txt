Pls explain what happens to ppl who can't get or afford coverage after repeal! Oh that's right u don't care!
is it you can't afford it oryou want other things in life so let's have others pay for your health
We will all pay for it when those who don't have it go to the ER for everything regardless.
Try this- NO MORE emergency room visits for those without emergencies!  Very simple... .
Easy to say but harder to do. Difficult to turn away and refuse care.
Dear KQBYRD,  NOT difficult!!   Tech:  "Sir/Mame,   do you have a life/death emergency?
And when the answer is yes?
In discussing areas needing improvement: A "NO"unfairly cost$ big resource$ of others.
Full repeal of regulations that are causing costs to increase!
You are as bad as those in the left u r criticizing for imposing OC on us. Get real senator!
No bailouts to insurance companies. Remove regulations. Allow people to join in group coverage, lower cost
Compassion deficit maybe? At least admit that you never walked a mile in poverty's shoes.
Now you don't even have a well worked out plan to fully repeal and replace the law.
President Buhari is killing us(biafrans). Senator Rand Paul u are d voice of d voicless pls help us
we d Biafrans a dying on daily basis, com to our aid senator. Be d voice of d voicless. Buhari is kiling us
I like your health care bill. I think it's the best I've seen
Politicians should have same health care as the people who elect them Why do they have different coverage
Hold these pseudo conservatives to the fire! Keep it up Rand!
Stick to your guns sir. Thank you for taking a stand. I know this is a hard stand. I will pray for strength.
@POTUS #FullRepeal #WeStandWithRandsPlan. Thats the answer for Healthcare for Americans
where's ur OC replacement plan? U've been bad-mouth-trashing Obamacare for years.
Repeal Obamacare,Replace Paul Ryan.Look into assembling great minds outside Washington for replacement plan
Why can't American ppl. have same coverage as Congress?
I agree. Do not let Paul Ryan run roughshod over full repeal.
Full repeal and full open, competitive, unsubsidized, anti mono oligopolic ,free market in health care servi
What they have proposed as a replacement shld be an embarrassment 2 Trump. Since they r publicly calling on you,in
the form of "We know Kentucky will support this",as not to let anyone know u were smarter than that, we will see...
You have a lot of support Senator. Thanks for standing up for us .#FullRepeal
People are angry by the BS the DC  are regurgitating at us. Maybe not you as much as the rest of the #DCTurncoats 
used to be a big fan, voted for you in primary, but as an Iranian American Muslim I can no longer support u
Why cant you all just FIX the "government operations" we already have? Medicaid/Medicare? ACA is unconstitutional 
@NetworksManager @ericbolling @FoxNews Thx for talking directly to @realDonaldTrump!
Senator Paul, I would love to run a plan I have worked on that even health plan admins love.
Is it true, repeal of ACA  Will give the wealthy a 157 billion $ tax break? And rates in KY will go up?
Yes, Repeal gives the wealthiest tax cuts billions. Insurance Co CEOs get tax cuts. The
how about full repeal on all gov employee insurance and they go on whatever is cooked up?
I agree. Vote NO for this #AHCA bill!  https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=-1hc69KVeYs …
It's called compromise.  Have you heard to that.
-Keep fighting for us Rand we need you , about the only one who cares for Americans
Idiot(s)!  What we need is a vote to send all republicans home for good. Thanks for tearing this country up.
Plz don't give n 2Trumps threat or Ryan, other GOP ldrs. OcareLite is a huge broken promise. #FullRepeal
Damn you sell out fast af.
Federal gvmt not Constitutionally authorized to provide or require purchase of insurance or healthcare.
why can't you and the others opposing the bill meet with Ryan and word bill 2 & 3 to make the changes needed
after its repealed the Dems will never let you get the 60 votes needed to pass a new healthcare bill
Duh! If ACA is repealed GOP has leverage to get Dems on board to replace If Dems refuse USE IT AGAINST THEM
stand firm! #constitution first. Fed gov is not responsible for health insurance or health care. #Notaright
Rand Paul you nailed it. When are we going to have a House leader with integrity like you and @tedcruz 
why don't you drop you government provided care and use #ryancare #trumpcare
is this bill the best tje American people deserve?
I can only pray that @realDonaldTrump is schmoozing the speaker to make friends. The people who voted Trump want YOUR bill.
do not cave in Rand!

#FullRepeal
Faith in Senator Paul, keep fighting for the self employed who have been gouged by premiums/deductibles.
you were denied so many times running for pres why do you think your solutions matter? Go away
@NetworksManager @ericbolling @FoxNews insurance more than house payment and can't afford deductible flush it
@NetworksManager @ericbolling @FoxNews repeal separate makes clean break and requires agreement
Rand. love idea of debating repeal and replace simultaneously so vote happens same day. Great clarification!
Good job! I hope Trump watched
.@RandPaul great job @ericbolling @FoxNews.
House GOP being dishonest, you can't replace without a separate repeal!
I hope @potus listens to him.
I no u Paul get ur repeal wth no gaurntee of replace, we want gaurntee
# leverage is key!!! Stay strong Sen Paul!!! We are behind you ..what you say makes sense!!!
I Got This;
Need to have emergency family coverage for unemployment & L&I.
I agree with you. Repeal replace same day.
Senator Rand, please win this fight. How did Ryan even get involved, he's clueless on HC
@NetworksManager @ericbolling @FoxNews I hope the President is watching!
stop the grandstanding. u lost the GOP Primary, your not POTUS, vote yeah for acha.
ugh.  We need single payer.
get on the Trump train. Dems stand together on a lie and republicians eat their own.
yes, we need for repeal of Obamacare.
only repeal if you are giving something better.   Like universal healthcare
I am with you!  Complete repeal...then work with doctors and insurance companies to figure out health care
...wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.” 
― Thomas Jefferson
it would be best but you need @SenateDems on board but they're following Hillary & Obama persist & resist
Don't hold back! We are furious @SpeakerRyan is trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes. Lying weasel!
lemme guess- because fuck the poor and sick?! What do I win?
Obamacare get out
will be watching you Senator. I am following your Health Care revolt very closely. Should be interesting.
you are gonna screw this up so that OBcare remains and POTUS agenda stalled
@NetworksManager @ericbolling @FoxNews please no coverage for illegals.
Go @RandPaul Go! All in with your plan!
Full Repeal Do Not Replace!
I shall be watching at 7:15 CT. Please, do not forget to watch Kentucky vs. Alabama tomorrow at Noon CT. 
bullshit the GOP is trying payoff their financiers the insurance companies!
Explain HOW you plan to get enough votes for a full REPEAL? Fix the current plan and support TRUMP.
They don't want to keep the ACA. Repeal give tax cuts to the wealthiest citizens. Tax cuts
How about the REAL ISSUE. Fixed payment/Fees of Medicare/Aid driving up utilization and cost shifting
Americans would love to have the health plan that the Senate and House have.
Most are behind you 100% don't let up on Ryan he's no good for America!
Doc, please explain how you got bill through congress back in Dec, did you have 60 votes then?
Thanks Rand for digging your heels in! Amazed the Reps had 8 years and this is the best they could do.
The cost of health care is insane in America. Whats the solution for people making $17K-$25K a yr?
hope you guys stick together. The president will own this, got to get it right!
What we need is universal health care.
What we need is a medical industry that doesn't bankrupt people. #obamacare wasn't the sollution.
So how is the GOP plan better?
Go Rand!!! #repealnotreplace #fullrepeal #rhinocaresucks
Keep pressing Senator!
WE'RE WITH YOU SENATOR PAUL! GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND ERIC TONIGHT FOR A GREAT INTERVIEW!
#StandWithRand
Replace 1st! your replacement plan is great but wont happen if they repeal first #ReplaceThenRepeal...
...as soon as Obamacare is repealed, GOP owns mass & no way they will get Dems to vote for a replacement...
...so called "phase 3" should be phase 1 if it is ever going to happen #ReplaceThenRepeal
yes cause "free market" has worked so well in the past Suck it RP U R bought and paid for just like the rest
You guys had 8 years to figure it out. #getitdone
ask why @FoxNews isn't reporting on their Left Lunatic reporter, Jon Decker, assaulting another @WhiteHouse
Yeah. Fox News is the only major media outlet that won't ask you hard questions. #TrumpCareFail
- Follow Rand Paul healthcare plan!
when can we expect tax reform
8 years of justifying repeal. Now show us the better option!
maybe you could explain to the American people the difference between health care and health insurance.
Please underln imp of not just repeal of ACA but instituting NEGATIVE RIGHTS so tht its ills can't come back
Senator Paul I support your bill in repealing Obamacare #RepealAndReplace
scrap the whole thing. Move on to tax cuts. Let it fail and have Dems come crying for help. Then start fresh
rooting for you! Watching....
Shelve the repeal & declare Nov election invalid. Trump & Putin, Assange, Comey, some GOP rigged it!
I have a better idea WISE UP
Go back to day dreaming. The illegitimate administration is screwing this country.
Hey navy girl I will continue. I didn't turn our flag upside down when we had an Amer hater Pres
Our country is in distress. I am a vet. Will defend & protect the Constitution per my oath.
Trump is a Con Man. Wake up.
You just have to give me a credible example of his con Don't give me something from the fake news
TRUMP University. Lawsuits from unpaid vendors. Hiring undocumented workers 4 cheap labor...
Rand please keep getting to Trump. Let him know he needs to slam down on Ryans Cuckcare law.
republican leadership still has no balls? No. its that the leadership is the same as the old boss. Dmand chg
Frightened & gutless members of Congress who focus on reelection are working at cross purposes with you, sir
Obamacare set a precedent for gvmt health care. Repeal it and open insurance boarders
#StopRepeal #ACASavesLives #FixACA
I'm with you, Senator Paul! Ryan is a Democrat in Republican's clothing. He need to go.
please explain to President Trump a 64 year old collect 15k can't afford to pay 50% for medical.
fuck the sick and the poor!
repeal. Get government out of healthcare
We don't need massive tax cuts for the rich at the expense of healthcare for the poor. #Shame
We already know why. You're greedy and hate poor people.
TY Senator,  we need your voice.  We don't want RyanCare.
Corporate taxes from pharmaceutical companies should be used to Fund Medicare and Medicaid. - ?
Because you can't fix stupid, right
Full Repeal!!!
k but is that a realistic objective?
.@RandPaul @ericbolling I have a neighbor named Eric Buttcheeks.
