@RandPaul Thank You Rand Paul for your fight for the American People, we need more voices....God Bless You and Yours....
@RandPaul I hope you know that if you'd have merely carried forward your fathers stand YOU would be where Trump is IMO, a #GOP outsider.

@RandPaul thank you Rand for all your efforts. You are the only one with any principles. Stay true to them
@RandPaul I'm a fiscally conservative dem who is honored to pay taxes and help a greater good. But I liked u so much more than the others.
@RandPaul Marine Le Pen doubled or tripled her movement after she took it over from her father.  You've done the exact opposite.

@RandPaul 
Good. Now go listen to the latest Tom Woods podcast.
@RandPaul I was sad to hear the news, you were the only reason I was enthusiastic about this election. I might just write you in come  Nov.

@RandPaul Thank you for sticking up for the American people. D
@RandPaul It's okay you can still represent the people in the Senate.
@RandPaul  Thanks to the people of Iowa, you are now dropping out of the race. Can doners get their money back?
@RandPaul Wish you all the best Senator! Thank you for all you do for our country!

@RandPaul #trumpaul Trump/Paul 2016 #Rand4VP
@RandPaul thank you for bringing the real issues to the table... I pray for your senate re election
@RandPaul Rejection! Get use to it!Take responsible for the bad votes you have made about National Security! Kentucky senators waste money!
@RandPaul I am not a Republican; Your voice will nevertheless be missed. The grown ups in the GOP roster are few.
@RandPaul Don't give up!!!! Let these other GOP neocons hang themselves!!! The world can see through the media smoke and mirrors!!!
@RandPaul I still support you Rand. Thank-you for everything you've done & will continue to do to fight for liberty. You are an inspiration.
@RandPaul win or lose please keep up the fight, need 1 voice of sanity out there, fighting AGAINST war, for state rights, & liberty 4 people
@RandPaul Was impressed with how you carried your message where it needs to be heard the most--colleges and the inner cities.
@RandPaul We love you Rand!  Please join forces with @TedCruz!  Together you can take our country back!!!!
@RandPaul heartbroken.
.@RandPaul announced he has suspended his campaign for pres but will continue the fight for liberty. It's been an honor to work for him.
@MichaelBiundo His voice is so important! @RandPaul https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUx7TvBuyEQ …
@RandPaul SANDER OR HILLIARY =WINS MAKES ALL COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE FREE ADMISSION. THE TAX PAYERS WILL PAY FOR IT. YOU KNOW IT I KNOW IT.
@RandPaul Please do not suspend your campaign, keep going thru New Hampshire!
@RandPaul whaaaat? How is this possible????
@RandPaul DON'T DROP OUT
@RandPaul @ACalltoPaul power on. let' snot fight any more. Thank you for your work. For Liberty
@RandPaul We are with you all the way!!
@RandPaul #ClownsToTheLeftJokersToTheRightHereImRandStuckInTheMiddleWithYou
@RandPaul Maybe it's time to drop out.
America will NEVER fall to some band of terrorists.  The main threat we face is economic failure (like USSR) Only @RandPaul gets this.
@RandPaul @robbyjr04 #VoteTrump2016
@RandPaul The Good Behavior is the Best Thing that has been given to people http://www.saatchiart.com/account/artworks/675853 …
@RandPaul Press on... nothing  can take the place of persistence!....Calvin Coolidge!!!!!
@RandPaul I can't wait to cast my vote in CO for you, Sen. Paul! Keep up the fight for liberty! #StandWithRand
@RandPaul enthusiasm doesn't mean jack if they DONT SHOW UP! The students let you down doc
@RandPaul You have NO SHOT  give up all your doing is helping elect Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.
@RandPaul I just had a great idea! do about 10 interviews with Kelly on her feelings of the campaign.
@RandPaul it would have been nice if you told us about your Christian background and what church you went to on Sunday?
@jfl1950 @RandPaul who cares what church he goes to?! The important thing is he is the one that will protect your liberty to go to yours!!!
@RandPaul Don't worry Trump people. I did some research, and beat fox again

@RandPaul with u RAND! Get WAY more Aggressive in NH. keep going!!!
@RandPaul Dr. Paul - You really woke the students up.  Bravo - great job!  Apathy is a NATION-KILLER!
@RandPaul any trips for east tx planned?
@RandPaul better focus on holding your seat here in Kentucky. Mayor Gray might be formidable.
@RandPaul Oh and one more thing, you have only one delegate, but Ted Cruz have only 8 with over 1000 to go. And I want to be your delegate
@RandPaul Tell your wife Kelly and your sons and your whole family not to give up on you.
@RandPaul Remember, keep your head up and win this thing!
@RandPaul If RNC do not include you in the debate tell your supporters not to watch the debate.
@RandPaul I need you to do me an favor, tell all your supporters to call RNC to include you in the debate.
@RandPaul You got fucked by 10000 students
@RandPaul You Will Win It! I have great faith in that!
@RandPaul On to NH!
@RandPaul The longer you fight, the better the chances we have for liberty!
@RandPaul  My advice to you is don't drop out even if you lose new Hampshire, others would drop out first witch will make easy for you.
@RandPaul PLEASE KEEP FIGHTING #StandWithRand
@RandPaul your a class act. Proud to be a fellow Kentuckian
@RandPaul I will continue to make phone calls for your campaign.
@RandPaul Spend more time in New Hampshire than you did in Iowa by a thousand fold!
@RandPaul Learned from Marco Rubio and why he did well in Iowa. Do not make the same mistakes.
@RandPaul  Hay Rand. it's not over by a long shot! Remember Bill Clinton  1992 Iowa Caucus.  But I will say this learned from the mistakes.
@RandPaul the only politician who understands that each amendment in the Bill of Rights are pillars of freedom
@RandPaul keep fighting for liberty! You are what this country needs #StandWithRand
@RandPaul you gotta increase your urgency. Bernie said it is too late for establishment politics. He's right about that.
@RandPaul Will you be visiting Minnesota anytime soon?  It would be a thrill to meet you and shake your hand.
@RandPaul I love Rand for the command!
@RandPaul keep fighting Senator.  I'll stand with you in this election and any in the future.  You have the voice that is the party's future
