REPEAL, NOT REPLACE!   Deregulate healthcare! NO MORE SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS!
Gov needs to stay out of our healthcare!
I'm sure @GOP will focus on "repeal" when it's time to get reelected. For now, their "actions" prove they don't care.
Hey, will you be writing the cancellation letters to the 20 million?
Stand with Rand. A real Libertarian and Republican. Whip Paul Ryan and RINOs into shape.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul Millions of citizens with pre-exsisting conditions do not agree.
you have to have skin in the game. State healthcare where is free for leeches not tax payers
My skin in the game is me paying taxes AND $ for state insurance AND wanting the ACA
yeah well aca isn't so affordable for me and my family. Until I don't have to b payforothers
I understand. I have a different view on it, but I respect that.
cool you can keep aca you'll just have to pay for it not me. If it works for you great :)
Complete Repeal!! No shred of BO mark left please!!
My response 2 all things Ocare. Just leave it alone and let it crash.Then the leftists can explain THAT.
@IngrahamAngle give a little, take a little, admit do something.  Under the status of USA, increase the deficit bye 1 1/2trillon
this was in response to Senator Paul, and taxes.  Got big fingers, sorry.
The ACA, damit.
If Paul Ryan can't deliver on this freedom group needs to make him step down.  Rand Paul's Healthcare plan best one
Not much of a deliverable.
@Rosecake @RandPaul Right on! Replacing it means we still have Socialized Medicine! Gov has no place in healthcare!  Not a win!
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul. Another cracked Nut.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul Fully agree with Rand. Most of #TeamTrump does too. @realDonaldTrump
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul pathetic politics! Repeal- yeah right. He's only concerned with cheap rhetoric & his image not people!
yes agree. Scrap that piece of crap. I can tell you first hand it was no good except for those getting a free ride.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul I agree 100% with Senator Rand Paul from my state of Ky
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul You'll have blood on your hands if repeal with no equal/better replacement. Talk about GOP death panels!
@mlong42947 @RandPaul the ACA has tentacles that run into other parts of government. Especially the IRS.
ACA Repeal is #RepublicanSanctionedMurder!
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul ..There are SIX BILLS they can chose from it can happen very quick.
no the GOP must deliver a complete replacement. How bout single payer healthcare like have the world has. I want yours
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul no one cares about replace. Repeal the ACA period.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul Provide free healthcare at county hospitals for the poor.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul Why can't we erase it all and start from scratch.Wouldn't it easier? We need to address billing gouging
@IngrahamAngle ABSOLUTELY  @RandPaul
good thing you've got that optometry back-up plan. #repealandgetreplaced
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul ACA COMPLETE REPEAL. Anything less NOT ACCEPTABLE
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul Find myself agreeing with Paul,  something that I rarely do.
but must address the problem with MEDICAL PRICING
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul Smiled!!!
Also eliminate the current marxist tax code. We may never have this chance again. Income tax is a plank of communism.
@gop yrs to do something & this is all u can come up with? Disgraceful #notmyrepublicanparty
no @GOP must fix ACA and the better get it right
lol
Rand Paul is one of the few in congress with sense
Repeal 0bamaCare & replace it with more repeals of anti-free market regulations. Cut @US_FDA approval time, make Rxâ†’OTC

Lol ACA not the problem the way local government implemented it is. Kentucky healthcare ranks next to last. GOP fault
and you will flip the bill for everyone that can't pay their medical bills right rand?
I vote for putting ALL federal employees on ACA replacement plan. Mr. Paul, you are an ass.
please give us choice in Healthcare.  We shouldn't have to beg the establishment!!
Rand Paul once said Donald Trump is a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag,,, Now he kisses his ,,,,,
Time to hold the GOPs feet to the fire. They can be replaced in 2018 just as well as the dems
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul Absolutely correct. Go for it. Also I really like your approach.
- yup - we elected @realDonaldTrump @POTUS - we're serious -  or get off the  - we'll elect people with spines 
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul That's what President Trump said yesterday and again today.
@IngrahamAngle It will take time to pay deficit but not without long term investments.  79 still paying to much Taxes only.
@IngrahamAngle @RandPaul Had to read it elsewhere. A deleted ad blocks it. FISHY.
.  @POTUS.  YES COMPLETE REPEAL NOT PARTIAL..THANK YOU F2F OR NOT GIVING IN TO OLD ESTABLISHMENT
