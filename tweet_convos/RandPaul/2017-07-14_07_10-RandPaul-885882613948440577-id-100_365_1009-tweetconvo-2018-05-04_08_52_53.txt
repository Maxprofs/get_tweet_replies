Nearly all the GOP ran on and voted for #FullRepeal 60+ times. Now when it counts they cave

Sooo this is awful but how is it Germaine to the thread?

Then vote to repeal DO YOUR JOB!
A true fisical conservative that keeps #Liberty in mind when looking creating or reviewing bills!  He need some more help in the Senate!
Yes he does. Check out @AP4Liberty running for the MO Senate seat! He can use all the support we can give! #AP4Senate #MOSEN
He is one that will be able to help!!!
We need more libertarians to restore the GOP to it's original principles. @AP4Liberty in MOand @SenatorBrakey in Maine will be a great start
So we have 1 Sen. in the SWAMP who is not bought & paid for by Big Pharma...Big Insurance...Big Oil...Big Tech...etc...etc..?

Yes! Repeal...worry about replacing or not later.

Stay the course. Keep your promises.

Thank you @RandPaul!  Stand Fast!

I've seen it and witnessed similar abuses.  Absolutely horrifying!
Its time for another rally!  repeal obamacare PERIOD!

I  @RandPaul! Thank you for standing for liberty, freedom, the Constitution and we the people.

Corruption runs rampant in every state at every level. Thanks to JFK signing exec order for gov employees to unionize. They can't be fired.
@RandPaul Stop looking for perfect and get this to committee. I sent you money for Pres primary. I'm not happy with you. Pull head out!

I so totally agree with you. Thank you for sticking to your convictions and your promise.

I'm with you Senator Paul, especially on health care. Get the government out of health care.

#StandWithRand

Did you not care that millions would lose access to healthcare if you did that?
RT @RandPaul You must remove crony corruption, lobbyists, & special interests. Start with the big oligopoly Healthcare Insurance Cos. #USA
"you can keep your drs." obama lie. It's the Dems fault, tweet them.
Senator Paul is the heart of the Christian conservative movement .Always stand on your principles.

#FullRepeal of #Obamacare
#NoDealFullRepeal 
@GOP @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP 
No full repeal; no $$/no votes 2018/2020!

TY 4the link always appreciate learning more about any topic!
If this bill will help reduce the cost of health care for Americans then sign it. Get off of your high horse. You should suffer under O care

@YALiberty

@POTUS @vp @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
#LifeIsMoreBeautifulWhen 

People keep their promises like @RandPaul on #Obamacare! 

…

You can't repeal it if you don't have something perfected to replace it.  Get a bipartisan committee working on something which protects us



RT @RandPaul @Jim_Jordan Politicians were elected to serve The #American People/voters; Not to be bought off by Corps.& lobbyists. #USA #ACA
Look for a New Job.23 million people  will vote  next term . Retired  blood pressure  meds. $4 to $18. Cheapest  14.
May go Democratic
Repeal now then work on it later. So U all can move on to budget and tax reform.  There r a lot of things need to be done,this holding it up
God bless Senator Paul i heard Bill O on Beck saying Sen P is standing on self interest, he stands on the individuals interest & FREEDOM!!!
BETTER HALF A LOAF THAN NO LOAF
So will you be introducing a bill to repeal the health care provided to you via the Senate? Or will you and your family remain a slave to it
Stand with Rand @RandPaul Get big government out of our business. Repeal do not replace #Obamacare

Senator sometimes the really big decisions take time. Becoming a Dr took a lot of years to get u "right" for job!!
He's going to kill poor people if it's the last thing he does.
So you do nothing
The replacement is worse than obamacare. It hangs our vets and elderly out to dry. Really throwing them over the cliff. REPEAL!!!
I pray you can't
Uh oh, watch out! You're not going along with mainstream GOP politics, the sheep aren't gonna like that!
#DrainTheSwamp
Would be devasting if you don't pass something now. Next election will go to the dems because GOP can't pull it together like pelosi can
Repeal! Do NOT replace! Give it to the free market. Don't create another gov't  bureaucracy!
That’s why I don’t think of you as a politician; rather a man of principle, who cares about this country’s future.
This idea gets DC out of the equation, & believe it or not, it unites free marketers and progressives.
Libertarians and Republicans believed in his facade, but Libertarians woke up first. I am not for any political party.
Rand Paul is the ONLY Senator looking out for the Amer. people. All the others are LIARS. They say Repeal when they want votes then screw us

Why can't you people pass SOMETHING then work on bettering it? Nothing will be fantastic the first time around. Geez
How do you repeal it? Wouldn't people be uninsured?  You have nothing to replace it with.
Thank you Sen. Paul for keeping your word
stop grandstanding; politics not religion....politics is art of compromise and WINNING battles to WIN the war..vote yes on gop hcare
Please be the one to hold up the whole healthcare bill which can be amended to repeal what's left. PPL are praying this bill to pass by GOP!
Cool, but "slightly less ObamaCare" is better than ObamaCare, and is apparently as good as we can get right now. Support the #CruzAmendment.
not going to happen
Stand firm ! 
REPEAL
REPEAL
REPEAL 

Thank You!!
Yeah but let's not let two people hold out on this GET IT DONE 
Publish the names of Senators who aren`t keeping their promises.
Easier to publish the names that are keeping promises. Repeal DO NOT replace #Obamacare vote NO #HealthcareBill
If only they'd stop the backroom deals and use the normal amendment process we'd find out fast who was preventing this repeal
@LouDobbs @limbaugh @GovMikeHuckabee @jessebwatters  Amen, Amen & Amen! Rand Paul is one of few that actually remembers what he promised.

So you were a horrible person and you refuse to learn from it and become a better man. Good job.
Yes! The Senate wants to pull another heist against Americans by trying to keep Obamacare  http://nws.mx/2unNFxs  #RepealAndReplace
SO, do you have a plan to take it's place??  If not, support what we can get to rid our middles class from bankruptcy.
Please keep up the good fight.  We the people want Obamacare repealed...not replaced with more BS...  Repeal it...please.
Rand, has promised to screw as many Americans as he can, and he is trying his best.
2010&14 GOP ALL PROMISED TO REPEAL ACA So the PPL gave you the POWER to REPEALinstead they funded&exempted themselves=WERE SERIOUS PROOF2018
#FullRepeal and #NeverReplace
Repeal and replace with nothing.
Amen, Senator Rand Paul!
Change the laws re: drug costs!!! My med should not cost 40k a year more here than in UK. It wld lower cost & save Medicaid & Medicare!
Did you win?? Maybe support to make America Great Again would begin the work...
Need it done now! Republicans have had years to get it right! Now we are desperate to get it done!
You're quite right.  #LifeIsMoreBeautifulWhen people want to take away my access to healthcare.  Nothing's better.
Do something that helps. Accepting Status quo b/c you don't get everything you want is childish/selfish. What's your plan?
Accepting the status quo is exactly what he's NOT doing. Are you blind??
Never been a supporter of yours because of the divergence on foreign policy. However, you are 100% correct on this. Thank You Sen Paul
I feel you @RandPaul, but making it more palatable it is better than leaving it as is.
Congrats on your non-accomplishments.
Completely disagree with your stance, but I appreciate you having a clear stance and sticking to it.
It'll never happen and u know it. Can't take away an entitlement unfortunately. Vote for bill
3 people disagree. Stand your ground for full repeal!!

@RandPaul & others keep promise to #REPEAL. But NOT @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan & @DNC! Despicable. @realDonaldTrump
#LifeIsMoreBeautifulWhen 

People keep their promises like @RandPaul on #Obamacare! 

…
How does it benefit them if its their money? You can be against tax cuts but don't say you are entitled to that money.
Lol. You do know those thing except education is why we pay taxes. I am not aganist public education but doesn't mean etitlement.
But funny how we're the greatest country in the world yet other countries are entitled to provide healthcare, education, etc.
We are with you repeal and get out of business if you need care Medicaid is still there
Therein lies the rub. Is 1/2 a loaf better than no loaf at all? In this case Obama lite is testimony to political elite catering to spec int
"No Repeal or No Deal"
