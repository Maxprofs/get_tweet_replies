@murphy13272 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton but going into Iraq war with lies to AMERICAN public, that's ok!
ALL I HEAR ARE WORDS!
And the Dems don't care. National security is a joke to them. They just want freebies.
@FrenchForTrump @RandPaul @HillaryClinton  The problem is, #MSM has convinced the masses that what she did IS excusable. Very sad.
turns out the private server was secure, unlike others including government.  Get over it.says Eastwood
No it doesn't. It didn't even have yo capabilities to tell you if it was breeched.
repub comedy said no evidence that it was, if had a gov. Server repub would prefer priv.
you are the one supporting Don Rump, disturbed sauce.not 1 true statement from him,
and she's been lying for 30 years good luck with that
only in the Rump supporters minds. Take the time & effort http://www.factchecker.org . notfox
yeah http://factcheck.org  maybe you should go run along now back to correct the record
yes, 1 email out of 30K slipped thru; you've had more malpractice claims against u with far less patients; #inexcusable
Anyone else with that clearance would never again have that clearance or job & most likely be in prison.
so why didn't you support theNominee??You and rest of the Girlsclub will be out of cushy jobs whenTrump gets in!UR Fired!
all evidence shows she asked over and over, was told no everytime and went and used it anyway!!

Just perverse! What's w/ all these pics of Trump/daughter in provocative poses?& he's being accused of raping 13 y/o 
#StandWithRand

GREAT JOB ON FOX 2DAY RAND!

Watch your 6. Bet you aren't gonna be popular around the water cooler! #NeverHillary #Hillaryforprison
She doesn't care about anyone but herself.  Corrup
Was it inexcusable when Rice and Powell did it too? #hypocrite
of course it was
You're too nice. It was about hiding embarassing self-dealing and corruption, not convenience.
Clinton is a delegator- she has others do a lot of her dirty work to keep her hands clean.She is the head of the snake
Was it "convenience" or was she hiding something?
that was as SofS if she was POTUS much worse.
God Bless you Sir!

One more for the Killary ?  Seems so

Well said
Amen,  You catch that Hillary. Everyone knows you as corrupt as Ma Harper. I believe it is time to LHAU!!
Get real!!!

It was much more than a manner of convenience.
@LindaSuhler @RandPaul @HillaryClinton Senator Paul, c'mon now, it wasn't about convenience. What turnip truck did you fall off?
& this rhetoric continues to be baseless. *shakes head*
Narcissistic! Entitled that actually pretends to care about the disabled, minorities, and women's rights!

Your indignity is undermined by GOP's candidate. Actually any indignation by GOP is undermined by Trump.

@realDonaldTrump Now if ALL the voters could hear about it.....but there's not enough unbiased media to get the word out.
Thank you Senator for telling it like you see it. Imagine if the entire Congress did honestly:)
