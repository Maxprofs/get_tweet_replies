We are continuing our search for the Obamacare Lite bill! Do you know where the secret location might be? Has anyone seen the bill? 
@californredneck What does it take for the GOP to get it. We don't want Obamacare, Obamacare lite. They can get a new job.
Yes it is. The GOP has no intention of repealing it. They have demonstrated that ever since it was passed.
probably cuz they all make so much $ from it the way it is by scamming us!
@ginareyna Tell that fool to stop grandstanding.  We have much bigger issues at work here like Obama and treason.
exactly the truth  we're sick of him pretending he's a REALITY STAR he's not that interesting 
Power and recognition is what they crave. If they don't get it, they will create it. Narcissists, the lot of them
@RandPaul DO YOUR JOB  STOP SHOW BOATING  we the people are watching closely  #FoxNewsUS #TrustIsPower
HELLO CRAZY AI PROGRAM WE DONT CARE WHAT BOTS THINK  however person who programmed you 
Ask Comey. I'm sure he pilfered it when spying on Trump.
@RandPaul  As usual, Rand Paul is being a boob.
the value proposition is equating financing deportation w national service that will rebuild inner cities & infrastructure
Lo & Behold its been released.. at least the outline-its great-complaints will come even if God wrote it
@RandPaul we gave you all the seats. Stop giving Excuses! Get it done. Don't worry about your way. Worry about a way period!
Heard your show in the car on Sirius (seriously) My wife & I loved it. Good job!
Paul is embarrassment to himself, Republican Party & his constituents. Get control of himself!
Tell the Sen to find something constructive to do. When the time is right he'll see it. Bet he didn't hunt for it last time!
Ms. Faulkner you are fabulous reporter. I  want to hearing all sides of a story! Keep it up!  See u on @OutnumberedFNC!
@RandPaul got the first part right... Let's forget about the whole "replace" part please. TIA.
@RandPaul This is such a cute game you're playing. It's funny when people lose their healthcare, get sick, go bankrupt & die
@RandPaul   I have to agree that any discussion on the healthcare bill needs to include all members of the Republican Party
Harris, can't watch anymore. We exiled DirecTV. Too much $ and lefty ties. But we do miss watching you on Sunday Fox Report.
you are fantabulous @HARRISFAULKNER  and you do a wonderful job with Fox Report.
C'mon Rand Paul, quit acting childish. We get enough of that from the Dems.
@RandPaul we love you Rand!
@RandPaul if it's at the Whitehouse it will be leaked soon
@RandPaul just makes so much sense! Thanks for all your work to get govt out of Healthcare insurance.
@RandPaul Why do the Republicans insist on eating their own ?
way to keep him calm and rational.
He is so passionate he oftentimes comes off too aggressive. You kept him focused on point
@RandPaul Awesome plan, Rand Paul!
Why do we have to join an association. Why can't an individual get the same rates as a large group?
if he hasn't read it, how does he know what's in it? Maybe he should wait until he reads it!
@RandPaul how do you provide healthcare for low income families without providing some type of subsidy
The premium you negotiate still might not be affordable for low income
He was just PO'd that he couldn't be the first one to 'leak' it to the press. Sorry, Charlie!
why can't GOP stand as one, Rand Paul stop the drama, pathetic.  #gopunited
just get it done!
@RandPaul Talk about a staged photo to grab headlines. Can' stand not to be center of attention.
@RandPaul so u hv absolutely no other wrk u cld hv been doing instead wasting tax payer $ on ur stupid theatrics this n
@NancyPelosi r y America is getting so damn sick of Congress we r getting sick of Congress tit 4 tat crooked ASSES
we r hell fed up w NP n her Nazi tactics she spreads fear hate n sedition every time she opens mouth
Its like a Monty python skit.not funny at the seriousness of the gov deflection and secrecy these clowns work for us Go Paul
Thank you for holding their feet to the fire! Hiding is tantamount to obfuscation!
No, it has unfortunately become a necessary move to keep leaks from the press before the final 
draft.
..We have a nutjob in the WH & @RandPaul is still running around showing off his version of the ACA...DO YOUR JOB
This is true. Her name is Nancy Pelosi in the building down the street!
@RandPaul  #StandWithRand
Can U ask what planet hes living on? Americans R afraid for their lives, R democracy under attack &hes making joke
What he's doing is bringing public attention to this and trying to hold House Republicans accountable
@RandPaul yes, it is in uniting behind aca to improve it
BHO Advisors Rhodes/Ernst Wrong: The Pres Can Order Wiretap,Trump Will Have Last Laugh #ObamaWiretap
@RandPaul don't repeal!!! Too many Americans count on this. #stopmakingusanoliarchy #whathappenedtoforthepeople #norepeal
I think they are working on it. They'll let you know when their first draft is ready for you to check-No media BS meanwhile.
@RandPaul  This seems somewhat childish to me.  With all the leaks out there, I don't blame holding cards close to vest.
with all the leeks I don't blame them
looking forward to watching your program on this Monday
acts like an obnoxious and petulant Manchurian candidate then wonders why he is shut out? he's become a typical politician!
he's @RandPaul got nothing neither, @GOP all smoke and mirrors re: ACA replacement.
