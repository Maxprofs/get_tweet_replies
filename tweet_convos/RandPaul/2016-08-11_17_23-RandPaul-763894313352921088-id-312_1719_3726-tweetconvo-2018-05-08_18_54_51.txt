and truly that is what the FairTax would do.
All taxes are unfair: theft from the pple by the govt  w/o providing anything useful/desirable
There is some truth to this however, we do need roads, schools, police, Firemen, etc. #FairTax
Schools: how much money is poured in govt schooling? Result? Very low global ranking. Worth it?
I believe in a lot less Gov not no Gov. Libertarian'ism over anarchy and that costs money #FairTax
#Libertarianism, tho good, leaves path to totalitarianism. Lib. Needed for orderly xfer to #anarchism.
including bill and hillary or especially them
That's rich coming from you.
absolutely, unequivocally agree with this statement. ~Reb
Biafrans need fair treatment as enshrined in @UN declarion on rights of indigenous ppl to self determination
@alllibertynews @RandPaul #allLivesMatter!
.@RandPaul I discovered largest fraud of public funds in #VT. Biggest impediment to justice is @FBIWFO, @USAO_VT & @SenatorLeahy @FoxNews
clearly we know that's not going to happen. Hillary is still walking the streets!  She should be in prison!!
@nerossister @RandPaul 
Isn't that what the Bill of Rights is all about?  When did America take a wrong turn??
good question. Seems 2 be when ppl w too much access to blackmail info and $ get away w whatever they want
@DeenaJo07969010 @RandPaul really? why haven't he endorsed Americans Nominee?
@pkelley196 @RandPaul well everyone isn't. Why is Hillary not in jail.
Ok RAND PAUL Equal Right For Everybody No Discrimination,Abuse and Corruption 
Unless Paul takes action his words are empty platitudes.
@FoxNews @alllibertynews @RandPaul @WhiteHouse Should be, but never will.Thru outit's never been. @Rich&famousPrivilege @PowerAddiction
@LanceSilver1 @RandPaul 

Unless your last name is Clinton.
Like you have ever done that?
THE CLINTONS ARE LAUGHING AT AMERICA ALL THE WAY THROUGH THEIR POLITICAL CAREERS
YOU are CORRECT-this needs to be blasted daily! They look at the WH again for their OWN agenda ONLY-believe it!
correct rich poor white black ...but she's Clinton the super race get ready for 8 years of pant suits .
Biafrans needed to be threated according to the international law.UN support Biafra http://memorandum.SUPPORT  BIAFREXIT
that is not the case in usa anymore.  Its old.
Whether you're rich or poor, white or black, the State's "laws" are a violation of our human rights.
fair enough, point well made.
Amen to that, but power, money and friends in high places will always skate
Tell that to the racist gang of thugs in the black lives matter group.
we now know it DOESN'T work that way!
if Trump had done this, his campaign would be over and he'd be on trial...TOTAL HYPOCRISY!!
...Nice one Rand, we are so grateful for your wonderful insight!!!
@instapundit @RandPaul "unless your name is CLINTON!"
Sorry, not in Nigeria, more so under @MBuhari
ALL LIVES MATTER ALL LIVES MATTER  ALL LIVES MATTER   ALL LIVES MATTER   ALL LIVES MATTER   ALL LIVES MATTER   ALL LIVES!
absolutely Correct
@instapundit @RandPaul Except those that are more equal than others. Like the Clintons.

Rule of Law, 1776-2016, RIP.
@Lookinabout @RandPaul let's make that under the sky and only space cadets will be racist!
Except Hillary and Obama, obviously!
Sounds like common American values
@PJStrikeForce @RandPaul Exactly why they should have a computer machine plus 2 judges weight out the facts based on a point scale
So now, what does congress and the senate do about her? What do we the people do to get her out?
Hillary Clinton is a lawyer she should have known better
@masspolitica @RandPaul What if the law is affirmative action?
amen
George Orwell showed how some animals are more equal than others. He understood #NeverHillary. #Trump #TrumpPence16
Very true and be honest also
Good dream, but racists and lobbyists won't let that happen
Amen Amen!!! #StandWithRand no others compare..
that's really not too original. MLK
That's the true meaning of #Justice and #Equality.
see that little * next to HRC... she's exempt, other than that You are correct we are all treated the same.
and everybody should respect the law and respond to directions accordingly!
@PJStrikeForce @RandPaul which should also mean there isn't any entitled class, race,creed, or gender!!!
All 4 =. All pay X 4 1st X income but only some pay way more 4 last income. In baseball all wins r equal.
yeah so if you threaten a police officer you're going to get shot. So don't break the law.
should have been the nominee
saw Rand on O'Riley last nite never been a big fan but he was spot on #NEVERHILLARY
here that Trump
I wanted this guy #RandPaul for #POTUS.
@satin_silkn @RandPaul TELL THAT TO THE #CLINTONS
Tell that to the DOJ and FBI. They seem frightened of the Clintons
Please tell that to the F B I and the C I A Rand Paul they seem to have Forgotten the pledge they took To uphold the law so help me
YES
Then why are you against gay people getting married if everyone should be treated the same under the law? Same @GOP crap.
he is so right,the Clintons have some kind of power to get away with any charges
Can you be dump Trump surrogate? He is not will to learn. Too bad for a person who is running for the POTUS.
--how about everybody should obey the law. Remove color. A crime is a crime, by whom is a secondary statistic
should be our GOP nominee. He could have beaten Hillary and united our country. Trump is set up to lose and divide.
Except when requiring a photo ID. Only then is it discriminatory...
too bad that doesn't apply to the Clintons.
@veganvecoh @RandPaul   Very idealistic but has that ever happened in history?
@HessionPari  I support this man. That is exactly how I feel. Amen.
@grege1953 @RandPaul why didn't y'all allow him more time to speak?
Thank you for your boldness. Great interview. It's starting to go viral.
that is right-- one law for all!
maybe Rand needs to spend a night in the hood. Rich folks are a protected species by the law.
we are not a country of laws but rather a country subject to the power of those who constitute the system
Tell it to the DOJ Rand
unless your names Clinton, something needs to be done about their corruption
when will appeals start coming from racketeering criminals wanting new trials because they impose the Clinton defense?
WHERE THE HELL IS THIS LAW??  CROOKED CLINTON'S CONVENIENCE HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT ABOVE THE DAM LAW THAT'S OUT THERE?,???
Rand you need to contact #JulianAssange @wikileaks Help prosecut #ClintonFoundation #CriminalHillary
pure naked Truth
so why can we use NY state investigators inquire into Clinton Foundation wherever foundation is registered
. How did the clintons ever get into office then?
politician get away with breaking the law and lying to all who vote
that means both politician and non politician @HillaryClinton
just saw your interview on FoxNews! Rand Paul I think you're awesome! # Clintons4Jail     #WakeUpAmerica  #NeverKillary
even HRC!  #hillaryforprison
Randy, you're so right about Hillary. Please do whatever you can to bring her to justice. Is there anything I can do?
I agree. Senator Rand Paul should work with Guiliani to bring @HillaryClinton to justice.
@realDonaldTrump From day1 happen USA Benghazi was buying weapon from rebels who stollen from Gheddafi Army give 2Syria
Good job Rand!
Cmon Rand
Throughout human history
The rich & powerful have always ruled.
Its just now the curtain is torn
@FoxNews @ItsJustJill @RandPaul
Unless you belong to the Clinton Crime Family or their crooked foundation.
you're a coward
you should have never dropped out of the race. Run independent please.
I'm tired of Hillary getting passes! On every thing! vote Trump!
I agree!
I watched you tonight on Fox and I agree with everything you said, you were so right. Thank you so much.
she lied to congress, smh
@DianaBialkowski @RandPaul 
Amen Dr. Paul!
Clintons dwell in only grey areas.
just who is this guy?
Equal protection under the law.
yeah and then we wake up and realize it's still the same old thing and it's not a bad dream wow
unless you're anchor baby citizen?
Unless you are the Clinton's, whom appear to be above the law.
He is absolutely correct & @HillaryClinton should have to go to #Prison like everyone else who breaks the law
@rosalokey @RandPaul Whether you are rich or poor is nice to have money.
I agree but I will not retweet a Fox post.
and when do you predict that will happen? You guys in Senate hate Trump so much your going to leg HRC skate!
Even if your name IS Clinton! #LockHerUp #Treason #NeverForget
************ Why is Rand Paul the only politician who understands the Constitution? ***************
Everyone? #DNC
ENOUGH SAID!!
Dems are not being held accountable...corrupt prez, DOJ, IRS, etc
But remember, Rand, the law doesn't apply to the Clintons!
this presidential race misses you, the only sensible, smart, incorruptible leader this country actually needs. #comeback
But they are not randy
And you both know how false that is in this country.
well, 'cause that is the law.
Mr. Paul, you are correct & I enjoyed your comments on The Kelly File this evening! Now let's elect Trump for our next President!
Sadly, there have been many examples of that not applying to Democrat politicians associated with this administration.
just run Rand!  Please!  We need you!!!  This election is a #joke Please run!  #weneedrand
In which category does HC fall?
Typical politician... We know all that... Your solution is???
@FoxNews @RandPaul
Unless your last name is Clinton!
: AMEN It's way past time for HRC et al to answer for their actions
our justice system is corrupt! And our senators aren't stopping them!
@FoxNews @RandPaul
Damn -- ya think??
Rand nailed it tonight he was dead on! We need rand helping trump more! Keep fighting for the people! We must limit GOV!
that's a new concept.
Yes they should. But sometimes in some places they aren't which is very wrong.
look  @MarthaStewart she didn't get any preferential treatment.
the rich and powerful play with different rules. Tell this to Lynch and Clintons.
#stillranding #StandWithRand Rand Paul 2020
will it hasn't been that way buba.
You need to be campaigning for Trump he is our nominee, step up.
Please endorse #TeamGov @GovGaryJohnson @GovBillWeld
then go after the Clintons and show the American people they are not untouchable
Hillary thinks she is. #TooBigToJail
But who makes the law?
Everybody except the Oligarchy!
Could you please tweet or post on FB the video of this interview?
That's right &when trump incited violence against Hillary he should be arrested like any criminal.Christie should eat him
I agree and so often are not.
/that's truly righteous. .just like the law..you know war is against the law too!
yet you befuddle me in support of Trump instead of @GovGaryJohnson
The law should be, "Be good."
no shit
I agree.
Always liked you Raul Paul even if you are republican. Won't hold against you.
oh really, not according to hillary, if you have money or power laws don't apply
Thank you!! But you know that rational thought and common sense have no place in this situation. LOL
u had ur chance but u blew it so now its time to go back home and do whatever it is u do. Nobody cares what u think.
Amen! Amen! Amen!!!
However complicated and diverse our laws are?  Gross quote.
... That will never happen.
so affirmative action, safe spaces in college, over representation of Jews in Ivy League and general hatred of white MC?
You are correct.
[Hollywoodkc27LIVE's podcast] IF YOUR BACKING HILLARY WE GOT OUR [...]
Please continue to tell the public about Hillary because many many many people don't know about these
Even Hillary?
taxpayers.  Please fight for us.  I have supported you
and now it is time for you to support what you believe in.
It is important to show everyone in government that we
mean business.  The Clinton's have taken advantage of all
amen
be taken to court and sent to prison.  Please gather other
senators and force the big boys to bring her to court/justice
Nobody should get a Get out of Jail Free card, not even the Clintons.
Don't confuse equal with equality. We all deserve individual respect & equal opportunity is fair competition
Of course @catoletters likes this tweet. Rand is talking about equality under the law.
hahaha so subtle I almost missed it...
Mr. Paul:  I want to tell you I am so proud of you for going on  O'Riley and talking about Hillary Clinton.  She should
So demands the 14th Amendment.  Have no idea what your rights are?  Thank a school that has dumped American Govt studies.
forget gay lesbian trans
Finally RP.  You did something that makes sense
In the political realm, what ought to be, and what it needs to be, is hard comprise.
OK hold on. You're talking about someone who boarded lots of airplanes on behalf of the USA so a little forgiveness pls.
You should be telling this every day, every place you can.
Go get 'em Rand! HRC and her minions should not be above the law.
Why couldn't this be our President.....
Where is you political clout when it comes to the Washington elite on their crimes and corruption? Where is the justice?
@alllibertynews @FoxNews @RandPaul There is no justice within a corrupted institution.
Then Hillary at the least should be fined and denied security clearance
not Hillary she's above the law and just wait till she's in the white house if she gets there she needs to be locked up
