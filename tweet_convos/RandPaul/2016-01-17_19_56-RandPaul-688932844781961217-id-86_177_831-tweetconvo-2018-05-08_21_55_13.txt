@zuranumo @RandPaul, no that's trumps clan. U have the same rights as I do. Have u seen https://youtu.be/HqV5eobq65I  or
@zuranumo @_JeremyR_ interesting. You know that racist you were referring to? He OPPOSES private prisons. You're thinking of Rubio.
@zuranumo @StephensonOhio  we are totally against that, it's horrible, drug laws are BS.  It all comes down from the state, ie government.
@zuranumo @StephensonOhio, Ron Paul has been saying legalize all drugs for 30yrs, ran for pres in 88, 08 & 12
@RandPaul ,  what a great president and first lady
@RandPaul in Scotland here, when is the republican debate or have I missed it already and is there a link?
@delboy1978uk @RandPaul he doesn't attend those since he was kicked to the kiddie debate @LeslieNeidig
@stephaniemagui4 @RandPaul @LeslieNeidig we're having a similar problem in Scotland regarding the Scottish Green Party  on the BBC
@RandPaul why didn't they have u on last debate?? What I miss & not interested in looking it up,
@tadros_s @RandPaul, they cooked the polls, stalled em, said he didn't qual then brought kaisich out as placeholder. Polls show Rand in 4th
@_JeremyR_ @RandPaul too bad
@RandPaul be Sanders running mate. Race needs a left hander
@RandPaul keep on fighting!
@RandPaul at least the #DemDebate doesn't make me fear muslims & immigrants will be hauled off by goosestepping nationalists.
@RandPaul    You should be embarrassed to comment on the #demdebate,  The GOP debates are like court tv gone bad.    #GOP should take notes.
@RandPaul not sure anyone watched the #DemDebate and I'm a dem. Candidates don't represent my views!
@RandPaul And I don't agree with raising taxes on anyone, especially the middle class
@RandPaul faaantastic! Much better & more truthful than both #DemDebate & #GOPDebate.#StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul has anyone told you that you don't have a chance.  Do you just like wearing the makeup and the attention?
@RandPaul It was great. They talked about real issues and acted like adults. Why Cruz & Rubio are soft on illegals.
@RandPaul Oh, and in the '80s my MOM was in high school
Libertarianism was inverted by Hitler when he audited the German fed and created the gold standard. @RandPaul
@TallKeven @RandPaul is this true if so provide me evidence plzz
@RandPaul no one care rand, tell your dad I said hi.
@RandPaul  Let's shake things up a bit!
@RandPaul would you rather the view of bigotry & false issues of the Republican debates from the junior table? You're in the wrong party.
@RandPaul Tell them to quit using our Constitution and Bill of RIGHTS as toilet paper!
@RandPaul get a Life you couldn't win a breathing contest
@RandPaul omg #tweetstorm shut up!
@RandPaul We want our rights back! Keep fighting for us Rand!
@RandPaul What is wrong with your hair?
@RandPaul thanks for all you do Doc!
@RandPaul your tweets were one of the best things about the debate.
@RandPaul Trolling #DemDebate to drum up support isn't going to improve your poll number. Your team doesn't like you. Switch parties
@RandPaul  Thank you for being the only candidate with integrity that stands for liberty!
@RandPaul randall i like to join YOUR army espetially after what you have said for iran. I say we screw those primatives into the Stone Age
@RandPaul you acted like an immature brat throughout the debate... Very presidential of you
@RandPaul Like the last debate, you are still the winner (via Twitter no less). Stay Gold! https://www.facebook.com/politico/videos/vb.62317591679/10153274526456680/?type=2&theater&notif_t=video_reply â€¦
@RandPaul Stop fighting Hillary except on gun rights. Your attacks should be 9/10 against @SenSanders ,...the real threat. Hillary=washed up
@RandPaul Best thing about tonight's debate was following your tweets about it. #RandRally #winning
@RandPaul the debate was great maybe you need to go back to school and learn more about the world and american to understand the debate
@RandPaul I did, although it wasn't exactly a high hurdle for you. They set the bar pretty damn low!
@RandPaul Now get behind Trump so we can fix this crap.
@RandPaul Thanks.
@RandPaul They were pathetic. I hope the people see that!
@RandPaul watching the republicans debate is like watching animals throw dung at the zoo. So shush and let the adults speak. #DemDebate
@RandPaul nice trollstorm!
You're the only fiscal conservative running, for that you have my respect. You're the least crazy and you have some good points @RandPaul
@RandPaul  Thank you Rand awesome as ever America will be proud to have youso intelligent strong courageous leader thxs Rand #SWR #DemDebate
@RandPaul Thanks for watching the whole #demdebate so we could keep our dinner in our stomachs!
@RandPaul No one forced you to watch it
@RandPaul You made good points all night and then destroyed it with some juvenile snark. 'Tis a shame.
@RandPaul Thank you for taking one for the team!  #StandWithRand
.@randpaul Your input was flatulent as usual. Get some help for your drug problem, it showed towards the end. #DemDebate

@RandPaul No I did not. You're a loser who couldn't even attend last #GOPDebate
@RandPaul stand strong dr paul! America needs you more than ever! I thank you for everything you do to protect all of our rights!
@RandPaul go Rand!
@RandPaul See you at the Iowa Caucus! #RandRally
@RandPaul and the winner of the #DemDebate is Rand Paul!
@RandPaul Stop making sense. You'll stampede the herd.
@RandPaul You can tweet. But you'll never be president. #DemDebate #DebateWithBernie #FeelTheBern #Bernie2016 
@RandPaul You were a lot more fun
@RandPaul very much so. It made watching those idiots tolerable #DemDebate
@RandPaul You're always more entertaining than their lies.
@RandPaul have a great night Rand.
