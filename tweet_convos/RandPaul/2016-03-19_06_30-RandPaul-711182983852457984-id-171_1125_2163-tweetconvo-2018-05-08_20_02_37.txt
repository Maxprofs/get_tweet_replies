@RandPaul @47525fc6c23248c @HillaryClinton I like Senator Paul, he needs to jump on the Trump Train. They have some similar ideas.
@likeitor_lumpit @RandPaul @47525fc6c23248c @HillaryClinton no they're actually complete opposites for the most part.
@milne_caleb @likeitor_lumpit @RandPaul @47525fc6c23248c @HillaryClinton not really Trump just agrees with stuff that gets a applause.
@TimonMOE @milne_caleb @RandPaul @47525fc6c23248c @HillaryClinton 1st of all I said Rand agreed with him not the other way around.
@likeitor_lumpit @TimonMOE @RandPaul @47525fc6c23248c @HillaryClinton waiting on an example
@milne_caleb @TimonMOE @47525fc6c23248c  Google their similarities there are SEVERAL.They agree on a couple issues. Whats the big durn deal?
@likeitor_lumpit @TimonMOE @47525fc6c23248c I have Google it. Rand is a republitarian and trump is a neocon protectionist. Almost opposites
@milne_caleb @TimonMOE @47525fc6c23248c I didnt say they should b running mates. I joked about rand joining Trump team only bc I like him

@RandPaul it is unfortunate Rand, but we have to fight climate change & there are costs that inconvenient truth
@brent_crain19 @alllibertynews , And WE have to battle the stupidity of people like you. That's not cheap either. Climate change is a hoax.
@pixalkiller31 I get its not cheap & that is very unfortunate. I wish it were not changing because of humans
@brent_crain19 , IT'S NOT!!!!
@pixalkiller31 what makes you think it is not? Because all your republican colleagues say so?
@brent_crain19 , Science and common sense. Oh, and good job generalizing, not all climate skeptics are Republican.
