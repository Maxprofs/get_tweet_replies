@RandPaul just for that I gave Bernie $35
@icapturpix I've accepted help from the government and I'm willing to pay taxes to help my fellow citizens. Why aren't you?
@ryantenney not through socialism! I believe in a smaller not larger government! I believe with a small gov and tax burden u won't need help
@icapturpix now I am making money and paying back into the system.
@ryantenney I own a small business and employ 5 people! I pay each of them 75-93k jobs are the best welfare! Again fuck off
@icapturpix I'm sorry you had to start shouting expletives to make your point.
@ryantenney I made my fucking points and if you want to help people donate to the cause don't give it to bloated government!
@RandPaul @SquareCash just donated to Bernie :)
@RandPaul isn't that kind of like socialist welfare? You should offer a product! I will buy it! Let's beat socialism with capitalism!
@RandPaul I wish you were the frontrunner for the gop. The only intelligent candidate. ~ #BernieSanders  supporter
@RandPaul Hahahaha! You ask for a lot of charity for someone who is against socialism.
@RandPaul you are an educated man yet you do not understand democratic socialism ? Wall Street corrupts Not a fan of FDR eh? Or Canada?
@RandPaul Your plan is to defeat socialism…with socialism? "Everybody contribute a little bit and we can achieve a common public good!"
@RandPaul NO
.@RandPaul IRONY METER BROKEN
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Many Rand Paul fans like Bernie. I respected you as well. That respect is gone. The "socialism" scare is a cheap tactic.
@RandPaul @billyboblee310 You are a rich person Doctor Rand Paul.  Please stop begging for money when you are at 4%.  Just stop.
@RandPaul @SquareCash The money can be used to buy guns for shooting gays and non-christians!
@RandPaul @SquareCash if only you could get on your own debate stage... You might not have to tweet during Dems townhall
@RandPaul Id just like you to beat Trumps socialism.
@NHTeaParties @RandPaul can't stump the trump
@RandPaul defeating socialism now a campaign fundraising vehicle.
@RandPaul Defeat Bernie's socialism with your own?
@RandPaul wheeeelp, the fact you're trying to scare the GOP with Bernie instead of Hillary means we're moving forward! #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul Use your own money for the campaign; Make a statement that you can and will not be the entitled one
@RandPaul -You can't do a debate and fight for it, I can't support you and donate to you
@RandPaul When Bernie Sanders is trending the vultures will come out to feed
@RandPaul just donated $35 to Bernie.
@RandPaul it's over rand. Time to call it quits.
@RandPaul The Iraq war has cost 2 TRILLION dollars

Where did America find the money to pay for that http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/5726571/1/ …
@RandPaul @SquareCash We're banding together and combining our resources to defeat. . . socialism?
@RandPaul The big bad socialist is gonna come for you, so give me your $ instead! #DemTownHall
@RandPaul Hell no!
@RandPaul @SquareCash Dude, Bernie is not the problem, get the nomination first.
@RandPaul Way to think big. LMAO.
Give up, Randy ole boy, ur not even 1st on the B team.@RandPaul @RealBillyGrant
.@RandPaul Instead of throwing rocks, you should show up for debates. I appreciate candidates who participate openly.
@RandPaul what will you so with the money?  Aren't you out of the race?
@RandPaul 20.16 contributed to beating socialism!
@RandPaul You're done... Let it go. These immature tweets aren't helping your cause
@RandPaul sorry rand. You're not your dad. We got @BernieSanders now
@RandPaul @SquareCash If you don't own the street to your house you rely on socialism. Standard #GOP fear monger.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul no.
@RandPaul @anythingbutdem Sorry rand I may as well throw a $20 off a bridge
@RandPaul Bunch of ignorant nobodies who don't know what a true patriot is. Rand Paul is a true patriot! Drink some more fluoride sheeple!
@RandPaul There's plenty of socialist roads you can go take a hike on @RandPaul.
@RandPaul @SquareCash

@RandPaul 
Maybe you should try posing with a crucifix while wrapped in a flag. 

@SquareCash
@barentw @RandPaul @ryanbeckwith Charity is superior to socialism
@RandPaul Hitler did not live tweet to beg for money when he invented libertarianism!
@RandPaul @SquareCash You're jumping the gun. You need to be fighting Trump. Are you too afraid to call him on his bullshit?
.@RandPaul best way is to donate to @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul where donate money to help filmmaker of PPvideo?
@RandPaul You strongly remind me of televangelism.
@RandPaul @SquareCash make it a game. Every time he says 'free' donate $2.
Sorry @RandPaul. You're a witty guy, but I'm voting for the candidate that's already winning and self-funded.
@lolitically @RandPaul Voting for somebody because they're winning is a terrible reason; make decisions based on policy
@anESScentualMAN I for the most part agree with the policies of both @realDonaldTrump and @RandPaul. Only one is winning though.
@RandPaul  sit down. You know his policies are what most young people agree with.
@RandPaul You should worry about beating Golden Don before you worry about beating Sanders
@RandPaul Bernie is not a socialist. He is an idiot.
@RandPaul BS and Socialism will be defeated.
@RandPaul go home please!
@RandPaul
@RandPaul How about helping Ted Cruz
That would make two losers.@audinaooc @RandPaul
