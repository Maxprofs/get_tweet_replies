Seriously? @BernieSanders is bragging he has a failing grade on protecting the Bill of Rights #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders still fighting for relevance?
@UrbanChefPDX @RandPaul @BernieSanders you mean rand Paul still fighting for relevance?
@oky13o @RandPaul @BernieSanders yes
@RandPaul @BernieSanders #buzzwords 
For being critical of that, you should know what that means #checkyourself
@RandPaul @BernieSanders on his voting record with the NRA.. I'd be proud of that too.. let's try telling the whole story next time.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders got a D- grade from the NRA.  What guns have to do with education, I don't know...
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Getting a D- from the @NRA is something to be very very proud of #gunsafety @MomsDemand
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Are you still running? Weird, is entirely forgotten about you, like an unfortunate case of gas.
Yea, if the faculty is made up of @nra goons. It would be like if you were graded on women's health issues.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Way to stick to the issues and not use meaningless party rhetoric. Jackass.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders D- from the NRA... Last I checked, they were not in or mentioned in Constitution! #GOPLogic Try again Rand.
@RandPaul yeah @BernieSanders  bragged about how the NRA feels about his record on guns...but keep posting snarky tweets for republican RTs
@RandPaul is bragging that they allow him to watch the #GOPDebate
@RandPaul I thought you dropped out of the presidential election @BernieSanders might be able to teach you a thing about staying in the race
@RandPaul Go to sleep old man.
@RandPaul @shad39 @BernieSanders   I heard him bragging about getting a D- from NRA... That has nothing to do w/Education.

#TeamMarco
@RandPaul @BernieSanders hey thats a good joke for a 6th grader Randy
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Two great things!  Are you actually saying it is a bad thing that Bernie wants to fix education? #DebateWithBernie
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @BernieSanders  #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders That would be bad if the NRA were education experts, but they are not. Funny Joke. But why not be meaningful Rand?
@randpaul @berniesanders Can't be too shocked by liberals and their logic probably mad he didn't get an F
@RandPaul @BernieSanders What does it say about a candidate that has to bend the truth to get elected?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders says the guy who would fail environmental science.
@RandPaul @fardinajir @BernieSanders I hope he doesn't plan to fix our education like his wife Jane Sanders fixed Burlington College.
@RandPaul @fardinajir @BernieSanders Now there's a scary thought.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders he gets a big fat F in economics.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Ummmm, yes...who awards you the D+ matters.  I'm happy to fail the "who's the biggest sellout to the gun lobby"
@RandPaul @News3LV @BernieSanders failing grade from the NRA. If you are going to troll at least do it right
@RandPaul @BernieSanders its the NRA. They aren't trustworthy.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders A D- from the NRA who refuses any sort of discussion of gun regulation whatsoever?  I'll take that anyday
@RandPaul @BernieSanders just omit anything that gives it context Mr Paul...at least you're true to form #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul @BernieSanders nice one but if the NRA doesn't like him the Dems will like him more
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Once again you're showing the limited abilities of your mind. #halfwit
@RandPaul you are a turd
@RandPaul Good bc Rep just cut it. @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders the grade was given to him by a corrupt organization the NRA. The NRA does not represent the Bill of Rights.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie is a statist socialist and will destroy America. I #StandWithRand #DemocraticDebate  #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders is this sarcasm I hope? Cause if it is you funny  #whoknew #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Your idea on tuition, paying off the principle on taxes instead of the interest and online courses needs resonating
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @shelbyreasor D- grade from the NRA is something to be DAMN PROUD of.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders That's a stupid comment.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders also misleading, that was a @NRA grade.
@K_Schallhorn @RandPaul @BernieSanders guns are the only thing Dems want everyone to get an F on.  That, and Right to Life.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders He also got a D- in economics
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Kudos! Way to dumb down the conversation #SMDH
.@RandPaul @BernieSanders #demdebate. Dr Paul this isn't a GOP debate. Immature digs say more about you then Sanders.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders ha! D- from the NRA is an A+ from humanity. 2nd Amendment included.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders MIT has homeschooled professors and MIT also accepts homeschooled students.http://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/homeschool …
@RandPaul @BernieSanders #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders well a D- by the NRA sounds like a solid A+ to a lot of Americans ! Gun owners and not.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders and to people abroad. Such as me.
@RandPaul So you're saying an A is always better than a D, no matter what the source? No wonder the #GOP is trying to get an A from the KKK.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders that #d- represents a lot of respect for his constituents, 2ndamndmt, the #constitution, &the threat of #tyrrany
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Hillarys voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard
@RandPaul @BernieSanders because a grade in supporting the NRA and public education are the same how...?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders #RandRally
#DemDebate @RandPaul Ky Moms wonder when gun laws will protect people #GunsInAmerica #NotOneMore #NoMoreSilence https://www.facebook.com/carolyn.halcomb/posts/972778569465213?pnref=story …
@RandPaul ON GUNS YOU NITWIT, D- ON GUNS. @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders because they are the same thing?  You are being goofy
@RandPaul @BernieSanders speaking out from the kids table, I see
@RandPaul Would you be proud to have a D- on abortion rights? Come on..
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Missed you in the last debate Dr. Paul!
@Packer_Freedom @RandPaul @BernieSanders You mean Rand vs. Bernie?
@Packer_Freedom @RandPaul @BernieSanders Would LOVE to see it!
@RandPaul Fits his position, don't agree with the guy, but he's honest
@RandPaul @BernieSanders lmaooo a D- from the NRA is like a B+ at being a decent person 
@RandPaul @BernieSanders US Education: Sinking since the government took it over. http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/results/summary.aspx …
Oh @RandPaul make the kiddie table debate, then we'll talk @BernieSanders  #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul @BernieSanders did he say "grade" or "rating"? Are we watching the same show?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders the one thing I agree with Gingrich on. "If Sanders wins republicans will Cary about 46 states"
@RandPaul does this logic actually work with your supporters? C'mon. You're better than that.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Scary that if dearly departed Hugo Chavez were on the DNC debate stage, there would still be applause!
@RandPaul is curmudgeoning around somewhere cursing trump but I like who he got to run his Twitter feed #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders 
Bernie is extremely stupid
@RandPaul @BernieSanders #DemDebate Rand Paul is jealous that he didn't make the first string..cry baby..
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Paul honey, I think we all know that no one wants an A+ grade from the NRA (or do you want that?Be in their pocket)
.@RandPaul @BernieSanders bragged about getting a D- from The NRA. Tell the whole story or shut up. No one wants to hear your propaganda
@RandPaul That's cheap and beneath you.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Your comments are irrelevant Dr. Paul.
@RandPaul give it upRP. Nobody cares what you think
@RandPaul not how that works, dude.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders We all know how the NRA grades work. Give it a break

Stick a fork in your campaign @RandPaul, it's done ... @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders It's feels before reals. Which explains why the facts are against bigger government yet they still support it.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Pretty out of context, Rand. He said he got a D- from the NRA, not in school.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Really? That is your argument? No wonder you were left on the main stage
@RandPaul @BernieSanders why are you attacking them? you should work first to get your numbers up in your own country.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders was that D- in economics?

@RandPaul @BernieSanders but he dies promote not suing gun dealers.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders isn't the POTUS sworn to uphold the constitution? Just not the 2nd amendment?
