@RandPaul some of those whose votes you seek actually like the high number of African Americans in prison.
@adamannapolis @RandPaul no they don't you don't know what your talking about. We incarsinate more people than 10 countries together dipshit
@JoeDeMello @RandPaul so you disagree, so eloquently, with the idea that there are people who have no issue with blacks getting jailed?
@adamannapolis @RandPaul yes there is a issue with white black green yellow don't matter the race we incarsinate intirely too many ppl
@JoeDeMello @RandPaul and Paul has astutely pointed out the high percentage of blacks compared to others
@adamannapolis @RandPaul ya no shit dude but r u trying to make a point ur what? And stop trying to use such big words u sound stupid
@JoeDeMello @RandPaul you have misspelled tons of words, and you want to call me out for sounding stupid? Bye genius.
@RandPaul FBI, CIA Homeland Security have all gotten too big for any politician to dare decrease their budget or attempt to regulate them
@RandPaul So trust states to rig the system and deny people their rights?
@Lark_Alexandre @RandPaul The best way to expose ignorance is to allow States to take responsibility for their actions. I #StandWithRand
@former_democrat @RandPaul No one has to expose ignorance, it's clear across the US. If it were up to states, slavery would still be a thing
@Lark_Alexandre @former_democrat @RandPaul no it wouldn't. Slavery is a crime committed by all races/civilizations. Society evolves if lead.
@RandPaul @Real_Syrian_Rev Dont forget to add foreign policy to that list.
@RandPaul sad to see this one out
@RandPaul thank you for being one of the few GOP candidates speaking on this issue.

But most of all: on *every aspect* of immigration... @RandPaul
@RandPaul Like how they don't go to jail when they break the law.
@RandPaul 
Criminal justice often sides with the criminals who can afford the best defense; who sway with  clients, aware of the real truth.
@RandPaul Gays hate christians!!!!
@RandPaul they are hardened and perverted  as they come..they border on sociopathic means to get what they want..their perverted lust begets

@RandPaul no truer words spoken..esp in small towns !!!
@RandPaul We need to end the destructive War on Drugs and decriminalize non-narcotic drugs (marijuana). Our government is destroying lives.
@RandPaul I like your ideas on foreign policy. I would be able to trust my government if it wasn't owned by corporations.
@RandPaul Both parties are more interested in power than the people and/or their liberty.
@RandPaul Way to stand for liberty and Bill of Rights !  I think you may be the only candidate serious about cutting spending.
@RandPaul I saw you live online, and I liked what you said on foreign policy and spending.  I wish other candidates would listen to you !
@RandPaul #StandWithRand
@RandPaul  Distrust abundance and all needs fixed thoroughly Rand is that fix couldnt ask for a better time we need Rand #StandWithRand
@RandPaul Be skeptical of ALL government. Distrust until proven worthy. Just like the IRS, you are guilty until proven innocent.
@RandPaul would not ban #FreeSpeech #encryption tools like @ICLOAK Messages! FREE for all http://ICLOAK.me/im 
@RandPaul how about abolishing private prison first?
@RandPaul Say it loudly!
@RandPaul I just asked Foxnews why they don't include Rand Paul, are they afraid of him?
@RandPaul people who distrust the justice system are the same ones who can't figure out how to not point weapons at cops.
@RandPaul oh trust me. WE ARE!!!!!
.@RandPaul Xlate: But I think big government is fine in foreign policy and war.
@PoliticalXlate @RandPaul Then Hillary Jeb Cruz Sanders Rubio or Trump should be your pick. I #StandWithRand
@RandPaul @justinamash and EVERYTHING ELSE which they do outside the Constitution of these united States.
@RandPaul I think people are simply distrustful of our current Government, PERIOD.
Distrustful re regulations, the plutocracy legislates unfettered capitalism on steroids rather than a balance that works for all.@RandPaul
Are you Suggesting- the Game is Not Rigged & people actually have a right to be free?? Dam That's Funny! @RandPaul

@RandPaul @Velcro108 I'm just going to lock myself in a closet and not come out
@RandPaul, we need a humble government that questions its ability to run other countries.
@RandPaul We do not Trust politicians.
@RandPaul Especially if they don't indict and try Hillary "The Exposer" Clinton!
@RandPaul yes....the paperwork is most likely  tampered with and false info on it.....time to repent...
@RandPaul I don't mind taxes and as long as it's fair, but I do distrust the criminal justice system
@RandPaul Big Gov.is ran by a few.
@RandPaul yes because we all want massive amounts of Lead in our water!!!
@49Westend @RandPaul  Our Governor is a Businessman who gave a buddy power over flint, that's what you get voting for a Businessman.
@ReaganHentschel @RandPaul Unbelievable that this could happen in America
@RandPaul agreed!
@RandPaul AMEN DR. PAUL!
@RandPaul when it comes to money not going into your pocket or being take out of your pocket is what normal people understand and care for.
