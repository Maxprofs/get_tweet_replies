@RandPaul does that mean you'll reject @realDonaldTrump as #GOP nominee? If not, you're just spewing BS.
@RandPaul you stand with trump...ugh
@RandPaul I can't. I'm so disappointed that you are supporting Trump. You were one of my favorites.
We need @RandPaul as part of a #Trump administration cabinet.
@freedom3556 #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #trump2016
@RandPaul @courtchauncey No Mr Paul, you have largely disappointed us, supporting Trump over basic conservative values.
@RandPaul Thank you Dr. Paul

@RandPaul By ENDORSING TRUMP?
@RandPaul What would you people want him to do? Back Hillary? Back Romney the Quitter? Trump may have a mouth, but he's our last shot.
@RandPaul sad and disappointed that you are backing Trump
@reneecjones10 @alllibertynews @RandPaul Don't be. It's Rand's time&the can't be marginalized when HRC runs&2016 US bleeds on so many fronts
@RandPaul Is it possible that you can write the new healthcare bill to repeal ACA the day Donald is sworn in? It needs to be started NOW.
@RandPaul Ive tweeted this to @SpeakerRyan as well for him to write it. Whatever is done must be started now. If HRC wins, ACA stays.
@RandPaul @SpeakerRyan but we must be ready to repeal in Jan, not wait til Jan to write a Bill that'll get signed a yr later
@RandPaul @SpeakerRyan I know it isn't going to be easy but it must be started now
@RandPaul Seriously you just said you support @realDonaldTrump. A little contradiction there.
@RandPaul You betrayed your ideals-was it ego/political ambition that kept you from endorsing Cruz? You&your ilk are culpable in loss of US
You are very brave to make such a controversial declaration! @RandPaul
@RandPaul I'm hoping that you are the one he's talking about for possible VP...Differences aside, I think you'd make a great team!
@RandPaul see #vaxxed, reaction is welcome, our children are more valuable than pharma Profit agenda via Offit, hear before CDC "fixes"

@RandPaul
@RandPaul well clearly this is bs because you endorsed @realDonaldTrump
@RandPaul How can you say that while supporting Donald Trump?
@RandPaul Good statement of a politician with his own mind and ideals. Sometimes we have to rethink his statements twice.
@RandPaul That's the plan @KILLTarango
@forrest_fire1 @RandPaul he is not vocal enough on prohibition of marijuana for recreational use. i am a rand man all the way.
@RandPaul nothing on religious freedom?
@RandPaul and the useless drug war.
@RandPaul you would be 10/10 if you supported bringing snowden home with no charges and a parade.
@RandPaul I don't always agree with Sen. Paul but I hope he runs again in 2020 to bring some sanity back to the party
@AdderAllStar @RandPaul 100%agree!
@LauraHenning12 @RandPaul I'm kind of a Dem in fact but out of everyone who ran, Sanders would've been my first choice and Paul my second
