@RandPaul then drop out and endorse @tedcruz
@IkeWingate You'd have to be ignorant, dumb, blind and mentally retarded to believe CRUZ is an advocate of liberty. What A FOOL you are.
@CMartinXII tell me how you really feel. How about some proof to your point, Mr. Troll?
@IkeWingate Only ignorant morons who have no real clue what they're discussing use terms like "troll" without any factual backing.
@CMartinXII you and your 2 followers. You are the definition of a troll. Bye
@IkeWingate Nobody has to have followers or even use twitter that much to reply to someone as ignorant as you, Ike the dike.
@RandPaul You are happy to trade the liberty of women to choose abortions. @margokingston1
@SandraEckersley @RandPaul @margokingston1 you can insist all you like, but at the end of the day you don't have a right to murder
@SandraEckersley @RandPaul @margokingston1 I suggest you educate yourself to exactly what a "right" is before you use the term.
@ScottGadille What next? Lock up unwilling mothers during pregnancy to ensure they deliver healthy babies for others? No freedom. @RandPaul
@SandraEckersley @RandPaul what next? You could start with making coherent responses.
@ScottGadille @RandPaul Men have no say in how women decide pregnancies. It is something WOMEN decide.
@RandPaul @solomon_ann Rand Paul a man of Integrity for staying in Senate.
I will now support @SenTedCruz
#CruzCrew
@mckalip @RandPaul @solomon_ann @SenTedCruz I would love to see Rand Paul endorse Ted Cruz now that he is no longer running.
@klshrews2 @TigerTownBaby @mckalip @RandPaul  @SenTedCruz  i doubt he will he is mad because cruz didn't vote on the audit fed vote.
@elsworthroy @TigerTownBaby @mckalip @RandPaul @SenTedCruz I hope it dawns on them that we have to unite!
@RandPaul you traded your pride when attacking Trump on TPP when he was correct, & you later admitted to Ingraham you never even read it

@RandPaul Honest, good constitutional understanding & positional arguments, caring. You are the best of the gop, Rand.
@RandPaul @NeilWMcCabe Bravo
@RandPaul many thanks for standing 4 awesome principles. best wishes from germany.
@RandPaul Why did you suspend your campaign? Its too early!

Paul is too grass roots committed to the constitution which is why too many oppose him. I respect the hell out of him, personally

#StandWithRand #LibertyRevolution
@RandPaul third party run?
@RandPaul: stop talking schmack about @tedcruz&concentrate on eliminating @realDonaldTrump. You s/b working together fighting establishment
@RandPaul Hitler didn’t trade his Liberty when he invented libertarianism.
@RandPaul Its time for you to bow out gracefully.
@RandPaul To bad you equate liberty to being able to take psychotropic drugs.
@RandPaul Love it when educated people deliberately use bad grammar to seem "folksy". Not obvious at all.
@RandPaul once all the immigrants realize Ted CRUZ is not going to save them or bring their parents to usa they will vote differently
@RandPaul @tedcruz continues on @FoxNews to beat the war drums. It's time to stop sending our kids over there to that Neverending war.
@RandPaul what about for titties? I'd trade my liberty for titties
@RandPaul I think many of those sad faces would trade a little liberty for a hot shower, warm meal & a comfortable bed.
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  NOT NOW NOT EVER U !!U HERE THAT WASHINGTON HILLARY #STANDWITHRAND
