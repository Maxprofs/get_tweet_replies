@GotchYaSon I wud recommend US stop all arms deal including the under table ones with Iran which is killing Syrians. Right?
Absolutely.
@GinferMagi5876 But it was passed arms deal to Saudi Arabia $ 15 billion Fuck
Obama may be preaching 'tough love' to Saudi – but arms sales tell another story
Dr Rand, can you explain, why we selling arms to Iran in first place. Is that because they want to kill Jews, & Americans. What?
SIGNED & RT

@GotchYaSon If US govt is tailing Al Qaeda masterminds of Sep/11, they are secretly hiding in the Satanic republic of Iran.

how about we take that 1.15B and form a new contract with Colt or Rock Island Armory to replace out out of date Beretta M9s.
GREAT JOB! Glad you are keeping your word to the party. Shows you are smarter you are than a few others! Your young, who knows?
if they don't buy from us they will from China or Russia. Why not have U.S. make the money and maybe a little influence
Thank you.
@justonepatriot Good, you do it Senator Paul! Stop it, stop arming our enemys.
Many are watching the people that ran. Next few years will fly by & 1 of you will appear as strong prez. Loyal to party a must.
@nas_malek just ask @POTUS not to give these BS #UN speeches when American weapons sales create Radicals&Refugees
Despite '28 pages' release, Saudi's 9/11 involvement still buried
@shupe_laura @RandPaul @nypost We will never find out the real story or full truth of 9/11/01

#conspiracy

Since 2009, the Obama admin has facilitated more than $115b in 42 different arms sales 2 Saudi Arabia, more than other U.S. admin
@GotchYaSon Can you just clarify or justify how the greatest nation on this planet pay ransom for Iran to release US hostages???
@GotchYaSon Mr. Paul at least we can say, Saudi Arabia is siding with Syrian people whilst Iran, Russia and USA are killing them!

For the love of everything that is America... WHY DID YOU DROP OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE?
@missjo1964 Yea Rand Paul , enough is enough. He arms them, while he cuts out military to nothing !!!
help with this bullshit #kratom ban, talk about shady shit
agreed. Sell the weapons to us. We will use them only for peace and happiness.
Thank you senator Paul
why don't you stop the $38 billion to your master Israel. Don't be a hypocrite @magsagain2
@ViPearson If this guy's against it; it's probably something necessary. #DoYourJob  #ZikaVirus
 #PHilososauR is on it
I wanted you to be my President. But I'll settle for you being Secretary of State.
would if I weren't so scared the fbi would come after me for apposing the governments wishes. Scary times we're heading n 2.
Probably one of the few things I can agree with you on.
@LoveIsCool But we have to support our military industrial complex so they can continue donating to both parties.
Need to block Obama's give away of the internet, too.
even if you disagree with his ideology (which I do vehemently) rand Paul is correct here. Citizens need to sign this
Join me & millions of Americans who need a fully staffed #SCOTUS Can U help us?
no we should not sell that to them now!
this is not the first time we have sold arms to Saudi interests. Where were you on this for the past several decades? Politics.
stop the arm sale for the saudis
more power to you senator! Don't forget saudis are good buddies with Pakistan. That's the hot bed of everything islamofascism!
How is this Obama's deal when we've been supplying Saudi Arabia, mostly under the GOP, for decades?
join 80% of Americans in opposing $38 BILLION to #apartheid israel.
@BernieOrBustLA By the way Rand, why did the State Dept tell you not to talk to me when you were in Guatemala.
@BernieOrBustLA Not only Saudi deal, let's stop the $39 bil. Israeli arms deal too.
Saudi Arabia destroy my country,




You are the best republican right now.
one of the few good republicans. Stay good rand
@KyleKulinski Honestly if he was the repub nominee AND maybe if the justice seats weren't on the line. I would've voted for him
Saudi should protect themselves.
Of course $25 million or more Saudis gave to Clinton foundation has nothing to do with this, right?
Rand is the only truth in Washington.
@KyleKulinski thank you for being a republican that makes some god damn sense.
are you going to block the $38Billion to Israel too?
Perfect ... Thats the humanity service
thank you rand. After trump we need to to be president
@KyleKulinski Can we add opposing Obamas $38 billion aid package to Israel to that?
TEHY GO FOR RULE NUMBER 3 @realDonaldTrump @VP @ASavageNation @seanhannity @AlexCapitalista
