The FBI then announced she would face no charges. This is an outrage and the rule of law has been turned upside down.
This weekend, we learned former President Clinton met with the Obama Administration Attorney general - the FBI director's boss - in private.
Three days later the FBI director announces no charges are being brought against Hillary Clinton.
The appearance is terrible. The decision is astounding. Ppl have gone to jail for less severe classified breaches and national security.
Today Comey & Obama's DOJ made it clear to the American people there's no accountability no justice & the Clintons live by different rules.
This is a loss for the rule of law and further degrades Americans' faith in the justice system.
not its not , it was careless , not criminal and get with the facts please
@Frappingline @HillaryClinton ...and so she will be Prez & repubs will support her
@Gumball55668882 @HillaryClinton

#neverhillary #RiggedSystem #trumptrain #heswithus https://youtu.be/WjUmj_4ejOk 
I agree
@Wriseup @HillaryClinton it's far less relevant than planning on 'attacking Iran', isn't it? This would endanger national security
Stand by you words. Now now than ever. If it makes you feel better, put a Hillary mask on Trump
Poor boy! Fixated on a nonissue.
Remove her security clearance immediately. She cannot be trusted.
And p.p.s. Rand, you are backing a pres candidate who is 'recklessly endangering national security'. So SHUT UP.
@kohlweiler @HillaryClinton we have not heard from the majority of your party Sir? why is that? why was HRC permitted to ?
@NatShupe @HillaryClinton FBI also re-wrote the law to get HRC off the hook. Corruption run amuck!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton
@Patriot_MM @HillaryClinton which in and of itself is a felony... #RiggedElection
Like anyone gives a shit what a loser like you thinks. You couldn't even beat the worst candidate of all time.
аnd still walks free
who gave the #FBI a bribe
why dont we ask wet willy
get her!!
Trump/Rand 2016
you would be a great v.p. atty general or supreme court swallow your pride and get with trump if Hillary gets in
why is the Republican party silent on this? Ryan denounces trump rather than address this. It's abhorrent
Comey suggested that Clinton basically have her security clearance revoked, will Lynch follow that recommendation?
let the people decide on her prosecution release all the emails.. #randpaulwritein2016
@elisamich0422 @HillaryClinton ...and then told the American people they didn't give a damn.
#StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016

@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton Trump has violated pretty much all of the 10 , Commandments... Where is that outrage? #Hypocrite
Trump's 10 Commandments

You lost - she won. Nobody cares what you think. Get over it
today we officially turned into a banana republic
@grannygethealth @HillaryClinton

Crimal HClinton pardoned by criminally incompetent FBI head.
Yeah, what's up with REPUBLICAN FBI Director James Comey? Hahaha!
How many times did Gen Patreus? Was he prosecuted? HE WAS? I don't understand. @TimothyLShull @HillaryClinton
What a shame she still gets away with stuff. God is watching, The care less women
Yes but since Soros pulls the strings you'll all just blow smoke and do nothing still.......
@catoletters -Yeh-suck it up!!
@BlueMaze @HillaryClinton yet our lawmakers, House of Representatives do nothing to stop it. We are powerless, thanks.
Thats the normal for Clintons
@Charswebs @HillaryClinton which means Hillary is unfit to be POTUS
@Cory_1077 @rachel_heil And now she flys around in Air Force 1 with #POTUS who should b at work for us & she flys around on us
if she broke the law the others did too. Why are we only trying to hold her responsible?
Here is the law she broke. Clear as day it says negligence. Nothing about intent.
Republican Accusers exonerated her! @FBI Clears her of GOP Conspirers!
Now stop your Whining-#GOPFail
cut out the witch hunt Rand Paul, move on, let it go.... breathe...
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton 
But she's #TooBigToJail?
#HillNo #corrupt #ObamaLegacy #WorstPresidentInHistory #tcot
Straight from the horse's mouth http://lsh.re/14F2Z  (insight by http://commun.it )
@amandayeah91 check out this new WH staff using unsecured phones and emails. Okay if Republicans do it? Double standard!
I believe there won't be any more elections I think we will have some sort of red guard on the streetsnoconstitutn
@USAHipster @HillaryClinton 
NEWS FLASH, LOL
.@RandPaul @chevalier__noir Obama carries a special high security BlackBerry. She CHOSE not to use one. Senate can ask why. @GOP
@AIDF911 @HillaryClinton "Recklessly," or DELIBERATELY? #HillaryForPrison
Sir, HRC cannot get away w/ this.  PLEASE do everything to ensure justice is served. YOU are the BEST one to see this is done.
must've  been some talk about Golf and grandchildren on plane to get to the director to not press any charges.
No charges = Clinton and DOJ collusion. It's a vile invention the D party. Soldiers died, No shame.
@snoopsquirrely @HillaryClinton    She gets away with murder... She has no shame. No conscience. She has nothing... But Lucifer
@sareed59 @HillaryClinton @LorettaLynch @FBI So felony laws can be broken without consequence according to the FBI
the Clinton cartel strikes again! She could club babies in the streets and libs would cheer with joy.
@NatShupe @HillaryClinton
has made us a corrupt banana republic. Actually it's an insult to banana republics to compare us to one.
the real question Dr. Rand Paul is What are you going to do about it?
sad day for America and the rule of law. If I didn't intend to speed will I still have to pay the fine.
@RalphSchiano @HillaryClinton Contradictory how Comey stated "She should have known better" then recommends no charges be laid.
-Time for congress to investigate subject matter of these "Meetings" between Obama/Comey &Bill/Lynch
And then she wonders why people don't trust her.
corrupt politicians always walk
Come on Rand.  Hold these above the law elites to the fire.  Too close to a full-on Banana Republic!
Hillary is so fucking corrupt it's scary o think she could be the next president. Trump really needs to win.
aweful she gets away with this?
they still let her off the hook. Our gov is incompetent our FBI is incompetent. stand against the corruption of our federal gov!
@NatShupe Butt........
Rand, just do us all favor & punch Trump in the mouth. p.s. So we were attacked because of the emails? Oh, wait...
Trump IS THE ISIS CANDIDATE, The lord of the lies will be an asset for them.

Donald is a joke
Tell your buddies to quit supporting her and unite behind nominee elected fairly by the people.
@kenlweb36 @HillaryClinton Doesn't matter anymore, Yesterday Hillary infected America with injustice because she's Above the Law
@ajelliottjr @RandPaul @kenlweb36 @HillaryClinton i believe what comes around goes around her day will come soon in gods eyes
@eyi_rick @HillaryClinton
@tthomaslew76 @HillaryClinton So what are you gonna do about it? I used to be a Dem...Now I'm too disgusted...have no party
@Cory_1077 @JamesComeyFBI is supposed to be standing tall for the judiciary committee this morning. Go ask him why he bitched up.
espionge and gross interpretation of the freedom of information act
@mrjorgemtz @HillaryClinton and according to Comey there was no intent which means she's just stupid then.
should the next POTUS be that negligent?
@mitchwinn42 @HillaryClinton they also said that Rand spent a lot of money to whine on a podium and receive a whole 2% of votes.
"9......11"
@BradleyWasson @HillaryClinton Time for you, Dr Paul, to get behind @realDonaldTrump so we can beat #crookedhillary & save us
in comparison to Snowden Paul's stance seems incongruent with his values - imp
Lying under oath....no charges? disgusting.
Not only that.. she was warned and kept going.. thousands of emails.
calling out the shots!
@BennyOlson14 @hovdenick the sad government we have to live with. #democRATS #TrudeauForAmerica
the pitchforks are getting ready.  Many americans are pissed.

this is an outrage! She needs to be put in prison! Rand Paul im scared what this country is becoming. :(
comey & lunch should resign quickly. Crooked. Made a deal. Clinton faces cameras & ppl w/o flinching. So bad.
I and your father are great people and Americans but loosen your tie and act like a regular Joe reach out to trump
and....was not criminally negligible...WTF!!!  My head hurts
@Charlie4Trump @HillaryClinton that only makes it official - she is now fully qualified to b potus by current standards
.@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Well that's not exactly true. Of all 2016 GOP crop I thought you would be the last to sacrifice your honor
And they won't prosecute even though intent is not required by the statute Comey quoted.
maybe Bill promised her address to. Still can't believe the director of the FBI I won't press charges
RANDDO SOMETHING ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF WHIMPY
dude I bielived in u why haven't bring censure or impeachment stop ttp and bring in a bill to end the war on drugs
Yep! Double standards!! One for the elite and one for the rest!! Strip Hillaries Security Clearance immediately!
and yet what is our government doing about the obvious corruption we saw today
They rigged the elections w Bernie & they will rig the general.
Why hasn't she been arrested? Her actions bar her from public office. The average Joe gets arrested but not her?
she was careless not reckless , you know the difference , right
yes there is , if intended or if being careless , there is a difference
@Poppy_Fields1 @gabriele705 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton
It wasn't for you I'm on your side love. And @gabriele705 federal law does not state intention is necessary, only negligence.
You know the FBI kept saying The B did break the law, but no indictment?  REALLY? DC CARTEL AT ITS FINEST
@olivierserge @HillaryClinton money, favors, influence and powers makes it clear there exist more than one set of justice.

All she got was a slap on the wrist... And look at all these flippin idiots who will still vote for her regardless
But NO punishment or accountability?
@jstines3 @HillaryClinton #WeThePeople #Revolution
Grow up senator-i-know-Trump-is-so-what -is-Hillary..The conversation about #TrumpTreason is about just that. BTW why didnt you imeach both?
I am appalled at this.
thanks for repeating that @RandPaul ! @ChooChooLife @HillaryClinton
Hellary the reckless candidate
Fight like you've never fought before. Mere words cannot defeat corruption. You must act.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton
@JK_Woodhauler @RandPaul @HillaryClinton
@ND4Bernie @HillaryClinton Yes, and they did nothing about it. Are the rich above the law?
why have they jailed and prosecuted people on less then what Hillary is guilty of? Corruption to the core
Clinton likely needed a private server to conceal corruption in the 1st place. FBI needs to be a police, not a political office.
Corruption at it's best! Sickening!!!
@SteuerCarla @HillaryClinton yep and she preaches to Americans about people who agitate and kill cops
why are you still talking?
Corrupt to the core.
Entire gov has been hacked>not possible to secureanything. Bush /Cheney purposely destroyed email. So did Trump!
@m_m817 @HillaryClinton that was just her calling tech support because apparently she can't even keep her private emails safe.
The Creeps win again! America the Ugly!
She is a great danger to US security.
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton how is it even #POSSIBLE for her to #ESCAPE #HANDCUFFS with #OBAMA? #OBAMALegacy #TBNT #Benghazi
dont start please
is trying to get 2 the coronation, one is trying to keep his job & the other is only concerned about his "legacy".
Proves that's a #RiggedSystem and the powerful get off
Witness to History & Torture of the Law
@olivierserge @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton so about this #equalprotection under the law? General Petraeus would beg to differ!
@__The_Awakening @HillaryClinton it's like they're giving the election to @realDonaldTrump
They also announced their endorsement    of Hillary Clinton for POTUS
@NatShupe  please allow edward snowden back in the country. His intent was to expose, not compromise natl security
@john12782 When will @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr do SOMETHING about this? What about OUT OF control #Obama w/ Airforce1 & Hillary?
@CyLyBu @HillaryClinton
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton corruption!!!!!!! DC is a lost hope
And the congress will do what about it?
were the #FBI given a bribe by @hiillaryclinton @realdonaldtrump
What are you going to do about that? I would guarantee that you feckless, spineless @GOP @RNC will do NOTHING
and you couldn't beat a anti Semitic racist bigot doesn't say much about u rand
@shadowbanned_ @HillaryClinton Just like illegal immigrants, Gitmo detainees, lawbreakers- protected by our government under Obama
This picture is circulating on Twitter. Not a good sign- dark day indeed
This may be a big win for @realDonaldTrump @GOP.  Lawlessness, reckless disregard for America. SHAMEFUL.
you #failed. @HillaryClinton
corrupt politicians always walk
. And the useless #GOP politicians always do nothing #ImWithHer
@speedingisfun
https://goo.gl/KRgLsl  Agreeing to @RandPaul, Hillary Clinton is #1 among Dem. candidates past hour in Twitter talk #neverhillary
Good thing you're a doctor, you'd suck as a lawyer. There's the letter of the law and the essence of the law.
How can she have a security clearance if (heaven forbid) she was elected?
DO SOMETHING !
This proves there is no justice.
you votin libertarian this winter? I know you got to keep the party affiliation n all but  2lunatics out there!
And you about wet your pants as you take your hypocrisy 2 Twitter. Your thoughts on Sec Powell's email system?
but let's not prosecute after all she is a Clinton
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton
if she's so incompetent then doesn't that disqualify  her to be president
So Dr. you heard all the evidence that the FBI heard?  If not then you have no cause to judge.
@trumpy17 @HillaryClinton  She should be in jail.
@djmorrowbooks @HillaryClinton If you: recklessly endangered national security, you might be a #CrookedHillary
.@RandPaul @SEAAdams2 Clintons are #TooBigToJail
@BellaLolaGirl @HillaryClinton The key to avoiding prosecution is...RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
@2009superglide @HillaryClinton ARe you going  to move for a special prosecutor?
@vito4224 @HillaryClinton B/C she is a Clinton she walks free. Now you know why many of us hate ALL politicians! #rigged system
Wish you were our next president!
@rhkirkland Might #Comey be afraid of becoming another mysterious death stat tied to @HillaryClinton ? #WakeUpAmerica
one sets of rules  for ordinary americans, another sets of rules for influential politicians. #NoJusticeNoTax
meanwhile in your state someone spent 20 million to build a giant boat that doesn't even float.
yeah its was a stupid mistake on her part but not criminal. which is BS! They have so much evidence its pathetic
If Hillary was still the SecState, Obama would have to dismiss her. Instead, they're sitting on AF1 heading to campaign together.
The country rules of laws are crossed, broken by the very ppl supposed to protect. Comey has succumbed to power
mounts to a hill (Hillary) of beans...no charges necessary. Dr Paul should be Paul Rand/Nutty
@thealtofsalt @HillaryClinton so when do we get an indictment? ??
where is the bridge you work under Rand? Or do you now work in the tree making cookies with the other elves?
Colin Powell used private email as did other Clinton state dep predecessors, it is not an outrage.
