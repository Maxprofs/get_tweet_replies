@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Republicans don't know how to debate. They get personal. They have no policies!
@doctork101 @BernieSanders @twitter All @RandPaul talks about is sensible policy,open your ears and put your prejudices aside.#StandwithRand
@kenny_geiger @BernieSanders @twitter @RandPaul very likely Rand wont win. Trump sadly will. Then what?
@doctork101 @BernieSanders @twitter @RandPaul I share your sentiment about trump. It's very sad. :/
@kenny_geiger @BernieSanders @twitter @RandPaul likely you will only have two options. Sanders or trump. Sanders seems very fair to me
@RandPaul @BernieSanders #DemTownHall Why Is DEA promoting pain patient suicide by jailing our doctors? #GivePainAVoice
@bobschubring @RandPaul @BernieSanders because Gary Mendell spent $4million to lobby cdc against pain meds.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter lol
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @justinamash dude, he’s an actual front-runner. Just saying.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter I think this would be the most interesting debate of the entire election!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter
 Bernie: I think we should legalize marijuana and end the drug war!

Paul: I agree

Bernie: Wait...what?
@Sc0ttcg @RandPaul @BernieSanders I think this would be the debate content for well over half the topics. The rest is night & day appart
@jokerbear54 @RandPaul @BernieSanders Yea their biggest differences would be economic policies
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter USA isn't USA anymore thx 2 ppl like Sanders. Progressive doesn't mean 4ward it means decay in govt terms
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Had a great discussion with some of your supporters today Dr.Paul.
@RandPaul @patmiletich @BernieSanders @twitter why should he ?
@allow55555 @RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Because Bernie knows he gets wrecked in that debate
@RandPaul don't you think you should be a viable candidate before you try and challenge anyone to a public forum?
@alllibertynews @BernieSanders @twitter sanders to me sounds more like a left wing libertarian and not a socialist
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter of course he won't accept it. If he does he will be fully exposed.
.@RandPaul @BernieSanders Debate each other any time with an online audience at http://www.lighthouse.club  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-KEsx57TdI … #debate

@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter lets go!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Keep the selective criticisms and half truths to a minimum and someday you too may win a Prez nod. #No2RP
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter dude you barely get accepted on stage, he has bigger fish to fry.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders I don't think he's legally allowed to.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter perhaps that's because you're irrelevant??
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Drop out!!! Stop wasting money!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Sorry Bernie Sanders Progressive means progressive decay of a once great nation from ppl of your mindset
@RandPaul Mr Rhetoric no substance Sanders. Im middle class, any more taxes I'm leaving the country.He wants 2 tax rich they'll be gone B4me

@RandPaul @BernieSanders you wanna debate, I keep telling you to hit up @KillerMike unless you don't do your own tweets
@RandPaul You're like 7th in the polls. Why would  Bernie waste his time with you? @justinamash @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter I can't wait!
@RandPaul @Ellysa_Maye @BernieSanders @twitter democrats seem to be scared to debate republicans
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter 
Don't blame him! 
Don't do it Bernie 
He's not in your class, its a set up.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Cutting edge! Exactly! Bernie is a good man. Just don't agree with all he says. We have a lot to discuss!
@RandPaul @justinamash @BernieSanders @twitter your own party won't let you debate. Why would Sanders do it?  #kidstable
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Bernie should accept his invitation!! I like both of these candidates so much! Rand Paul is so fiery!!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter I feel like Rand Vs Hillary would be a better debate.
@DayAndNeitzel @RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter nah, can't waste time with jail bait.
@CussinCosmonaut @RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter haha. True. She could always Skype from her jail cell 
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Hit Bernie with the cold hard facts, Doctor
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter i would love to see you guys debate....Sanders and your dad got along very well.....
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter If you're writing your own tweets, you have some enviable wit, my friend. Usually good stuff.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Rand, I actually think you're really funny. One of the best politicians on twitter, even if we disagree.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter you do realize by DNC rules if he accepted your invite, he would be barred from any Dem Debates right?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter can't even get Republicans to debate him. Why would a Democrat?
@RandPaul Duh! @BernieSanders has to follow the DNC rules. Are you that stupid?
@RealDanPham @RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter whats your stand on #DUIlaws nationwide?
#KeriAnneDeMottMatters @MADDOnline
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter THIS WOULD BE AWESOME . we all know you would wreck any cAndidate lmao i wanna see this so badly
@RandPaul I will always respect you for calling out Trump on the TPP/China! Best debate moment yet, bar none. Not sure your party agrees.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter If the topic turns to economics, you'll be facing an unarmed man, @RandPaul. :-)
@RandPaul Win the @GOP nom so you can debate @BernieSanders; the debates are intraparty for now. Follow his lead and stick to the issues!
@mollybushman @RandPaul @GOP @BernieSanders like when bernie said that he was the only presidential candidate against NSA illegal spying
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter, this would help both campaigns and should be done.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter he's too afraid of you. People are for liberty not authoritarianism
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie has already embarrassed you https://youtu.be/YUXwDMqjC-A 
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter he would lose
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Only Dr. Carson has real solutions 4 big issues. https://www.bencarson.com/issues  #IowaCaucus #iacaucus #iowa #BC2DC2016
@RandPaul @DChrissos @BernieSanders @twitter  Alright Im there #StandWithRand tonight yall thxs
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter probably bc there's no chance he'll run against you in the general Rand
@RandPaul, @BernieSanders will debate the Republican nominee, and that won't be you because your supporters don't have a #RandOrBust pledge.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter why should he debate someone who isn't even doing well in the polls?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders I'd rather hear the two of you talk about what you have in common.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter sanders is a communist! And Trump is the one who's gonna destroy the country... Smh.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter I want @RandPaul to be @BernieSanders VP..THAT IS AN AWESOME BALANCE FOR POTUS & VPOTUS
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter I've been wondering if this dog is humping the stuffed animal, lol,  that would make sense. Getting *ucked
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter I would pay to see this. You're two of the most legit and principled guys in politics.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter why would he debate someone who has zero chance of affecting the election?   Why not debate a tree?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter to the wack jobs supporting burning in gas chambers.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter
For the General Election too (y)
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Because your not even a factor in the RACE that's why Bernie won't debate you.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @GarrettBellows
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter don't feel bad Rand, he's refusing to debate other nonfactor lost-in-the-margin-of-error "candidates" too.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders it's not about the issues, it's about winning! ;)
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Vote Sanders and become like the rest of the world. Broke by Socialism. Give me Rand!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Don't mean to be rude, but why should Sanders debate any Reblican right now, much less low polling?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter And I'm from Kentucky . So you definitely owe me answer .
@RandPaul @EternaFreeda @BernieSanders @twitter Ask about killary's super delegates and if that worries him because he gave her a pass emai
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter I think the way it works is that you win the GOP nomination first.
@AaronM1978 @alllibertynews It "works" the way you make it. @RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter
@Soueraigne @alllibertynews @RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter he should probably concentrate on not being at the GOP kiddie table.
@AaronM1978 MSM ignores Pauls so they must create own publicity. @alllibertynews @RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter so glad that Bernie won't stoop to that level.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter Please send Bernie a copy of http://www.amazon.com/If-You-Give-Mouse-Cookie/dp/0060245867 …

@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter now we're talking, you clean his clock, you'll gain some supporters.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Why would he debate you when you're polling at +/- 2%? BTW, that is what the Senate is for...debating issues.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders  I like how separate party candidates are willing to do this. And I think both actually believe what they say
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @twitter oh my, I would love to see that haha.
