@RandPaul @freedomtex TX who will you vote for now?
.@tealtweet With Rand out, Cruz is clearly the top conservative. But Rubio will be nominee: running a great campaign, conservative enough.
@freedomtex @tealtweet If your definition of "conservative enough" is amnesty/open borders & mass 3rd world immigration then Rubio's good
@albanach68 @tealtweet Heh. That's not his position. But it's what you'll get if Dems win, yes.
@freedomtex @tealtweet Oh yes it is his position. Check out Rubio's I Squared immigration bill from 2015.Massive increase in foreign workers
@albanach68 @tealtweet We do need more high-skilled H1Bs if that's what you mean.
@freedomtex @tealtweet 2M American born Stem graduates under 25yrs old currently unable to find jobs in there field due to H visa workers
@albanach68 @tealtweet That's not really how tech employment works. Cut off H1Bs and you get more outsourcing.
@RandPaul isis is libertarian, go join them
@classic_mouth how does @RandPaul & Isis have a connection? I know Hilary killed Gaddafi and Libya is now an Isis playground.
@OutlawedMind @RandPaul Rand Paul and ISIS are both named after libertarian author Ayn Rand, you udder fool!
@classic_mouth @RandPaul - cute. Pretty sure it stands for Israeli secret intelligence service.
@classic_mouth @RandPaul - does spewing BS make you feel good?  Do you know the truth about Isis?  Doubt it!
@RandPaul you still have my vote Dr. Rand Paul.  #stillranding #randrally
@RandPaul Liberty*

* Excluding women's sovereign body rights, freedom from discrimination while conducting business, etc.
@MetroIssues @RandPaul the right to life trumps "sovereign body rights".
@crankypatsfan @RandPaul Sovereign body rights pertains to the woman's life, and there's no sci/pol consensus on when personhood begins.
@MetroIssues @crankypatsfan @RandPaul Life begins at conception per science please check your bias
@disturbedsauce @crankypatsfan @RandPaul Biological existence != Personhood.  Please check your emotional/irrational thinking.
@MetroIssues @crankypatsfan @RandPaul the term is life not "personhood"
@RandPaul  you were our only hope. I pray for this country and our future. We will fight to our dying breath for our freedom #StandWithRand
@RandPaul Still here! @NHForRand @NHTeamRand @GOP @NHRepublicans @RandPaul  #RandRally #RandPaul @YALiberty #UnitedWeRand
@RandPaul so glad you are fighting for your senate seat so you can still fight for our rights  #StillRanding
@RandPaul @freedom3556 Man that video just packs too much common sense in one video for the American public to comprehend...
@RandPaul RANDLETS I AM GOING TO VOTE @GovGaryJohnson
@RandPaul Whatever, I'm still voting for you in the California primary #StandWithRandAnyway
@RandPaul when Hitler invented libertarianism, he abolished the minimum wage, the EPA, and audited the FED!
@TallKeven @RandPaul hey Hitler was authoritarian not libertarian.  Libertarian movement promotes liberty and human rights over big brother
@MLebarno @RandPaul
@RandPaul Liberty Lovers, Rand is still on all 50 ballots! Why are we giving up so easy! Isn't this about us anyway! #RandRallyPrimaryVote
@RandPaul @VincentHarris fantastic work
@RandPaul @NHForRand Thank you Rand Paul.
@RandPaul @NHForRand  WHY DID YOU DROP OUT?
@RandPaul :(
@RandPaul NICELY DONE I really thought ur voice in the debates was indispensable & vital..I'm glad I got to know u better this time around..
@RandPaul Thanks for curing my apathy, Dr. Paul.
@RandPaul thank you for advocating for Liberty. I will continue to support you as long as you seek pubic office. I stand with Rand
@RandPaul Thank you!
@RandPaul it makes me sad that you quit. Maybe next time, buddy. Still voting for you in November.
@RandPaul Hopefully America can withstand what hell will be unleashed, before Rand gets another chance. Maybe he jumped the gun.
@RandPaul @RyanCasidia7 he's irrelevant
@RandPaul @anthony_soscia rip
@RandPaul Don't leave us Rand!!!!!! Keep fighting!!
@RandPaul at least you never had to beg people to clap for you. Thanks for having some self respect in this election.
@RandPaul what an incredible man with the most noblest of messages.
@RandPaul so thankful to you for fighting for liberty and for bringing diversity of thought to the Republican primary process!
@RandPaul @adisathi stay involved, rand a good guy
@RandPaul good vid, sorry we have such a dumbed down electorate afraid to Unloose the apron strings and stand up for Liberty.
@RandPaul Rand you should run as independent
@RandPaul @chap_payton "the man who got enough money to stop socialism"
@RandPaul well fuck both parties, I will most definitely be writing rand in or voting third party now.
@RandPaul Still voting for you April 5th.
@RandPaul First Netflix removes @bbcdoctorwho, and now this? What a crappy February. #shortestmonthforareason
@RandPaul Sad to see you go!
@RandPaul thank you Dr Paul. Wish you'd have stuck around to duke it out but establishment fight is hard-esp when you get no help from media
@RandPaul what happened?
@RandPaul My sincerest endeavors Dr. Rand Paul! I'm sad to hear news. TY to you and your dad for always fighting for liberty. Much respect.
@RandPaul @RandPaul Sorry. I was hope you will be resist until final line like ur father did. God bless you
@RandPaul so sad to see such a great candidate dropping out. I'm sure you'll do great things for this country as a senator. #StandWithRand
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump 
Deepest Thanks to You.
@RandPaul there still Gary Johnson people
@RandPaul will you run again in 2020? Please tell me you will.
@RandPaul a heartfelt thank you
@RandPaul Sad to see you out of the Presidential race, but I know you will keep fighting for the Constitution and our liberty!  Thank you!
@RandPaul   Rand why did you drop out?  Trump will end up imploding, Cruz will get disqualified and Rubio you could easily beat!
@RandPaul Rand Please dont.
@RandPaul U dropping shows corruption, deals and lies. I thought you were the smartest man I have seen in politics. Guess I was wrong.
@RandPaul Listen rand you can not give up and make a deal with ted cruz or back lash what you say, 2020 is not the year. New ham is liberal.
@RandPaul @OKStateSFR  But remember everyone he still on ballots in all 50 states
@RandPaul thank you for speaking out loud for us.
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  #StandWithRand what a shame we missed a great leader here who knew how our USA works we never had that we needed Rand!
@harleygrl3465 @RandPaul @BaruchSFR #stillranding because he's still on the ballot for the primaries! Long shot, but might as well try!
@RandPaul who am I going to vote for now. See you again in 4 years.
@RandPaul know one knew you were running heck you did not even know yourself. Maybe the rest of the #republican #koopalings can follow suit.
@RandPaul Dr. Paul thank you for putting your voice out there. You brought the "conservatarian"  view point to the table.
@RandPaul if anything it brought down ethanol subsidies (Cruz wouldn't have done it if not for attempting to appeal to "us")
@RandPaul if ethanol subsidies aren't sacrosanct than nothing is. Please be proud of that and try again soon
@RandPaul Out of the so called Republicans, you came the closest to conservatism.The rest of the pack are nut jobs. Good luck w/Senate run
@RandPaul If you want to win here in KY you make sure you back the right candidate. If I'm not mistaken Trump is winning here. Just a tip!
@RandPaul thanks for trying.
@RandPaul come on don't suspend your campaign continue to spread the word for liberty across the nation.
.@RandPaul thank you for fighting for our #constitution ... God bless you and your family!
how does it feel to be 20% as charismatic as your dad @RandPaul
@RandPaul Thank You! Dr. Rand Paul. The fight for Liberty continues. My support for you as a Champion of Liberty continues. ~
@RandPaul 
@RandPaul please tell me there is a surprise #comeback planned and this is just a media stunt
@RandPaul @freelancer1787 OH WE ARE BACK NOW TO 
"DOCTOR" RAND PAUL = WEATHERMAN
@RandPaul makes me just want to cry; it's like a bad breakup you didn't see coming.
@RandPaul it's all over now, we didn't listen enough, WWIII is coming, & the Fed ain't coming down anytime this century ;-;
@RandPaul You were my last hope, and now America is just screwed.
People are not awake enough for you, @RandPaul. Eventually sheep will be led to slaughter and hopefully then liberty prevails. God Bless!
You people will vote for a socialist, a billionaire, a crazy but ignore this brilliant candidate. Shame “@RandPaul: https://amp.twimg.com/v/2d7277fc-e142-4778-858d-98ee9001a3a3 …”
@RandPaul Thank YOU for fighting for liberty and continuing to do so
@RandPaul hey ily
@RandPaul Rand Paul sorry you pull out the GOP is going to hell.
@RandPaul you are a good man Rand Paul
@RandPaul Though I disagree w you on issues, U are honest man. Cruz, Christie, Bush lie like rugs, run dishonest neg ads. U should be on ABC
@RandPaul thank you for the opportunity to be even a small part of your campaign
@RandPaul thank you for your service to this Great nation @DrRandPaul I still like some of what you have to say @johannarandi
@johannarandi @RandPaul @DrRandPaul Come join us at @WebbNation2016 #Independent
@MelissaMelimac @RandPaul @DrRandPaul @WebbNation2016 no thanks @johannarandi
@RandPaul DADDY NOOOOO
@RandPaul This brought a tear to my eye. America doesn't deserve a Amazon candidate like you. Keep fighting for us in the senate. #Rand2020

@RandPaul Will you be giving endorsement of another candidate soon? I was going caucus for you ,
@RandPaul Trump/Paul 2016
@RandPaul God bless you.
@RandPaul Hey Senator, I would have preferred you in the White House but we need you in the Senate/
@RandPaul  Thanks for running. Please keep working for the good of our country.
@RandPaul you still have my vote. I'm tired of not being represented. If the GOP wants to win it won't be with my vote.
@RandPaul Thank you, Dr. Paul. You ran a principled campaign. raised crucial issues, and elevated the debate. #CruzCrew
@RandPaul I'm devastated that I won't be able to vote for you in SC, who do I vote for now? #undecided
@RandPaul , as a voter, I'm disappointed. For the first time, I felt that a #gop presidential candidate represented me. #standwithrand
@TharpforOhio @johnglenpdx @RandPaul http://www.acalltopaul.com/node/1163 
@RandPaul There's always another chance in 8 years, when pretty much most of your supporters will be able to vote
@RandPaul Well, now we can get down to meaningful "say on pay" reform; a little democracy in the boardroom might be good for a change
@RandPaul @KelleyAshbyPaul Thank you for running, for being my hero, for being my voice. Your fight for liberty shall continue on.
@RandPaul while I support @marcorubio I lean Libertarian (due to David @David_Boaz's Primer book) so I appreciated ur voice in this process.
@RandPaul I'm so sad 
@Melissa232220 @RandPaul me too 
@RandPaul I have so much respect for you Rand. It's sad to see the true lover of liberty dropping out! Cruz/Paul 2016
@RandPaul thank you keep up the fight for Liberty.
@RandPaul You are an awesome congressman and KY is lucky and this nation is lucky to have you. Thanks for being a Senate watchdog.
@RandPaul only #GOP candidate I could support for Prez just dropped out of the race.  Now what?  Right to vote not = obligation to vote 
@RandPaul thank you for running! Very sad I didn't even get a chance to vote for you  #NorthCarolina
@RandPaul U were one of only 3 #RepublicanCandidates that made any sense. The other 2 will be out soon.
@RandPaul Thank you for bringing your strong voice for the Constitution & liberty to the race. Please continue to fight for us in the Senate
@RandPaul Didn't know he was really in the running! I mean come-on...
@RandPaul They all know deep down u stand for Justice never sleeping.  Carry on. So many were reached. proud of your positions, every damn1
@RandPaul Thank you for all you've done in this campaign. You've raised questions and ideas that will improve the race. #IdeasAreStronger
@RandPaul crying shame.  Do I pick the double talking used car salesman, the puppet, or the populous self absorbed bombastic ass?
Thank you @RandPaul, your the greatest thing to happen to politics in a long long time.  Thanks for always fighting to protect our freedom
@ParadiseIsCool @RandPaul No foreign gov. or jihadist took away a single freedom.U.S. gov. did & we let it happen.
@NewParisite @RandPaul The U.S. Gov. and the media treats us like we're too stupid to have minds of our own!  The Hell with that!!!
Based on the infighting of @RandPaul trolls and other RWNJs that I see, the GOP is finished.


#VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Senator @RandPaul , Please endorse  @RickSantorum .God has chosen him for this time, & many of your supporters have already approved him. TY
@RandPaul Don't you dare give up!This country needs you!!!
@shupe_laura @RandPaul He won't give up. He needs to win Senate seat so we can Audit the Fed.
@RandPaul sorry to hear. At this point all of you guys should check out the next best candidate @SenSanders
@RandPaul sad to see you go. You fought harder than any other candidates for the country. Keep doing great job.
@RandPaul No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-(
@RandPaul bye buddy. It's been fun. Shame you didn't grow that mustache.
@RandPaul yes, ideas have consequences .........
@RandPaul Thank you for standing up for the American people. Can't wait to see you continue ur stand in the Senate.
@GotchYaSon @johnglenpdx @RandPaul http://www.acalltopaul.com/node/1163

@RandPaul 
Sad to see you finish

tis suspension not resign...
@RandPaul Keep up the good fight. You will always be a long shot because frankly the majority of Americans don't have the knowledge base 
@RandPaul you were the best candidate out there by far
@RandPaul as Ted Cruz supporter, I respected a lot of your positions in the POTUS campaign.  I wish you the best in your Senate race.
@RandPaul glad u where in the race u and Cruz only honest men there the Constitution matters Paul and Cruz only two fighting 4 rgt reasons

Still, I #StandWithRand
@RandPaul be strong on Fourth Ammendment and reenforce our Bill of Rights.  Thank you
@RandPaul Kick ass in the senate race!
@RandPaul happy to hear your out.. Your not what you think you are.. Good ridden
@RandPaul unfortunately more people don't care enough about liberty. Everyone just wants to be taken of. They'll get their wish I'm afraid.
@RandPaul Even though I am not a Republican, I'm sad to see you exit the race because you are far better than Trump & many of the candidates
@RandPaul Love your awesome spirit and calm demeanor. Be blessed.
@RandPaul It's a shame that our system is such that Trump and Cruz continue and a statesmen like Sen. @RandPaul  withdraws
@RandPaul No, THANK YOU for picking up your father's torch & continuing the fight for liberty & freedom in DC #SadDay #IStillStandWithRand
@RandPaul We still need you Sir, your work is not in vein. Keep your #Senate seat!  Sorry to see you leave the campaign. #Pennsylvania #TCOT

.@RandPaul congrats on running a 1st class campaign. America just isnt rdy to cut spending and end the welfare/warfare states yet #rand2020
@RandPaul Sad day when the only person with sense running for president drops out.
@RandPaul I beg you to reconsider running for president
@RandPaul Why!? You should've seen what NH held for you. But go keep your senate seat, we still need your voice in the political discourse.
@RandPaul how about Vice President?!! @tedcruz you need this man on your team!!
@RandPaul So no more #StandwithRand , I guess it's #withdrawlwithPaul now,

@RandPaul,  people aren't ready 2 fire the nanny. People don't see that if we kill innocents there is blow back. Get out of the mid east!
@RandPaul sorry to hear! I will vote Dem now. The other GOP candidates are wannabes. Not true politicians or defenders of the constitution
Bless you, Senator @RandPaul
@RandPaul Thank you for your beautiful effort to save America. Keep holding them accountable in the Senate.
@MarkHudson3502 @johnglenpdx @RandPaul http://www.acalltopaul.com/node/1163 
@RandPaul when Hitler invented libertarianism he didn’t quit his campaign after one measly defeat!
@RandPaul liberty and freedom takes work. That message can't compete with today's fairytales. Thank you for YOUR work.
@RandPaul suspending the race was an honorable action. You're a good American. Keep up the good work.
Strong advocate for Liberty @RandPaul has dropped out of the presidential race. Thank you for your time, and may God bless your Senate run.
@RandPaul now that you  have suspended your campaign who  will you choose to back #gop #Election2016  #TCOT  #RandPaul  #thefive
@RandPaul thanks doctor..
@RandPaul A good inspiring man with solid principles.
@RandPaul Thanks for running, hope to see you run again in 2020. Now I need to figure out whether to go republican or third party this year.
@RandPaul please don't drop out! Please Rand! We NEED you! #thisGirlisforliberty #StandWithRand
@RandPaul sad to see him go. He's still got a great future in the party and brings freshly new ideas to the national debate. #godblessyou
