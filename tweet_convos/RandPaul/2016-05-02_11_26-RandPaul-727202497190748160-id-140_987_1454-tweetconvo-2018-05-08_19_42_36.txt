@RandPaul @TheVoiceOfPaulR @HillaryClinton I think it's about time that she goes to prison. I'm very sorry for the job loss in your state
@erthbndspcmn Tell Her Rand Paul!!!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Sorry Rand, but you're wrong.  She owes everyone in the country an apology, not just Kentucky!
@ADLeVier @RandPaul @HillaryClinton Doesn't Cheney owe every American an apology for that last war? Or vowing 2 make Obama a 1 term pres.
@zhanaya101 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton and it's all Rand's fault??? Move along, you're barking up the wrong tree.
@ADLeVier @RandPaul @HillaryClinton YES cuz Rand's said horrendous things about Obama. So,now ALL of you need2 take several seats. Bye Miss!
@zhanaya101 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton "horrendous" things, you mean like speaking the truth? Rand is a good man.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton there had been a war on coal, and coal lost. Not Hillary's fault so stop trying to find someone to blame.
@dhunt64817 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton where were you during the War on the Rustbelt?
living and during in Syracuse
@EatAllYourFish @HillaryClinton I'll stand with Rand because Rand stands with Trump. Vote Rand Paul KY and vote Trump
@instapundit @HillaryClinton and who the fuck r you? Oh yeah I remember loser.
@RandPaul @DrottM @HillaryClinton Hillary should apologize for not going straight to jail - do not pass Go, do not collect $200.
@RandPaul @pricklypear12 @HillaryClinton 
Fracking is putting coal out of business.
It made gas more abundant, cheaper and it's cleaner.
@MyassesDragon @RandPaul @HillaryClinton No, obama promised to put coal out of business and he's used the epa to do it. #NeverTrump
@pricklypear12 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton 
This statement concerned the passage of Cap & Trade, which never happened.
Cheap gas killed coal.
@MyassesDragon @RandPaul @HillaryClinton Cheap gas makes sense, but obama doesn't need cap &  trade to destroy coal.
@RandPaul @bowhunter_va @HillaryClinton Rand, she really enjoys your Kentucky whiskey.  Maybe too much. Good luck with that apology
@RandPaul @DrottM @HillaryClinton Ruth, why would ANYONE apologize for telling the truth?? Just because the truth offends you??
@MarkoOhNo @RandPaul @HillaryClinton She is breaking about putting these people out of work and you don't think she owes him an apology I do
@RandyBohlke @RandPaul @HillaryClinton ???
Rand is a she? Since when?
@MarkoOhNo @RandPaul @HillaryClinton Hillary owes Them an Apology. Speak to text messes up some times.
@RandyBohlke @RandPaul @HillaryClinton lol Yeah. And I agree, as I said earlier.
@ReneeofSoCalif An appoligize is turning herself into custody. And whistle blowing on Barry Obama AKA Barack. @realDonaldTrump
@DebAlwaystrump Yea that will happen right after she apologizes for Benghazi and her emails.
apologize to America @RandPaul 4 Donald Trump @sarobards
@RandPaul @garydailydrift @HillaryClinton 
She's not going to acknowledge her statements as true.
@BarbMuenchen @HillaryClinton I agree. We don't need idiocracy in the government anymore
@RandPaul @Scapmichelle Well said and thank you for supporting our nominee. #Trump2016 
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton and the #Egyptian people @HansPZwetsloot @censorednewsnow
@RandPaul @Charlie4Trump @HillaryClinton We are 100% with you on that Dr. Paul unfortunately Hillary is not one for apologies.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton if you evorce your wife, in "Kentucky", is she STILL your sister? ;-)
@GSCAtlanta @HillaryClinton There's a lot of incumbents whose time is up but I really hope Rand gets reelected. He deserves it.
@RandPaul @DebAlwaystrump @HillaryClinton Hilary apologize that's like asking a alcoholic not to drink the odds aren't good
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton Yep, she should
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton don't hold your breath...
agree with u @RandPaul of the #WarOnCoal @sarobards @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul @Gelicmonk  You will get an apology out of @HillaryClinton  right after Bubba tells the women he's abused that he is sorry.
@RandPaul @DrottM @HillaryClinton Why? Because she endorsed @realDonaldTrump? Oh wait, that was you. #NeverTrump
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton She'll never apologize except to get votes. She meant every word she said about putting coal miners out of work!

@kathybelk87 @RandPaul @BarbMuenchen @HillaryClinton SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE COAL WORKERS, JUST HERSELF, THAT'S IT
@RandPaul @ojhines2k @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Hillary, you boasted about hurting Kentucky coal miners! You are despised!
@RandPaul Losers say what????? 
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton don't forget West Virginia. Hillary is anti-American. She just loves our money
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton she needs to do more than apologize. She should be in prison!
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton For telling them the truth?  She was misquoted, never thought you would go this low

@RandPaul @adagioforstring @HillaryClinton Only if you apologize to Republicans for endorsing @realDonaldTrump  What happened to you?!
@RandPaul @ShepherdMao @HillaryClinton 
Thank you!
@RandPaul @dawngpsalm63 @HillaryClinton You were right about so many things. We need to get behind & support Trump for America.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @ussenate @USCongress #RememberBengahzi @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaSecretariatAgain #Decision2016
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @HillaryClinton I prefer self-immolation.
@RandPaul @adlangston75 @HillaryClinton Her apology would mean nothing, just like everything else she says
@geauxducks79 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton agreed. It is about getting her to admit it.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton  She'll fall all over herself apologizing. Doesn't mean a thing. 
Fair warning  : She made her intent clear.
@RandPaul how's your run for president going?
@the_twelfthday @RandPaul Rand who?
@brendagaylern @RandPaul Not every physician is good or worthy. 
@RandPaul @MARVINBURKY @HillaryClinton #vote out all #liberals, #progressives, & #liars.
@RandPaul @_HankRearden @HillaryClinton you are correct. Pls endorse Donald J. Trump. You have a lot to offer to his team.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump The Dem war on coal, oil, and US industry-also national security issue-Energy Independence! &JOBS
@RandPaul @alexryanhannah @HillaryClinton this guy should've been our next president
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Rand, please endorse Trump. The Trump/Paul ticket will demolish #CrookedHillary
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton This is a tough one. On one hand, you save jobs. On the other hand, you decrease the rate @ which our planet dies.
@SenpaiOfPirates @alllibertynews @RandPaul @HillaryClinton I think it absurd to believe the planet is "dying"... This isn't a videogame
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I think it's time you apologize to everyone in the country for blocking the President every chance you get.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton maybe she should apologize to the families of those slain in Benghazi while she's at it. #HillaryForPrison
@RandPaul @fan3dan @HillaryClinton you should apologize to @tedcruz
@joeboch348 @RandPaul @HillaryClinton @tedcruz Cruz should apologize to the american public.
@fan3dan @RandPaul @HillaryClinton @tedcruz he probably will if he doesnt win. Crybaby Paul should have endorsed him
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton That's probably the most polite demand I've ever heard. I'd like to see the tie come off, sleeves up and ROAR
This must be what @realDonaldTrump was talking about when he complimented you @RandPaul Good on you for holding @HillaryClinton accountable
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I still remember every word Rand Paul said about Obama! & now he's telling someone to apologize for something.
@RandPaul @WatchStossel @HillaryClinton I think it's time you apologize to kentucky
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton oh shit's about to go down
@RandPaul @iphooey @HillaryClinton wah wah wha-whiner Rand.  Take care of your Kentucky problems and stop blaming others
@RandPaul definitely adding that tweet to my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1MCeASR 
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton I am Sorry to here that. That Witch! has done that! But do not forget who started it OB #TedCruz2016
.@RandPaul -- Im a former donor of yours and am curious why you haven't endorsed @tedcruz. 
#CruzCrew
@RandPaul If you could go back in time, would you also require the Auto industry go console/appologise to cart and buggy industry?
@RandPaul I thought you liked capitalism? What changed? If coal was best, it would stick around. Its not. Deal.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Maybe you should apologize for using Kentucky's senate seat as merely a springboard to national office?
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton give it a rest man. I'm a supporter but you look insane
Hey @RandPaul , I think it's time you endorse @tedcruz and start proclaiming it from the rooftops!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton #StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton only 1,500 lost jobs??!  That's not nearly enough. #blacklung
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Billary Clinton will put alot of Americans out of work. Supported #TPP before against it. Support #NAFTA.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton *uc! KY. Whole state is a "welfare Queen".
@RandPaul dr. Paul I am none your positions have ever caused any job loss in  any other state. Policy has implications. Saving lives is ok
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton shouldn't apologize for ending dirty coal jobs, if anything she should offer a plan to keep those workers employed
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton You first!
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton they all need to vote republican in the election.  wish you could be vp
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Hillary the job killer and warmonger
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton RAND PAUL. IT WOULD BE NICE IF TRUMP WOULD INVITE YOU TO BE VP.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton You Apologize for allowing this to happen  moving  of 
Confederate memorials
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton 

@JudgeJeanine 4 Administer of the Environmental Protection Agency @realDonaldTrump  President's Cabinet
@RandPaul @Lord0fCinder @HillaryClinton good luck with that, she won't apologize to Benghazi. Evil at its best.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton @FoxNews Unfortunately New England States still let Hillary Clinton visit.
@RandPaul get behind @realDonaldTrump and let's take on Clinton together.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton because she did it... Single–handedly....LOL
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton she screamed about how Bernie didn't approve auto Bill  (also bank bill) but would kill Kentucky in a heartbeat.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton if you stop supporting subsidizing the coal industry it'd die on its own anyways
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Make that "everyone in America."
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton ideally, Rand, we could kick the coal dependency and move your state's economy into 21st century
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton No one cares, Rand Paul.  Work on finding a better industry, not relying on something from the 18th century.
No offense Dr. Paul but I think it's time you apologize for letting a clown and con man beat you in the primaries @RandPaul
@almyrOH @RandPaul The education, or lack thereof, of the majority Americans is not Dr. Paul's fault.
.@watchthehans @RandPaul sad but true. However, weirdly enough Trump has been dominating with people who have postgraduate degrees
