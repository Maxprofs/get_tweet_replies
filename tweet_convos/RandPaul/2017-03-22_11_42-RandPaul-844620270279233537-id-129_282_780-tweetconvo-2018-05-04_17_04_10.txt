I hope that Trump doesn't threaten your life if you vote no. He seems like he would. All about the win. Not about people.
Time to vote for this healthcare bill and it's time to act like a Republican Rand Paul. Let's get this done !
@POTUS I'm against the Ryan/obamacare bill and insurance company bailout.  Listen to conservatives PLEASE. Fight 4 us
We find ourselves begging the GOP (that we elected to SERVE US) to not give us more ObamaCare.
PLEASE look out for us! Let @POTUS know that @SpeakerRyan and the others are NOT looking out for the citizens.
Conservatives had 7 years to be ready day 1. You failed. We need a leader to get everyone together and your not it
FULL REPEAL. 
Kill it, shred it, then flush it. 
@RandPaul @RobinEnochs #FullRepeal #ACARepeal #Ryancare
@swebs @HuffPostPol I'm in Ky @ you make us proud.Snakes convinced @POTUS he had no other choice. Thank you for standing firm!
REPEAL COMPLETELY
guess we're keeping the disastrous #Obamacare thanks for nothing.
@realDonaldTrump KEEP NEGOTIATING;  keep working toward YES. We all know you need a better bill to vote on. Thanks!
REPEAL! REPEAL! REPEAL! Free market only! Worst words you'll ever hear. We're the government, and we're here to help.
If it passes as is, GOP can kiss 2018 goodbye. America will vote them out. We the people! Enough is enough!
It needs to go down.
it made me lose my full time job when i was a student
.. my health went to $#/7
So sorry! You'll bounce back! Get creative.
I'm fine now but just sayin'  'twas a while ago.  It's just ironic because I had to eat worse food, n 2 much free time
wish you had worked together during the YEARS you had, as hard as you are working to block the President.broken hearted
Stand strong we have your backs
With GOP.. you will never win.too broad - no compromise. People will get tired and it will be 80% DEM next election.
Tragic mistake...millions of more murdered babies and small businesses ruined. When are you going to help all Americans?
Full repeal of Obamacare as promised!  Remember,  you work for the people that voted for you.
PLEASE vote FOR our GOP Health Care Bill!!!
@swebs Good. The bill is trash for us regular ppl, but protects illegal non-citizens. That it was even considered is a travesty!
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y pathetic so pathetic that y'all can't get something done. Republicans do nothing as usual.
too bad u have to have faith in your president I believe ultimately your constituents will be happy. We need jobs
@IsraelNewsLinks good grief you are all a hot mess.
It's a laughing stock, Rand. Create an alternative and PUSH IT.
Thankyou @RandPaul 4 sticking to your guns. We need insurance being sold to "buying pools" across state lines and with customizable plans.
WE WANT WHAT TRUMP PROMISED!!! COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE AT A FRACTION OF THE COST OF OBAMACARE. VOTE NO ON OBAMACARE -LIGHT
Just saw Meadows on TV suggesting he thinks it'll pass. @RandPaul is it fixed? Sounds like no, but these guys are charmed by Trump
You have received over 500+ calls to vote NO on this bill by ppl whom elected you! REMEMBER THAT!
@MEPFuller ... Not in favor of this move at all. It's divisive
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr Rand Paul&freedom caucus ,Americans expect you to stand behind Trump vote AHA,stop sabotaging by 60 vote
We must have the full repeal that will take down costs of health care along with more choices for Americans. Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump Do your best.
stay strong this is a glorified Obamacare! It sucks!
Their plan is bad, yours is probably worse for the GOP in 2018.
your starting to sound like the other party, such a shame
I suggest you do nothing until Obama care self implodes. Then the failure falls squarely on the democrats.
Please do not divide the Republican Party - a house divided cannot stand - this means 4 years of failure followed by Dem rule
Thanks for watching out....
obamacare wrong people forced to take it and penalizing Not having it. Awful
I sure hope so. We need #cleanrepeal #FullRepeal
Please vote no on Ryancare
good. Maybe work on lowering the actual cost of care and medication and maybe the cost of insurance will go down.
Senator Paul thx so much 4all the work youre doing on this.  I'm not in your state but i'd vote for you  hands down..
Just repeal Obamacare first. Then replace it after. Don't tinker with it kill it. That's what we we're promised and expect.
. Repeal the mandates and taxes. Let free market forces take over!
hang tough guys , the American people are behind you! No ryancare! Repeal the ACA!
Don't vote it down. Get in there and make it work
-I'm glad they should repeal Obamacare and if involved in health ins. at all take their time and do it right ! No Ryancare!
force health care providers to disclose cost of care and compete with each other. Break up pharmafia!
Do this right, no abortions, no political by passes.
I find it unsettling that after getting rid of Obama..having House,Senate,WH...Repubs can't come together & govern 4 the people
Rand you need to grow up. You can never get everything you want. Your stance leaves us with Obamacare.
Make it an investment in docs nurses hosps clinics and medicine. NOT insurance co. profits.
not something to be proud of
@VP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SecPriceMD  Please do not embarrass yourselves. Form a strategic plan that makes sense
.@RandPaul As it should! #CleanRepeal  #RepealAndReplace  #YesToS222    Gov't OUT of Healthcare! @SenRonJohnson @RepSeanDuffy  @RandPaul
hey yoy commies,..get it together!!. don't make me have to come over there!!!!!
...take that rout and I'm done with NC republicans
@SenSchumer is so proud of you.
No to this bill. Do a clean repeal and replace with everything Conservatives want! Has to be right 1st time b4 going to senate
@NetworksManager they are corrupt and on #SOROSPayRoll resign, we need new non political folks to replace them all
Thank you Rand! From Missouri Patriots.
and you may get voted out
so if it doesn't pass then what is your plan?
@NetworksManager @HuffPostPol  Good. Complete repeal is what was promised. Remember, we are watching.
Thank you!!! Why are Christian ministry sharing plans penalized in #Ryancare? It's ridiculous.
@NetworksManager RyansCare!
What have you been doing for 7 1/2 years about repeal and replace Obama Care. You should be helpful to Americans
HFC has the leverage. Ryan & Trump have to get this bill passed. Stay "No" until u get what is needed to make this bill work
These #RINO's need to repeal obamacare @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @gop @RepTomEmmer
You guys need to vote it down and then you need to get POTUS to go with your HC Plan If Ryan gets approve Trump will be 1 and done
UR HonorableStatesman-SenRandPaul-praying4U-Go Forth& Repeal Obamacare-2bringLiberty 2 our Republic-Defeat Tyrants in Chris's name
Good... I think President Trump needs a wake up call from "establishment" Ryan.
You all need to get in a room and keep your lazy asses there tell you work it out!!
Can't believe after 7 years of failing #Obamacare we don't have a plan talk about unprepared!!! Stop making conservatives look so dumb!!
changes by tomorrow? Why would you vote for anything with such little time to review?
R u really willing to bring everything down unless u get everything u want?  If it doesn't pass n we r stuck w ACA ITS ON YOU.
good luck next election people want representation not dictatorial actions like Obamacare has presently. I pray you are wrong
you by far have the best plan, presented yet to America!
No to new health care bill.  Instead go to single payer universal right plan.  See Sen Sanders @BernieSanders #healthcare
Why would American Taxpayers have to pay for tax credits to illegal immigrants?
Do you guys know what "compromise" is?
Yes...poison & Evil.
@MEPFuller bet you $1000 it passes the house
and the American people said "AMEN"!!!!
There are NO changes that can make this bill "better." Is it better for it to fail later after taking more of our $$?
thank you!
Great. Stand your ground!
Vote the F-er down!
We not  want  OBAMA care or  Lose care  or  Dictator care  In God We Trust not Hurt  citizens
If they drag their feet, Ppl will face higher costs than they cud imagine. Pass it. Perfect it.
it's a shame you're not voting against it because you know it hurts people, but a no vote is good, regardless of your motives.
yep moderate s claiming they won't support the changes trying to a appease the conservatives, so I guess we all lose.
. Republicans don't get there heads out of their asses and get serious and work this out kiss 2018 bye.
stop playing games. You know this is the only way to repeal and replace. It's PROCEDURE.
Seriously, if we can't get that number of people losing coverage above 30 mil it's not worth the time. #Trumpcare #Ryancare
Constitution by law and order
Are you having fun playing both sides? You know damn well Kentucky will kick you out before you can blink if you do this to them.
I'm pretty sure most of those who will lose insurance are in Appalachian areas aka his constituents.
but these are people who think kynect is a Republican plan and obamacare is ruining them. No hope.
Exactly these people will go against thier best interest because it comes from a "D"
#StandWithRand
Let's hope so
Are you tired of winning yet, Mr.President? #Biggly
