I have been told that the House Obamacare bill is under lock & key, in a secure location, & not available for me or the public to view.
the bill is with @POTUS tax return under lock and 
@Deemoney521
hope he fights for the people
@randPaul the secret ACA replacement bill just a bunch of blank pieces of paper in Manila files.
But this info came from The Grim Reefer,who probably WAS given the key,but just couldn't work it
It will be like Geraldo and Al Capone's vault.
@drfarls I flashed on, "behind a door marked 'Beware of the Leopard'."
in the basement in a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory
I've been killing Bothans all damn day and I still can't find a copy of Obama care replacement
They have it locked up with the IBM super computer trying to come up with a plan  LOL
Where's our elite team of outcasts and misfits to send to Scarif for those plans?
@RandPaul You'll have to vote for it to see what's in it.
#ACARepeal
government by the people indeed
@RandPaul That's because it only rearranges the chairs on the titanic and they know it.
Most likely, he means "the Death Star plans" not the plans to blow up. Still a good joke.
GOP never been know for its love of democracy, openness, transparency, human rights, the welfare of the less rich.
these are not the droids you are looking for
"These are not the bills you're looking for"
Rogue One, anyone?
@RandPaul really! How crazy are the republicans getting!
@Deemoney521 LOL
BTW, Paul Ryan NEEDS TO STEP DOWN AS SPEAKER!  He's slowing things down w/his delays & flip flop support of Trump Agenda
Just repeal! Completely REPEAL! The @realDonaldTrump promised a complete repeal!
The same secrecy surrounding the PP&ACA now surrounds its repeal.  Will sunlight ever be cast onto this shadowy hall?
@BoingBoing  Excellent. Just keep it in there and everyone will go on living. #keepGOPplaninthesafeSaveACA
@WalshFreedom Paul Ryan is a snake, don't trust him Mr President
Are you kidding? Don't tell the president not to trust someone when he can't be trusted himself.
@RandPaul see that is because there is just a big placeholder that says 'let 20 million Americans suffer without insurance'
If I have to pay for it, you damn right. Pay for your own crap. I'm tired of paying for lazy people's way.
.@HeerJeet .@RandPaul .@POTUS .@realDonaldTrump .@whpresscorps 
.@RogueSNRadvisor I saw the plan myself. All pages were blank.
Unfortunately, loose lips cause needless scandals.

I LOVE your support on this issue and as a result, I'm now going to follow you :)
In fact, Senator, we the American People not only have a right 2 c this Bill, we should also be voting on it!
Not only should u b able to c it so should the American Citizens via 30-Day Public Comment Period & Public Meetings
@RandPaul why would anyone trust anyone on the hill?
@RandPaul Too many people like to leak shit to the press. Keep it quiet till your ready, Ryan.
Is Death Star #POTUS secret service name? #TrumpRussia
Yes keep Rand Paul away. His ideas Suck.
@RandPaul Bor Gullet!  'Paranoid Saw Gererra' voice!
@cmpriest TBF the Death Star then exploded. They're learning!
well, they learned from past mistakes.
@Kris_Sacrebleu The reason they can't repeal and replace Obamacare is that they can't find any bill called Obamacare.
@Truthdig What a hoot!
Outrageous
Thankfully the giant claw machine is still working
@markdrop Force it open!
I assume it is now a matter of quantum uncertainty whether the bill exists or not
@xeni this is sounding very familiar to any Brexit-watchers.
Rand Paul as Darth Vader right now...
They don't want the other side of the aisle to get hold of it to identify the "death panels" /chuckle /smirk
@xeni - Be prepared, they will be shoving down our throats 
@RandPaul That's better than, "you have to pass it before you see what's in it", as Pelosi told us for Obamacare!
- GREAT, just what we need ... a repeat of Obamacare ...
lol
Blowing up the Death Star was much easier.  Still, let us see it!!
That's hardly fair, the Death Star was fictional.

Oh.......
did they type it up on a typewriter? Like surely there's a PDF in their "cruelty" folder?
@RandPaul Troubling
The House healthcare replacement plan is soylent green.
@Kris_Sacrebleu it was under lock and key because it never existed. Now they've "lost" it.
this is probably the truth!
"You have to pass the bill to see what's in it". Any leftist criticizing this is one of the lowest forms of life.
There better not be any "we must pass it before we read it"  statements made
Because there was someone with morals who was willing to do what is right in the Death Star.
Help us, Obi-Wan, you're our only hope!
@RandPaul - Yes, and the rebel plan was to blow it up...not blow it up and replace it with something else!
@RandPaul And this is why I distrust gubermint, immensely
You've now been retweeted by Rand Paul. Weird day, huh?
maybe the dingo ate their health bill
I guess we need Rogue One and Jyn to go get that bill. If it exists.
COURSE...NANCY PELOSER HAD TO "PASS" IT FIRST.....LIKE GAS!!!NANCY IS FOUL!!!
So it's at Trump Tower...
Trump family's Secret Service detail costs already exceed $12M. Projected cost to secure Trump Tower: $183M a year. https://goo.gl/v8E0qr 
@RandPaul 

Watch another movie, please.
The Death Star's more likely to exist, too.
You could post the bill in the METRO...everyone is focusing on Russia and Restrooms.
@aduanebrown Paul will not vote for anything but his own "plan". Selfish egotist.
well, that's because the Death Star plans existed in the first place
@RandPaul just tell someone in the state dept, it'll be out faster than a tweet.
Many Bothans died to bring you this take.
Forget about the bill. Just tell the American public, in detail, what your "great" replacement looks like.
The plans for blowing up the Death Star were more real than the GOP plan to  replace and repeal bill
@RandPaul  #StandWithRand
@RandPaul Doesn't this seem like a convienent way to meet covertly to get on the same page about Sessions/Russia? #russiagate
Your profile forgot to mention  that you are "illegal."
If you believe my profile then you're probably a Trump voter. It's fake news, yo.
If you asked them, they'd probably say that it's because Obamacare is more dangerous than a Death Star.
@RandPaul it's such a crapfest they don't want anyone to see it?
Almost like we will "... have to pass it, to find out what's in it...."
Beginning to think the 2016 deaths of Princess Laia and R2D2 may not have been coincidental.
and also less evil?
channeling Bill Mitchell, the House Obamacare bill is in our hearts.
I guess we can assume that @RandPaul is NOT part of the #GOP Russian Cartel then, he is out of the loop!
Randy never has been in.
Bills popular with the voters are always hidden from the opposition and the public.
buncha rats!
Considering the administration is a literal sieve, do you blame them?  Although it likely just doesn't exist.
