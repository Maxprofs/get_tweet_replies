Idea of sending everyone$$ from govt-is very short leap to Universal/rationed/cost controls. Obscenity
They have no way to "improve" ACA. So they contort themselves.  @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion
This is worse. Tax credits bad. Old way much better than any of this. Most states had pools
Until we get serious about cost containment, there's no good way out of this. @RandPaul << COWARD. @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion
Other ways to contain costs.Allowing cross state purchase of insurance will dramatically cut
No it will not. And you'll create a "too big to fail" concentration in insurance. @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows
You want to allow someone to charge you $600 for a ball point pen, don't expect lower costs @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows
Thank you both!  Please, ONLY the FREE MKT will SOLVE health care issues.  #FullRepeal
There is no "free market" in health insurance. It's why our system stinks. @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows
I pay a lot of lab work out of pocket bc it's half the price of the insurance rate.  Free Mkt works.
That's not the "free market." That's getting your car fixed w/o filing a claim. @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows
No, it's free mkt bc I go to a stand alone lab that doesn't take insurance.  Price is half of Dr office
Whatever you say. @RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows
AND HOW LONG WILL THIS "DEBATE" TAKE? You guys have had YEARS to work out a "Republican plan"!
@AmBeachy @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews Repeal Obamacare... All of it.

Return Healthcare to the Open Market.
@gmiller1952 @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews REPEAL ONLY!!!  Then market based solutions. No Govt run HC!  More entitlements!
It's OK, Senator. Your drug addled constituency won't be needing any health insurance. @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews
THE ONLY WAY!! 100% FULL #REPEAL !!!
No! Repeal leaves people unprotected for MONTHS while you guys bicker on a new version!!
no repeal without provisions for those currently saddled w Obamacare. Repeal must include protection for these ppl.
No,figure out a replacement BEFORE you repeal.Senator,do you realize repealing w/o a replacement will kill people?Or do you care?
covered till when?  November? Calendar much?
Could you elaborate? Didn't get your point.
Repeal now. Enrollment isn't until November. 6+ months to come up with suitable replacement.
They had seven years to think one up, and didn't. I have no faith in them making a good plan in 6 months...
Only a few can be courageous. Lets pass it to see whats in it...
You don't believe current Phase 3 plan can be passed. How would YOU pass "replace"?
@Lrihendry @RepMarkMeadows and make what provision for the ppl forced onto ACA now. leave them no coverage? Financial suicide.
.. Immediately cut illegals and migrants off of the system.. that will save big money. #MAGA
Heartless & tone deaf & a liar! People need & want healthcare! Many ppl deaths will be on your hands!
Thank you for demanding that premiums go down, making healthcare affordable. Insurance companies are #CORRUPT
Meadows NC marching in masses 2018 to the voting booths. We are ousting as many Republicans possibly
It must cut cost to work: eliminate waste, liability cost/ tort reform, excessive insurance profits, etc
Free Market: mandate transparent charges by provider to compare & shop. 
minimum gov involvement.
@freedomusa_ @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion egos sit down! This is @HouseGOP Bill do their thing, then @SenateGOP does theirs,combine
YES! #FullRepeal, then Replace after repeal!
#FullRepeal this mess, get it gone, then pass fixes like competition across state lines, torte reform.
@gardenofthegods @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews 
Is there an interim cushion? If people are told that,there won't be a panic
sir keep it up. A lot of people like your plan. Ryan is wrong and is a snake. Stand for USA!!
If it's repealed without another plan in place, won't that leave everyone without a plan?
what kind of irresponsible mess is this? don't take away healthcare without a replacement plan. wtf
It will be a fatal blow to the R's if you repeal the most popular parts of Obamacare.
@POTUS @SecPriceMD I have already sent plans to#KillObamaCare & Launch Replacement ~ No Delay #Hireme
No! Peoples lives hang in the balance! ALL AT ONE TIME!
AHHHHHHHHHHH, you need to be still in rewrites...reading this mess now...
WHAT??
Let's Work with the President to push the Obamacare Replacement Plan through Congress.
Maybe look at/debate your options first so you have some clue what you're doing beforehand.
Repeal would be a public health crisis. Only people with the establishment want that.
Let's take away health care for millions and then take years to come up with a solution. So brilliant.
Who will insure Kentuckians when Humana drops out in 2018?
Stand united and pass it does not need to be perfect
PLS let the ppl know this new healthcare is B A D!  Give back to the ppl! Capitalism works
Don't worry, Rand...the kinks will all be worked out. Keep the faith.
Please include in the repeal bill that all illness &accidents are required to stop while you debate.K?
It seems @SpeakerRyan wants to destroy it and provide free care to illegals. Repeal Ryan!
Trump's role in shady hotel deal, w/partners tied to Iran's Revoluntionary Guard.

New entitlement reads like Trojan horse to Universal care.Concedes govt responsible for everyones care
agree senator. Please make this happen.
Have you seen this?

Also, allow everyone to save in HSAs!
#RINOCare sucks
if what they released today is the replacement plan then we are screwed. That is one big mess.Stop this Sen @RandPaul
will you do a Periscope and explain why you don't like it so we understand it? @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews
Hey Paul, lets cut you open then debate what we are doing.
.@RandPaul @RMConservative @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion Please keep fighting this. The House has sold out the voters. Lied to us.
@POTUS if Rs want 2 keep majority, keep promise #FullRepeal NOT #ObamacareLite #StandWithRand
You're OK with suddenly pulling the rug out from under people so they have no medical care?
you were the chosen one!
It might help if you call it by the Official name Affordable Care Act and not the derogatory name the GOP assigned it!
Yes! The voice of reason!
NO #subsidies or #taxcredits. Get gov't out of healthcare. #Obamacare #RepealandReplace
@JuliaLaPorta @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews Rand Paul & Mark Meadows sound alert on "Obamacare Lite". Very little change.
I read your plan Sir, I like & respect you but this would bankrupt millions.
the gop is a fraud
You bitched about ACA for 6 years 
You have nothing
You don't give a shit about Americans
NOT 1 SHIT.
wait, didn't you ask to have both done at the same time? , well anyway, just make sure not obamalite
Yes. Get the Federal Government out of healthcare.
KY coal miners .. understand this 
Repealing ACA is code for 
TAX CUT FOR WEALTHY @ YOUR EXPENSE
Fix ACA 
Call it by correct name
Instead of robbing poor & giving to rich. 
I can't stand you.
you guys bitched for 7 years and never came up with a replacement. Do we have to wait another 7yrs?
Healthcare should not be run by the federal government.
the GOP RINO slime won't repeal! Big insurance protected! Huge new welfare program now!
You have to repeal and replace at the same time people can't be left with out insurance.
it's the replacement that should include the repeal so people aren't caught in the middle
@influx_Divine @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews Don't you think Dems would block replacement just to harm @GOP
@influx_Divine @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews If you repeal separate, then won't you need 60 senate votes to replace?
Are you good with this? DHS Sec says he's considering separating children from their parents to deter immigration
@AngieStein15 @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews Has to be done together seperate will make bigger problems
- That has been the promise since 2010.  GOP credibility is gone b/c of it.
@RLibertyCaucus @RepMarkMeadows @fxnopinion @FoxNews dont replace. No constitutional authority for federal #healthcare
There is no Paradise in this world; no Utopia. WWIII, Armageddon, the Apocalypse is coming. The return of Lord Jesus the Christ.
Do your constituents in KY know how badly you want to kill them. Then again, you have healthcare paid for by their tax dollars.
There should be no direct or indirect taxes on food. That means no fuel tax and no tolls on roads. To lower the price on food.
Doctors should not have to pay property taxes, to lower the costs of medical care.
Cronies in @GOP @SpeakerRyan @LindseyGrahamSC @JohnMcCain want to pass Obamacare lite on American #USA
Yes let ppl die,  after 6 years there is nothing and to leave it would be what Americans want
