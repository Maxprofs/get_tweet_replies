@DJDadMCMom @RandPaul you stand for foreign business and foreign coal GodTweetstm?  Shh is that
Do explain we are all ears...
@forrest_fire1 @DJDadMCMom @RandPaul  coal is garbage fuel and should be retired completely
@RealTrillBill @DJDadMCMom @RandPaul bill are okay with paying 100% more on your electric bill and removing thousands of jobs?
@forrest_fire1 @DJDadMCMom @RandPaul well nat gas is cheaper than appalachian coal right now. also gas fired generation is more efficient.
@RealTrillBill @DJDadMCMom @RandPaul true,  but you okay with much larger electric bill and thousands of family's going on gov. Subsidies?
@forrest_fire1 @DJDadMCMom @RandPaul most large utilities in the south are retiring coal generation. what good is coal if no one uses it
@RealTrillBill @DJDadMCMom @RandPaul coal produces electrical current.   Who doesn't use electricity?
@RandPaul Coal kills the environment, buddy.. How come the earth doesnt fall into your "libertarian" agenda?
@coldhard_fakss @alllibertynews @RandPaul, coal is the earth. I don't think she minds. You mind, why should I bother your opinion? Or anyone
@pixalkiller31 @alllibertynews @RandPaul do I really have to explain to you how fossil fuels work? You look at weather trends in the artic?
@coldhard_fakss @alllibertynews @RandPaul, How 'bout you do some actual science before you quote your flacid bs at me. I will own you.
@pixalkiller31 @alllibertynews @RandPaul dont have time to explain 7th grade science to you. Climate change is as real as evolution
@coldhard_fakss @alllibertynews @RandPaul, "It's real because I say it is." Nice argument.
@pixalkiller31 @alllibertynews @RandPaul here is a nice short simple video to catch you up on modern science https://www.climaterealityproject.org/video/climate-101-bill-nye …
@coldhard_fakss @alllibertynews, This science, actually, debunks this whole climate change boondoggle.
@RandPaul if you're concerned about the environment & EVERYONE should be....vote for #ImWithHer
@RandPaul @alllibertynews freaking evil, treasonous bit&$!!
@RandPaul yes I stand with you against Hillary
@RandPaul hillary is the only thing that could be worse for this country than the current POTUD
@RandPaul I am a coal truck driver in Wv and I thank you sir for fighting for my job!

@RandPaul Trump 619 v. 696 opposed. Tap your pops for VP and get back in for the brokered convention.
@RandPaul coal in Appalachia is a product of early 1900s tax breaks and gov't subsidizing - I thought you were against that?
@RandPaul "Stand strong for coal!!!" Are you serious? So much wrong in that statement.
@MillerRoad @RandPaul you are against  energy and jobs?
@RandPaul You should encourage Natgas over coal.
@Oilfielder @RandPaul he represents his constituents and the 10,000 jobs lost in KY due to Obama's war on coal
@adlangston75 @RandPaul For the common good of USA.  It's not about one group of constituents, that's the problem now.  Rand stands for part
@Oilfielder @RandPaul coal affects the steel, riverboat, and railway industries. You must gradually change, not hastily change.
@adlangston75 @RandPaul And would have but for politics. If politics replaces right, we are all screwed.
@Oilfielder @RandPaul He has stood up and fought hard for all Americans. He is supposed to do what is right 4 KY
@adlangston75 @RandPaul For the common good of USA.  It's not about one group of constituents, that's the problem now.  Rand stands for part
@adlangston75 @RandPaul But that may not be the true right answer.  Natgas will win in time over coal.
@Oilfielder @RandPaul I don't disagree. Regulation are killing our economy.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Why is the Republican Party supporting government subsidized wind and solar? Do you guys ever talk to Engineers?
@RandPaul she's not saying coal going to disappear overnight but with more renewable energy emerging it'll be SLOWLY faze out & #ImWithHer..
@RandPaul wants to protect coal workers & their families Don't get it twisted
@RandPaul Also, please stop Trunp
@RandPaul @ZanderBrant  and we didn't lose any lives in Libya either! Yea Right Hillary. Did you forget something ?
@RandPaul #StillRanding

.@RandPaul does the bidding of his Coal Baron bosses, blaming #HillaryClinton for what free market forces are doing. #killing coal
@RandPaul 我希望美国驻中国大使联系我办理美国签证

@RandPaul @StormForce_1 coal? Hell no
@RandPaul can't handle the randle
@RandPaul Burning of coal promotes global warming and pollutes our lakes and rivers.  Big fail Rand, let's get with it!
@RandPaul Please get back in the race. Run as libertarian with your dad Thomas Sowell judge Nap and Tom Woods in your corner PLEASE
@RandPaul our air is poisoned,, our water is poisonous, all you have is Coal??? It's 2016 not 1816!
@RandPaul  You knowit couldnt budge me if u tried #StandWithRand #RandingStrong #StillRanding
@RandPaul @PatriotCorner if you endorse cruz
@RandPaul does standing strong for coal mean the end of coal subsidies?
@RandPaul You better stand strong for coal. We need to keep coal miners working.
@RandPaul Stand strong for coal? That's one of the few positions Rand has that I don't agree with. #AdvanceAmerica
@RandPaul if you care about Kentuckians check out Colorado's economic boom. #justsaynotocoal
@RandPaul Because you don't want to leave a habitable planet for your great grand children or......?
@RandPaul why stand strong for coal? Let's stand strong for 21st century jobs, that don't end life prematurely.
.@cjbo33 .@alllibertynews .@RandPaul You need coal to smelt the steel to make things for the 21st century.
@TylerGSpires @alllibertynews @RandPaul it's just the miners that they won't need anymore.
@JillSmith81975 @RandPaul Insane for politicians to intentionally put companies out of business and American workers out of jobs.
@RandPaul #BanFOSSILFUELS #StopOIL #RenewableEnergy #AlternativeENERGY #TechnologyMEETSEcology #MACCNIPH #IMmaculateEMPIRE
@RandPaul Who are you supporting for the presidency?
@KellyBerard1 @alllibertynews @RandPaul he has said he will support the nominee, but will not back anyone before then.
@adlangston75 @alllibertynews @RandPaul Okay, Amanda.  I hadn't heard anything so I appreciate the info. Thank you!
@RandPaul That is bad. Vote @realDonaldTrump with Rand as Secretary of @USTreasury Encourage hillary to keep talking say its a good thing...
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @USTreasury ...and maybe she'll pre-announce more industrial job eliminations between now and the election & lose
@RandPaul I don't agree with you on this, but I'll probably be attacked again by hundreds of coal country folk like I was on Facebook.
@RandPaul I don't disagree with you on much, but coal is so 19th century.
@RandPaul I respect many of your positions, but this is a backward idea that will soon be irrelevant.  You're better than this.
@RandPaul Her smug attitude that she knows better than us. That's how losers get ahead. They convince you that they are right.
@RandPaul NO
@RandPaul unplug your iphones, coal is charging it! http://Worldcoal.org 
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump supports the coal industry. As my senator I would love to see u support him
@RandPaul yes
@RandPaul Gary Johnson/Rand Paul 2016
@RandPaul you dropped out of the race since u had zero support
@RandPaul Someone must kill the jobs that support what is going to kill the planet.
@RandPaul Bring back the steam train! More black lung! Find jobs for these people instead of them having to risk their lives 4 our energy
@RandPaul it's 2016 who in their right mind supports coal?
@Sundevilinsa @RandPaul Dr. Paul represents his constituents and many are coal miners. I support clean coal.
@RandPaul @bulldog338 You should have stood with Ted Cruz.
@TigerTownBaby @RandPaul W/all due respect, I sincerely hope Sen Paul joins Sen Lee endorse Cruz,who is the only Principle Conservative!
@RandPaul Sorry its Hilary or Trump I know who I would vote for
@RandPaul I' m against Donald #Trump, sorry.
@RandPaul No! I am not for Hillary, but certainly not for destroying God's creation anymore!
@1GMarty @RandPaul isn't coal part of God's creation? It's  under the earth.
@RandPaul Why, why, why did you have to drop out of the race for President?
@RandPaul Long, loaded coal trains used to run thru my town several times a day. No more. Heard a train, went to see -- a few cars of scrap.
@BetaNipson @RandPaul Loss of coal mines have cost jobs in the steel, railroad, and riverboat industries. #CleanCoal
@RandPaul Rand Paul is good for America thanks Dr Pual
@RandPaul If you want to dig for coal you gotta stop fracking around.
@RandPaul please endorse & help @tedcruz beat @realDonaldTrump--you are so needed in this movement!
@mom2feebs @RandPaul @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump IthinkCruz is a backup for puppetTrumpIf puppetTrump lose there is puppetCruz to save the day
@RandPaul "We're gonna shut down coal mines and fire miners -- cackle, cackle, cackle." Hillary stinks.
@RandPaul why don't you stand up for wind powered energy?
@RandPaul NOPE ! coal is a poison,..
@RandPaul un less you want to slowly fade it out,... then dah,... yeah !
@flndr6 @RandPaul I guess you've never hear of #CleanCoal.
@adlangston75 @RandPaul see,... it was that easy to get me to join !
@adlangston75 @RandPaul but will we continually once we lose,... and we will, people somehow love the boast ste est people ?
@flndr6 @RandPaul we should explore cleaner energy, but it needs to be a transition. We also need to make opportunities for new jobs
@RandPaul people who live near coal generated electricity plants suffer non stop, no I wont support that, natural gas is way to go 100%
@RandPaul about even now between coal, natural gas for fueling electricity generating plants, has to be 100% natural gas
@RandPaul only time coal should be used is for production of steel then U need the high temps that natural gas can not produce
@RandPaul I will Rand!
