@RandPaul @Team_Rand
@RandPaul @Team_Rand good run Rand. Enjoyed what you brought to the debates!
Trump 2016
@randpaul @team_rand @dmashak #commandoForRando
@RandPaul  It was a true shame that you had to drop out Doc. You represent the party far better than your competitors. #IStoodWithRand.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand How did your strategy of attacking Trump work out for you?
@MRMitchnet the fact that he attacked Trump in spite of the political consequences shows he has character. Unlike Ted Cruz
@Wikkiwahh678 Trump is the only remaining candidate that is anti-globalist and anti-establishment, attacking Trump was stupid and cost him!
Rand should endorse Dr Ben Carson. Poetic Justice.Check his site. Where your support should go. @RandPaul @RandStudents @Team_Rand
@RandPaul @Team_Rand @tedcruz will win #nhprimary w/your endorsement. Establishment, media & Trump are all attacking him. Stand 4 liberty!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand #EndYemenWar  Even with ceasefire now,  many will die due to logistics of delivering food aid  : Time is of Essence
@RandPaul @Team_Rand i wish you would at least campaign in NH and see how it goes. if your names still on the ticket,I'm voting 4 you
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @Team_Rand  Rand the man with all the plans for real leadership Constitution is the only way. #StandWithRand #CFR
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Thank You all. Your Awesome !!!!!!!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand look forward to another run in 4 years. For now keep fighting the good fight in senate #RandPaul #RandRally #Liberty
No 1 will read this, but when NatDebt is$25trill we will need some1 to make tough choices. C U in 2020 @RandPaul @Team_Rand
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Godspeed in your Senate race. @dougstafford
@RandPaul @Team_Rand I really believe it was more prudent to have waited until after N.H to call it quits. Yet, on to the senate race!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand your inspiring to me and you will and always will get my vote
@RandPaul @Team_Rand, you were my favorite.  I have to SMH at who is leading this race! God help us. We do need you in the Senate!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand To bad he didn't try harder and wait till April to suspend his race.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand You are to be commended for a well fought campaign! #wsrp
@RandPaul @Team_Rand whatever happened to affirmative action?
@RandPaul @Team_Rand - dr Paul, it was a good fight and am glad you are stepping down
@MikeGhouse @RandPaul @Team_Rand now he needs to pick a candidate who best fits his principles and endorse him so we beat Trump, Hill, &Bern
@RandPaul @Team_Rand https://vine.co/v/iJvZxJI9TZA 
@RandPaul @Team_Rand ):
@RandPaul @Team_Rand good bye
@RandPaul @Team_Rand be well & win re-election here in Ky- We need you!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand - Thank you, Rand, and your whole team.  I read a bit about your challenges - continue putting freedom above all else!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand I wish we had more of that libertarian leaning media dominating the air waves. Then you would win without trying.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Farewell, Dr. Paul. Now please go un-do the damage that O'Care has caused before everyone loses their ass(ets)/subsidy.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand wish you would have stuck around until the end of this month. You never know what could happen. #StandWithRand
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Ayn Rand is a good "university" to attend. I am an alumnus. Good foundation, but there are others also good, try Burke.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Sorry to see you leaving the race. I hope you'll run again.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Rand suspended, not ended. He is on ballot off all 50 states. We can still make it right! 
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Let everyone know that Rand suspended, not ended. He is on ballot of all 50 states. We still have a chance to do right
@RandPaul @Team_Rand we are #stillranding
@RandPaul @Team_Rand - Sad to see you go! The fight for liberty doesn't stop here! #RandRally #StandWithRand
@reeldealpro @RandPaul @Team_Rand He is still on all the ballots and we can/should vote for him. He did not drop out.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Rand is still on ballot on all 50 states. Do the right thing fellas! Peace 
@RandPaul @Team_Rand I love you Rand Paul.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Everyone called me wacky because I love your dad too...
@RandPaul @bcwilliams92 @Team_Rand Thanks for all your work to get rid of NDAA and audit the FED
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Thanks for all you do. Best of luck from MN on your re-election

@harleygrl3465 @RandPaul @Team_Rand Salute U.
Just went to Trump camp.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Stay there...WE the people need you....until the next "Challenge"
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Count on me team Rand here in KY.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand I got the election blues. I was voting for you. Don't know who to vote for now :(
@RandPaul @bcwilliams92 @Team_Rand If Rand wanted to save the Republic he would endorse Ted Cruz and go campaign for him but, he's too vain.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand U R The ONE person with all the right stuff to save this once great republic. Our electorate is full of dumbasses.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand sadly the GOP does not interest me anymore.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Do we need 4 years of HRC, Bernie or Trump for America to finally embrace fiscal responsibility, liberty, and less war?
@RandPaul @Team_Rand so sad and disappointed you would've been great
@RandPaul @Team_Rand....you are needed more in the Senate...Congress is a mess keep up the fight
@RandPaul @Team_Rand thank you for putting up a good fight.
@RandPaul @_CFJ_ @Team_Rand So need him there. :)
@RandPaul @Team_Rand I wanted to vote for you Rand. Unfortunately the RNC and the GOP are very very corrupt. Go to the senate. fight for us
@RandPaul @Team_Rand I was rooting for you! Please don't endorse any of the GOP clowns that remain!! #liberty #youCruzWeLose #DumpTrump
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Rand's the only/best candidate qualified to be President. He's still on ballot. I'll vote for no other! #StandWithRand
@RandPaul @Team_Rand 

Good luck, you are very good for this country.

Trump!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Join the Libertarian Party. The two party system in the USA is toxic. Fifty types of coffee but only 2 parties? #fail
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Best of Luck with your Senate race. If you should decide to restart the POTUS campaign I will be here for you. Paul2020

@RandPaul @Team_Rand I'm #StillRanding #StandWithRand #RandGirling #RandPaul2016
@RandPaul  I wish you all well. I still believe you are the only #gop candidate worth voting for in this #2016  #primary #standwithrand
@RandPaul @Team_Rand I believe you can do more good in Senate. We need more like you to fix that broken hall of injustice.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand See you in 4 years? Hope so.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Kudos for your efforts. Senate needs you. Don't give up. Audit the Fed
@RandPaul @Team_Rand The single most faithful disciple of the intent of the Framers since Ron Paul - a shame citizens don't understand/care!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand  Dr. Paul, we always need a guy who SAYS what others are thinking...or, least, hopefully thinking !
@RandPaul @Team_Rand I'm still on board if u continue after the senate race or even 2020 but w/o u Hillary wins so sad :(
@RandPaul @Team_Rand You're not compelled to endorse. But if you do, get something for it. You're not Santorum. You're a heavyweight.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand I had the highest hopes since before you even announced. Maybe timing will be better in a few years.If we're still here
@RandPaul @Team_Rand oh man, I'm bawling again! But we need you in the Senate!
@RandPaul Great team, great candidate! Now go retain that Senate seat so those of us who love liberty have a voice! God speed Rand.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand thank-you,you are a good man
@RandPaul @Team_Rand you will never be accepted by the GOP establishment. Go to your roots and come to the libertarian party where u belong
@RandPaul @Team_Rand This group fought for ideas that I do not agree with but were not about a hate or demagoguery but a legitimate vision.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Endorse Bernie Sanders
@RandPaul @Team_Rand And now I cry as the last sane republican nominee drops out.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand 
Still on ticket in all 50States 
So vote @RandPaul
@RandPaul @Team_Rand We Love you Team Rand!  Never give up on Liberty!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand best wishes to you.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Keep fighting the good fight. God Bless You!
@RandPaul @Team_Rand You’re a good man, Rand Paul.  We need you in the Senate.  Don’t get discouraged.
@RandPaul hope you run again next election. We need more moderate Republicans like yourself.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand How can I support your race to keep your senate seat?
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Now it's time to get behind #AuditTheFed cosponsored @tedcruz
@RandPaul @Team_Rand thank you Rand, and thank you for what you stand for! #americanrights
@RandPaul @Team_Rand focus on one thing then come back strong and expierenced in 2020 the people will grow tired of liberlas  the next 4 yrs
@RandPaul @Team_Rand The one voice in the primaries who made sense.
@93_99_13Noles @RandPaul @Team_Rand  

On the Republican side, yes.
@Kloxen @RandPaul @Team_Rand On either side.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand Thank you for having stood up for #America, Rand. I hope that you run again in four years! #OneMoreTime
@RandPaul @Team_Rand  

Endorse sanders :)
