How do minimum wage works afford health savings accounts?
you can have $20 taken out of your check for an HSA or you can have it taken out in taxes... your pick
Uh-huh… since minimum wage workers can barely afford food and shelter where does that money come from?
that $20 is coming out of your check one way or the other. Which would you prefer it goes to?
Not necessarily, subsidies make up the difference.  Paul’s plan also doesn’t fully address pre-exist conditions.
my point is with an HSA a MW worker has more control over where their $ goes since HSA contributions are TAX FREE
I’m guessing you’ve never lived on min. wage and had health problems.
wrong. Thanks for playing. I would have LOVED to be able to save my $ to pay for healthcare. But it was taken in taxes instead.
Your plan is great. Respects individual choices, freedom & economically feasible.
no thank you Kentucky's health Care is bad enough without GOP making it worse. Were ranked 47th in healthcare
@ClassyLady4DJT @RandPaul will it own up states borders so that it's more fluid, less expensive, & create healthy competition?
I mean,  open up states
You President?
What?
Russian group supports the murder of Americans by repealing ACA. KGB Paul stands with Putin.
you are plhttps://www.facebook.com/RoadandTrack/posts/10154986222586091l
HSAs are terrible unless you are young with no children and no health problems. Crazy high deductibles too.
you mean HMO's?  HSA is a pretax savings plan, not insurance.  HMO's also had copays, not deductibles!
HSA does zero to attack cost, unless you are free to directly buy med care rather than insurance.
Why do we need ANY govt. plan? Let the #freemarket work! #MAGA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Unfortunately large organizations and industry need (some) regulation.
Lib B.S.
- will it give me back the great insurance I USED to have before Obama? I liked my Cadillac Insurance!
Free market health insurance equals more medical bill bankruptcies Those bankruptcies makes healthcare more costly
Really liked his explanation to Bartoromo. If you endorse I am all in!
@hectormorenco @RandPaul Rand Paul needs to be at the helm for the replacement.
how much better if @CABFund #Veterans patrolling streets replace Uber & pump millions into healthcare.
I will never stand with a bunch of Racist Republicans that believe the world should revolve around them, smh. No.
Guessed that from your previous posts. God Bless you, and keep pursuing happiness.
What about Flynn? You seriously going to overlook his actions to promote GOP brand over justice?
Patient-centered? NO!  I would lose my healthcare entirely under this plan!  At 64, w/chronic health probs & no $!
it's the plan of NO PLAN!!! Love my country! Hate Traitors!
Rands  the man!
read the constitution! Not an enumerated power of Congress, Fed Gov leave health care to the people.
More HSAs?! Laughable and pathetic. @FreedomWorks @RandPaul #Obamacare
I'll believe it when I see it.  Been waiting for 7 years.
U said 2 let the Budget & CR Expire & re-appropriate ALL Spending Bills spending 1 @ a time.
How MANY Bills is that?
No, rolling back taxes on those who have most benefited from American economy is not an option.
#GiveBack
Why is government involved in my healthcare? Why are you fixing/replacing something that should have never existed?
Just send me the S22 in full so that I can read it and compare it to the PCACA. Obamacare don't exist.
If the GOP had a plan they would have done it 20 years ago. This is BS. The GOP is bogus/Racist.
why don't you repeal and replace @SpeakerRyan 
you should be more worried about the orange clown @realDonaldTrump  & #PresidentBanan destroying democracy.
What ever health insurance turns out to be All govt workers must use it
Be honest, Rand, you just really don't have a plan and you about to mess up America.
care. What so special bout RandPaulCare or RepublicanCare, smh.
Also, who is to say that RandPaulCare is viable and needed? There are hundreds of ways to provide universal health
Also, please stop using "Obamacare" it was never "Obamacare" other than the fact that President Obama got Congress
Provide a side by side, line by #PCACA Act. These are selected highlights. I want to see the entire proposal, smh.
somebody fix the typos. Just makes you look bad.
The pre-existing condition shouldnt be aseparate pool,but spread over the whole population,no healthcare "profiling"
All types of insurance get an actuarial table.
And the free market worked so well before...that's what we had right, free market healthcare?
Get #government out of our #healthcare #FullRepeal
NO GOOD FOR US ONLY FOR INS CO.
So what's the delay?  No other Republicans plan. Go for it.
Because patients and profits go hand in hand! Love making money off sickness! WOOT!
Roll it out!   Lets look at it.
No penalties for refusal to sign up.
think seniors are "trapped in Medicare" & want to get rid if it. Free-marlet HSAs mean cheap plans with insane deductibles.
Or more expensive plans with no deductible.
That is where the 9,000 deductibles we have now are coming from.
Medicare, Medicaid, Emergency Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)must be  abolished  or NOTHING will help
It aint perfect, but At least Senator Paul is an adult about the process and is thinking about the people. Thank you
Some of your proposal is good, Randy Paul, but the pre-existing condition part of your plan is vague and unequal.
always liked Rand
many former Ron Paul people believe you sold out

@LizMair @RandPaul you can take your replacement and shove it where the sun don't shine #MakeAmericaSickAgain
you have to let the free market work,it'll be like pulling off bandade at the start but in a few yrs, lower prices!
- is that the way it was before Obamacare?
Joe, it was before govt got involved in1965 w/medcre. A real free mkt cures all, quality, and prices
#StandWithRand
Nice job Rand!
lies! Killers! Fascists!
Please vote NO on Betsy Devos. She should not be able to buy a position in the cabinet. And she is not qualified.
that's an oxymoron.
No, We Can't Trust Rand Paul on Race Issues
Please get this passed ASAP! 
Senator Paul is a light in the darkness. Agree or not his objectivity is intelligent and sincere.
there is no plan Rand !!!
Rand Paul Has a Race Problem
hope it's simple and not gov't style stupid
Let's see a start on litigation reform in conjunction with it. That would make a HUGE impact!
This is not an issue. Really.
a health savings account? You assume people have thousands of $ to save? Millions are barely putting food table.
I love you @RandPaul but you must eliminate 3rd party payer system to get real competition back into healthcare industry.
But I have to say that reading your plan, I agree with all the provisions in it. 
3rd party payer is final obstacle.
Yes!! Thank you, Senator Paul!
thank you @RandPaul
