this is because ppl are retiring, we are aging. Obama was improving things.
now we have trump utterly incompetent and an oligarchy. Expect real GDP to be bad. Expect a potential depression
don't believe his lies.
http://www.alternet.org/story/156234/exposing_how_donald_trump_really_made_his_fortune%3A_inheritance_from_dad_and_the_government%27s_protection_mostly_did_the_trick … the gov gave him a ton in bankruptcies
he only has a big ego, to the point of delusions. He conned the American ppl.  Like you I'm sorry
not just that it also creates a false narrative by using an image to create fear w/out right context
instead here is the graph that doesn't exclude women
The Labor force participation rate counts only ages 18-65. Also, total participation no. & that of men's is very close.
.@RandPaul you're too smart to ignore that this is because of shifting demographics and baby boomers retiring.
... wow you're dumb. 

Ok so boomers are a larger portion of the population than previous retiring groups.
also not true. 04-14 16-24 is down 1% (increased educational attendance) 25-54 is  down .2% (negligible) 55+ is up 1%
.@RipperBravoSix the problem is that since that 55+ bucket keeps getting bigger and has 1/3 the employment of the 25-54 bucket...
. @RandPaul hrm....
After decades of anti men&especially anti anglo men,the numbers have dropped. Now many are sad little snowflakes !
those are just my ex husbands.
more women means things will be better. That is progress not decline. #mustsucktobeawhiteguy
"More women"? @LoveArmyGeneral @RandPaul Rand Paul doesn't care about women working. Rand Paul wants women to stay at home & make babies.
I know he is trying to delay progress.
Speaking of waste. 21 Billion a yr for windmills & ethanol! Al Gore admitted ethanol was bad & he suppported it for votes
how dare those wicked women!!
if you're going to turn decline, you're going to need to get those lazy bastards, the Baby Boomers, off retirement. Math matters.
the picture seems brighter when you include women...
"Include women"? @adam_inman @RandPaul Rand does chose to not include women, because Rand Paul never includes women.
@RipperBravoSix the portion of Americans 65+ has tripled since the start of this graph. Among men that # likely higher due to Wars
further it excludes women. Female breadwinners are a thing now which is probably only a slight factor here
.@RandPaul @RipperBravoSix further labor force participation among those 65 and older dropped 25% over the course of this graph
.@RandPaul @RipperBravoSix and that's the whole population. Just among men one would guess that drop is larger (as women entering offsets)
Someone stop those baby boomers from retiring!
someone inform Nick about the data-reality of why US Labor Force Participation rate has nosedived:
Half retirements, half unskilled workers having jobs wiped out by recession/automation.
There are more job openings today than ever before. People don't have the skills. Republicans blocked action to help that
the gov. doesn't need to educate them, let the private companies invest in re-education rather than letting them go.
WORK TO SAVE THE FREEDOM OF THIS COUNTRY FROM TRUMP AND HIS MENTOR...PUTIN. SEE THE END OF YOUR COUNTRY'S DEMOCRACY COMING. ACT!!!
I'm sick of paying for able bodied people to sit on their ass & collect while I work, need a limit child welfare
The new NY subway cost 4 billion. Divert all GREEN tax subsidies&allow the market to work & use that money for projects
got one of those by age?
We have the perfect PEOTUS to continue the decline.
Please share more random graphs without context. #orangeovrlord
Stats don't lie. But liars like Rand Paul use stats to scare his voters into fearful thinking. @OrangeOvrlord @RandPaul
@alllibertynews Why wud ppl want 2 work when our new Dictator is threatening nuclear war? Dont u think the GOP need 2 investigate?

labor force includes people looking for work, the employment population ratio is even lower
more like looking forward to watching the new administration get ppl working.
I propose to All, that entitlements are treason promoted by our enemies to lead to our decline! We must now change the System!
@TeamTrumpAZ 
Unbelievable.
A chart,inverted,of the success of America.That so many people don't have to work is triumph. And we need the boomers to fade away
Dramatic looking charts deceptive. Must adjust for age demographic shift. %of prime work age is only 2% short of highest ever.
What's your plan to counterbalance automation in both manufacturing and now the service industry? That's where jobs are going.
Yay!!!
watch how you and the new administration will destroy the middle class. You guys will finish what bush started.#HumanCrisis
will be nice to get some industry back!
we'll see, got a few stop loss orders after the recent ralley., rooting for you 2020 or so....
what about the rest of the graph?
You lost my respect
your chart is misleading. You want to go back to the 1950s?
thank you is in order ,Sir
Please tell me one of my state's senators understands that women work now, and the largest generation in US history is retiring.
Keep up the good work Sen.
Wow. There's been a structural decline since c.1950. Must be Obama's fault...
this chart has to be bull shit.
the combination of technology and globalization has taken its toll.
not unless they change monetary policy.  Keynesianism is killing us but it sounds like more of the same is coming.
You're too smart to think this is primarily bc of outsourcing. Please talk about automation and technology
.@RandPaul I wish U & Ur dad would be INSIDE the new adm. #TrumpTrain #AmericaFirst #MAGA #tcot #tlot #dems #libertarian #uspoli #cdnpoli

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300002 …
Does this chart take into account women starting to work and baby boomers retiring?
Have you factored in the effect of aging population?
Are you going to magically re-create a world in which computerized automation doesn't exist? Jobs and work have changed since '50s
it may not be as bad as it looks in that chart http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS?locations=US&name_desc=true …
If this is only counting men, isn't our labor force participation significantly better now?
But @potus is gloating about the jobs HE created... like professional full time fence jumpers and refugees....?
There are more retirees (who live longer) and more college students. These 2 contribute to much of this -- and you know it.
How about starting with removing ACA mandate which reduced full time workers to part time & part time earnings forced to pay ACA
Does this graph account for increased military personnel and retirees? This graph tells me that boomers are getting old. Shocking
We all need to give the new administration a chance to show what they can do.
.@RandPaul but what does the curve look like for women?
do you have a chart that takes out those who are retired?
Sending women out into combat is a further sign of a decadent society.
look at the tag on your shirt and pants.  Tell me what it says.
excactly rand! Jobs, jobs, jobs
- Definetly need to educate people for the jobs of the future, not the past.
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=ccol  #FRED @stlouisfed
Why work?  Just stay home with mom and dad.  And play video games. right?
The Obama trend is going up, even tho boomers are retiring. You know this, but play dump for your undereducated. Pathetic.
With tariffs & trade wars? @justinamash #makeamericavenezuela
Is American civilization not also based on women working? Or do they just belong in the home?
Is this hope http://M.O.is  going to miss. I guess she hadn't a clue what her husband has done to this country.
BLOCK THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL
Sir, the jobs are horrible and pay just as bad. Are you honestly surprised people have given up on the American dream?
THANKS for being a CLASS ACT, Dr. Paul. Didn't know if u were aware=@RealBenCarson has ALWAYS spoken highly of u 2 his supporters!
So...women joining the labor force in greater numbers has lead to "the decline of American civilization"?
1. This is due to a shift in demographic as the baby boomers retire. 2. Why show a graph excluding half of the population?
The reason for decline is angry white men refuse to get educated. The hard truth is many are not even qualified to flip burgers!
unacceptable for America. Thanks Senator
I rspct & appreciate UR willingness 2 B optimistic & gracious about R new President & his administration.#MAGA #BetterTogether 
what happens to the graph when you add women?
Rand Paul has already advocated for term limits.  The rest of Congress (Dems and Republicans alike) voted him down
You retweeted the Adam Saleh hoax. Your timeline reads like a caricature of a SJW liberal.  The only psycho here is you
FIX THIS, spread the word, work for the people and not your pockets, scrap the waste and get Americans to work
Can you also chart the percentage of men over 65 over the same period? Also, use a standard Y axis?
only paul-senpi can make America great again ;-;
i truly hope ur genuine n have Trumps back he is our only hope please protect him and stand with him and defend him the left=evil
How absolutely stunning.
there need to be tribunals of all globalists! Find traitors and put them on trial for treason! Find all globalists!
I'm in! Should we start with Trump and his appointments? Maybe Ivanka for outsourcing shoe line? #perceptionTrumpsfacts
sure, if you have proof, go ahead. But you don't understand globalists, dummy.Look at CFR Council on Foreign Relations
#StandWithRand and were all ecstatic you are there GOLLIE thx God thxu Rand for all u do.
66 yr old still working btw Ban ALL immigration 6 mo until Border is secure & IMMIG SYTEM FIXED  & NO $ for migrants, Syr rebels
You start to get men working when you stop paying them to stay home!!!
@chrislhayes  But are there partly less people in work force because baby boomers are retired and not working?
And this chart is just men. Many more women in workforce since 1950. Dr. Paul your chart is deceiving.
that's because the right is trying to cling on to declining industry and isn't investing in the future.
is there a chart for women?
Hoping Trump can help make the decline stop and move forward. The World Liberals( Commies ) only push Welfare programs for votes.
is there one for women's participation rate?
.@RandPaul automation?; outsourcing?; retirements?  No wait, it was #Obama, the day he took office in 1955 it's been all downhill from then!

scary
... need to see by age band ...
I bet we have fewer ox carts today than in 1850 too. #getheoxesworkingagain
this is the kind of trash that makes sure you will not succeed out side of Kentucky. Sad I once defended you.
I expect Senator @RandPaul to be President @realDonaldTrump's strongest supporter in the Senate. So much of their vision is shared.
Huh, Looks like we should get unions back in our lives, and put tax rates back to what they were in 1950's - #MAGA
While at the same time Obama brags about his great work on labour and employment. Smh..
American Civilization is failing?? Save the apple pies, dammit!
