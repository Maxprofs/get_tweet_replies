Is that the arms deal Trump just made with them last mont?
Mr. Paul, what you and the others are doing is wonderful. All the people who complain about Russia cannot cast a critical eye  at Saudi
The shooting in Alexandria could have been prevented by passing a guncuntrol Bill or referendum then we could have restricted the bar arms !
A bill that does what?
Thanks, for trying to give peace a chance. Where can we see how the senators voted? I'm curious to see where they stand on this issue
I don’t know the names…but I think blocking arms sales to Saudis was defeated by six votes…and five democrats voted against it.
Yeah, it says it was defeated. I'm mostly wondering how Sanders voted?
YOU mean Saudi Arabia, the ppl that sent their Bad Hombres 2 US on 9//11 that we have signed a BiGLY arms agreement & R giving smart bombs 2
Ski-rew bipartisan. The left is running all over you while you stand around singing Kumbaya. Fight the resist Trump movement.
Pro-Qatar?
#WeThePeople had no say on sale of arms 2 SA. This senate vote was pathetic. TY @RandPaul for pushing the vote. Avarice & Greed reign in USA
Thank you very Mr. #SenatorRandPaul for stopping Saudi Arabia's carnage in Yemen.@SouthrnMovement
It's sad to say it, but your country is the worst harm to peace and democracy of the world
Saudi Arabia is not our friend. Glad you spoke against selling them weapons  that might end up in the hands of Isis
Arabia and Israel. Please be careful though. Historically, the CIA and our corporations have had a close relationship.
Thankfully the vote failed. All Senators wanting to defeat #ISIS & #AlQaeda voted to let the arms sale go through, protecting the #USA.
Those weapons aren't being used against ISIS. Are you daft? They're being used to slaughter Yemeni children and arm terrorists.
Civil debate is a hallmark of our freedom.  I'll pass on ratcheting up the discourse. Good luck to you.
...Yemen. They're an out of control faction, originally financed by House of Saud. It's a 4 sided civil war, but SA mostly fights the Shi'i
Exactly. Funny how so many people manage to miss this point, somehow thinking we are protected by this. How? All I see is smoke and mirrors.
I wish there were more like you in Washington, Sen. Paul - not in blind lockstep with the establishment.
I don't get why you are opposed to this. If they have agreed to ban the Muslim Brotherhood, asking for arms in case of retaliation is fair.
The sale of arms to Saudi Arabia was approved
#Congress 
#Trump
government
now Qatar. Why?
2 Senators of 99 who voted voted no to sanctions against Russia: @RandPaul and @senatormikelee . I guess they have to go!
I applaud you.
Thank you, Senator! This was a smart move. I appreciate working across the aisle!

Saudi Arabia 'protected' by B.P., Chevron, Shell, Exxon-Mobil mega-Oil Corporations! MSM CENSORS almost all News on Saudi crimes!
Unfortunate that your bill lost... kudos for you for taking a stand. Don't always agree with you, but glad you go with your conscience.
Thank you for coming out against this deal.
What an amazing display of presenting the people's voice to the President re arms deal. We need more like this.
They need to block all of it
Happy for this but wonder why you were against Russian sanctions via Congress?
They live next to us and we have the right to protect ourselves.. meanwhile, you destroyed Iraq and Afghanistan ... from 10,000m away!
Really? Sen voted to block arms sale to Saudi how about block rifles sale this country! Never minded you and GOP $$$ from GUNS Co?
Well done Senator, God bless you
Thank you Senator Paul
I can't believe I agree with you on this
You actually did something responsible? I'm impressed.
Good idea not enough
What's the number of this bipartisan group of senators? Is it important ?
YAY!!
Excellent policy change to end flagrant arming whomever, wherever, fueling hatred & sectarian conflict. Now, Senator, put Turkey on notice!
Another REASON to send a hit man. That is Hillary's MONEY -- Wiki told you Hillary was the MAIN gunrunner. WAKE up, please! PLZ STAY safe.
How can you do such a thing ?  The arms sale has been agreed to th strengthen allies and weaken enemies!
Thank you for your STRENGTH and ability to STAND! May the Lord continue to bless you and keep you SAFE! In Jesus Name, amen...

And he Rand
He Rand so far a-wayyyyyyyyy https://twitter.com/ALT_uscis/status/874972509875183616 …
I watched your speech on youtube. Senator, @RandPaul we need more like you.
Finally USA is returning to a moral power as well from being just a superpower
Great!
we should give them the weapons and start letting them fight their own battles
Thank you, Senator.  I respect you!
Saudi attacked us...no arms deal
Well it was proved that most American Senators are butchers.
Reports say you jumped in a car and ran, rather than stay and help?  What say you? Did you stay? Are you aware of Virginia's open carry law?
Why did you allow #barak to arm them?  This seems a bit hypocritical @Potus @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems
Whose congressional district in the past was involved in mixing arms (hopefully defensive) with cattle-prods & thumb screws?
Why is only a PORTION of the sale being blocked?  We shouldn't be selling this terrorist nation ANY weapons.  PERIOD.  #StopCreatingWars
America needs to find another way to maintain the skills required to produce armaments than to arm the Saudi ethnic cleansing agenda
Well done senator
just get us the money, Randel

Our ally at work. (Examples like this abound).  h/t @cuttlefish_btc https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/world/europe/how-the-saudis-turned-kosovo-into-fertile-ground-for-isis.html … 
Thank you Mr. Paul, much appreciated.
"Take a stance against....Fueling an arms race in the Middle East" sounds noble. Wondering how are you going to force it on Iran!
...or maybe Saudis should rely on Russians for arm supplies as they have been demonstrating high levels of reliability in comparison
Thank you for trying to slow down the insanity! Too bad we aren't sending that as humanitarian aid to Yemen. They need help now! NOW!
Hats off!
To Rand and to all heroes of senate who put American values above Saudi dirty money!
So who is reliable in our Congress? Maybe only Louis Gohmert.
Letme thank U for U positive attitude,on #Yemeni #civilians"Saudi jet victims"were killed in their home,farms, halls with #US smart bombs,
Well done Rand!
No! You are wrong!
Agree with you on this issue. However please do not vote for that Abomination being proposed as a healthcare bill just unbelievable
Do you have a list on the vote?
Thank you, Great!
How come they did not take a stand against the Iran deal?
Thank you for standing up & saying something. #antiwar
#StandWithRand.   Thank you sir thxu
good to hear some senators are still fighting the good fight
Don't agree with you on much Senator but thank you for taking a stand on this.

@NetworksManager 

Doesn't it look bad on the USA's part if Congress does not  honor their President's arrangement?
Thank you, Senator. Wish more Republicans had joined you.
Did they do it with Obama?????
Thank you Senator Paul. Saudi Arabia is not an ally until human rights are established
And Wahhabism is abolished!
Anything to obstruct our President. The Dems got to go!
Saudi probably paid already
Senator outstanding job you say what no one will we are arming Isis by arming Saudis and the phony rebels in Syria
Is there a link to see who voted against this? I can't find it.
Found it

Good for you now lets start working on issues that effect the poor and middle class.
WAKE  UP  !!!!!  WAKE UP ...YOU ARE SUPPOSSED TO LOVE FREEDOM -  STAND  IN UNITY --FOR THE SAKE  OF  JESUS
You are all wasting precious time. This the end days- the antichrist is next - wake up- God gave us Trump to restore  our country, dang
Thank you Rand!! #StillRanding
Ooh great.   Don't remember any of this with Obama.  And this  is so SA  can actually  defend themselves - against  isis, wow,unbelievable
Thank you for speaking out against Blocking Portion of Arms Sale to Saudi Arabia, how do we win in the US House?
Senate rejected the bill to stop Trumps deal.  Not enough votes to stop the arms deal as several Democrats sided with President !
Seems hypocritical to me since America has no problem ( long history) of slaughtering others around the world 
How about being consistent Dr
THE THREE AUTOCRATS 
Saudi,UAE,Egypt destroying ME with Sunni/Israel Anti Shia Alliance & Proxies. 
Coming Wars: Kurdish war, Shia/Sunni war
Actually you Voted for #beautiful  children of Yemen. Stop the war, stop selling arms  &stop killing innocent people all over the world.
Bless you
While many waste time interrogating Sessions
good. The real Muslim threat is there.  They are not a friend
Thank you Senator, you just saved many innocent lives.
#AwanBrothers
good work!
Thank you
Keep working it.  Gotta stop the deal as best you can
Well done Senator, I watched/listened to your remarks today regarding the matter. Well done.
Why not Communist Muslims and Norma Muslims 
Thank you Sir. 
Less They killing together Just a Joke

To our President that believes in FAKE NEWS He also believes in BLOOD MONEY !
Yes, we don't need to send weapons to another Saddam and have them used against Americans - get out of the Middle East!
Instead of looking for ways to block something and grandstand, DO YOUR JOB!
WAITING WORD THAT BLOCKED WAS YES.
PRAYING
Wow this is gonna piss Trump off for sure. Great move though
It is okay to have disagreements,just keep talking to Trump bout it, hopefully he will change his mind..Talk and debate.KEEP TALK ABOUT IT!
Good Job! I wish we could disable all the arms we have sold in the region
Thank you 
unarmed protesters have been shot dead in Yemen's capital Sana'a after government loyalists opened fire on .SADLY Citizens unarmed NOT GOVT

Thank you!
IRAN GOT $160BILLION FROM THE COMMUNIST MUSLIM
So you should be good with this right?
I love Sessions
Why are you against Iran getting money but okay with us selling arms to Saudi?
No one has ever asked me anything so stupid
More like you know what a hypocrite you are and can't defend it.
Thank you.
More uni-party obstruction ;announcement !
The deal doesn't exist.
Want the wall built between the USA & Mexico?
