@greta @ChristianCalls1 Rand Paul has zero credibility on National Security
@chattycatthy @greta @ChristianCalls1 and apparently you have zero understanding of the 4th amendment
@swishnelson @greta @ChristianCalls1 I understand it. But fighting in fighting terrorism, we need to use EVERY resource in a timely fashion
@chattycatthy @swishnelson @greta @ChristianCalls1 learn from history. When we get involved the problem gets worse.
@Gunsight416 like World War II?
@chattycatthy Use your tiny brain, I was talking about the Middle East.
@Gunsight416 Your little brain forgets we won that war after being attacked on 9/11, but Lost our gains when Obama pulled out w/o status of
@chattycatthy If by won the war you mean went trillions into debt, and created more terrorism, and killed thousands of civies,  yes we won
@greta @ChristianCalls1
You have become so anti-Cruz since #NewYorkValues. He was addressing Trump politics-not values in general & not you.
@JuanChicoTweets @ellievoices @greta @ChristianCalls1 Agreed. Knives have come out now that Iowa is so close. Don't forget their #truecolors
@greta @former_democrat Rand is part of the GOPe. He is their lap dog to attack Cruz.
@5OKid @greta I disagree. Rand calls out establishment candidates, of both parties, for undeclared "wars" & support of Federal Reserve.
@greta Cruz or Trump nom. would be gift to Dems! Cruz not liked outside Iowa;Trump=fodder for same GOP accusations by Dems! Rubio or bust!
@greta @RandPaul Rand wants to say that Cruz supported amnesty because he worked on GWB's campaign?  Cruz has a memo that proves otherwise
@greta I liked Cruz before he started campaigning..he looks like a snake in the grass. He talks with squinty eyes and I dont trust him 1 bit
@greta was Great exchange
@greta @RandPaul half truths speak for themselves. Research the real truths! Lies are lies and bashing conservatives is a pathetic way to go
@greta @LibertyPoet And rightly so!
@greta @RandPaul Greta is obviously anti-cruz I will never watch her again.
@greta You're delusional if that's your take...
@greta get off twitter and go try to make "news."
@greta @ChristianCalls1 
P.S. I still love you!
@greta @ChristianCalls1 But it wasn't the truth. Truth matters. Even @megynkelly said she studied it, and @TedCruz was being honest.
@greta Greta have Megan explain this one to you. Ted explained to her after the debate and she finally got it.
@greta Cruz isn't honest about his position on Amnesty.
@greta @LibertyConserv no Rands like a gnat to Cruz.
@greta @ChristianCalls1 So now you're aware of the post debate interview with your colleague Ms Kelly on this topic.  Thoughts?
@greta @tedcruz  his response was great quoting Sessions. Funny Paul fed CRUZ snicker bar during Cruz filibuster of Obamacare
@greta funny, I didn't see it that way.
@greta @RandPaul ...............The only TRUE CONSERVATIVE !!!!!
@greta @RandPaul sure did!  I definitely showed his position of strength on that stage.
@greta @RandPaul I meant *It
@greta @RandPaul Funny because his dad loved Cruz so much he sold my information to him in 08.
@greta @RandPaul it's called the truth.  #standwithRand for Liberty!   #RandPaul #RandRally
@greta Yes!
@greta @RandPaul Paul was very on point with this.
@greta #Standwithrand @RandPaul #presidentpaul #RandWon Rand is the real life Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Often imitated never duplicated.
@greta @RandPaul wrong. @tedcruz was trying to kill it and everyone knew it at the time.
@greta @RandPaul - #Cruz explained his amendments & position clearly. He has been consistent. What doesn't Rand understand?
@greta He's not honest about anything
@greta @RandPaul very wrong about it though
@greta @RandPaul and did so politely, calmly without calling him names
@greta @RandPaul @SenMikeLee disagrees.
@greta @RandPaul
@greta @RandPaul These 16 Pictures Of India’s Chai-Wallahs Have Som... http://unnaokamal.blogspot.com/2016/01/these-16-pictures-of-indias-chai_8.html?spref=tw …
@greta @RandPaul That was a high point for me
@greta @RandPaul Ted Cruz defeated Marco's gang of 8 bill. what more evidence is required??
@greta @RandPaul Then Rand is not being truthful.
@greta @RandPaul #StandWithRand #RandRally
@greta @RandPaul Another Fox employee who doesn't like Cruz? Let me prepare my shocked face. ...
@greta @RandPaul And Cruz had an answer like on all the other ?'s.  Everyone down on Cruz.
@greta @RandPaul Then give him serious consideration....@foxnews belittles him
@greta @LRbullies Love to see two losers going at it , neither could win
@greta @RandPaul Did Rand's team just wake up?
@greta @RandPaul sad that rand Paul used to be an ally to Cruz... Bad juju rand
@greta @RandPaul @tedcruz has done more to stop illegal immigration than anyone else on the stage tonight.
@greta @TheBigVote16 And he isn't
@greta @RandPaul he needs to be our next president.
@greta @RandPaul that was a hour ago lol. Ted Cruz 2016. Hey forgretta keep talking to you bff trump.
@greta @RandPaul LYING AND RIPPING MUST MEAN THE SAME THING TO YOU EH?
@greta @RandPaul Rand will tear them then all apart on logic!  #StandWithRand
@greta ....we all know your anti Cruz. And doing work for progressives in GOPe.
@greta @RandPaul That was called being "ripped apart"?
@greta You're not watching the same debate that I am.
@greta @RandPaul Greta you know it was a poison pill, don't be like that
@greta Ted was telling truth.He knew what he put N bill if it pass,would kill it. .A poison pill.Rubio not telling whole truth about bill.
@greta @HEYWALIO21
@greta @LRbullies wouldn't know I am watching Trump honor our Vets.
@greta really doesn't make any attempt to hide her bias against @tedcruz. @FoxNews fair and balanced?@EdMorrissey
@greta #cruz#Rubio#Jeb, liars liars pants on fire, all 3 have failed immigration policies, all 3 are 3 peas in an illegals back pocket!
@greta Cruz having a bad two weeks or so.
@greta Here's what Democrats had to say about Ted's Poison Pill Amendment... #GOPDebate
@greta So call him out on it. Here's what FoxNews said in 2013 about Ted's amendment. Who changed?
@greta Rand Paul is a smart man, he knows his numbers are low and it's all part of  what needs to happen @realDonaldTrump
@greta  Anybody can play soundbites about Ted's immigration's position. We need reform. People should visit candidates' websites and c plans
And Cruz sister Gang of 8 Rubio with the truth. Jeff Sessions & Steve King back Cruz NOT Amnesty Queen Rubio @greta @MChisholm
@greta @USAHipster So Rand calls Ted Cruz, Jeff Sessions, and Steve King liars good to know - take notice Iowa Paul dissed King
@greta Paul was wrong on this. Mike Lee has stated in past that Cruz did not support Gang of 8 bill
@greta @FairDealDaveNH #MarcoRubio shouldn't be President "some day", he should be our President Next Year!!!
@RAMSEYHOUSE Hey - If you like Rubio just say so but keep me out of your tweets - #NotCool - Kind of like your candidate
@greta Cruz is being honest.  Cruz was smart in what he did and the establishment just don't want to admit that they were outsmarted.
@greta Rand is the man but he can't BS enough to attract support so it's both a gift and a curse.
@greta The Voice of Liberty" @RandPaul is also the "Voice of Reason" on the stage. #RandRally
@greta @dougstafford And Rand Is Right! Thanks Greta!
@greta @dougstafford tell '3' Greta!! @RandPaul
@greta great.
@greta and Cruz continues to remain cool and Presidential
@youthpastorbry @greta did you not see Cruz throw a temper tantrum? He looked like the guy that didn't show up.
@greta RAND PAUL..Basically, wants to let every trespassing ILLEGAL ALIEN stay in our country, that entered, ILLEGALLY. smh
“@greta: Rand Paul just ripped Cruz apart - essentially saying Cruz not honest about his position on amnesty/path to citizenship” I disagree
@greta Cruz is a professional liar
@greta Ted Cruz is a jerk, rude and a liar tonight.  Irrelevant to me.
@jasian12345 @greta @Bernadettea777 OHHHHHHH KELLY LEE WITH THE GO AHEAD HOME RUN!!!
@greta When WAGES WILL RISE and when will homes be built for the COMMON Working Man/Women,Thats not happening anywhere USA !
@greta But, @tedcruz won in the overall exchange!
@greta Cruz, is like what I said on the Video is not really what I said!LMAO! To
@greta A politician not being honest? Really.....
@greta And came out pro-amnesty, finally! Way to distinguish himself!
@greta I agree with Rand Paul.
@greta the death rattle of the irrelevant.
@greta Hes not honest about his Eligibility either-He must get a Ct.Ord- Not Eligible to Debate or Run-MSM needs to cover this-
@greta @tedcruz  #FlipFlop
@greta paul seems honest
@greta So...Carson and Kasich ordering pizza?
@greta Kasich, only one w/ the experience & leadership skills to be commander in chief on day 1 #gopdebate #kasich4Us
@greta @EdMorrissey Rand Paul is a smart guy and an intelligent debater. He'd make a great prez if not for his isolationalism.
@greta just hurts when they're so nasty. Sad Ted has sunk to that level
@greta Rand is disingenuous
@greta How?
@greta they all throw it at the wall, but does any of it stick?  So far, same old attacks.
@greta why are they ignoring Carson?
@greta no he did not
@greta the action is on CSPAN.
@greta Saying it does not make it true!
@BenDoubleCrossd @greta but it being true makes it true!
