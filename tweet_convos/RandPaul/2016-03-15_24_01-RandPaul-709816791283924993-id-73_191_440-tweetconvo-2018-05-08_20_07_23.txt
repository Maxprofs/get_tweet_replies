@RandPaul Coal is filthy and inefficient.

@RandPaul the black market drug economy puts thousands of people to work too but we don't like the industry. Same diff. #altenergy
@RandPaul did you ever propose coal research R&D that would enhance the coal industry?
@LinsieJr @RandPaul Or better, Rand, did you discover Clean Coal yet or are you waiting to repeal and replace #Obamacare? That would be cool
.@RandPaul not like one of them is trying to put millions of Americans to work or anything. Good luck with that, Rand. #WeMissRon
@RandPaul @WinnaWinna2016 ENDORSE TED CRUZ!  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!
@RandPaul It is time to embrace new technologies. Bernie has a plan to help coal industry workers to retrain & get through transition
@RandPaul @alllibertynews I  you rand Paul
@RandPaul there are only about 45 people who still believe in that industry. You rascal! #checkthestockpricesgenius #whippingadeadhorse
@RandPaul you support coal? Really? How can you be so ignorant?
@dnofal @RandPaul  maybe he cares about the working people .
@Julianwillis6 @RandPaul yes, or maybe he cares about the coal industry's campaign dollars
I doubt that he's cares about the people not the dollars he's not like Hillary lol
@RandPaul Should we be concerned about the coal pollution....etc?
@Nancywillask @alllibertynews @RandPaul I'm not Rand but,my 2 cents. No, coal tec now is so advanced it's our best "green" bet.
@RandPaul Donate to @realDonaldTrump instead, Rand Paul is useless, unless he endorses Trump.
@RandPaul @WinnaWinna2016 @ValerieHalosfo2
@RandPaul Or they could find jobs producing more efficient energy resources......
@RandPaul Let's see, GW Bush at -462,000 jobs, B Obama at +223,340,000 so far, which party puts people out of work again? #factsarentwithyou
@RandPaul @CNN @marcorubio Rubio should have cheated like you and change the rules so he could run and keep his Senate seat too. Smart Rand
@RandPaul No war on coal. Only a war on coal miners by the mine owners. Normal GOP to get the misinformed to fight against own interest
@giovanni0514 @RandPaul you support Rand Paul. So I assume you support giving tax breaks to the top 5% of ppl who already own 65% of wealth?
@sandersforprez @giovanni0514 @RandPaul Rand's tax plans made the most sense.  Bernie wants to tax success and reward laziness. Gross.
@JustinSzew309 @giovanni0514 @RandPaul so, if I'm correct, you are in support of giving tax breaks to people who own close to 70% of the US?
@sandersforprez @JustinSzew309 @giovanni0514 @RandPaul Ethan Google "fixed pie fallacy" - you are welcome
@vlastelicar what a joke. http://Epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation …
@RandPaul We can't afford to keep destroying our planet by using one of the dirtiest forms of energy in the world
@RandPaul Hillary's plan calls for a $30 billion fund to ensure coal miners and their families get the benefits they deserve.
@RandPaul  http://hrc.io/240hWLX 
.@RandPaul Aren't we eventually going to run out of coal? Shouldn't those people be planning for that?
@RandPaul I thought the Republicans created the worst recession in our lifetime which we are just recovering, now with 4.9% unemployment.
@RandPaul Coal is awful & outdated. Why not stump for buggy-whip workers? Better yet, train them in a 21st century energy source, not 19th.
@RandPaul coal mines aren't safe & ive seen 2many young men die of black lung & other serious issues from working in them.has2b alternative
@RandPaul why is randpaul still collecting donations?
@RandPaul bullshit
.@RandPaul Government doesn't put people out of work, business does that, when it fails to adapt to market forces.
@RandPaul train those in the coal industry to work on clean energy. they can have jobs and it's better for the earth and workers' health.
@RandPaul as a physician, i thought you would want to read this: http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/psr-coal-fullreport.pdf …
@RandPaul God Rand, we are trying to donate & get a decent president right now. Living On SS doesn't give one $$ right now for other causes.
@RandPaul how much is the coal industry paying you?
@RandPaul  What's this about votes for Rand don't count? Family voted in Ohio.Said there was a sign up instructing not to vote for Rand
@Klinko150 @RandPaul Really.Well this really make me write him for President since no one is taking serious to be a real candidate.Paul2016
Coming from a previous @RandPaul for President supporter... Can't we have just one politician that is above the partisan talk? #disappointed
@RandPaul Why do you hate our planet? What else do we do the same as 100 years technologically speaking?
@randpaul Is that money going to empty ads or are you using it for something that will make a difference like finding alternative fuels?
@RandPaul Sir you do not stand strong for anybody except yourself this was proven when U needed 2 stand w/Sessions, Lee & Cruz - U R about U
@RandPaul y would she do this ? Does she understand that like the oil field the old dogs can't b retrained? Does she even care? I doubt it
@RandPaul @MN4RAND #StandWithRand #RandingStrong #StillRanding
@RandPaul I registered as a republican to vote for you. But today I voted for Trump. Lower taxes and audit the Feds are important to me.
@RandPaul what will you be doing with the money if we do decided to donate?
@RandPaul Violence:
communication about a lack of communication
@RandPaul  just another lie by a Republican.
@Bfry53 @RandPaul you do understand that the jobs were created by pumping 4tril into the econ w/ QE /w low rates hs nothing to do with prez
@RandPaul wish you would join the Donald forces #makeourcountryGod'scountryagain
.@RandPaul and make your vote #Trump2016
@RandPaul @alllibertynews I hate coal but I love coal workers.  Gotta be green high paying green transfer programs.
@RandPaul Nah, dude. I'm voting for Jim Gray. Nice try though. 
@RandPaul I think the Republicans especially under Reagan & Bush killed more jobs, killed off the MiddleClass and you blame Dems? Get real!
@RandPaul how about we stop with coal & put the coal miners to work with the solar industry... save their lungs while saving our #earth
@randpaul End the Minimum Wage! Arbitrary wage floors are destroying American competitiveness.
@RandPaul @GroverNorquist I'm with you on 7 out of 10 issues but coal miners need retraining Coal jobs = Black Lung
@RandPaul vote Trump 
@RandPaul I can't. I'm out of work...
@RandPaul you're still around?
@RandPaul I beg to differ but but you mean RepubliCANTS.
@RandPaul Maybe it's time you invest in alternative energies and create NEW jobs from that. Our planet is more important than coal jobs.
.@RandPaul Let's stop people who want to stop cancer and put cancer researchers out of work too!  Yay stupidity!
@RandPaul That's the liberal plan. Get everyone on the gov dime so they control everything about your life. Food/medical/work/social
.@RandPaul DELETE THIS TWEET! It's GOOD that liberals put Americans out of work because THAT SENDS THEM TO CHURCH/JESUS™!!! #ugh #idiot
@RandPaul Hitler didn’t invent libertarianism so you could blame others for your faults! #StandWithRand
