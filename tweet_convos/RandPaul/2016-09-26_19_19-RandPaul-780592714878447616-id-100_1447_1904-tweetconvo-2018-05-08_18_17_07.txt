Clinton is most likely to take us to war. The next President should respect the Constitution. http://time.com/4345172/rand-paul-congress-war-amendment/ … #debatenight
Hildabeast makes up crap as she goes along and tries to pass it off as law. She has no business anywhere near the WH.
Nice thought but that's not happening.
@alllibertynews @TIME are you suggesting #trump respects the Constitution?
@alllibertynews @TIME ok rand show me where trump supports the constitution...
 @AladoreVacca @TIME
We also have to stop all non-White immigration and deport millions because in 30 years Whites will be a neglected minority.
@alllibertynews Face it. Most people have never even read the Constitution or really care about it. We're getting what we deserve.
@smartvalueblog @TIME Rand.  Lost respect for you.  Turning out to be as wacky as your dad.
@TIME This would be the most sad sad time to be an American! I truly believe America will cease to exist if #Killery should win 
@Bizaster war makes them profits and they still want their NWO .... Out of chaos
CIA trying to provoke a war.. Google "Syrian girl" Did HRC win or lose debate? http://grandmathunder.com/2016/06/why-elites-cant-accept-the-will-of-the-people/ … @RandPaul
@TIME @HillaryClinton @cnnbrk @ABC @nytimes  @washingtonpost @AP RT

WATCH THE LYING Hillary in #Bosnia
You've blatantly trashed HRC while remaining silent on the travesty that was @realDonaldTrump; you have no credibility.
@cplbhvac @TIME @RandPaul is RIGHT on...@HillaryClinton a disaster in mid east as sec of state #syria #iraq #iran #libya #egypt #saudiarabia
@TIME You have what to base that on? What experience do you have? None You couldnt even get nominated so now you are on the train
keep fighting to defend the constitution.  Remember our forefathers thought the 2nd was important to defend the rest of it
@alllibertynews @TIME neither candidate respects the Constitution. 
RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION??What a concept, I thought all pledged to do that. Why does there have to be a reminder?IMPEACH
@kupajo322 if Hillary became president she would be the first person in history to launch a nuclear war. Back to the dark ages
How about the state of KY start respecting it first and maybe the rest of the country would follow.
@TIME I'm with you; restore Congressional authority on war. We must uphold the Constitution & find solutions to USA problems.
@TIME Thank you sir for your support of Mr. Trump and America. You have my respect & admiration for choosing America first! #MAGA
Congress can take its Constitutional authority back any time.  Just do it.
.@RandPaul are we at war with #Eastasia our #Eurasia Winston? she actually said Eastasia #1984
do you think DT respects the Constitution? #LetGaryDebate
@Karee_news Well, I think we need 2 start over if u want that cuz neither candidate fits that description.
How come @POTUS #Obama not taken to court for ignoring #Democrat passed #WarPowersAct in #Libya? 
@RandPaul @TwittaChicca
#Benghazi #Hillary
Jill Stein echoed the same concerns. Hillary is deranged.
@LeslieSawyer17 #YesSir #Amen #ObamaAbuseOfPower #BushObamaHillaryWarCrimes #Corruption #CoverUps
@justonepatriot @TIME 

@HillaryClinton basically committed to troops on the ground in #Iraq and #Syria
@godisgood1961 @puj_rit  RandPaul knows what he's talking about
@alllibertynews @TIME remind me again who started the last 2 wars? Oh yeah, a republican president who supported unilateral war
@NatShupe @TIME neither of the two con artists respect or follow the bill of rights, don't lie about it. Neither are fit to serve
IF she wins.
She won't.
a reckless statement considering what has been said by both candidates
@NatShupe That is t stupidest thing any congressional member has ever said, literally. And your buds starting w Bush43 start wars
I guess you are being sarcastic.  Trump just admitted he would attack an Iranian ship b/c its sailors mocking ours.
who are you endorsing for President?
I thought CONGRESS HAD THE LAST WORD ABOUT WAR!!!
Only when people who respect the Constitution are in power.
true!
@TIME every president should honor the constitution & all of those n gov state/local/federal.
come on Rand you can do better than this. This uninformed bigot sucked the air out of your presidential message. #BelieveinLiberty
Are you serious or just stupid. That Fraud Trump would cause a civil war.
@TIME completely agree with "we should obey Constitution on war" but what assurance do we have  neoCons will not hijack Trump
@TIME I agree. Neither one of them came off as a constitutionalist.
That's total BS!
Because Lying @realDonaldTrump is such a diplomat. #GetStuffed #debatenight
@TIME
@TIME  Gastly scary America would be doomed with Hillary gotta respect the Constitution must it falls on you Rand n or DJT plz do!
I'm writing you in.
@TIME and you think that's Trump  Vote @GovGaryJohnson. Rand I love you but endorsing Trump makes me disbelieve everything...
@TIME unlike both Bushes? Oh wait they did take us to war! One we still have to fight!
@TIME I mean yes, she will go to war, but with Trump it could well go nuclear! There is no peace candidate. #debatenight
really? Sounds to me more like Trump wants to go to war.
@TIME I respect u 4 honoring your pledge as hard as it is. My husband & I voted u n prim. We vote on principle. #WhereIsGary
@TIME I don't think either candidate could even tell you anything about the Constutution, Bill of Rights or even the preamble
@TIME 18th place said what?
I’ve supported u thru many years of people bashing u. This comment, u lost me. stay real. Sum appreciate that bout u.
if you think that Trump is going to better respect the Constitution, you really haven't got a clue about what it says.
And coming from the Republicans, who DEFINITELY never took us to war, this carries legitimacy how?
Thank God you are not running..
@SenTedCruz how could you have endorsed this clown? Back @GovGaryJohnson and stop the bleeding! #LetGaryDebate
Agreed. Since you're not in it any more, we need @GovGaryJohnson
too bad your party is too foolish to support you, you would kill Hillary tonight
.@RandPaul @TIME It would be great if the next president had actually READ the constitution. #NeverTrump
@TIME Today's Congress has surrendered their power to an aggressive Executive Branch
next president should know the Constitution as well, yes? @realDonaldTrump makes it up. You're really OK with that? Losing respect
@TIME hey....u mean the way ur candidate respects right?
@TIME how can you support trump.
@TIME right on.

@TIME do you support the unconstitutional stop and frisk like Trump?

You cant honestly believe that. A guy with thin skin and hair trigger temper is the one whos scary with his finger on the button.
@TIME so you are endorsing @GovGaryJohnson then?
@TIME Hillary says What difference, at this point, does it make?
#debate #debatenight 
@KrisParonto @JohnTiegen @MarkGeistSWP #MAGA #PJNET #TCOT
@TIME ... umm how about Bush? Are we forgetting that?
you’d have done so much better on that stage
Donald trump doesn't respect the constitution...
@TIME this is true
