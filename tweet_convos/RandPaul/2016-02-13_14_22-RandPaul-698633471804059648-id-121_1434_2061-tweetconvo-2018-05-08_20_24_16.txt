@RandPaul Obama writing unconstitutional exec. orders etc, NOW he wants his pick for supreme judge to uphold constitution! HELL NO!
@izzysroses @KatyinIndy @RandPaul Obama stomps on the Constitution but now wants to use it. I am with you Isabelle.HELL NO!!
@RandPaul Well, Obama got rid of him before the next election. Now Obama will appoint an anti freedom puppet.
@RandPaul @INJO I'm sure Obozo is going to try to cram a liberal freak like Ginsburg through the Senate thank God forSenators like Rand Paul
Thanks for sharing @RandPaul . Hated 2 see you leave the race. Cruz has already stated he will filibuster BHO appointee. Will U stand w him?
@RandPaul Justice Scalia was a defender of the law and the Constitution he will be missed
@RandPaul @FriedrichHayek @JustenCharters He made powers of corporate business & superrich stronger. It's time for change! #Feel the Bern
@RandPaul @conens46 @INJO The timing of his death very suspicious.
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @INJO  Very much so were loosin all what makes us great he will be missed #StandWithRand #RandRally #RandWagon
@RandPaul @INJO I need your help for my paternal uncle sick daughter
@RandPaul @INJO I think @RandPaul should be the next nominee. That is one way Obama could get a nominee through the Senate.
@RandPaul 
I will miss Justice Scalia, my admiration for him is so profound! RIP, defender of our Framers handiwork. Remember!
@RandPaul @JustenCharters #randfilibustortime #gonnastillrandout #missyoualreadyantonin
@RandPaul If an Obama nomination hits I hope you put your filibuster shoes on.  #StandWithRand #StillRanding
@RandPaul @JustenCharters hell yeah he'll be missed.....America is screwed
@RandPaul @INJO so sad you dropped.
@RandPaul I think it is worse than that, Senator Paul.
@RandPaul @INJO I wish Andrew Napolitano was on the Supreme Court
@RandPaul That society is the freest that is the most responsible’ @PeterNJanssen on @LinkedIn
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @INJO , and a defender of forced corporate vaccination with disregard for those vaccine injured #CDCwhistleblower
@RandPaul @INJO   Rand, you've always danced to a principled tune.  DO NOT fall into trap of refusing advise & consent of SCOTUS nominee
@RandPaul @StopObamaCourt Absolutely appalled at the liberal delight being shown before the man is even buried, this includes Hillary/Obama
@RandPaul @JustenCharters I feel as though @Judgenap should get appointed now
@RandPaul  let's hope the senate is convened ASAP, to prevent a recess appointment!! Quickly, before Obama finishes his golf game!!!
@SpeakerRyan @RandPaul @JustenCharters @marklevinshow Congress better put up a fight and not let a liberal hack be appointed #scotus
@RandPaul @INJO he was a b******* conservative a****** and I won't miss him
@RandPaul Justice Scalia will be missed by corporations who want the same voting rights as people.
@RandPaul How long before Saddam Hussein, I mean Barack Hussein Obama nominates a Muslim woman? She could wear a hijab w/her robe!
@RandPaul live tweet the GOP Debate tonight!!
@RandPaul Scalia was murdered.  We all know it.
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @marcorubio Will You work to block confirmation of new justice until Obama out of office?Have all been bought off?
@RandPaul Judging Antonin Scalia claimed prolife but SPORT HUNTER loved killing!  Hypocrite doesn't care about suffering but religion
@RandPaul @JustenCharters Unlike you who tolerates subversion of Article II
@RandPaul Scalia was a paragon of conservative ideology; the election is more important now than ever---we need you Rand.
@RandPaul @INJO Thank you Dr. You are  a great man. God keep you safe  You have more great work ahead
@RandPaul So happy to have your content on my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1PMk45z 
@RandPaul You would be good to fill in his spot
@RandPaul:Senate GOP could block Obama’s #SupremeCourt pick. If Clinton, Sanders won, could appoint Obama. Would O pick Holder?
@RandPaul @NateBell4AR @JustenCharters His decisions were not in line in a lot of cases.
@RandPaul @PoliticalLaughs I did not know him personally or I might miss him. Respected his position but will NOT miss his actions.
@RandPaul #mayherotinhell
@RandPaul @PoliticalLaughs @INJO OMG not you too.
@RandPaul The Wicked Witch is Dead!
@RandPaul Any #SCOTUS member ON EITHER SIDE whose vote is 100% certain bef. case is presented is not a great justice. Just an ideologue.
@RandPaul @PoliticalLaughs @JustenCharters oh please!
@RandPaul @banjobird @INJO Ugh
@RandPaul LOL
@RandPaul Let’s start pressuring the Senate Majority Leader to keep this off the floor until next year.
@RandPaul your Tweet was quoted in a story by @TIME
@RandPaul @WHAS11 @JustenCharters nah.
@RandPaul @JustenCharters cmon Rand,love ya buddy but, just no...
@RandPaul Fight hard Senator Paul to keep Obama's nomination off the Court!!!!! We can't let Court cant go left fringe wing.
@RandPaul terrible news.
@RandPaul Please clarify, exactly which country's Constitution did he defend? Certainly not that of the USA. #scalia #davidcorndc #dailykos
@RandPaul hey think you can filibuster a Supreme Court nom for 11 months?
@RandPaul Don't play politics.  I am a huge supporter of you.  Please, encourage party leaders to vote on replacements.
@RandPaul @ConservMemes @JustenCharters I fear now more for our nation.
@RandPaul @INJO God bless him
@RandPaul You must stop BHO from filling this seat.
@RandPaul We must stop President Obama from electing a Liberal Judge to replace him.
@RandPaul @JustenCharters we are screwed
@RandPaul thanks for sharing! I've added your tweet to my news updates at: http://rbl.ms/2430beR 
@RandPaul @JustenCharters He was no Frank Murphy.
@RandPaul @LaneSadalup This is a calamitous development for conservatism.
@KingWard1 @mlong42947 @RandPaul @LaneSadalup. Disastrous, really.  May I shut my eyes for a moment?
@WhiteJacketPink @mlong42947 @RandPaul @LaneSadalup "You'll have your eyes opened for you, my friend."  Cosmo Castorini
@RandPaul @JustenCharters He likely won't be replaced until after the Presidential election. It will become a major issue.
@RandPaul @INJO A genuine loss for our country.  One of the few remaining defenders of the Constitution is gone.
@RandPaul @ConservMemes @INJO Sad day indeed
@RandPaul and the next justice wont be Obama will put in a server radical with the help of you and the rest of congress and Senate
@RandPaul @ConservMemes @JustenCharters oh no here comes another Obozoite Lost a good man
@RandPaul Please start conditioning for an epic filibuster.
@RandPaul @JustenCharters Scalia was a petty, vindictive know it all who seemed to rule based on his own personal hates and biases..not law
@RandPaul I helped vote you in as Ky Senator in 2011. I Was routing for you as a presidential candidate & I'm democrat. Maybe next time?
@RandPaul @JustenCharters @ChuckGrassley STOP all nominees by this president or they will destroy the Republic. Wait till after the election
@randpaul Those of you in Congress must FORCE the other cowardly Republicans from backing down to Obama. He MUST NOT be allowed to pick one.
@RandPaul @INJO Praying
@RandPaul all the more reason for you to come out and endorse the only constitutional candidate left.
@RandPaul very unfortunate' .. Scalia the best by far..is there anything more suspicious than usual ..
@RandPaul @JustenCharters congress had better step up and stand for liberty and not another leftest judge.
@RandPaul Yes at a time Obama don't give a crap.
@RandPaul yet another blow.. Rand can u just announce tomorrow your back in?
He was 79, y'all. 

@RandPaul @INJO
"@RandPaul: Justice Scalia was a defender of the constitution, an important conservative voice in the court. He will be missed."
@RandPaul I didn't see the tweet good. Didn't see he has past. My apologies. I deleted my tweet! My mistake!
@RandPaul @JustenCharters R.I.P. Supreme Court Justice Scalia...
@RandPaul @JustenCharters A sad day for our country and our Constitution. 
@RandPaul The stakes just went up exponentially.  I don't think POTUS should defer: nominate immediately
@RandPaul @Josh_Richman I know a chorus of "Ding Dong the witch is dead" would seem tasteless, but f*** it, I'm singing anyway  #SCOTUS
@RandPaul @JustenCharters he will be missed
@RandPaul @JustenCharters now will be the time for the real filibuster Senator.
@RandPaul @JustenCharters lol tragic!
@RandPaul Given the current politics, there should be a full investigation probe to see if it was #naturalcauses or #foulplay.
@RandPaul @leeleemunster If you and the @GOP have ANY BALLS you will let this seat STAY empty until Obama is GONE!
@RandPaul @INJO say hello to Obama and tyranny. I bet he won't even declare a natl day of mourning
@RandPaul @INJO sad day. Dark days ahead for America.
@RandPaul Perhaps the worst news Constitution lovers could hear.  Sad day for liberty, very sad.  RIP
@RandPaul TELL ME OBAMA DIDNT HAVE HIS HAND IN THIS!
@RandPaul and this just days after the halt on the climate change nonsense.
@RandPaul @JustenCharters #DoucheScalia
@RandPaul @INJO Makes me want to cry! He was a man of honor. This will be bad for Conservatives.
@RandPaul @INJO His death seems very suspicious to me. I hope it will be investigated.
@RandPaul @JustenCharters you and the rest of the senate must NOT confirm a new justice for this president.
@RandPaul well said.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul @JustenCharters
@RandPaul do NOT confirm another #Obama appointee. Block any nomination.
@RandPaul @INJO great constitutionist
@RandPaul I fear his replacement.
