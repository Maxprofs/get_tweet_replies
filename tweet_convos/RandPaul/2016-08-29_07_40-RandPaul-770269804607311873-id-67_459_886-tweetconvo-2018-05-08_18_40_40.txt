@lmirandabermud1 With you 100 % on that why are we not using the constitution to arrest Obama treason among others arrest Soros.
Our government is functioning as like when 1st  Hitler took over Germany.  There are many similarities.
we have to take care of the domestic enemies or the constitution will become non existent. We have a lot on both sides in our gov
Will you actively campaign for Donald Trump?
You know the value of freedom if others don't. It's a gift from God. it's get taken away by Death and tyranny (mortal decay)
@KKeyster Thanks Sen. You are one of the best there.  That is the minimum required by your oath. I want the Constitution restored
You back one of those enemies: Donald Trump.
Hillary is the enemy, a corporate puppet
Impeach Obama NOW! We go over seas and fight then what we come home and you still haven't gotten public enemy #1 @alllibertynews

You guys did a lousy job of it with Obama. Endorsement of Iran & Suppressing Christianity in military & schools.ALL BS no action
Your pseudo-libertarian ideas are not part of the constitution. Just as capitalism isn't. So perhaps U should read the document

The Internet is a miracle of modern technology. 

Why tether it to the whims of Islamic clerics and ancient Arab tribal law.
Muslim nations are demanding the blasphemy laws of Islam be embraced at the UN.

Will Hillary Clinton defend free speech?
The US defended the ideals of free speech on the Internet.

Muslim nations will demand a UN ban on the criticism of Islam.
start with the president and his administration.
Who all would this include in the "Domestic" section?
@tomborelli then don't you think we should protect it from hillary
agreed, which is why I am not voting for who you endorse for president.

#WRONGWITHFED As Russia off THE dollar ALL the excess money from FED flood back  America to create inflation (hidden tax) @RandPaul
I believe politicians know the sad truth that no one is actually legally bound to the constitution....when did consent occur

Romney,Mc Cain, Cruz not backing Trump is so stupid
yes and we need you to support Donald Trump like you pledged. The Constitution doesn't need Liars to defend it
@alllibertynews  ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN N DOMESTIC..#STANDWITHRAND
I absolutely agree with the 2nd amendment & irresponsible criminals should not determine the rights of law abiding citizens
You are correct Rand.  Is that the Donald's goal as well? #TeamGov #GaryJohnson #JohnsonWeld2016 #LetGaryDebate

"Domestic enemies" includes Obama and his pack, Bill & Hillary, and too much of Congress.

Yet you're endorsing someone who has no respect for being constrained by the constitution. Why? Party affiliation? Shame.
