@57KazqZ6UYIq2P2 @Dan_Brummitt 
The only Senate race going on in the US that I actually care about is yours in Kentucky. 1/2
@LadiesPac supports Rand in his race! Like us and support this amazing statesman! 
help put her away
why I'm voting for @GovGaryJohnson #JohnsonWeld2016.
Why isn't Clinton in Jail and why isn't the Clinton Foundation investigated. Beliefs are she is selling her political position
Can you get back in the race? You were my 1st choice. Highly intelligent w unquestioned integrity. What more could anyone ask for?
There's nothing in those words that aren't true! Please support Gary Johnson, he thinks the same way!
Trump is none of those and you support him?
you sir are a complete hater of all that is America news bulletin: 
"HE'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS"
Trump is big government Populist nationalist that wants tariffs and to punish private companies for moving to another country.
AMERICA 1ST!
Every job you protect with tariffs , you kill 3 other jobs.  Populism sucks and tariffs = taxes.  Are you for Taxes?  USA is great
no populist nor am I for taxes nor am I for big govt stop implying crap just because I support someone who loves America!
You called me "Anti American"  I am just anti Big Govt't Populism and tariffs... Trump is con man fake conservative and is losing
lie lie lie lie & more lies TRUMP is not losing fudged poll #'s ,already been proven it was stolen from bernie !
, honestly, why should anyone believe anything you say any longer?
#DonaldTrump   Uhmm..... Because it's the truth?
We need more politicians who actually have an understanding of foreign policy beyond that of a third-grader. #StandWithRand 2/2
THANK U! Ive been saying that 4ever! Bill 2. 
I want 2 c a congressional hearing & her being convicted & prisoned! 4EVER!
Don't count on seeing much good government for the next few years.  Try again in 2020 Dr.
Great message!!   I'm not sure why anyone would not agree with balancing the budget??   Thanks for your hard work!
The Constitution is the key to keep us all free #StandWithRand to keep it respected n followed total knowledge #SWR

this one got me @NEWeather_ wow.
just simply amazing.
Wish it hadn't been so crucial to save your seat in senate to dropout before giving Trump run for his money&make him talk policy.
Rand, do you consider yourself a Progressive Conservative? You and @realDonaldTrump seem to share many of the same technical ideas
u go ,laul
I agree and so does @GovGaryJohnson we need him in the WH
.@RandPaul you have my unequivocal endorsement. Together we will #MAGA!
You said the U.S. had the highest corporate tax in the world, but what percentage of taxes are actually paid and how many pay 0?
why the heck did you leave the race???
Sen Paul. I Agree w ur "Obey the Constitution". Vote on SCOTUS candidate. Do your job or stop your BS. #SCOTUS #RNC2016 #DNC2016
It's simple. Go back to the Gilded Age when the government only protected property and contract interests and let people die.
yes
this is exactly what @realDonaldTrump needs to be saying right now!
balance the budget is easy an eleventh grader could do that. to get out of debt when u cut spendng u DONOT cut the revenue,B$corps
@troyhwoods #StandWithRand you should have been the nominee!
We do not have the highest taxes on corporations in the world but besides that, yes, lets keep Govt simple.
Getting back to the socialist idea of the Treasury being in charge of coining or printing money would be a good thing.
should the Clinton be prosecuted?
spot on! #StillRanding for smaller government.
Rand, the American people are going to reject your views on the way government should be when they vote on 11/8/16.
then endorse @GovGaryJohnson and @GovBillWeld lmao
love you rand, but its silly that you removed your own voice in the video and made me read what you said. lol
Couldn't agree more.
please get back in the race.  We neeeeeeed you. #StandWithRand
well... I agree with most of what you said here.
To this day , I still can't figure out why you never got traction. To much common sense I guess.
he is another politician who is supporting hillary
as long as I see you supporting Donald Trump you have my vote
where was that guy last March?
Trump/Paul would have been overpowered.
@Madison133Patti Hmmm can you say Trump speech
@melissugh 2020 hurry up
you'll have my vote for #Senate n Nov.  Just wish you'd done this 6-9 months ago while running for #POTUS.
#Kentucky
Senator Jim Gray will make much better government than you!
@realDonaldTrump #MAGA @jerome_corsi #Trump
Is one of them telling the truth about the fake pResident ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8muZ1Pe9OAo …
The country really needed you as president.
thank God you only have 2% of support in the general electorate!  You weirdo!
u miss the point- what makes good Gov is good people trying to serve the best interest of the people not their own personal agenda
I just wish you were anti government involvement in reproductive rights.
It's so simple, it makes you see how corrupt today's liberal politicians are.
@RandPaul
You should endorse Donald Trump then.  :)
it's too bad your message doesn't resonate. What a shame.
stay in the game Doctor !!!
riots in Milwaukee Wis. BLM should target the black power Panthers
Kind of late, considering the Repubs ran up the largest deficits in history?
So now balance it all on the backs of the American people and its government while you make a clean get away?
Repubs and Dems.
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Thank you Rand Paul for DOING YOUR JOB, unlike those who claim to be a part of your party!
guess the 2020 campaign has already started
Hos message has never changed in the last 6 years. He is up for re-election in KY
nah it was just in jest. I tend to be Democratic but I would have voted for him over HRC in a heartbeat
you're awesome.  Figure out a way to win.  I'll help in any way I can.
will you endorse @GovGaryJohnson ??
he already endorsed trump...
