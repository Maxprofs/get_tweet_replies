Well what's the plan? It's either Obamacare or bend over for the insurance companies. People just want answers.
Hope and Change was a pretty broad plan too. Don't remember it being enacted 10 weeks before presidency...
That's in the past. The only thing that matters now is the future.
And 10 weeks from now, when Donald is sworn in... we can talk about the future.
That's the point...
if you want better health care kill the D in FDA. Pharma pays big, to stay exclusive & protect insane margins.
It absolutely would be a disaster! #MAGA
.@FoxNews @alllibertynews @RandPaul 

I agree wholeheartedly with @RandPaul A single-payer government health-care system would b disastorous
@KYGOP @KYHouseGOP @KYSenateDems @GrayforKentucky Obamacare will stand if Dems get in & EPA regulations.etc
Obamacare has been under fire since day one.
How about covering Trump Rape Story
liar
Well, seems you were right @RandPaul 
Government needs to exit healthcare.  #Repealandreplace. @realDonaldTrump
this person Paul needs to not be allowed in gov ever again he is a pig along side of trump
Healthcare premiums have increased every single year for the past 20 years before Obamacare.Republicans are insincere
should be our candidate. Not this goober @realDonaldTrump
@IrvinePatriot @RandPaul mynew premiums
Why a disaster for America but not for Portugal, Italy, UK, Canada, France, Germany.....?
works for other countries but it would be a disaster for the Republicans and their special interest
single payer run by government well great, like the VA, IRS, DOJ, ad absurdum.
yes a major disaster!!
@mschlapp @RandPaul sooo, where are the checks and balances of our government ?
Obamacare is the best thing that has happened to the U.S healthcare. No cap, no pre existing conditions etc.
speak up for us Mr. RandPaul
@RandPaulthen then why didn't you fight tooth and nail to repeal this disaster?  Too little too late senator
and the un-united republicans that occupy space in DC will be directly responsible for the single payer system. Good work
actually you can do a two tier system like Canada and they rate it pretty highly there save for wait times.
Lost in freedom of speech. Let me take your hand. http://s-4-v.blogspot.com 
shut her down! All of you need to get behind trump right now! Hillary need to be tried and hung!!
where is @GOP alternative to #ACA? #GOP not helping Americans, only want to keep their jobs & get paid for doing nothing
agree, because our government can't even do a proper job with Medicare/Medicaid. Providers don't want to take it.
works for many other countries. We know about Canada, U.K., Germany etc. get Wall Street out of our healthcare!
.@FoxNews .@RandPaul We See Their PLAN is COMING TOGETHER. Re-Distribution of Wealth INTO the Pockets of the ELITE
Who gives a shit about what RandPaul thinks, he's nothing but a greasy hillbilly
@jsmith6919 if u want single payer look at the VA...that is what u will get
#StandWithRand he knows what's best for u n America listen to him..
You want better rates, competition across state lines, doctors you can go to? VOTE TRUMP!!!
I agree!!
Do you Rand have any concept of What is Bad for Our Country
Obama's Failed Obamacare will Devastate Many Lives
....
@nedryun @RandPaul  how Stupid are those who wants to vote for HRC?? Increasing premium with less coverage 
...do tell Rand, exactly why would that be a disaster? would it be because it would take buddies in insurance out of it?!
RAND PAUL & REPUBLICAN GO AFTER THE INSURANCE REGULATOR,THEY THE ONE  RAISING PRICE, GREED.GREED GREED
If anyone doubts Mr. Paul just take a look at the single-payer system known as the VA Health Care System!
We can't take another single payer system! Look no further than the Canadians. Don't work.
create a dependency on government and rule for eternity.
MOST DEFINITELY! # NEVER CROOKED HILLARY ALWAYS TRUMP! TRUMP-PENCE!
EVERYTHING the govt touches turns to crap. Ask vets how the stellar VA is working out for them.
. . . Single payer. So everyone can have health care like VA.
Dems have been saying for years a single payer system was their goal. Obama said it himself.
Some people do.  Trump did before he was a GOP candidate. I don't know who this "They" is you refer to though.
this is MORE govt control n bigger gov
Exactly where HRC is headed.
I agree the less the government is involved the better it will be
more exactly total global single-payer #corporate system of management.
was the plan all along captain obvious
Voting for you , Rand, as a KY resident, but you need to crack down on immigration this time!! Our safety 1st!!!
Just look at how the government post office, VA, FBI , Justice Dept and education departments are doing! Disaster!
look at what is happening in the UK with the NHS. Promises of £ helping NHS, lies. Another one to lock up, Theresa May.
Wake up America and listen to Rand Paul!
Conservative Congress needs to drill down the Dem objective to the American people. Complete Control. Graft it.
we need candidates who will hold Healthcare providers accountable for proper billing and coding. The unspoken problem.
Why can't the Dem's open their eyes and see the truth and stop believing Hillary's lies.
no doubt
medicine in US is regulated monopoly, cost
 needs to be regulated  or opened up to competition.
@realDonaldTrump Is it safe or wise to let the government control your healthcare decisions?Bad enough that ins co's do.
@alllibertynews @RandPaul YOU R RIGHT AND U NEED TO BE CAMPAIGNING FOR @realDonaldTrump
@tjhlfld @RandPaul YES HOW ABOUT LOOK AT THE VA SYSTEM!!! #prooofinthepudding Govt by the People, not Govt knows best! @cvpayne
They have failed our Veterans miserably!
Like Gov runs Vets admin, Post Office, IRS & those are either doing poorly, involved in scandal, failing. #draintheswamp
reason jobs going to Mexico out of US but not out of Germany health care costs. Single payer cost 11% of GDP vs 20% US
I "smell" another Obama-Hillary SOCIALISM scheme
The Dems only want to grow government they do not know from the private sector
rand is right a disaster. Keep ACA and fix it. Need to regulate the drug industry.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROVEN THEY CAN'T RUN ANYTHING. IT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENTS JOB THAT'S WHY WE HAVE PRIVATE CO CAPITALISM
@angelwing10155 @RandPaul  who ya voting for Rand? Ron?
ANYTHING completely run by the government IS a disaster, including law making, budgeting, welfare, wild spending...
STOP LYING...HRC IS AGAINST SINGLE PAYER! It's ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS who have mobilized to block it in CO!  Ask Bernie!
I don't want socialized medicine I live in the US not some third world country
Yes, single player means: Dictatorship. @KhalidAsghar2
that's wht Evil Hill has been waiting 4 this since the 90s she wants2 push her agenda through take over our lives.No gov
so what's your plan in detail??  Insurance for the Rich only???
Do you realize, Dr. Paul, you could have EASILY been elected this cycle as the Libertarian candidate and saved us all?
forcing people to pay is f****** robbery
works for every major industrialized nation
@catoletters @RandPaul  Well no shit sherlock, because almost everything the Government runs or touches is an epic failure.
Not the samething and no because government before Obama care did not force you to have it or fine
government forces U to do a lot of things for the common good.
He's absolutely right. A single payer system is contrary to American culture and values. We need our own system...
Hillary & gov do not care about your health they just want to control 1/6 of America's economy will force Americans into it
Indeed
same kind of disaster all those European nations with lower costs and longer lives have suffered?
Why sir? The VA is doing so well??? Oh, I mean the administrators and politicians behind the VA are doing well.
daddy Rand
If the Government can't run the VA without people dying then what makes us think adding 350 mill will work?
The day USA elects you (Rand), Tulsi or Jill for White House then USA can celebrate a second independence day :D
disaster!
... Wrong path for America #VoteTrumpPence16 on 11/8
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #MAGA #NeverHillary
Welcome to Socialized Medicine.  #Obamacare  #WhereIsTheOutrage
Anything run by this government is a disaster.
An individual/business can purchase Health Insurance at premiums that range from $50/month to over $2,000/month per.
The higher the premiums, the better, the louder, the most volume of advertising.
The plan all along. Ask Europe & our VETS about that high quality of care! Plus enjoy that 60% income tax to pay 4 it
Single payer works in UK, most of rest of Europe, at a much lower cost to taxpayer than US system. It works.
who is they?  Not part of any plan I have read.
Already is. People need to earn things. Socialism/communism never works!!
Why do people from Canada come here for medical care!
Everyone thinks its bad except for the government machine wanting to control our lives & our choices. No thanks Hillary!
it would be!
BTW.......The term "FELLOW"......With all these "NASTY WARREN WOMEN" looking to be "Lizzie In Charge"....You're Eunuchs
Has been obama's plan all along! Why else would they have created such an abortion as Obamacare!? #AlinskyitePOS
you are absolutely correct they want single payer and it will be disastrous for us.
then GOP get out for trump ! The GOP are PUSSIES explain and stump or shut the fuck up!!
true
Rand Paul is right!! Government in total control of insurance would be disastrous for America, especially the elderly.
Who is “they”? I thought HRC was simply advocating for a public option.
voice of reason mr. Paul
you get that @mcuban
Mr. Kentucky Senator and his "Fellow" Republicans should have worried sooner about their agenda!

#VoteTrumpPence16

Single payer is coming no matter who the President is. They destroyed the system and will claim it's impossible to repair
@mschlapp @RandPaul. Thank you DOCTOR Paul !!! #LockHerUpNOW
They want insurance and drug companies to make more money and I think that is a disaster for the country.
Yeah the gop know this & still show lack of support for Trump. I don't get some of these fools
every other country that has been doing it w/ success disagrees. we can have both.Let ppl pick if they want public option
NOT a time to slow down. Call friends & text Vote @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @GOP  TELL ALL @LouDobbs @seanhannity
yep sir disaster
This 2nd failed attempt should be met with insistance that the Federal Gov't. get completely OUT of #healthcare. #FoxLDT
Rand Who?
glad everyone finally caught up to what other people have been saying from the start. You reap what you sow
please someone punch gruber in the throats multiple times let's see how good his insurance is .im betting he's exempt
I think U misspoke. It IS a disaster already. Upside down triangle of fraud (created for the sole reason to buy votes).
NO, they want to control the health care so that they can control the people!
