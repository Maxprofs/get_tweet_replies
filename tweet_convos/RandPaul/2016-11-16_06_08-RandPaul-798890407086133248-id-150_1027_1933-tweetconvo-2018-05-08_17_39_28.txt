@AmbJohnBolton is not an interventionist. He wants a strong military to keep the peace. Isolationism is deadly.
The Iraq War was an intervention. @alllibertynews @RandPaul
I support the Reagan foreign policy. In 8 years we went to war for 2 days in Grenada
with all due respect Reagan had much regret about his policy overseas. In his memoirs
he regretted millions of people around the globe being freed from tyranny?
what in the world are you talking about? I liked Reagan but I don't remember that
Eastern Europe. They even have statues of him.
all my fellow conservatives talk about 30k emails and forget how many IranContra  files were lost
@nickgillespie @reason simple solution. Lets follow constitution. No more police actions
@alllibertynews @robbysoave I don't like single question litmus test
Are you going to help try and stop the Sessions pick? He’s terrible.
@nickgillespie @reason didn't he support Mitt in 2012 for Potus?
@AJDelgado13 @reason Bolton will not be SOS. Take it to the bank.
Hey @RandPaul toss your hat in the ring for SoS. @pariahpolitics
He needs to stay in the senate just take Ron
God bless you, Senator. Wish you were made Secretary of State. I'd sleep easier knowing you had our 6 @RandPaul @TalkNerdyToMe72
I applaud you and completely agree with your assessment of Mr. Bolton.
hey Rand Paul, what do you know about military service? You're a joke
Rand Paul gets in the news promoting his own agenda but he needs to know his facts before criticizing others
@nickgillespie @reason 
oh shut up...
Do whatever you can to right this Trump ship that could sink America in more debt. You should have been President.
* Don't be so crudely crude-minded? * Don't believe the late Ahmed Chalabi again? * Don't let the British anywhere near Basra? *
How about @RandPaul for Secretary of State?
My favorite choice!
agreed, We need to exterminate Isis, etc - then get all of our troops out of the Middle East - then protect ourselves.
Let's just call it for what it is: a lie from beginning to end; that has bankrupt our country; truth being our only salvation.
omg get over it
He's right.
Please fight the Pompeo nomination as well.
just about anybody better that Giulanai and Bolton? How bout Hillary? When you win, you can pick.
@AJDelgado13 @robbysoave hilarious coming from an ideologue who is irrelevant...I'm not a Flynn fan but he hasn't even started?
OK SEN PAUL-WHO R U RECOMMENDING??
@AJDelgado13 @reason Hey man you forgot he's working for DJT now. It's all good.Sleep ez
Rand, your a little late bubba. Catch up.
@AJDelgado13 @reason @realDonaldTrump Paul for SOS
Thats OK YOU are only one vote asswipe
@AJDelgado13 @reason Ron Paul should run the federal reserve lol
@AJDelgado13 @reason Spot on Senator Paul!
This is one of the few things you have ever said that actually made sense! @realDonaldTrump
Lighten up , Francis!
Have you opposed Hillary Clinton or ANYTHING SHE DID AS A SOS, Senator? I don't think so - so SHUT UP NOW! We're not interested!
so you want Corker who completely capitulated the Treaty Provision of the Constitution to Obama for the Iran Nuke Deal?
#StandWithRand He is Truth Listen to him thxu
It was pretty sad how Mark Levin was brutalizing you last night. Apparently another guy that can't handle different philosophies.
You are entitled to your opinion. As abReb let the Pres-Elect work things out. I feel you are ready to fight Trump on everything.
Bob Corker is weak. now I'm beginning to see you are too
@UTHornsRawk he never supported DT and expect the later to listen to his unsolicited advice?
Thank you for speaking out. Keep it up!
Bob Corker's Liberty Score is an F.
F is for FAILURE
The American People selected @realDonaldTrump from 17 Rep Pres Candidates because we trusted his decisions.
Hissy fits
Agree!
All due respect Rand, I disagree w/you on this issue
Your support of Neocon Corker raises great Concern
@MayorRGiuliani
please run for #potus again. In 4 years. No doubt the DNC will go further left. We need you.
KY voters disagree. You're next.
But Corker? Didn't he neuter the Constitution in regards to treaty making? Aren't you on the wrong side of this?
I don't agree with some of your politics but thank you for being reasonable & not following this insane president off the  cliff.
I suspect that the secretary is not the policy maker. I personally believe the new POTUS understands. Stand together.
@GHFiii @reason Do the same for Secretary of Defense. @SenTomCotton says Iraq war was justified, necessary and a noble war.
I heart you Rand!
Nobody cares about your support.
You are making me sorry that I voted for you. Stop the crap and get behind our President-Elect.
Thank You!
I hope you are going to be on his cabinet
What about Bannon, he should not be anywhere near our White House
Rand Paul as Secretary of State would bring common sense and integrity to our foreign policies
Senator, I'm counting on you to be a voice of reason. Man, do I wish you were p-elect.
Corker is Kryptonite, are you kidding? You were there when he helped surrender the treaty power of the senate. Cmon
Watch out for Tammy Bruce. She is telling others to bring hammer & fist at you @RandPaul. We got your back, as always! #StandWithRand
with all do respect, but Iraq needs another war just to correct the first one.
Thank you for your principled stance. #Liberty
And I'm sure if you'd won the presidency, you'd listen to Trump's opinions on who you chose for your cabinet. 
only Trump opinion anyone should listen to is where to get chicken dinner.
America won't support you in next election
been awful quiet until Boltons name where were you Bannon how bout Trumps campaign talking to Russia,better not attach your name
Follow his money nobody could get this job with secrecy,step up step up or are you happy the GOP  agenda looks to happen
why are you feeding into the media ? Don't take the bait .
.@RandPaul @reason Amen brother.
You base your support on Bannon by your meeting him? Does track record mean nothing? Or are u simpatico?
Second-best idea I've heard today. (The first was @RandPaul for the 2020 LP POTUS nominee.)
I voted for you And your father. Keep our boys away from foreign entanglements. We'll be up the holler  if you need us.
so let's poll everyone that actually voted for it and still believe it is right. Many do. So let's take them out of office
But would the senate confirm such a person that had absorbed the lesson of Iraq? look at what Hagel went thru?
How bout you for secretary of state then
please please please apply for #SecretaryofState
Keep them honest Senator! Thank you for all you do!
I disagree with your position on Ambassador Bolton. However I supported your re-election. Congrats on that.
Please vote no on Rudy Giuliani
Sorry you are not POSTU not your decision We support Trumps decisions. They are always correct and for the People
You're largely irrelevant so I doubt anyone cares much about you. You're a nice guy though.
Suck it up, buttercup! We elected a populist Republican, not a Libertarian
…@RandPaul lesson of Iraq War for Amerikansky is if you cannot finish war before term is over, some incompetent boob aka #Obama is takeover.
Your nobody anyway. Stop trying to get notice.  Trump did what you failed to do so get over it.
#NeverTrump like @RandPaul need to be purge out in the 2018 elections. AntiTrumpers don't dictate who PEOTUS selects!
@sppeoples @reason - How about standing against that Muslim registry too, Rand?
rand your vote may mean nothing. So just take a hike
Corker is still a far cry from ideal. http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1361IS …
Recommendations?  @B_thom96 < our conversation this past weekend
What, if anything, do you SUPPORT?
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @reason if you listened/read their writings you'd know the answer is liberty. They support liberty.
Serious question - was that intended to be sarcastic?
sadly no.  Not many advocates for liberty in politics these days.
Enough! It is one thing to object to Trump but different to oppose 9/11 hero who you know will be fine Secretary of State.
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @reason Are you talking about Rudy?

What heroic thing did he ever do?

Give a speech?
I have not been a big fan but I hope you'll be a strong counter to Trumps authoritarian impulses. WATCH HIM 24 X 7!
Please continue to speak out!
I'd like to see Colin Powell great resume and temperature for that job and was one of the few in Bush cabinet not for Iraq
Thank you! I hope you are not the only one in the Republican Senate who feels this way about rumored nominees Giuliani and Bolton.
he has a point
@PatrickMay595 read this
this is why we're best friends
we definitely don't need anyone who is bought and the wars were started by Zionist warmongers
yet you can support a person that didn't learn the lessons of the civil rights movement #SteveBannon #Trump
Not  for  get 09/11 Bush Make  War.
@realDonaldTrump Mr Trump, I'm sure u agree.
trust.
Your comfort with tyranny gives away your true religion: isolationism. Too bad you fail to see how that will eventually backfire.
The  president  Bush because  Bush  War.
support MAGA team no matter what .. don't like it change in 2 years !! Get on board or get lost !!
Both Bolton & Juliana are light years better than Rand Paul. They know how the world REALLY works. They know how to protect USA.
Sir  What about  He is  protected  90/11In new York City,  all Religious  There  He is  Good  man.
@robbysoave Keep the neocons out.
a failed trump admin will open the door for @RandPaul in 2020 to win the white house. Dems & Repubs are very weak are now.  3party
@alllibertynews @reason huge @RandPaul supporter but I want @realDonaldTrump to succeed  #GodBlessAmerica
there is a reason you did so poorly in the debates, and it had to do with values not matching those of the populous.
call it what you will. Don't think anyone hates so much as the left.
Your Dad, Ron Paul needs to replace Janet Yellin.
@KGBVeteran @reason @mike_pence maybe consider Rand for SOS?
You're an inconsequential bystander.
@KGBVeteran @reason put your name in the hat Rand!
@justinamash 
@RonPaul 
@mike_pence 
@realDonaldTrump
#NoToBolton
Bravo! #StandWithRand
after their "what's an Aleppo" moment no one should listen to libertarians about anything involving foreign policy

You need to bring all views together to #UnifyTheUSA. Everyone share, tell Washington we want a unified country. Be loud, make them listen.
@KGBVeteran @reason Potz! !!!
maybe you should have won then lmao
kys
rude
follow me faggot, it's Rome
Your sentiment is understandable but We the People need Sound Uncompromising Leadership in dealing with Tyranny at home and abroad
amen
Is this something you may be interested in doing? Speak to the transition team on how best you can help. Perhaps being SOS is it.
@PhinsDiehard @elduderino82
although we need someone not working for the russians. Bolton might be the only option we have to ensure that.
but an anti-semitic xenophobe is perfectly okay
Well said, and well principled.
These things are expected for him at the time. There's a difference between "endorsing" and "agreeing", I think.
yo Rand we need you or your dad in Trump's cabinet...let us know and we can make it happen
Can try this petition
Ron warned against the shadow govt trying to come in #ronpaulrevolution must continue #standwithrand
I want u to be SOS @transition2017 pls get rand he will be great
