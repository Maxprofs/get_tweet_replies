@RandPaul You are the one in the wrong party.
@uberhamburgler @RandPaul He would fit in better as a conservative democrat than a conservative Republican. Talked about CJ reform b4 anyone
@uberhamburgler @RandPaul He also talks about cutting off funds to Israel and spending more money on education.
@uberhamburgler @RandPaul I dont agree with vouchers either. However, again, his views on criminal justice reform was ahead of the Dems.
. @RandPaul That it's 2016?
It means their debate is on @NBC, of course. @RandPaul
I think the Democrats are taking questions from cartoons. I don't know what that means, I'm just pointing it out. #DemDebate
@RandPaul: Aspires to presidency but tweets like 12-year-old lobbing spit balls and snickering. Daddy called, Rand. Time for bed. #DemDebate
@RandPaul cartoons know more about the world the Republicans? ???
@RandPaul You don't know what it means but you're saying it anyway. Perfect republican mentality.
@RandPaul out of all the republican candidates, u are most bearable,u really need to market urself better nd reachout to young Americans.
@RandPaul Means cartoons are smarter, more sensible, more humane, etc than you.
.@RandPaul Please return to the children's table, the adults are talking.
@RandPaul @minutephysics Minute Physics and Minute Earth are AMAZING educational media. Please do your homework before throwing insults.
@RandPaul  Isn't it past your bedtime
@RandPaul the GOP debate was a bunch of mean girls fighting about nothing and very clueless about the economy. War mongers
@RandPaul @Ricky_Vaughn99 We need Paul back in main debate

Kick Kasich, Bush, & Christie off
@RandPaul @minutephysics And your point being?
@RandPaul @minutephysics what are you even saying?
@RandPaul @minutephysics What's this? Targeting a younger audience? Trying to gain more votes through the youth? NONSENSE!
@RandPaul congratulations on having eyes
@RandPaul "I don't know what that means" Ummm okay?
“I think the Dems are taking Qs from cartoons. Idk what that means, I'm just pointing it out. #DemDebate” Go home @RandPaul you're drunk
@RandPaul The whole democrat party is a cartoon! #ThatsAllFolks
That's aright, @RandPaul! Tell those kids to get off your lawn!
@RandPaul I think it'd be more interesting if the #DemDebate were held #hungergames style the lone survivor gets the nomination!?
@RandPaul @minutephysics you don't know what it means and still need to comment. #pauldoespolitics
@RandPaul I remember when you were a Libertarian. Way to puss out
@RandPaul @minutephysics That "cartoon" is educating the masses on the issues that face the entire world in a new and intuitive way.
@RandPaul it is my viewpoint that a person should learn what something means before making a tweet about it to thousands of followers...
@RandPaul No one expects you to know what anything means. You're a politician.
@RandPaul what are you poll numbers again?
@RandPaul at least they are answering real questions - unlike the ones asked at the request of the Donald.
@RandPaul Check out @minutephysics or @minuteearth. They run YouTube channels that explain scientific concepts using animation.
@RandPaul @minutephysics has a lot more information than any god damn presidential debate.
@RandPaul what does the fact that it came from a cartoon have to do with it being a viable question
@RandPaul @minutephysics But Rand you take questions from Fox News all the time. The difference is cartoons might be true #DemocraticDebate
@RandPaul @minutephysics and some damn good cartoons too
@RandPaul @HeelKuruc damn it Rand stop being a down to earth regular person lol
@RandPaul @minutephysics it means you don't understand social media
@RandPaul lolololololol
@RandPaul you think American voters are cartoonish? Gee, thanks.
Interesting coming from someone who was sat at the proverbial kids table in the GOP debates @RandPaul
@RandPaul Better to take questions from a cartoon then to ask a cartoon questions. BTW that orange cartoon is leading your republican party!
@RandPaul @richie_bambara every time I try to like you, you dive into the mud. You were raised better than that.
@RandPaul who are you
@RandPaul I'll explain it for you. Americans are concerned about climate change. Some young Americans made a video asking about their ideas.
@RandPaul idk if you know about this website called YouTube you might be a bit old. It's a site where creators can upload their work!
@RandPaul I think you and the GOP candidates actually ARE cartoons.
@RandPaul You have a bunch running for President....
@RandPaul O'Reilly needs to ask the questions!
@RandPaul if there wasn't a great example of how disconnected you are before...
@RandPaul You don't know what that means? Are you listening to yourself speak? And did you even listen to the GOP debate?
Good grief.
@RandPaul that's the 21 century
@RandPaul So in short, you're making a pointless point...way to go.  smh
@RandPaul
@RandPaul, Shouldn't you be campaigning somewhere?  Finding some folks to join the .005% of voters who support you?
Focus, man.

#DemDebate
@RandPaul Better than when that toupéed orange cartoon takes questions in the #GOPDebate. #Trump
@RandPaul you're funny.
@RandPaul I think they're having a substantive discussion. Something GOP is incapable of.
@RandPaul @MattWelch It's like watching the movie "Reds" (1980)
@RandPaul I'd rather have  cartoon characters on the monitors then on the stage like the GOP debates. #DNCDebate
@RandPaul Said the candidate who did not qualify for the last debate full of clowns.  When you don't qualify to even debate w/ ingrates. smh
@RandPaul you wouldn't know what many of this means. The GOP debate questions are preschool level and you all act like a bunch of children.
@RandPaul how is the concession speech coming?
@RandPaul The visual distraction must have kept you from hearing an important policy question. This is the #DemDebate after all.
@RandPaul it means let the adults do their thing and stay out of it.
.@randpaul Take another toke. #DemDebate
@RandPaul @hankgreen @minutephysics It'd be funny if it wasn't so sad.
@RandPaul At least they're on stage to even take questions.
@RandPaul is still running for president. I don't know what that means, I'm just pointing it out.
@RandPaul dude..people who live in glass houses.. Ring a bell?
@RandPaul you're obviously not watching. That "cartoon " was an informative info graphic
@RandPaul just taking a page out of the #GOPDebate playbook where all the participants are cartoons!
@RandPaul We like cartoons. The GOP for example. 
#FeelTheBern
@RandPaul to quote the GREAT Jeb Bush from the GOP Debate, "C'mon man'
@RandPaul I think You are a cartoon, I don't ever know what you mean, I don't know how you got elected. I'm just pointing THAT out. #Dembate
@RandPaul Being the smart kid on the stage next to Trump doesn't make you smart Rand Paul.
@RandPaul Remember that time you compared Universal health care to slavery? Oh Rand.
@RandPaul @News3LV Rand Paul taking questions with the JV team #scrub
@RandPaul doesn't this seem a little bit dense, even from you?
@RandPaul well when you figure out what the thing you took the time to tweet means, let us know. I won't hold my breath.
@RandPaul it's called technology and advancement.  You should try it sometime.  Maybe even get with the times.
@RandPaul The democrats are taking questions from Real People who has a major following, so by calling us cartoons is a bad move #DemDebate
@RandPaul vs @BernieSanders would be great to see. Two people that aren’t just part of the machine. NBC fawning over Clinton is disgusting.
@RandPaul it's actually a popular form of visual style whether it's a "cartoon" or shouldn't matter. Only the question.
@RandPaul it means you're hilariously disconnected from the current state of media consumption and one of the best science youtube channels
@RandPaul sorry senator- love some of your libertarian ideas but put down the merlot and go to bed
@RandPaul shut up
@RandPaul with all due respect Mr Paul this debate is not a shit show like the GOP debates are. Stick to fixing your house
@RandPaul   #DEMDEBATE  just too stupid to watch...turned it off
@RandPaul I didn't even know they were HAVING a debate! What! Did they keep it a secret?
@RandPaul  #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul Are you drinking right now, Rand? #BourbonCountry #RandRally
@RandPaul earlier you were bragging about reaching out to the youth tho
@RandPaul you are very dismissive of a truly substantive question and important issue.... Cartoons? This attitude might fly at the GOPdebate
@RandPaul lame joke
@RandPaul please don't insult ppl of whom you may need a few votes in order to win, if you get that far. #justsaying #DemDebate #nbc
@RandPaul it sounds like cartoons because that's all you know you people never talk about real subjects just fear and loathing
@RandPaul wow I didn't know they started taking questions from you...
@RandPaul what is funny is that they used a cartoon on the projector to show the obvious but they still forgot the cost
@RandPaul you are obviously not watching the #DemDebate .. pointed questions from moderators who know their job and doing it very well
@RandPaul LOLZ!!
@RandPaul that's a weird comment- you don't know what it means? Woody woodpecker? Bugs Bunny? Explain. I need to see your source
@RandPaul A YouTube channel that builds on their ideas and creativity... I think the Republicans aren't open to things like that #DemDebate
@RandPaul you are smoking the wacky
@RandPaul great logic
@RandPaul maybe that's why u are not getting any traction
@RandPaul that's because the Republicans don't believe in science so we have to explain it to child like minds.
@RandPaul lol
@RandPaul wtf does this mean
@RandPaul pretty much the dumbest thing you could possibly have tweeted...
@RandPaul You'll never be president; but you are somewhat amusing at times.
@RandPaul Hmm. Whats better? a debate with cartoons or a debate that you dont get a invitation to?
@RandPaul It just proves what a JOKE they are!
@RandPaul Nothing like the softballs tossed by fox business the other night - with NO follow-ups!
@RandPaul Hey, that was an awesome cartoon!  :-D
@RandPaul Well, at least we can finally learn "What's up, Doc?"
@RandPaul Sadly, many of the Democrat candidates are like cartoon villains. We catch them in obvious lies, and they get away with it.
@RandPaul remember when you didn't take any questions at that last GOP debate?
@benpepben @RandPaul Nice
@RandPaul  LOLOL
@RandPaul haha
