@MalcusD @RandPaul @latimes IMO this would hand election to Dems. We tried this with Perot.  That's why Ron went Repub.  Take over within
@MalcusD @RandPaul @latimes Ron Paul and now Rand have gotten further under "Republican" than Libertarian party ever did. Smart move by Ron!
@MalcusD @RandPaul @latimes Never expect perfection.  Isolated small party is where globalist want us.  Dem party totally changed. GOP next!
@MalcusD @RandPaul @latimes They are not exactly like us but we have a lot of common ground and can get along. Religious freedom important
@johnmanko @alllibertynews @RandPaul @GOP what about Rand caucusing with dems next cycle?  There's room for a fiscal conservative #healthy
@RandPaul I now Dr Rand will be working for America therefore for the world. We really like your ideology. I hope you endorse Trump.
@johnmanko @RandPaul I know, but he is as Anti puppets as Trump is.
@johnmanko @RandPaul He just skiped the middle man I agree, but he is an expert in Bankruptcy and is exacly what the economy needs now.
@johnmanko @RandPaul  I wish I had time to be here all day but is regarding the production standards worldwide. Plus Rand cutting expenses.
@RandPaul Sadly, we may be needing you in four years.  Maybe one day we elect by issues rather than be concerned with "electability"
@johnmanko @schaabdl @RandPaul @CPAC IMO his only hope this year is VP and hard to see a viable matchup there but would love to be wrong.
.@RandPaul I guess only some 3rd party candidates...but it should be the people & media asking them *sigh*
@RandPaul No they won't which is why I am #StillRanding 
@RandPaul @latimes do not back cruz, anyone but Cruz.
@RandPaul 3). Do you think #Hillary has an edge bc this is the 2nd time running 4 the #WhiteHouse & is in everyone's memory + $$ #SuperPacs?
@RandPaul Rand is so much better than the top 3 gop candidates. He's not canned like Rubio & he destroys Trump & Cruz every time w/ logic.
@RandPaul Although i am for Bernie, you are the only other candidate defending liberty. Now the Republican party loses constitutionalism.
@RandPaul I support Rands decision to end his campaign.  Focussing on his Senate Re-election is the best choice.
@RandPaul @latimes Rand was the last chance to get freedom back
@grip642 @alllibertynews @RandPaul @latimes 
You cannot regain that which you never had in the first place.
@RandPaul Ben Carson!!! #BenCarson #BC2DC16
@RandPaul Looks like he got ran over by the Trump train....
@RandPaul 4). Whose on the list of #HillarysFoundation, #SuperPacs & #MilitaryContractors?
@RandPaul 2). Will you #EndorseTrump in order for the #RepublicanParty wins the #POTUS?
@RandPaul 1). Do you think that the #USGov has been hijacked by outside interests #SuperPacs?
@RandPaul you should be @BernieSanders running mate.
@RandPaul @latimes none.
@RandPaul Particularly about foreign policy.
@RandPaul PAUL=TIME TO DROP OUT AND SUPPORT TRUMP. TRUMP=WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. TRUMP=IS A GREAT BUSSINESS MAN. YOU HAVE TO AGREE.
@RandPaul Don't give up on Rand he needs us right now and we need him.. Please understand that.... Rand is still on ballots!
@RandPaul We needed him in debate when Jeb! said he would push Apple and others for backdoor access to encryption. No one challenged Jeb!
@RandPaul we don't need a candidate to ask questions.  We need them to tell truth and share solid solutions for WE THE PEOPLE!
@RandPaul 

We Need Rand Paul in the white house...

I will write Rand Paul's name in

I care Not that he has dropped out
@RandPaul with Rand Paul gone, say bye-bye to Freedom, and hello to more of the same.
@RandPaul @latimes no one
@RandPaul @Jason4Liberty Like who can hit that nuclear button the hardest?
@RandPaul @RandStudents @latimes #StillRanding for Liberty and small gov't.  #standwithRand #RandPaul #RandGirling
@RandPaul you will be missed!
@RandPaul You still can by supporting your party and protecting your nation. The fight is far from over.
@RandPaul @Team_Rand @_JeremyR_ 
#Congress #GOP #Hillary #AsSecretaryOfState & b4 #IranDeal DID YOU KNOW THIS!?
@RandPaul @Team_Rand @_JeremyR_ #Hillary shouldn't be on that stage to collect more money for her #SuperPacs!
@RandPaul real question is with Rand Paul gone what chance is there at having a true transparent administration?? Probably 0!!
@RandPaul No one will ask them because they are all afraid of the truth.
@RandPaul I'm hoping this is a bad joke & u r still in this thing! I'm writing u in regardless.
@RandPaul @latimes rand, you'll be one of my favorite politicians.
@RandPaul @latimes #StandWithRand #noonebutrand
@RandPaul I've been praying for a conservative miracle since 2008,
If it can't be you, Cruz is our only hope.
@RandPaul hilary, of course
@RandPaul if it is clinton vs trump or cruz you should run independent with bernie sanders
@empenadaempty @alllibertynews @RandPaul As in running mates?  Haha have you even read their policies?!  They're nothing alike!
@M1K3weber @alllibertynews @RandPaul i know. I dont even like sanders but we need a decent 3rd choice.  Clinton vs trump/cruz we are fucked
@empenadaempty @alllibertynews @RandPaul Without Rand, all of the decent choices are gone.  We're fucked no matter what now.
@RandPaul run independent
@RandPaul please run independent! If i have to choose between cruz and clinton i will vote "all politicians are crooks" party or some shit
@RandPaul you were ahead of jeb and christie in iowa! Why drop out now? You dont need money all you had to do was stay in and wait
@RandPaul You were one of the only Republicans worth his salt, yet you were marginalized on day 1. What's that tell us?Wrong party, perhaps?
@RandPaul @latimes I got this. http://mikemarkforpresident.com 
@RandPaul @latimes #StandWithRand
@RandPaul @latimes wish you would run independent
@RandPaul do you think your foreign policy could prevent persecution of Christians in India by Hindu gangs
@RandPaul The question is which candidate is even remotely capable???
@RandPaul @CARLYforAmerica will ask the tough questions. #LetCarlyDebate
@RandPaul "Just when they think they have all the answers, I change the questions." - Rowdy Roddy Piper #rip
@RandPaul supports match up more with @realDonaldTrump than #CreepyTed
@RandPaul My suggestion is to have Rand Paul moderate the next debates. There should be a ratings increase.
@RandPaul don't go senpai. We need your voice. :(
@RandPaul Run libertarian Rand, don't just give up the fight of your life.  Please God No!!!  Your the best Man for the Job and you know it!
@RandPaul @RobinEnochs He's still on the ballot in all states, just not campaigning
@RandPaul No one but Rand. #stillstanding on the ballot. VOting 4 you in Florida primary. Still handing out Super Brochures. #RandPaul
@RandPaul @latimes Who is the only other candidate who wants to stop corporate subsidies?
@RandPaul 
#SupportBiafraIndependence
#SupportBiafraReferandum
#FreeNnamdiKanu
#FreeBiafra
@RandPaul @latimes #ComeBackRand
@RandPaul Which is why you should've stayed. 
@RandPaul Please keep working for a free America!
Clean, safe food with GMO labeled. Gov't agencies that admit vaccine ingredients R unsafe!
@RandPaul   U can help Trump make America great again.
@RandPaul Nobody will. That should be obvious by now.
@RandPaul I want you to be a guest moderator @ the next & other debate. We need you to expose the truth bout Rubio
@RandPaul None of the political class. Maybe #CarlyFiorina #LetCarlyDebate
@RandPaul or answer the right ones correctly
@RandPaul @SarahsRazrSharp I like Rand Paul, but he's not a leader. We need someone who can actually get things done, like Trump.
@RandPaul be honest how much influence does the president actually have? Congress more critical from a legislative standpoint?
@RandPaul @SarahsRazrSharp Trump has been asking the tough questions, and has given others the courage to talk openly about them.
@RandPaul endorse Trump please!
@RandPaul Like, who too carpet bomb?!?  Then I'm your guy! #conservativelovebeams
I’d like to see an actual debate (iow, where off-script back-and-forth isn’t interrupted) w/@randpaul as the moderator choosing the topics.
@RandPaul @latimes no other candidate will ask tough questions like you do.
@RandPaul  Rand Paul should asked the questions. Wouldn't that be great?
@RandPaul This is the part of the process when a bunch of grown ass men & women start acting like spoiled kids for the Ent. of Amer Publc
@RandPaul Oops, already started and #FOXNEWS is eating it up.Tired of hearing TMP whine ab media bias while watching him whine abCruz onFOX
@RandPaul a sane voice in a sea of madness.  Leave the GOP, there is room for fiscal conservatives on the left.
@RandPaul Sure wish you would step up and endorse @tedcruz . He is the principled leader our country needs.
@johnmanko @RandPaul @tedcruz Yes, I know both. Do you know of a perfect candidate? At least he took a loan instead of donations from GS.
Rand Paul: Destroy gov! Destroy gov! Destroy gov! Destroy gov!

Any GOP moron can fill his role. Tough questions? Laugh.

@RandPaul
@EroticPolitics NSA illegal surveillance program, criminal justice system reform, non interventionism foreign policy.  That'll be missed
Rand was the smartest candidate...by far. He should have shoveled the typical propaganda and then addressed those as POTUS.

@MLebarno
@RandPaul @latimes #nothinghaschangedvoterandpaul
@RandPaul will #standwithRandPaul for the long haul! We have your back in Kentucky your supporters love you and your message! #StandwithRand
@RandPaul @latimes or represent views?
@RandPaul and this is what's wrong with our political system.
@RandPaul @latimes With Paul gone the candidates, on both sides, look the same on foreign and domestic policy: Big gov 1st & big gov 2nd
