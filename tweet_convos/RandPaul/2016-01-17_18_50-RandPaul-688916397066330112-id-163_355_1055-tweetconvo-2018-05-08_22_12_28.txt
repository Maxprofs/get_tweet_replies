@FNTHEHALLS 

 .@RandPaul is toast...the next one to drop out of the Preisdential race?
@TammaraMaiden1 @FNTHEHALLS @RandPaul Limit of Republicans Repertoire Bathroom Jokes. Some never Graduated from Grade School Humor.
@FNTHEHALLS @CTO1ChipNagel @TammaraMaiden1 @RandPaul lol why not you elected a community agitator'er I mean organizer for lotus haha.
@FNTHEHALLS @CTO1ChipNagel @TammaraMaiden1 @RandPaul lol reduced to name calling = you lose haha
@RandPaul Don't use the language Trump uses, you are better than that.
@RandPaul /I see that's why you were relegated to the child's table.  You can stay there too.  Don't worry we won't miss you at all!
@RandPaul @WillMcAvoyACN At least they talk about real issues unlike the clown car that is the GOP debate
@narents @RandPaul @WillMcAvoyACN guess you missed Paul's townhall during the GOP debate. All he did was address issues.
@mbgdixon @RandPaul @WillMcAvoyACN Yes, because I was watching the debate that he didn't qualify for.
@narents @RandPaul @WillMcAvoyACN I skipped it to watch his townhall. Was really good and covered real topics unlike the clown debate.
@RandPaul this is beyond disrespectful and out of touch with what it is like to be a woman.
@leahcowan @RandPaul I find it funny. Lighten up and wear a Poise pad.
@adlangston75 @RandPaul nice canned thoughtless & witless come back
@leahcowan @RandPaul I am a woman and have no problem with it.
@RandPaul At least they showed up to the debate.  You can use then bathroom all you want at home!  #GOPDebate
@StevenSilton @RandPaul I guess you didn't hear about the #RandRally
Such silliness. Bathroom? Really. This is how you prioritize the ppls needs? Where are the Jobs? @RandPaul? Can we keep ACA? @Jimmy_Webber1
@RandPaul Stop it. You know they have affiliates unlike Fox News, CNN and Fox Business.
@RandPaul this isn't your schtick. I kinda thought you were better than this type of low level comment. Stick to your platform, not insults.
@RandPaul proof that democrat women have zero sense of humor...
@RandPaul LIKE YOU SHOULD WORRY LOSER
@Webinfotech @RandPaul  If Rand loses, America does too. 4 more years of the SOS
@Carl19555 @RandPaul #Trump2016
@RandPaul Haven't watched 1 #DemDebate. Sick of Clintons, 3rd term  no way! don't want a socialist. No diversity no ideas. #CitizenGovGOP
@RandPaul Asshole
@RandPaul hahaha
@RandPaul that's the prob with politics, must we go back to the tired jokes form weeks ago. Where r people looking forward-for the future
@RandPaul You sound rude and childish - grow up. #DemDebate
@amoyal @RandPaul no sense of humor
.@RandPaul How’d the undercard debate go? Oh wait…
@dlayphoto @RandPaul He actually gained more attention by boycotting.
@RandPaul well that sure did seem like a low, sexist attempt at humor.
@MaggieGrem @RandPaul lighten up and wear a Poise pad
@RandPaul savage AF
@RandPaul sophomoric pass...
@RandPaul how did you do in the last debate? Oh that's right you weren't invited.
@RandPaul what do you expect? They are all old people... Tired ideas, tired bladders.  #DemDebate
@RandPaul In past GOP debates you could have taken a 1/2 hour piss call and not be missed
@RandPaul I thought you were an adult
@RandPaul You were irrelevant in past debates and you just sat out a debate and now you talk about potty breaks?
@RandPaul   You're disgusting.  Do you make fun of your wife that way too?
@RandPaul  for a second I was drawn to your campaign, but cheap shots at women turn me off immediately
@RandPaul hardee har har. Is that all you got? #feelthebern #MedicareForAll  #DemDebate
@RandPaul "Back to from the bathroom"?

Stfu
@RandPaul Stop trying so hard to be witty.
@RandPaul lol
@RandPaul
.@RandPaul don't hate just because you didn't even make it onto the clown car debate. #ImWithHer
@RandPaul #StayClassyRand
@RandPaul no one gets his humor. He's just making fun of the last silly debacle. #StandWithRand
@RandPaul I hope that was a #BitchSlap @realDonaldTrump Otherwise...
@RandPaul hopefully you make the main stage next time
@RandPaul LOL yes or people would have to hear Donald comment about how gross it is, not about politics.
@RandPaul Grow up. @WillMcAvoyACN
@RandPaul @WillMcAvoyACN still smarting from your debate demotion, huh Rand? You're polling at 3%, at best. Just drop out already, it's sad.
@RandPaul nice joke, loser. Backfired a bit eh?
@RandPaul thats because a circus is entertainment enough that doesn't need commercials. #DemDebate is an ACTUAL debate. #letsbereal
@RandPaul What are your numbers again? @WillMcAvoyACN
@RandPaul You need to grow up.
@RandPaul You're a real class act
@RandPaul It takes a few minutes to get back to the main stage. But you wouldn't know that.
@Dave__52 @RandPaul  Did Fox hire all you trolls to come out tonight?
@RandPaul they could probably use a nap too.
@RandPaul I crave civility in public discourse. Your comments add to the problem we're seeing in American politics. Play nice.
@RandPaul That was a little beneath you Sen.Paul.
@RandPaul Republicans are all obsessed with urination apparently
@RandPaul Depends if it's occupied. I hear Dems have shy bladders when they have to share public bathrooms with those beneath their station.
@RandPaul why hurry, it's like a soap opera, you don't miss much
@RandPaul  holy katz she bellows like a braying donkey! YIKES!
@RandPaul @WillMcAvoyACN I never do. I'm glad I'm DVRing it.
@RandPaul I usually see U operate with class, U have been standing next to Trump too long.....
.@RandPaul She probably didn't read the cable that said she need to be back promptly.
@RandPaul moron.
@RandPaul That break isn't long enough for one as full of S@#t as you!
@RandPaul. Rude.
@RandPaul good comment rand trump. #DemDebate
@RandPaul Stay in your lane. Typical #nastyGOPresponse. Not Presidential. But knew that.
You're a douche @RandPaul. Nice bathroom joke. We missed you at the last Republican debate. Heh.
@RandPaul really?  You have a issue with women I see.  How surprising
@RandPaul are you 8 years old? Stop tweeting garbage and tell me how you are going to fix things in this country?
.@RandPaul Dude... You're better than this... Stop.
@RandPaul don't be a Trump, you're the only semi likeable republican and you're not exactly relevant anymore.
@RandPaul Were u on time from your  bathroom break at the GOP debate??? Oh wait, u weren't there! Go have a seat... on the toilet!
@RandPaul bernie acknowleged he wants a national police force. His own private group of brown shirts. Worried about loss of freedom
@RandPaul @WillMcAvoyACN You won't. Your damn campaign was flushed down the toilet months ago. Round the bowl down the hole. #DemDebate
@RandPaul have to keep bathroom breaks up for dem drinking game and let @HillaryClinton & @BernieSanders go to bathroom as well
@RandPaul your mind is in the toilet.
.@RandPaul A small, petty comment. Surely you can do better than that.
@RandPaul don't you have anyone to spell check your cheap shots? #DemDebate
@RandPaul Something you don't have to worry about bro, you weren't on the main stage last time.
@RandPaul my vote only goes to you I have barely much in common with any dem but you I agree the most with in our candidacy today.
@RandPaul Rude.
@RandPaul feel the burn
@RandPaul what a very "presidential" remark. So much class and poise! Exactly who I want 4 president... Not!
@RandPaul I think somebody's got their feelings hurt. Hope there's enough tp. Lol
@RandPaul savage
@RandPaul god forbid people USE THE BATHROOM. holy shit. human anatomy. gross. holding it in until you get an infection. only way to do it.
@RandPaul tasteless
What a sexist comment. #stfu RT @RandPaul: Another break already? I hope everyone makes it back to from the bathroom in time #DemDebate
@RandPaul 
Sigh....
Your comments are juvenile
And.... Unfollow..
@RandPaul your jokes are lame. No wonder you're not connected with young people.
@RandPaul Manners, please!
@RandPaul , clever. But you're not not bright.
@RandPaul make #pancakes ^^
@RandPaul Bathroom humor?  Doesn't surprise me.  #JVTeam
@RandPaul The format is so 60's.  Let the candidates sit down.
@RandPaul Must be nice getting to watch 2 debates back to back.
@RandPaul God, I don't know how your wife deals with your stupidity or do you check how long she takes when she goes to bathroom #pathetic
.@RandPaul waka waka
@RandPaul riding on the back of Trump now?
@RandPaul below the belt, but still good. #RandRally
@RandPaul Martin was in the back shotgunning Red Bulls.
@RandPaul are you really a doctor???? Making potty jokes? Did you go to medical school???
@RandPaul this debate is awful
@RandPaul at least they showed up!
@RandPaul miss a work there buddy. Didn't see you on the stage at all 
You're not very nice. I want a nice president. @RandPaul
@RandPaul Hillary only shook twice this time...
@RandPaul aren't you just so funny
@RandPaul makes you wonder what they thinks more important... The future of the United States or the size of their wallets and ego.
@RandPaul hahaha.
@RandPaul Why? Sir Why? #DemDebate
@RandPaul or Hook  up a Hose ??lol.
@RandPaul - Was that a thinly-veild sexism comment?
@RandPaul need as many breaks from the democrats as possible
@RandPaul  with all the crap coming out of their mouths, I hope the #DemocraticDebate has enough toilet paper!
@RandPaul tall talk from someone who was assigned to the kids table
@RandPaul watch if u want 2 learn more Rand Paul Revolution! The Most Interesting Man In Politics https://youtu.be/DR5AKGM0bEU  via @YouTube
@RandPaul #standWithRand it's ridiculous how people follow you just so they can post negative comments. Must feel threatened!
@RandPaul Keep whining Rand. You will never be President.
@RandPaul time to hit the coke, paul!
@RandPaul hahaha you're funny! #NOT
@RandPaul I want bathroom time in your mouth
@RandPaul thanks for putting that image in my head - yikes
@RandPaul They've covered more substantive issues in their first 50 minutes than the GOP debates have combined. #DemsDebate
@RandPaul don't be a Trump!
@RandPaul go away
@RandPaul It's more fun when (at least) one of them doesn't.
@RandPaul  #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul glad your watching the big show
@RandPaul No worries. They are all wearing depends.
@RandPaul haha #DemDebate
@RandPaul How about you stop complaining about your kiddy table and eat your veggies?
Hey @RandPaul - go watch #OITNB @LOLGOP
@RandPaul It's disgusting!
@RandPaul looks like they did!
@RandPaul Nice one. The rules don't apply to @HillaryClinton. They were lost long ago on her private server.
@RandPaul now you sound like Donald Trump
@RandPaul tasteless
@RandPaul 

I hope they don't.
First ever debate, 2 candidates break a hip trying to get back to podium.
@RandPaul Depends.  (see what I did there?)
