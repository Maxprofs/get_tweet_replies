@zack_pennington @RandPaul yee yee bub! #CantHandleTheRandal
@RandPaul lower taxes? Bernie wants to raise tax for his health care plan. Oh, and free college.
@RandPaul @realkodybrown  uh like you pay your fair share. Last I checked you were scamming the system of welfare checks and food stamps!!!
@RandPaul yes please, I'm tired of this tax code, ridiculous
@RandPaul Shame on Iowa! After that video, how could you not vote for Rand?? #IowaCaucus #NewHampshirePrimary #StandWithRand #StillRanding
@RandPaul #YouMustChampionTheRealWageIssue https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10153798598608670&id=773523669&_rdr … #KnockSandersOffHisStool so you can get elected @GOP may give you VP nod!
@RandPaul Let people keep more of what they earn. Brilliant! #StandWithRand #randrally #DemDebate
@RandPaul @redostoneage Mr.Paul. That is a thought that is way to deep for Democrats to image
@RandPaul @realkodybrown right until your TLC ship came in
@RandPaul @thebuffington why don't we try getting people/corporations to actually pay their taxes before lowering them.
@RandPaul ....most of us can figure out @turbotax , it's pretty easy. #demdebate #debatewithbernie
@Hippies4Bernie @RandPaul @turbotax 14.5% flat tax and none under $50K eliminates payroll. I guess you can stick with 26% and hikes
@adlangston75 @RandPaul @turbotax 2.2% income tx on all Americans and a 6.2% levy on emplyers. http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/17/politics/bernie-sanders-medicare-plan/ …  $50,000 pay $466 tx
@Hippies4Bernie @RandPaul This will never work. Good luck getting a job. The unemployment rate would go up to pay for the costs
@adlangston75 @RandPaul Invest in infrastructure 4 tons of new jobs. Weve got a crumbling interior that can employ our people! #newnewdeal
@RandPaul NO TAX.EFFICIENT MANGMT OF OUR COMMON WEALTH & WHEN THE LAST DOLLAR FROM THAT IS ALLOCATED.THAT'S AS BIG A GOV AS WE CAN AFFORD.
Good idea Rand!
yea, the 99%ers didn't want this, instead they want to impose some kind of greedy self centered social justice
70k pages, is that all? You need lessons from #EU ! Look & learn @BrexitTheMovie (youtube)
@RandPaul @alllibertynews now you're talking
@RandPaul Clear and understandable Hope and Dignity for 2,000,000 jobs creation.  Fair taxes all Americans can live with.
@RandPaul How about we abolish unconstitutional 'income' taxes and the criminal, unauthorized private corporation the IRS.
@RandPaul #DemDebate Stop Neo-fascist trolls from getting the USA into a pre-Nazi War of politics.
@RandPaul @KatyinIndy Correctamundo!
@RandPaul Would you support limiting the number of pages per piece of legislation to 100 pages or less?
@RandPaul Hey Rand, you had your chance now go back to children's table and eat your carrots!
@RandPaul I like your plan and I think you should be president.
@RandPaul helluva plan
@RandPaul because muh 1%
@RandPaul  -great, the poor will pay MORE!!! Perfect plan for the corporate welfare scam we've got going.
@RandPaul Why are you even speaking? You had your chance at a debate and chose not to show up! #GOPfail
@RandPaul :Why don't you worry about your son's legal issues & not about things that you'll never get elected to fix #itsaboveyourpaygrade 
@RandPaul you 1st need to get rid of the IRS or it won't go away. Like obomacare it hasn't gone away and that's why we elected Republicans
@RandPaul Trump will bring Democratic Congressional landslide and #KochFamily a 90% rate.
@RandPaul nah.  health and education are much more important to me than money.
.@RandPaul I love your plan!
1 hour into debate - only discussing things that Obama already said he fixed. #DemDebate @RandPaul
@RandPaul Because if they FIX it, they can't promise to fix it next election.
@RandPaul 
One flat tax for all.  Eliminate property's taxes.  No deductions.
@RandPaul That would be such a shock, albeit a pleasant one. Won't happen with this crowd. Margaret Thatcher had it right
@RandPaul 

This is ridiculous none of them even mentioned what tax they will be taking out of what income. Liars much?
@RandPaul : The republicans hate to pay taxes and the Democrates are very good with giving away people money to others not their own money.
@RandPaul would love to see it, but your GOP colleagues won't have it. They're owned by Koch, Oil, and Pharmaceuticals.
@RandPaul #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul For over 100 years, before 1913, we did just fine without an income tax.
@RandPaul outstanding idea! Why r u the only one saying this?? Y doesn't anything ever get done?? Cuz it's all talk.
.@randpaul I believe the #GOP is standing in the way of that. #DemDebate
@RandPaul Dems? Doing something that makes sense?! #Blasphemy #WatchTheWorldBernWithComradeSanders #RandRally
@RandPaul without tons of taxes, how will the middle class pay for all of Bernie's free goodies? #RandRally
-@RandPaul If you show up to debates you generally get a say
@RandPaul  how about you drop out already?#DEMDEBATE
@RandPaul how about we show up for our job and vote for things that help the country?
@cptnloco262 @RandPaul Such as???? Rand has one of the best voting records
@RandPaul you're still running?
@RandPaul But you just said to give tax breaks for college! Make up your freaking MIND RAND
@RandPaul how about the #fairtax
@RandPaul that oil money is still helping you out.
@RandPaul because your supporters are incapable of using an index of TOC to find relevant info?  GTFO.
@RandPaul you mean like @tedcruz tax plan?
@arnoldse38 @RandPaul @tedcruz Not!
.@RandPaul  #Winning
@RandPaul  Your plan cant get no better Rand non only reason if they dont like it is they want the ripoff to continue #SWR #DemDebate
@RandPaul low taxes help rich
@_GeorgeRoberts @RandPaul Rands tax plan helps poor, no taxes for those making under $50K and eliminates payroll taxes
@adlangston75 @RandPaul rich need to pay more, not less.It just undermines middle class. Poor shld pay some tax too so have stake in society
@RandPaul and what would are source of income be?
@RandPaul Because liberals cannot comprehend simplicity.
@RandPaul  Tax reform woo!
@RandPaul nah man... a good tax code system is one that even tax consultants are struggling to understand. ;)
@RandPaul I have a PHD as well .
@RandPaul lets lower taxes to around 5 foot 5
@Trumps1stMember @RandPaul Jealous much?
