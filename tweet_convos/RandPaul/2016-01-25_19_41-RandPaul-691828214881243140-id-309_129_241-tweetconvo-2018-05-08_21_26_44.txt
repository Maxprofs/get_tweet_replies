@RandPaul Oh please, admit that you support longstanding socialist institutions in the US.  You are a BSer if you can't admit that.
@WEBBtheJust @RandPaul prove it pal
@kjoo25 @RandPaul US military, police, libraries, social security-- all good socialist institutions, Rand ought 2 be able 2 admit 3 of those
@TevinMcDade @kjoo25 @RandPaul Failing  to admit support for longstanding socialist institutions= dishonesty that impedes beneficial reform
Why don't you focus on Fascism in the White House?  Why ignore the real problem at hand?
@RandPaul @SquareCash You want everybody to chip in to help you stop everybody from chipping in to help eachother?
@xmikesparx @RandPaul @SquareCash He's "asking" you to chip in. The government is 
"telling" you to chip in or be locked in a cage.
@BrownleeMathew @RandPaul @SquareCash I see. Having to ask for aid is better than mandatory aid.
@sotohito @BrownleeMathew @RandPaul @SquareCash Your society is more selfish than mine. I'm out.
@sotohito @BrownleeMathew @SquareCash Who are all these bloody people, then? Why do I have to queue? Why don't I go around starting fires?
@bilgewarning @RandPaul Rand is pay for by the people cause he work for us. #STANDWITHRAND Nothing is free.
this is the saddest tweet I have ever read @RandPaul
@TommyECook @RandPaul the number of people voting for rand paul and the percentage he ever holds public office again
@RandPaul I cannot distribute my money to you. That would be socialism.
@LZipher @alllibertynews @RandPaul $2.00 bribe? It's a contribution. If more contribute, the bribery from corp/elitists will be diminished.
@RandPaul #stillsanders #bernieorbust
@RandPaul Dear Rand, Pooling money together for a common goal *is* socialism.
@RandPaul Defeat socialism? You mean police & fire services, roads, highways, bridges, libraries, parks, education, arts, healthcare, etc?
@RandPaul It's good that Twitter has a mute button.
@RandPaul @SquareCash this is actually socialism
@RandPaul Why weren't u guys screaming about socialism when the middle class was forced to bail out the wealthy on Wall Street? #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul This is radical redistribution of wealth and I won't stand for it
@TevinMcDade @RandPaul Fitting your profile starts with B.S.
@RandPaul all the millions millennial are pumping into Bernie Sanders they should start college fund and invest it.
@RandPaul Please clap.
@RandPaul @SquareCash So this is that actual Rand Paul scary guy? Not someone making up something transparently stupid, to make fun of him?
@RandPaul Stop asking for handouts you moocher.
@RandPaul @SquareCash Sure. I'll donate! Going to donate to @BernieSanders campaign right now! Great idea! Thanks! #WeAreBernie
@griselbahena1 @RandPaul @SquareCash @BernieSanders you will love the bread lines #RANDRALLY
@kjoo25 @RandPaul @SquareCash @BernieSanders #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul defeat socialism for only $2! Some conditions apply.
@RandPaul @SquareCash lol wut
THE HYPOCRISY
So you want people to pool their resources together for a perceived common good? Hmmm...I'll stop my thought there.
Oh the irony is strong here
@RandPaul From Europe it looks like the US desperately needs Socialism in order to survive as the Founding Fathers envisaged.
@theassmanNY @RandPaul It's*
@RandPaul @SquareCash Love your work Rand! Does anyone know how Rand Paul would feel about being VP?
@miles_athompson @RandPaul @SquareCash We're thinking POTUS sounds better #RANDRALLY
@RandPaul @SquareCash gave it to @SenSanders  #NotMeUs  sorry, Rand
@RandPaul Defeat socialism?  You mean end social security, eliminate public schools, police fire dept, highways all run by corporations?
@marym652 @RandPaul you wish you knew what you we're talking about. None of that is true. http://randpaul.com  learn the real @RandPaul
@RandPaul #STANDWITHRAND #RANDRALY
@RandPaul if I weren't on such a limited income, I would. I've already donated $20 despite having bills.
@tmgodfrey07 @RandPaul thank you Travis
@kjoo25 @RandPaul You're very welcome. I only wish that I could do more. We all want to see @RandPaul getting his fair shake.
@RandPaul If we're going to defeat socialism, we need to get the Republican party together and stop attacking each other. #DividedWeFall
@Dennis_QH3 @RandPaul then #STANDWITHRAND
@RandPaul stop begging for miney
@RandPaul @SquareCash isn't asking for this type of money socialism, or is that communism?
@RandPaul #FeelTheBern beotch! 

@SquareCash
@RandPaul @SquareCash Socialism...
@RandPaul I'll do if if you will first tweet a shout-out to some of my buddies let me know.
@RandPaul No thanks, I'll waste my cash on Powerball tickets instead!
@RandPaul Like in many other parts of the country, ppl saw your name on the ballot and thought they were voting for your father.
@RandPaul Defeat socialism? You are a delusional hypocrite like the rest of your GOP compatriots who collect their SS and decry socialism.
@RandPaul You are unhinged mate. Best see a Dr if you are worried about socialists. #uspoli
@RandPaul Why do you want a handout? Do you not have the means to feed yourself?
@RandPaul You're begging 4Campaign$ that's illegal @jack @Support don't let @RandPaul solicit cash donations on @Twitter @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump C @RandPaul Can I get another 100 donors from Twitter tonight? We must defeat Socialism. Contribute $35, $11, or just $2!!
@RandPaul   Sorry, I think a better investment is a great bottle of California wine! Cheers!
@RandPaul Oh brother...Reeks of desperation
.@RandPaul "Screw #Socialism, Give Your Money To Rich Guy"
@RandPaul asking for handouts is what you consider socialism. You are wrong btw.  Also Christianity=socialism.
@RandPaul @SquareCash great idea, a socialist solution to the socialist problem. Taking fighting fire with fire to the next level!
@RandPaul isn't this Socialism itself?
@RandPaul Good money after bad
@RandPaul @SquareCash what would Ayn Rand say if she saw you being all socialist up in here
@RandPaul   You crack me up!
@RandPaul I'd rather get 35 McDonald's dollar menu items
@RandPaul   You may have an MD but you are as bad as Carson. Ignorant & selectively stupid.
@RandPaul @SquareCash are you still a "thing" ? I thought you had a TV show. RandPauls Drag Race
@RandPaul Speaking as a Canadian, socialism is pretty awesome and nothing to fear. You do need empathy towards other humans, though.
@RandPaul in which country?
@RandPaul @SquareCash the problem with socialism is that, eventually, you run out of other people's money.
@RandPaul that's socialism.
.@RandPaul sorry, the socialists got here b4 u. I gave all my bitcoin to them. https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/691828214881243140 … 
#FeelTheBern
Can I get another 100 donors from Twitter tonight? We must defeat Socialism. Contribute $35, $11, or just $2!! http://cash.me/$RandPaul 
.@RandPaul @SquareCash Quit asking for cash and sell your segway Blart
@RandPaul @SquareCash lmao
@RandPaul suckers
@RandPaul You really don't see the irony, do you? Are you sure that's not an honorary doctorate? :smh:
@RandPaul  still talking about a #blowjob from 1996. #Clinton #RandPaul
@romac419 @mdcolliM @RandPaul Thats because only boys ever gave him a blow job
@RandPaul I always respected you, but pooling funds to fight pooling funds?
@RandPaul @SquareCash LOL. Asking for donations to fight socialism. Boy, that's rich.
@DadBoiler @RandPaul @SquareCash Donations are voluntary.
@RandPaul You want to use socialism to defeat socialism?
@RandPaul So you're saying that if we pool our $ together we'd have the collective power to defeat Socialism? #MixedMessages #irony #LMGTFY
@moralinjuryblog @RandPaul Voluntarily pool our money. "Voluntarily" being the key word making it not ironic.
@RandPaul @OLDFE1 something to spend yr pocket money on
@OLDFE1 oh no... what a terrible shame...
@RandPaul Pooling resources for the common good? Sounds an awful lot like socialism...
@RandPaul fighting socialism with...socialism?...that's tight.
@RandPaul dude, I don’t think you know how socialism works…
@Wensh88 @RandPaul Oh really? Why don't you enlighten us all on how it "works"?
@RandPaul @SquareCash I always thought that everyone pooling their money together in order to achieve something was socialism
@RandPaul I thought this was a parody. No irony at all.
Since when is the @RandPaul handle owned by The Onion????
Can I get another 100 donors from Twitter tonight? We must defeat Socialism. Contribute $35, $11, or just $2!! http://cash.me/$RandPaul 
@RandPaul <--you're time has come and gone. Now, be gone.
@RandPaul this request sounds suspiciously like a call for socialist action. Can you please explain?
@RandPaul No.
@RandPaul @SquareCash To defeat socialism you're asking a bunch of people to come together to donate small amounts to all be equals?
@RandPaul https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RxWJd3w3QPs …
@RandPaul @JohnEmminger @SquareCash john what's your problem with socialism?
@McHugh @RandPaul creeps me out when dead men tweet about archaic nonsense
@RandPaul kind of socialistic of you no?
@RandPaul And replace it with what? Every man for himself? Kick the sick to the curb? Watch children starve&folks die of old age on the job?
@RandPaul requested $2 from you. Please respond.
@RandPaul uh... Rand, old boy? When you want us to pool our money for a cause, that IS socialism. Hello?
@Edgewise2 r donations and taxes the same thing douchebag? think about it @alllibertynews @RandPaul
@lerudefrog @alllibertynews @RandPaul Name-calling? You are rude.
@Edgewise2 @alllibertynews @RandPaul pulling money together for a cause thru free will is not same as collecting money thru govt force
@RandPaul #lazarus @dansuozzo
@RandPaul I was going to say people on Twitter don't give shit, but that's all they give
@RandPaul @SquareCash lol
@RandPaul ack i gave my last five dollars to socialism!
@RandPaul LOLOLOLOLOLOL
You just need to pray to AquaBuddha! I'm sure he'll "bless" you with the cash Randy!
You want to defeat socialism, by having lots of people give just a little for what you think is for the betterment of all. 

@RandPaul
@KalSonofJorEl Brilliant! Love it
@RandPaul the irony of publicly asking for money while bashing socialism ....
@RandPaul hates socialism, wants people to share their wealth with you...
@RandPaul Oh the irony 

"This is like O. Henry and Alanis Morissette had a baby and named it this exact situation"
@RandPaul You want to defeat socialism by collecting money from everyone?  HAHAHAHA.  K.
@RandPaul irony escapes you, doesn't it?
@RandPaul I contribute money to defeat YOU.
@RandPaul don't think you understand what socialism is bud
@RandPaul Can't your campaign pull itself up by its bootstraps like a good capitalist?
@RandPaul maybe we should all pitch in to buy you a dictionary and you can look up the definition of socialism
@RandPaul asking a community to give money to you would be 'socialism'. What are you a Dr. of?
@RandPaul No disrespect but really... crowdfunding to defeat socialism is kinda hysterical.
@RandPaul are you aware of the irony of asking everyone to work together to defeat something they can't beat alone (socialism)?
@RandPaul Are you running for president or collecting for a lotto pool?  $2?
@RandPaul "Can I get another 100 donors from Twitter tonight?We must defeat Socialism."...by pooling our money together for the common good?
@ElkFondue @RandPaul One voluntary, one forced. #tryingtoohardtobeclever  #dumbpoint
@RandPaul What if we just redistribute campaign funds so you have a prayer of winning? #tryingtohelphere #DEFEATSOSHULIZMZ
@RandPaul maybe get a better job and run for president when you can afford it.
@RandPaul donors or donuts...?
@RandPaul @SquareCash no thanks. I contribute to Bernie. I want my taxes going to education healthcare & infrastructure, not war & walls.
@HeathNOLA @RandPaul @SquareCash bernie sanders votes for Afghanistan war. Rand paul has been most consistent on this issue
@MLebarno @RandPaul @SquareCash Rand can't win as a Republican, so it doesn't matter. Not enough people are anti-federalists like Rand.
.@RandPaul No, socialism is BOSS.
@RandPaul Once you have gotten rid of those pesky public school leeches, we can work on those socialist drains like Dams & Highways!
#FDR
@RandPaul Don't forget about those socialist 'public' schools either!
#Freeloaders
#BurdenOnSociety
@RandPaul Great thinking! Let's use socialism to combat socialism! That'll teach those socialists!
#WhatDoWordsMean
#Irony
@RandPaul SOCIALISM! BURN HIM! BURN HIM AT THE STAKE!
@RandPaul how much do I kick in to defeat cronyism?
@RandPaul promotes socialist behavior to defeat socialism.
@RandPaul Or I could do something more worthwhile with my money, like burn it. That would at least provide a small amount of warmth.
@RandPaul So... we all pool our money together for one cause....?
@RandPaul so we should defeat police, fire, and emsa services?
@RandPaul Define socialism. Is it corporate subsidies? Is it 35 years of economic redistribution to the top AKA Trickle Down? #Plutocrat
@RandPaul Will you help get the Commie out from under my bed?
@RandPaul no you can't , Donald Trump is going to be the next president
@RandPaul because capitalism has made the world such a warm cosy place hasn't it
@Carole29 Capitalism produced the computer you're typing on right now Carole. @RandPaul
@RandPaul please get out of the race your not relevant anymore than I am
@RandPaul @SquareCash Are you seriously asking for donations to defeat socialism? You batshit Americans don't do irony do you?
@RandPaul if we all chip in we can defeat socialism. Also if anyone wants to help save my son's life by shooting him in the face pls dm me.
@RandPaul Let's all pool our money in a collective effort to defeat collective efforts!
. @RandPaul haha, that's a very socialist idea
@RandPaul so to combat "socialism" your asking people to give you money. For nothing. K.
@RandPaul Take up a collection for a better education instead.
@RandPaul I can't just give you money.  You need to come over and do something.  Wash my car.  Dance.  Let me punch you.  Something.
@RandPaul lmao dude
@RandPaul THIS IS SOCIALISM. THIS. This asking for money from the public. IS socialism. To defeat socialism, STOP ASKING FOR MONEY.
@RandPaul Why not defeat prejudice and hate instead? Oh yeah, that would be too left wing wouldn't it.
@RandPaul http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony 
@RandPaul Sir, your methods of requesting monetary assistance are indeed socialistic.
@RandPaul You are picking the wrong battle.  You share, sir, more in common with the socialists than with the right wing neofascist cadre.
@RandPaul sounds a lot like socialism to me
@RandPaul this is collective action, and collective action is socialist
@RandPaul instead of hating government and worshipping corporations, why don't you try to get along with people and make govt. better?
@RandPaul Yes, let us pool our resources into a collective so that we individualists can use that to defeat Socialism.
@RandPaul delete your account.
@RandPaul the world owes you nothing, Rand.
@RandPaul pull yourself up by your bootstraps and stop expecting someone else to do it for you.
.@RandPaul what are the stretch goals
@RandPaul @SquareCash Aren't you rich? Can't you defeat socialism on your own?
@RandPaul @SquareCash You want to defeat socialism by using the socialist method?
@RandPaul randy, do you know what socialism is?  If you do, you're a hypocrite; if you don't, stop using the word.  #WeAreBernie #Bernie2016
@RandPaul Really? That's the slogan you're going with? Defeat socialism? No schools, libraries, or roads? Have fun with that.
@RandPaul @SquareCash You can't even get past Marco Rubio, how do you think you can beat Bernie? #youcant #socialismisfortherich
.@RandPaul how much exactly does it cost to dismantle a concept? Is it cheaper than dismantling a tower block? What about a car engine?
.@Flofflewotsitz  *Passes @RandPaul an abacus*
.@RandPaul sounds a little “from each according to his ability”? Nice to see you expressing a Marxist view point.
@RandPaul is this tweet from 1952? Is my bathroom breeding Bolsheviks?
@RandPaul @SquareCash I can't believe all these people don't even understand what voluntarism vs socialism is
@RandPaul @SquareCash distributing our money to you WOULD be socialism, you dart machine...
@RandPaul  How about some free advice?  Quit the race
@RandPaul sod off
@RandPaul @SquareCash Why would you want to stop this? #SocialismIsCool
@RandPaul You're still talking?
@RandPaul Have you tried @CumFundMe?
.@RandPaul Why "must" we defeat socialism?
@RandPaul I’m also accepting donations
@RandPaul  The radical right oligarchy had killed the American middle class. We need a little socialist movement to help the rest of us
.@RandPaul I already pay your salary with my taxes.  How much more money do you need?
@RandPaul @SquareCash do you even know what that is?
@RandPaul so socialism to defeat socialism?
