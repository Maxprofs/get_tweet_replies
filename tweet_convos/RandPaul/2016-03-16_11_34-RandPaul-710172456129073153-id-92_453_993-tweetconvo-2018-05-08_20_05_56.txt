Combined with the Presidential race it is difficult to conceive of a reason to confirm a judge before the end of this term.
The President gets to nominate but the senate must consent, and I am not simply going to let him have his way without a heck of a fight.
@RandPaul would someone show the American people on the air by hi lighting those words because I am not reading the Sen has 2 do that at all
@RandPaul @GrayforKentucky is wrong for KY. He would rubber stamp anything that is 4 gun control. #StandWithRand #2A
Randomly throwing a bunch of GOP catchphrases together isn't helping your cause. @POTUS is constitutionally required to nominate. @RandPaul
@lawhawk @POTUS @RandPaul Senate Constitutionally bound to refuse or grant consent to appoint. There are no Senate time constraints to act.
Obstructionism isn't advice/consent. It's unprecedented in history of nation. Consequences to GOP will be severe @uvbogden @POTUS @RandPaul
@RandPaul Hold up..the President isn't unconstitutional for nominating a SC Justice. Is that what you're saying?
@RandPaul do not give in to him you have control of senate and house
@RandPaul funny how quick and conveniently everyone forgets Schumer and Dem's stance on this EXACT same issue in 2007.
@RandPaul how could that creat a confict of interest DR?
@RandPaul Shut up Doc! U wudnt know a great president if u tripped on him #teabaggers #GOP #RandPaul
@RandPaul Rand I respect you more than any other republican candidate despite us not agreeing on most things- this can't be how you feel
@RandPaul When has Obama cared about the constitution.
@RandPaul Your right!
@RandPaul @alllibertynews We need to abolish Washington DC and take our original constitution back!! Before 1871
@RandPaul @alllibertynews What else is new? If u can do insider trading and ban it from everyone else, and if SCOTUS can pass laws now
@RandPaul I thought Rand Paul was his own thinker and not afraid to stand up to the rest of the Republicans. RAND PAUL is no leader.
@RandPaul why won't you guys move for his impeachment?
@RandPaul no, it states that he "shall" choose a nominee, not he "gets" to - do your job, hold hearings. as an american citizen, I demand it
@RandPaul Gotta try and pack the court like the Democrat idol, FDR.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Stop lying. He has used Executive Orders, just like every president, and a hell of a lot less than predecessors.
@RandPaul Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia ..., a judge should interpret law, not make it.
@RandPaul  Its astonishin the outright disrespect toward decisions to protect n do whats right for America you must stop them #StandWithRand
@RandPaul  Regan did it where were the republicans whining about it then?
@RandPaul The Senate should take the high ground for once and do its job to consider the President's nomination.
@RandPaul You tweeted a conflict of interest as a grievance . Is this a distraction of duties from the ongoing Presidential race ?
@RandPaul 'Usurped?' Show your work.
@RandPaul @LesPaulReese  Paul grow a pair of balls & impeach obama now & deport his disgraced ass back to Kenya where he was born.
@RandPaul And the President probably voted for himself too. Is that a conflict of interest?
@RandPaul Franklin Roosevelt did the exact same thing. That's who Obama models himself after. Decades to unwind.
Sen @RandPaul thinks the President doing what the Constitution says his job is = usurpation, but the Senate refusing to do it's job is fine.
@pecunium I think @RandPaul's talking about other usurpations of power, not appointing a justice, but using that as an excuse not to approve
@RandPaul This guy is more conservative than whoever Hillary nominates next January.
@RandPaul Thanks for staying in the #Senate, we will clean out the trash eventually, and there is trash there & the #House. @tlamb775
@RandPaul With only seven case to base an opinion the nominee seems willing to negate the second amendment just say no!  Thanks
@RandPaul Busted! Hillary caught cheating, fixing debate
@RandPaul Senator Paul will you step up&endorse the one presidential candidate who knows Constitution, by heart, & will defend it absolutely
@RandPaul 'John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!'
@RandPaul If you take this to the Supreme Court you will lose the case. Just as you did about O'bama Care and abortions.
@RandPaul I know you guys disagree on a few things but you both see the big picture! 
#Trump/Paul
@RandPaul There's lots of conflict of interest  not enough paper to write it on. So lets save the trees and get busy #fixinit
@RandPaul So are you going to endorse Trump if the he's the (R) nominee?
@RandPaul Haven't all Presidents back to George Washington used Executive Orders?
@RandPaul there is no conflict of interest. @POTUS Is constitutionally entitled to nominate. The senate confirms. Don't agree? Dont confirm
@RandPaul This is incredible nonsense.  It's a Republican controlled Senate and House.  How did this rhetoric play in your campaign?
@RandPaul So endorse Cruz and help the cause.
@RandPaul    Is that why you're Sitting on the side line? How'd your Presidential Run Go?? Haha Yaay 
@RandPaul That's not how conflicts of interest work.
@RandPaul The conflict of interest is resolved via the lifetime appointment.
@RandPaul @USAforTrump2016 Obama is an embarrassment as President. He should not get his whiny way on this. Supreme Court can wait!
Republicans & @RandPaul must be reading a different Constitution. U.S. one delegates POTUS the power to nominate #SCOTUS. Art 2 Sec 2 Cl. 2
@RandPaul You Reps betrayed us giving in to @POTUS! Mailing conservatives gallons of Vaseline for 7 yrs would've served us better!! @tedcruz
@RandPaul these short sightes, partisan tactics got you Trump. But please don't learn from your mistakes. Do you job.
@RandPaul Most of the country disagrees with you. That's why you  & a lot of the GOP will be voted out>Obstructionists. Do your jobs!
@RandPaul Prosecute! Reign in the power!
@RandPaul Wrong!
@RandPaul 
Come on Rand endorse Trump already 
Ted has betrayed the tea party.
@RandPaul Sorry Rand. You are on the wrong side of the constitution on this one
@RandPaul If challenges to presidential authority were a "conflict of interest" no president would ever be able to nominate a SCOTUS justice
@RandPaul @arav_m what did he do?
@akilan27 Agree I was too eager is retweeting, undoing it. Not sure what he is trying to say
@RandPaul Trump/Paul!
That is a Recipe for Audit the Fed to pass!
@RandPaul The president has the right to nominate, just get him a hearing and later votes no with explanation
@RandPaul You're so CUTE when you're angry.
@RandPaul you really don't care about the constitution if you want Trump to make the next nomination.
@RandPaul Baby Paul is doing his best to keep his Senate seat by carrying water for @SenateMajLdr. #STFU & #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
@RandPaul Are you going to vote for this nominee like you did with Kagen and Sotomayor? Who are just as disastrous on the court?
@RandPaul Why not help stop the trainwreck of DT by endorsing Cruz?
If you truly believe this, @RandPaul, you have Constitutional obligation to do more than be a pandering lollipop on Twitter.
@RandPaul About time someone said this. I have been saying it since Justice Scalia's death. U.S. v Texas (DAPA) is a clear case in point.
@RandPaul  Can you expand on this statement?  It sounds like you are just trying to be inflammatory. You fail.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul ..yet without a deciding vote in a 4/4 split - it will remain unresolved. The GOP will not be in the oval office.
@RandPaul Yeah but what about Mitch,McCain,Collins,Graham, and a half dozen other Rinos
Based on this statement I can infer you've never actually read the constitution. @RandPaul #dumbass
@le_blah @RandPaul Based on this comment, you have implied that you're either illiterate or too lazy to research.
.@JustinSzew309 @RandPaul Illiterate, apparently I must be because I don't see where they ruled he violated the constitution. Thanks #clown.
@RandPaul That's one of the stupidest things I've heard a sitting U.S. Senator say. And that's a high bar.
@RKTlaw @RandPaul It's stupid to state facts?
@RandPaul will therefore ask to be part of the hearings to probe #SCOTUSnominee on these vital issues.
@RandPaul Stand strong!!
@RandPaul ...you keep using that word...I do not think it means what you think it means.
