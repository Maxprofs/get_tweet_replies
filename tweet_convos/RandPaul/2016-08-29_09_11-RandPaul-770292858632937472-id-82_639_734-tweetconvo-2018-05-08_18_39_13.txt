honor your pledge to support Donald Trump and I will support your efforts
He already endorsed him
did a little research he is honoring his pledge. no where has he said I endorse Donald Trump sad, big difference
The pledge was to support the nominee, he has he's said he's voting for him. Trump's still a terrible nominee
I can get behind a Rand Paul but, let's not shoot ourselves in the toe and let Hillary in.
Everyone who voted for Trump in the primary already did. Her win is their fault
ridiculous you still have a choice
My point, never seen Repubs act like this.  If your guy lost, accept and strive to improve things.
.@RandPaul Thank you! Hillary armed al Qaeda in Syria through the CIA. US-backed terrorists murdered countless Syrians #StopArmingTerrorNow
@jajones338 @RandPaul Way to go gentlemen. It's about time. And they used Gadaffi's money to do it. Keyword: UNFREEZE
Cowards in Congress state the obvious NOW, when it's safe to do so, as Trump nears POTUS
Sen Black was a Colonel, served in Vietnam.  Rand Paul has always been "Less Govt" #MAGA
Then they shld know that the @CFPB is a fraud Bankster front that destroys American lives.
They'll handle getting us back. Just need the right Commander in Chief.
Crooks like @SenRichardBlack and @RandPaul deliberately failed in oversight of @CFPB because their campaigns get paid off, too.
What are you talking about?  I'm not even in Washington. Do your homework before you attack people you don't even know.
Shut up you obvious paid troll
stop this madness, please...as an American I have never been this worried about the (REAL) state of things
What happens when POTUS leads from behind... Ever increasing chaos in Middle East
@mariannecope The way to stop it is to vote for @realDonaldTrump. He will fix it!
rand Paul is always doing good stuff

SPEAK OUT LOUDLY, Rand, and have a big press conference about it.  If media doesn't come, twitter SHAME!
Rand the GSE law suits show if gov get away with that crime the constitution and free markets are over.
#PutinAssadCrimes
@Csinaco @POTUS man as far as I'm concerned their all Isis who knows who's who over their 1min their Isis next min their not messy
Same in Vietnam. Been going on too long. Military industrial complex, remember?
THEY'LL make an industry out of anything

@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP have enough to impeach Obama an stop his madness but you stay silent
Help by getting behind Trump back him all of you
@Ricky_Vaughn99 @POTUS Wait. What? Someone in DC is not only paying attention, but trying to stick it to Obama? Yes!!!!!
@Ricky_Vaughn99 @POTUS How does a cuck to that?
@Highcentered Hey but the us war corporations are doing well. Don't you just love Hillary.

@Highcentered @POTUS Please stop US arms sales to Saudi Arabia!  Killing in Yemen today.
@Highcentered @POTUS please says a former DEM!!!! We need your help.
Please do!
any chance of supporting #YPG
You should see this; Rand Paul says he would support the Kurds http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=1e1_1433116091 …
I think if you check Rand, you'll find the #US has had THAT issue since WW2! I'd let the #UN & #Nato have the ball. -bdl
You have a right to know this (see attached).  It is not fault of Mr.Obama...
@alllibertynews @POTUS This is why the 's are FEDup. Representatives that act in groups,Bribing 2passBills,w/hidden agenda's.
when a bill is past it should be illegal to include any other articles within
This madness began with AFG in 1978.And NeoConism since then cld not be really cured from this Insanity!
can you name the members of the coalition so we can encourage them as well?
& I'd like to work on Nuremberg trials with no Operation Paperclip for USavage AngloZioNazi lawless war criminal barbarians
US arms & proxy terrorists have killed & displaced millions of Syians (Iraq-Libya too) in un-civil war of USavage terrorism
@harleygrl3465 @POTUS Thank you, Sir. We need some Political Hero's now.
Thank u all THXS...#StandWithRand
you need to pass a law that forbids any usa weapons to be shipped to any group in that region
Rand Paul supports Muslim refugees while allowing Obama to take 2.6 Billion from the VA to pay for refugees! Veterans Dying
You're the one who didn't want arm rebels fighting Daesh, Assad, Iran & Russia in the beginning, don't complain now about Syria!
Because they'd find their way into the hands of the enemy.
Iraq army had already accomplished that when they ran
A cautionary tale for sure.  Arming Syrian rebels was iffy at best given the dynamic.
The legacy of Obama is "Arthur Zimmermann" and supplied chaos - while Rome burns Obama plays golf and sends more fires..
Thank you, Dr.
Not you, @POTUS
This is our version of gladiator fights. Are you not entertained?!
if only someone could have seen this coming! ;-)
The day YOU Politicians Stop Obama from doing anything will become national Holiday
YOU TELL 'EM RAND!
thank you Obama and Clinton
You'd have to occupy Middle East for 100's of years to hope to fix that messed up place.
@CuckCarl @POTUS #TOWtheline Should have thought about that since the 70's.  Ask your Dad about it #Reagan
that's some turn of events
we are not only fighting Isis. We are fighting the USZ because of that pos in the WH taking my country down

More $$$ for US arms manufacturers! How can that be bad?
@brad_shipp
just stop voting to fund this insanity. Stop funding Yemen and Libya while you're at it.
this president should have been impeached years ago!
Keep fighting Rand!
Are they shooting each other? Keep in mind NEITHER side likes us. Give'em guns. Let'em recruit and shoot. Each other
yep, kill them all and let God sort it out
I thought after the flood GOD said he wouldn't interfere with mans dealings with man again. I'll check
The 'WH institution', not the Pres, per se.
No scapegoats.
Do you support the Kurds and SDF?
dont congrats him it was congress that sat on theirs hands when he needed u to help he did what he had to talk to urselves
He's being sarcastic if you can't already tell
bad situation like the aforementioned and your first reaction is to lob shots across the bow at your commander and chief
@RandPaul @POTUS
Ha Ha Ha..go figure...if you only knew the truth Rand Paul..@TGowdySC Seems there ought to be a hint there that obama is playing.
both side against the middle..you guy's amaze me....and its not by Brilliance..You let that Prez. get away with too much
R.I.P. Miss Cleo.
the landscape in Syria would have called for psychic powers to be able to predict how loyalties and alliances would shift.
Senator Paul, I'm completely behind the belief that we should have gotten involved earlier and more decisively but -
