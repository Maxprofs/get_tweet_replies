The bottom line is a whole generation is being slaughtered my Assad and Russia in Assads genocidal attacks @FoxNews @RandPaul
 What utter bullshit! And as for your "freedom fighters", they're 100% terrorists.
So you support baby killer Assad @aj_observations @FoxNews @RandPaul
How many babies has the US killed in Iraq Libya&Syria? I guess u don't have a problem w that
But since you support baby killers Assad and Russia do not type to me. @Baby_Blue_2013 @aj_observations @FoxNews @RandPaul
Baby blue eyes you better open your eyes and dont support killers.
You better STOP LYING-U OBVIOUSLY Support MURDERING Saudis who attacked us on9/11
Funneled ha after years of asking for help the  us finally helped the Syrian freedom fighters they are not terrorist @FoxNews @RandPaul
The prominent Republicans who got Syria right were @RandPaul and daddy @RonPaul.
I think @GovGaryJohnson does!
MSM's obsession w ratings & the selfishness of estab Repubs deprived us of YOU, Rand Paul, as Prez. U r what the US needs
Yup and he agrees with @GovGaryJohnson. Defacto endorsement?
Yes,I agree.
@dougstafford @RandPaul Totally agree.
did not go back on his pledge a man of integrity unlike Jeb, Cruz & Kasich, no integrity @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity
@mbbeachgirll @RandPaul. YES
making them Armageddon ready. Even so, come quickly Lord Jesus.
100% agree
@JahnBarris @RandPaul you think if we followed the Constitution and gave the politicians a pay cut we'd have less drama ?
This is why: http://grandmathunder.com/2016/09/understanding-global/@FoxNews … @RandPaul
100% agree.
stop Obama from giving away the internet impeach this bastard now
@shupe_laura @RandPaul Arming terrorist is one of the few things the U.S. Gov't is good at.
All true and yet NOTHING has happened to ppl responsible. So how does constitution protect "us" at all?
I THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CHICAGO & the civil war in OUR COUNTRY...we are quite the multi-taskers.
If it's disgust Rands onit nomata the title if it's against USA n our values it's fair game yepper.
YES WE DO.. #STANDWITHRAND
none dare call it treason.
These contradiction are only seen in hindsight for most thinkers. I spotted wrote of many for last 35 yrs..
There's also ineptitude in high yield agriculture making agricultural communities to be uneconomic migrants
Yes I agree!
Completely true and NOTHING has happened. Yet ppl still imagine that the constitution "protects us" ? how
Agree with Rand. Would add it's time 2 end Saudi Arabia's control over US foreign policy. Enough!
Hillary will be more of the same stupid foreign policy only worse. Vote Trump and Rand in 2024!
Syria-Tell the truth-Why all fighting over Middle East sites? #PokemonGo battles, over Ancient secrets in command centres
@alllibertynews @FoxNews @RandPaul ugg
Absolutely, & not their first genocidal chaos creating by spreading fear and breeding terror. Hope it'll be their last.
@MVBeleg @RandPaul
Yep, that would be Obama & HRC - BOTH! Yet both will skate ... go figure...
yes we spend billions middle east.  ISIS got our military equipment.
I partially agree with it, it was unconstitutional but one thing is for sure US policy is main reason behind chaos in ME
#Turkey state #islamist lost its dirty agenda in #Syria
,
#NATO would lose too
if they support #Erdogan

More or less.  The diplomatic realm is working on this and with this, after the fact.
agreed.
@wavetossed @RandPaul Yes!
Rand Paul should be our president.
@HillaryClinton didn't have the integrity. "Reformer" Assad concept did not go with @POTUS.She feared opposing Obama.
Hillary and R O T H S C H I L D S who will stop at nothing to get banks into Cuba, Iran, N. Korea and S Y R I A.
If leaders liv by #MotherTeresa's mesag, #society wldnt b so #TornAsunder …https://humaneearthadvocasylinkmovement.blogspot.co.id/2016/02/torn-asunder.html?m=1 …
YES.
Yes
I agree w/ Dr Paul and say it also applies to lack of real end game objectives since Gulf Wars & post 9/11 actions.
Yes, 100%
It's clear that Obama wants to cause disruption in Syria, to get their 10,000 m3/day of oil. Kaching for the Fed!
hell yeah I agree with him.
It seems very similar to the Iran/Iraq war, where both sides were funded by the US Gov.
Obama is a dithering Arthur Zimmermann because Zimmermann had a crazy objective - but Obama changes direction and returns
agree
& let's not forget signatories to Iran letter Rand -ano Bald Vampire Vulture war addicted USavage degenerate barbarian
Study PNAC (& Oded Yinon) '7 wars in 5yrs' plans pre 0911 & malevolent strategy Afghan->Iraq->Libya->AFRICOM->Syria->Iran
No -AngloZioNazi Leo Strausian MACHIAVELLIAN policy DELIBERATE depopulate destroy divide for Pox Judaica COLONIAL expand
Not we Rand Paul all you goofball politicians. Fixing to RIGHT this WRONG.
Yes I agree.
Let's transition to renewable energy and cut off the need for oil to have peace in the Middle East.
@WeirdNews__ @RandPaul Yep.
Yes & we should only b helping the Christian Refugees that r in danger. Instead out of 10,000 Syrian Refugees only 56 are
Agree and Congress stood by.
What's wrong with sending in arms? Are you saying guns aren't always the answer?
WHO  is  WE ? I certainly did not agree with ARMING the REBELS. Would we like Mexico to ARM US Rebels ? GOLDEN Rule guide
@DentonReports @RandPaul sure but this all started with the war in Iraq!
no doubt. We had no clue what we were doing there for about 30 years now
yep! Regardless of Sadam this may have been inevitable. We can't solve it though, it has to come from w/in
not to mention "Obama ended the war"
and brought some of those people here unveted and to live off gov welfare while we slip further and further into debt.
Yes. @FoxNews @RandPaul
Yes, I agree with @RandPaul
... YES
.  Yes I agree
it is a neo-con war, why can't you use the actual word "neo-con?" :). I truly do enjoy your presence as USA media. Peace
Why aren't we listening to this?? #StandWithRand
fast and furious just got dismissed
yep
@NotLukeKuechly @RandPaul Vote @GovGaryJohnson to end this! #LetGaryDebate #TeamGov #YouIn #JohnsonWeld2016
Yes
sounds about right, except it's all been for oil and because of Bush
he is spot on right
to not agree with that statement means you are ignorant or a liar .. Or prob both honestly
100%
How are facts even a question? The facts demand a #StandwithRand :: #ConvictHillary and #CorruptObama mishandled it all.
That's been the US Gov't  MO for a longgggg time.
surely that should be a violation of some sort of Law by the UN
agree
Yes.
but he wont submit for impeachment.. So what he is really doing but blowing smoke
Yep!
I feel like this is obama's fault - i mean it is a colossal failure; but that would be too hard for him to do on his own.
My idea is that if no one had bombs or drones then they would have to talk to each other and work something peaceful out.
Its a complicated situation.I'm trying to understand it by following lots of correspondents in Syria but nothing is clear

YES!!!!
of course not.
Yes
Yes!
So why no call for impeachment?
Their observation improves when it is Obama, but fail to see the failures of the 2 wars Bush started in Iraq & Afghan.
ol' bo is clueless and as stupid as a rock
no he has no idea what international law is or what is going on in Syria. UN R2P law you signed demands intervention.
Any1 who doesn't agree is simply dumb. So yes
%
Yes.
...If only we had proper Representation...
"I don't recall" - Hillary Clinton
They do know so little and no it so fluently. Lord save us from our current government.
hits the nail on the head
100 %.
.@FoxNews .@RandPaul He is right... And somebody got paid for the arms.
This is abysmal failure.on both sides of the aisle, with the Obama admin deserving much of the current blame.

#ObamaCrimes #Syria
And at the same time tried to take guns away from American citizens.
yes but what's the repercussions? Nothing!
we never learn.  How many times does arming random groups backfire on us?
Constitution: Only Congress has the power to declare war.  Dispicably Congress has not declared war since WWII.
Yes but I still don't like him
/What do you mean,'we'? I did not vote DumocRAT last two elections & no one asked me what to do.
pretty much!
100%
foreign entanglement? yes
yea
And so far, the Republican-led Congress and Senate have done nothing about it but whine.
.. Another barking chihuahua ..... That's all they good for .. Bitch ..!!
Yes Rand Paul is Right Obama Foreign Policy is A Disaster Because He Has No Idea what to do or Who he did it with
is correct. Obama waited too long&now Iran, Russia, Turkey, USA, Assad & a plethora of terrorist groups are all fighting.
I agree
He's been saying this since 2003.
I agree %100
yes
Yeah but the Rothchild's bank balance is better of with all the arm sales. Who cares if the war never ends. Make war! $$$
VOTE Liberty @GovGaryJohnson #BalancedRebellion
yes
and w/pres who is pushing socialist agenda   shame on house and senate for not fighting for us
he knows Syria is a very complicated problem, with multiple actors. If he doesn't,  he should educate himself, pronto

#ObamaCrimes #Syria
yes
yes I agree.
this is nothing new.  We been doin this,every war,every country since creation
so exactly like Reagan with the Iran-Iraq war?
yeah, well if that's so why haven't you done anything about it..just asking, tell me, please.
Absolutely!
what's not to agree with?  He hit the nail on the head
yep
i'am french I don't undestand why USA & France are friends with Saudi Arabia. What is the difference between ISIS & SA?
I agree!!

wen I hav teh nooks u dnt hav 2 wery
Killary should not be President of THE USA she has no memory to recall??? How can this b a president shes guilty treason
Well, that's the Obama & the Clinton's handy corrupt work. These crooked ppl repeatedly made decisions that created Isis.
Russians back assad we back rebels.And it's mostly about building a oil/gas pipeline to Europe through Syria.Dontcha know
We don't know about Syria. I would drag the Russians in there and sneak out which is our plan
Best and safest way to beat up a Russian is get him in our fight and make him think it was his idea works every time
Failure to agree highlights ignorance, cognitive dissonance or  malice behavior.
Yes!!
I agree since 2008 we have govt derelict of duties/should have been removed .
Result is loss of our military/ISIS gain
. WE THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF TALK! YOU ALL WORK FOR US! AND USE US & OUR TAX DOLLARS TO PLAY WITH OUR LIVES!  WE SUEING !!
no
ctami kuda tyt itak polno
Yes we are all choking on the shit burgers that the Obama admin has made. Thanks for the reminder
Yeap, however some republican hands aren't totally clean - McCain, big supporter of the "rebels!"
Obama thinks he is a founding "brother"
This is what happens when Congress will not do it's job. We have had an impotent Congress for the last six years.
and that folks is the new a improved  democratic parties way. With Obama & Hilliary, would you expect anything different
This is Our Obama and Clinton era people
gotta love the crappy goings on of our lame ass  government.
Absolutely.
Go @realDonaldTrump
That's a nice brief synopsis.
#Syria belongs to #Russia in allegiance. US will NEVER prevail, as w/Crimea for Port Access. Peter The Great legacy.
Reversal would be like USA reversing Manifest Destiny
@Wsj.@nypost.@judgenap.@scotusblog.@un.@bbcworld.@dw_global.@npr
Perfectly stated.
great but where is his endorsement of #Trump who wants to end all that?
yup
Yup pretty much sums up the @BarackObama administration, he has had NO Clue and has left our country is bad shape! #MSNBC
Sounds about right to me!
