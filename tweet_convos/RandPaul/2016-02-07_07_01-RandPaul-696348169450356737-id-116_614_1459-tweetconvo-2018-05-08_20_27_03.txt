@RandPaul @townhallcom you and Cruz may have differing opinions but you both had the same principles. You two need to stick together
@RandPaul @alllibertynews everyone in support of patriot act expansion has a hawkish federalist elitist view of the constitution @tedcruz
@OGWriter @RandPaul @alllibertynews @tedcruz I agree that's why Trump/cruz are a nightmare.
@RandPaul want to still #StandWithRand, wish he was still in. :(
@RandPaul @RestoreHistory "limited government of the state Ponzi scheme."
@RandPaul do you mean devolving power from washington dc giving greater power to states & local councils big gov is not the answer
@RandPaul @SMolloyDVM
@RandPaul @townhallcom Curious. Your supporters are flocking to Cruz like sheep to slaughter. Thought privacy was one of your sig. causes
@HenrichsenCliff @RandPaul @DonaldJTrumpJr Rand supporter aren't going to vote for that joke
@RandPaul why so paranoid! ,??!
@RandPaul @townhallcom Yes & all that remains on both the left & the right are collectivists.Oppose oppression! http://amzn.com/1493795783  #RCW

@RandPaul I hear u have some dedicated grassroots we r the campaign #StillRanding DO what u need to n then unsuspend
@alllibertynews @townhallcom If we are to support the stop of bullying politics, we cannot support Donald Trump.
@RandPaul @townhallcom I'm not voting for any of them. The only Republican I'd be willing to vote for is you, Rand.
@RandPaul I have video of my friend trying to talk 2 Marco & he rudely walks away in mid sentence
@RandPaul @alllibertynews sounds like the wise words of a balanced, thoughtful, diplomatic  leader. Great traits for a VP... @BernieSanders
@RandPaul #StillRanding

@RandPaul IT IS TIME TO DROP OUT AND SUPPORT TRUMP FOR PRES. PAUL=YOU ARE NOT CUT OUT TO BE PRES. BAD ATTITUDE. CARSON=TO NICE= TRUMP OK.
@RandPaul yep.  That's why we're voting Democratic.
@RandPaul  Trump is childish allowing illicit border activity is not.
@RandPaul This should tell ya somethinghttp://truthinmedia.com/poll-do-you-support-rand-pauls-decision-to-suspend-his-presidential-campaign/
@RandPaul Totally Agreed!
@RandPaul @townhallcom I will stand with rand till I can't stand no more

@RandPaul Get back in please.
@RandPaul  Rand I wish you would come back we need you more then ever before.  Will we make it to 2020 to see you run again?  #StillRanding
@Bigboss1911mp @alllibertynews @RandPaul Rand's focus now is in retaining his Senate seat in KY.

@RandPaul why did you drop out then.
@empenadaempty @RandPaul he's still on the ballot! He is still going to be in the Senate
@RandPaul It's so sad to see freedom & common sense loses to childish, power hungry talk. What would the future be like? #StandWithRand
@RandPaul you should have stayed in. You got 5% when you were polling at half that. NH could have been very pivotal.
@RandPaul Well stated Dr. Paul - its unfortunate you left the campaign trail!
@RandPaul The "Governors" have done very little to push back on 7 years of failed White House policies.
@RandPaul @townhallcom We are #StillRanding and support a Dr. Paul in the White House 2017. #StandWithRand #RandRally #SFR
@RandPaul @townhallcom why did you quit? #armedradio
@RandPaul Who will be the dove in the party now?
@RandPaul Hay Rand, glad to hear from you. I don't know who to vote for now.
@Richards35S @RandPaul Rand Paul! He's on the ballot in NH! Elsewhere, too. #StillRanding
@RandPaul missed u at the debate last night.  The Liberty movement was not well represented.
@RandPaul @Youth4RandPaul please get back in the race, this quote is exactly what is needed to combat the gop establishment. #stillranding
@RandPaul wish you were still in the race!!
@RandPaul @townhallcom we need you now more than ever!!! #stillranding
@RandPaul limited government. The only issue that matters.
@RandPaul  I posted this video yesterday. The likeness between Reagan then & you now is remarkable!
http://youtu.be/Fi3x7mmywDE 
@RandPaul Yes!! We need you, Rand, & the debate last night confirmed it even more. Please reconsider! The #RandRally is stronger than ever!
@RandPaul @townhallcom is there anyone you support now that you've bowed out of the race?
@RandPaul @townhallcom You are missed very much.
@RandPaul Amen!
@RandPaul I wish you could've held on a little longer to continue applying pressure to the GOP. Would like to see you in the cabinet
@RandPaul @townhallcom come back Rand
@RandPaul when Hitler invented libertarianism he didn’t actually limit government.
@jkoury2 @RandPaul oh hai, we don’t say “page” on Twitter. That’s Facebook.
@RandPaul https://vine.co/v/iJlitVbBemj 
@RandPaul needs us to caucus for him. #stillstandingstillranding
@RandPaul Speaking of Bullying, why is Jon Orcig bullying me to go to Virginia to be with some guy, so that he can put me in great harm?
@RandPaul Speaking of another Pakistani Bully @chamath) disses top CEO Jack and Silicon Valley survives http://on.recode.net/1Zwta 
@RandPaul I am not either guys property, they go back and forth brokering me! Both Chamath/Rham(Pakistani) and Jon Orcig are evil!
@RandPaul Local currency creates safety net: Berkshares
@RandPaul @townhallcom I sincerely hope you surprise everyone in NH! Would love to see you continue the trail. #UnitedWeRand
@RandPaul It's time for you to get your butt back in this RACE !  #StillRanding #StandWithRand Let's go !
@RandPaul The Rand-Less Republican Debates: Warmonger vs Warmonger...
Torture vs Gestapo-Tactics...
The definition of Dumb & Dumber! No TY!
@RandPaul Missed you last night, Rand! You would have knocked some sense into all of them.
@RandPaul @townhallcom
@RandPaul @townhallcom the world needs you!
America needs @RandPaul. All others are pretenders. Only Rand's plan pays down debt instead of increase it.
@RandPaul @townhallcom wish you were still running
@RandPaul The liberty movement will do what they can to stand in for you. #StillRanding
@RandPaul Both RNC, DNC along with their supporters & the media want to control other people's Liberty. Carpet bombing.  #StillRanding
@RandPaul @townhallcom #StandWithRand without you I'm out of this politic game. I was super entrenched, now nothing Its a Rigged game anyway
@RandPaul @townhallcom Purest apostle of founders' intents since his father.
@RandPaul @townhallcom many blessings coming from Texas. #istandwithrand #RandRally #StillRanding
@RandPaul @CIA would have been kept on their toes if you were president. Is it too late to change your mind?
@RandPaul @townhallcom we are still fighting for Rand for the greater good of our children. #StillRanding
@RandPaul @townhallcom #StillRanding #RandRally #istandwithrand #randgirls #randgirling #presidentpaul #commandoforrando #

@RandPaul @townhallcom I'm "sure" Paul Jacob is "the greatest journalist of all time" but he "missed it" on foreign policy. Go Rand!

@BNyeson @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @RealBenCarson libertarian party!
@RandPaul @townhallcom link up with Gary Johnson! The two of you would make an unbeatable power ticket!!!
@RandPaul @townhallcom did you just decide this today? You should support the only constitutional conservative @tedcruz #Cruz2016 #CruzCrew
@IamRobJeffries @RandPaul @townhallcom me neither
@RandPaul @townhallcom to bad there is no one left in the race with this sound logic
@RandPaul @townhallcom
@RandPaul @townhallcom Missed your wisdom last night. We're still fighting though.
@RandPaul there isn't anyone left to vote for that believes in liberty! COME BACK!!
@RandPaul endorse @JohnKasich he is the best option in the field after you doctor! #takeastand
@RandPaul nice to see you tweeting :)
@joshuabutcher83 @RandPaul then it's time to get someone with more of a RP understanding of the constitution.
