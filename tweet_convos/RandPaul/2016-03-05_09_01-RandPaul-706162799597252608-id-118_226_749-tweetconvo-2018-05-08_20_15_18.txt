@RandPaul I sure hope you had the courage to support a Constitutionalist! #CruzToVictory
@Fiercely_ He should have showed up to vote for Rand's Audit the Fed bill then. Rand waited years to get a vote and Ted was the only no show
@MaryStewart01 And did it pass?
@Fiercely_ No..it was short just a few votes.
@MaryStewart01 hmm, I'll check the count. I am sure I heard Ted mention auditing the Fed on the campaign trail.
@MaryStewart01 Ok, vote was party lines so the 60 needed wasn't going to be met.  Cruz was in NH at the time.
@Fiercely_ He should have supported the bill. Rubio showed up and he usually skips votes. Rand worked years on it.
@MaryStewart01 I understand your point. Do you think President Cruz would sign it when it comes through again? I know he would.
@RandPaul did you vote for yourself?
@RandPaul theres one for the establishment donor class I bet you voted #Cruz is your dad proud?
@RandPaul keep attacking trump, burn burn GOP Burn
@RandPaul Who on earth could you have voted for? They are all scum. Too bad @RonPaul didnt run. We're all doomed!
@RandPaul #ConstitutionMatters NOT negotiable! #NeverTrump
#Cruz2016
@RandPaul You wrote yourself in, didn't you?
@RandPaul i voted for #Liberty and the #Constitution today - i voted for Rand Paul ... #StillRanding #RandWagon
@RandPaul attack trump attack trump
@RandPaul Why do I have this Distinct Feeling it was a Stupid Vote in my hometown by U? LISTEN TO THE AMER. ppl RAND!! We want #Trump2016!!
@RandPaul People are making their voice heard! We are tired of establishment.  Cruz will not beat Hillary.  Trump is the only one that can!!
@RandPaul My trouble with Ted Cruz he lies all the time. No matter what he says,Bush send Cruz out to get a Supreme Court nominee.etc
@RandPaul trump says your hands are small pls attack trump
@RandPaul I think he voted for @tedcruz ! #CruzCrew
@RandPaul You were practically the only 1 worth voting for on the GOP ticket. I pay attention to all debates & substance. #NeverTrump
@RandPaul democrats will win. Kiss your GOP ass good bye
@RandPaul Donald Trump right?
@RandPaul thank trump for turn out
@RandPaul disappointed Rand has endorsed Cruz, the only constitutionalist left in the race
@RandPaul very disappointed you caused such confusion for the KY voters this year. Many did not vote because of your actions.
@RandPaul I certainly hope you voted Rand Paul 
@RandPaul Senator, please tell me you voted for @tedcruz ?
@beth_wellington @alllibertynews @RandPaul @tedcruz He is not a good person.  Almost as bad as the devil. No compassion for the working man
@RandPaul @doncastella yeah Rand who did you vote for?? One word could have made Kentucky different tonight!!! But you just couldn't...
@donnasfineart @RandPaul @doncastella He couldn't bc Cruz isn't for Liberty he is for war.
@RandPaul @ShutUpListen2Me I hope you voted for @tedcruz
@RandPaul and who did you vote for???
@RandPaul wondering whom you would have supported with your vote Sen Paul; none of these other clowns cares an iota about #liberty.
@RandPaul Who'd you vote for?
@RandPaul I would love to know who you voted for.  And how much Pepto you needed to do that!
@RandPaul I had a moral dilemna. I wanted to vote for you on principle but needed to make sure Trump didn't get all delegates.
@RandPaul I'm curious too! I would love to know who you voted for! I voted for you while I still could
@RandPaul I'm disappointed that you are not endorsing Sen. Paul. You have to stand for something, not just your own cause.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul my guess would be Cruz because nobody else has Libertarian policies.
@RandPaul please tell me you voted for someone who has actually read the constitution.
@RandPaul For Ted Cruz?
@RandPaul back at it again with the @McCafe
@RandPaul and ..........
@RandPaul Did you vote for yourself?  Seemed like you only liked yourself.
@RandPaul I have it on good authority that you voted for @realDonaldTrump thanks for helping #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@RandPaul TRUMP RIGHT
#PresidentPaul2016 is our last chance to save whatever is left of America and American values. Vote @RandPaul .   #StandWithRand #UnSuspend
@RandPaul It would have been cast for Rand Paul, but decided to vote for Ted Cruz in your absence.
@RandPaul Funny that you are not sharing you who voted for.  #kycaucus
@RandPaul  So, for whom did you vote?
@RandPaul  Hope you were smart enough to vote Trump not Cruz.
@RandPaul he's definitely  a trump supporter
@RandPaul ok..who did you vote for? Out with it!
@RandPaul Why didn't Colorado vote like that
@RandPaul Ron Paul did you vote for Donald trump
@RandPaul Why is Trump campaigning against Rand in favor of a dem? He tweets what a loser Rand is. Insane!
@RandPaul Thank you for fighting the good fight. Good on you for not endorsing anyone. Don't cave. Liberty now, liberty forever!
@RandPaul KY is in a sad state of affairs, and you are part of the problem.
@RandPaul who are you supporting? #kycaucus
@RandPaul vote Trump
@RandPaul if you voted for anyone other than Ted Cruz, you are as bad as the rest of them!
I bet it was for Ted Cruz.  Amirit @RandPaul ?
@RandPaul hopefully Rubio!

@loverofhoney @RandPaul  #StandWithRand #StillRanding #RandingStrong
@RandPaul yes please tell us !
@RandPaul he voted for himself duh.
@RandPaul Cool, Rand!
@RandPaul My guess, he voted for himself. Throwaway vote, but nothing new here, also, "to thine own self be true."
@RandPaul I hope it was @tedcruz!! 
@mkp513 it was bernie, he announced it.
@RandPaul I hope you didn't vote against our Constitution, safety, and freedoms. #NeverTrump
@RandPaul I hope you voted for and support @Ted Cruz
@RandPaul cant, I'm working today
@RandPaul It's no ones concern who Rand voted for. He didn't endorse anyone, so it's private.
@RandPaul for who?
@RandPaul if your a real libertarian your vote is for trump
@RWSurferGirl1 @RandPaul did he endorse a candidate? I must've missed it.
@RandPaul Go Trump!
@RandPaul Do you want to share who received your vote?
@RandPaul Which business as usual candidate did you choose?
@RandPaul you did you vote for? Did you make an elaborate plan to win the caucus, and knock down Trump? That'd be great!
@RandPaul For whom did you vote?
@RandPaul Did Rand Paul vote for Donald Trump? @realDonaldTrump
@RandPaul probably voted for @tedcruz
@RandPaul For @tedcruz sir?
@RandPaul

For Trump 2016

@RandPaul Did you vote for yourself my good sir
@RandPaul Exit poll: who did you vote for?
@sarahheartsnews @RandPaul my guess is Ted
@RandPaul Vote Liberty! @tedcruz
@RandPaul Who did you vote for?  
@RandPaul Rubio!!
@RandPaul I bet you voted for @JohnKasich .  He's the most sane out of the left overs.
@JDCalvin02 @RandPaul Kasich is the most establishment candidate left in the race. Say "NO" (or "HELL NO") to the GOPe. #VoteCruz
@RandPaul who did you vote for?
@BenjaminDousa @RandPaul my guess is Ted
@dfwinsurance @BenjaminDousa @RandPaul My guess as well.I would be voting for Rand if he was still in the race.
@RandPaul hope it was for #TedCruz
@greenivyocean @RandPaul "Ted Cruz is no libertarian... he's owned by Goldman Sachs" -Ron Paul
@flowingsolemnly @RandPaul of the field of candidates Ted is the most conservative vote #TedCruz
@RandPaul who did you vote for?
@RandPaul did you vote for yourself still
@RandPaul wish you were still running #GOP
@RandPaul  Trump!
@_arbitrageur_ @RandPaul you mean #Drumpf?
