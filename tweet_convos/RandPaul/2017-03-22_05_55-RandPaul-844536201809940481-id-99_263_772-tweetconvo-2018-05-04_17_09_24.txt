Rand paul permenatly lost my vote!
Thank you for being the voice of reason. This bill is not what @realDonaldTrump promised!
Come on Rand.  We got to get on with this.  I trust Trump. You should too.  Everything will get fixed!
I think he trusts the president to fulfill the pee elected promise of full repeal.
pee = pre auto-correct
#TrumpTrain Calls it #RhinoCare or #Ryancare Liberal Left Mindless Lunatics Call it #TrumpCare Or #AmericanHealthCareAct Whatever It Is!

why is it that Kentuckians believe the ACA and Obamacare are two different plans when we know they are the same plan?
Will you vote on (SAFE) Banking Act of 2017?
If smoking tobacco is harmful how can smoking marijuana be good?
Who in your State will want to support you if you force them to pay for abortions and go out of business?
I would agree "NO" Republican welfare! Let it Obama care burn! No more Medicare for non citizens!
Obama care Lite.  All the things you hate about regular Obama care plus a few more you haven't learned about.
Why would you vote "No"? Don't you wish to show your fellow colleagues that your a team player? Don't be surprise if your not re-elected
Why would vot on something to just make your party happy if it is a shit bill?
I will have to reconsider you;  whether you have weighed your vote for the long run
You are right brother
Mr. Paul will not be reelected
Good job Rand! I read it this week and it is a POS.
Rand hurts all of us! The bill will get changed anyway in Senate and future phases. Don't kill it! America needs you.
I go for repeal only
Govt out of my healthcare
Trump is always my president
I am loyal
Rand should not be so negative right from beginning. Have some POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE.
thank you
Thank you
@RandPaul WHY? Are you paying my health premiums ($1,700 mo) for me then?
good for him.  Ryan's plan sucks.  Trump screwed this up.  Politicians cannot be involved in this.
I have this from the beginning.  Independent brokers need to write this@ not doctors. Not politicians not ins company
true conservatism is dead! Unless you also fight against all the legs up businesses get! Moderate and get things done
You should support our President not your own ambitions
thank you, we need more like you
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPriceMD  Speak some sense to this elected official. Every person has a price it's a matter of asking him.
I voted @realDonaldTrump and I completely agree with Rand here! This isn't conservative!
Thank you Senator. This Bill is not what we asked for or will accept.
lead the way Senator. Make Trump get this right
==Get in there and let your voice be heard...surely...you people can work out a compromise...we need tax cuts
Good.
Ryan and the rest need to listen to their constituents
thank u Rand for ur conviction
Democrats need not worry, My way or the highway Paul and Republicans demonstrating they can't govern either!
I'm glad some of our leaders understand what this crap bill is about.. Thank you
please find way to make this work!
sure is too bad republicans can not support each other.  Always in it for themselves
Thank you for your no vote & especially your "objection" to @SenJohnMcCain 's crazy NATO-Montenegro idea.
ACA is mumbo jumbo, can someone describe the insurance product this bill will produce? IN ENGLISH
Good, your State has an eye on you!
Senators can vote on house bill?
, why dont you have a solution. 7 yrs late
duh.
#StandWithRand
Grrrrr. Why Rand Paul ?  What are you looking for ?
come help, not hinder, you can do it!
stop all health care bills. Let the private sector handle it. No more big bother
If you had a better plan then it would your plan going for a vote Pull your head out and do the right thing
repeal and replace with a "Do Not Enter" sign.
work on it together,make this work #unity
stay strong Rand Paul. Right now it's you that's fighting for us not Trump.  no to RyanCare
You "principled" Conservatives amaze me as you work to destroy our Party.  You guys will never get my vote again!
#RepealTheBill @RandPaul  We are so close! #Compromise is the name of the game. Decrease the regulations #universalaccess    @FoxBusiness
@Osvaldo53009221 @RandPaul Good!
Make sure we get this one right...for GOP sake and USA sake.
keep fighting.
We have a BAD bill, AHCA: but the far-right wing wants an even WORSE bill. May they all need coverage but lack it!
Not happy with it so far. Those that got insurance with Obamacare should not find themselves without coverage.
U R willing 2 win individual battle & lose the war?  Sounds like a plan -not!This GOP devide is why Dems win! @POTUS
Thx for standing firm why can't all improvements be put in place now w/one time vote. Fallout w/Dems regardless
Great. Can't wait for Paul Ryan to whine about results
I agree with your vote.
THANK YOU! #FullRepeal #Obamacare #FreeMarket fix @freedomcaucus
I support you!
then go work with them on one that's "Rand approved" It needs to happen!
Why @RandPaul ?? What are your thoughts and ideas?  How would you fix the healthcare system?  #Suggestions
its sad
thank you @RandPaul! We must stand on principle especially considering GOP holds all the chips.
if he cared so much for his people he would help write the bill.
Your exact reason is?
cuz it sucks and sends taxpayers funds to pay  salaries of Hlth insurance CEOS.  $10s of millions
You had me at COST, this version won't work if it costs the same as Obamacare!
It will be more than Obamacare!
@Morning_Joe  Just saw you On Morning Joe.  Agree with your take on AHCA.
@POTUS No bill is better than bad bill. Remember Iranian deal?Respect those standing for US. Let ACA implode then fix
implosion is a terrible option. They let that happen and they lose. Regardless of whose fault it is
U.S. has no business in the health care business!! Let Obamacare collapse under the weight of its own lies. #LetItDie
if they let it collapse they will lose the majority guaranteed
You have conviction and integrity! I respect that! Hope you have enough support!!
I just never know if Rand is Grandstanding or following his conscience. So many politicians don't seem to have one.
conscience. He's a dr. He knows this bill is not right. It's going to brig down premiums & increase care
Did you say AHA will bring down premiums and increase care?
Ok Rand let's wait forever for tax cuts.
Good!!  Just repeal this Ponzi scheme.
Let's get this bill right! I support You & the @POTUS & @SpeakerRyan even disagreeing! Let's get this right! #MAGA
Agree!!!!
Good! We want a full repeal. Not this Ryancare 11th hour BS.
Well, I hope you've enjoyed your time in congress. You'll be looking for a job very soon.
he's rightbto say no to something that's not right
why what is missing?
