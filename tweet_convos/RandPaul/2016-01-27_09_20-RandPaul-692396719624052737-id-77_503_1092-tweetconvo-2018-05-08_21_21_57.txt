@RandPaul I like you. But don't start with tear downs. Very counterproductive.
@Kindhearted2015 @RandPaul If anyone should be teared down it should be an authoritarian candidate who never mentions the constitution.
@akaskew @RandPaul this is the problem. People who tear down others. It's not good from anyone no matter who. Our children deserve more
@Kindhearted2015 @RandPaul If Hitler were running I would expect lovers of Liberty to equally tear down his big government principles.
@akaskew are you actually comparing Trump to Hitler? Wow. That's pretty low. I'm out of this convo...
@RandPaul he's not Hitler but Gov't by command & focusing the masses on common enemies is all in Road to Serfdom!
Hard to miss echoes of Road to Serfdom in how Trump is building mass support? https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Road%20to%20serfdom.pdf …
and this page you tweeted describes the Democrats Hillary, Obama & Bernie perfectly. Trump is about US in a positive way
@RandPaul Be positive.  What is your plan?!  Don't just tell me you are  better than another option!
@donross03 @RandPaul He's said his plan so many times by now if you haven't heard it you haven't been listening.
@akaskew @RandPaul  If he has nothing new/pos to say, just be quiet.  Attacking others, esp @realDonaldTrump, won't help but will hurt him.
@RandPaul Take the time to explain to this Trumpster why we need you as POTUS. Explain how and why the constitution is so important, please!
@Lynette38734567 @alllibertynews @RandPaul are you really asking why the constitution is important? Or was that sarcasm...?
@mikeshehi @alllibertynews @RandPaul I am very serious!
@Lynette38734567 @alllibertynews @RandPaul it is the basis for our government, and outlines its power and limitations. It guarantees rights.
@RandPaul That's why you're at 2% in the polls and he's at 41%. #TrumpTrain
Because people can't handle not having the government doing "something" for them. #StandWithRand #StandWithFreedom @AlWilson725 @RandPaul
@RandPaul Will the government be building these roads? Otherwise, how will we get there? Oh! On the #RandWagon
@RandPaul Agreed Senator. It's so sad how little people are paying attention to Trump's authoritarianism.
@silentkpants @RandPaul Its like a Herblock cartoon without the attention to detail
@RandPaul I read something about your house being broken into, you okay??
Ok i feel you but why does your road look like it's going off a cliff? RT@RandPaul
@CharlieCGordon1 @RandPaul Most will choose the Road to Serfdom.  Do Trump supportres read books?
@RandPaul We miss you! @jenladkins
@RandPaul bit ambitious with the number of supporters you have
@RandPaul Do the 2% candidates realize when they attack Trump they attack the majority of American voters?
@RandPaul So Paul is predictable ? FALL WITH PAUL !
@RandPaul I choose freedom #StandWithRand
@RandPaul The video-----that Donald Trump doesn't want Republicans to see

@RandPaul not pictured: everyone else's road to destruction
@RandPaul Be careful your jealousy is showing.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump is crushing you and the others because of illegal immigration and the border!!  He's the only one we trust. 
@RandPaul found! !!Donald Trumps boogie man, 5ft 5in, 110 lbs Meghan Kelly
@RandPaul Will U  @tedcruz  @marcorubio @JohnKasich @ChrisChristie  all stand 2 support @megynkelly doing her job?
@RandPaul Don't destroy each other, please remember and consider attacking Hillary and Communist, Bernie.
@RandPaul Okay, whatever you say! Should be Rand/Trump's road to freedom United we stand; divided we fall.
@RandPaul Freedom is an empty word.
@RandPaul Rand's road to F-ING STUPID!!!!!!
@RandPaul Don't worry about trump, just stick to your message of liberty.
@RandPaul What's w the attacks on Trump. Ur getting bad advice! U skipped a debate and so can Trump. Ur at the bottom Rand. Pull the plug
@RandPaul @TekNoCrazy yea! though I walk through the valley of death.....
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Needs Bernie's cliff to socialism

@RandPaul http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24308395  we need to stop all fluorine treatments immediately.
@RandPaul @mariannecope
@RandPaul @D_Rich012 no
@RandPaul And your road to the White House??? #VoteTrump2016
@RandPaul Except of course for gays to marry. And for Planned PH to continue to provide women free or low cost healthcare. No freedom there.
@RandPaul Correction: more like Hillary & Bernie's road to Socialist serfdom.
@RandPaul THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF FREEDOM! THEY WANT SERFDOM!
#Trump2016
Its doesnT matter what they write about
You as long you have a young and beautiful PIECE OF ASS
@RandPaul
@RandPaul You exposed the theft of OUR SSI money now go further and tell us WHO STOLE and WHO is attacking SSI NOW!
@RandPaul You say this, but I as a Trump supporter, must tell you that he is at 6 gorillion percent in the polls! Haha! Argument refuted!
@RandPaul No.  Rome is the very opposite of freedom, and you know that quite well.
@RandPaul Sounds like the naysayers should read more. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom …
@RandPaul unrealistic, your road should just have a couple wandering bronies and maybe a guy in camo
@RandPaul lol he's not even in the debate and yall still can't stop talking about him.
@RandPaul @GOPtoday
@RandPaul you sold out! You attacked Trump instead of the establishment. 
@RandPaul Do it Rand.
@WAhockey28 @RandPaul would you rather he offer to sing kumbaya?
@RandPaul even tempered libertarianism is a hard sell apparently. Nationalism is easy to hook into to. Ur the only reasonable candidate. Sad
@RandPaul if you think the Trump voter base as any clue what this means ?
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  #StandWithRand he the real deal about gov America n its citizens true patriot genius
@RandPaul please don't attack Trump rand I would like to see you as vp
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Which one's Mitch?
I do love @RandPaul, but... not the right personality for national election, unless he spends 8 yrs as VP. That would be fantastic. #tcot
@RandPaul Sorry Charlie; 2% and falling.
@FuriousAmerica @RandPaul According to the rigged #Polls #Trump scared to take on @megynkelly #Trump is more a joke now than ever before
@RandPaul SHAMEFUL
@RandPaul We must shun him like Joseph McCarthy. Stop using his name.
