What would you prefer Rand ?
full repeal and the replacement plan he submitted weeks ago.
I've seen the replacement plan he submitted he wants to get rid of Medicare and Medicare
exactly.  It's not the government's job to get involved in Healthcare.
Well in other countries whom have cheaper healthcare costs, and outcomes I think it's time to rethink
they also have inferior quality of Healthcare.  Many patients with serious issues come to US.
Not necessarily true, many European countries and Australia included has great health care, it's just
.@RandPaul @observer
Thank you Rand for fighting against @SpeakerRyan & his $110 billion pay back to his insurance co donors! #NoAHCA
.@GennieCritzer @RandPaul @observer @SpeakerRyan Might as well call the bill Insurance Company Care.
.@gamecocksSecE @RandPaul @observer @SpeakerRyan 
You win best comment of the day! 
.@GennieCritzer @RandPaul @observer @SpeakerRyan You saw Ryan is trying to sneak in Gun Control into bill & strip veteran tax incentives?
More than "loom," #Ryancare could sink GOP in 2018 & possibly 2020
@POTUS @tedcruz 

I'm not a communist, but health costs go up for the consumer, care goes down, while CEO pay goes up.
Please don't trust Speaker Ryan. He reminds me of a used car salesman. Not trustworthy.
.@RandPaul @observer
@SpeakerRyan Listen to We the People for once. NO ONE WANTS THIS! You just want to pay bank your insurance co donors.
@BarbMuenchen If he wants to be Pres nominee in 2020 he should run as a Democrat 
Ryancare stinks. It will harm 2018 and President Trump.
@JacumbaGirl @observer Not a single illegal immigrant should receive any health coverage until every American citizen does.
@SpeakerRyan - do you want a Dem president? Because this is how you get a Dem president, genius. #NoAHCA #KillTheBill
I hope Ryan care fails to pass & it gets hung around his neck as a RINOsaurus. Then Trump can work with U to do a better job.
I guarantee that if congress was forced to be on the plan they approve, our options would suddenly get a lot better.
@SpeakerRyan RyanCare will loom over mid-term election 2018.
@BarbMuenchen @observer probably true, but your plan won't pass the Senate and u know it.
You and the freedom caucus need to get with Trump or nothing gets done, we lose  in 2018, USA gone, your fault
I hope that happens. Flip the House.
.@RandPaul @observer
@SpeakerRyan - if this passes you will be responsible for losing seats & majority! #KillTheBill #NoAHCA @GarrettforVA
@szucrm Paul Ryan is the White Obama.
@KNP2BP @observer 
Is there anything worthwhile besides Libertarian views that you espouse?
You are going down Eddie Munster
Then persuade the President to endorse incorporating the most essential parts of your plan. He seems willing...
God bless u Rand ,and thank you for fighting for we the people . Because you sir are someone who actually cares about us
If this passes and Trump signs it, AHCA will become "Trumpcare" and Rs will have shot themselves in foot for 2018.
Thanks Rand for protecting us voters instead of the McCarthy-esque dictator. How stupid does @SpeakerRyan think we are? 
.@pslredrider @RandPaul @SpeakerRyan
REALLY apparently.  #NoAHCA #KillTheBill #NoObamacareLite
@freedomcaucus @GarrettforVA @justinamash
@hectormorenco @observer
Your lips to God's ears. What a disaster this is. I hope Ryan gets tossed on his ass right behind Trump. #Trumpcare
Paul Ryan acting quickly to create name4himself, but shd be cautious as to how he defines himself. Too hasty,big govt healthcare.
Disasterous Ryancare must be stopped.  Please get it right this time.
Pass the bill Obama vetoed.
--don't worry about '20--worry about '18--
@adagioforstring @observer Ryan was a bad idea from the beginning, his sincerity is shallow and transparent
Even if #RINOcare allowed purchasing plans across state lines (which it doesn't) Fed regs will still drive up costs @RandPaul
Donald Trump promised a complete repeal of ObamaCare, Paul Ryan needs to keep that promise, repeal is what we voted for.
The Repubs have had 8 yrs to build a great plan, so why are they caught w their pants down now?? No excuse for it
don't you guys ever sit down face to face and talk about this?
Funny how all the people that were piling on you about not falling in line are now eating crow. Keep up the good work!
@dodsonusn @observer Many people are behind you Sen.Paul. Don't let Socialism expand in US any further!
will loom over all of you in 2018
Catch 22 There is no perfect plan. There never was and never will be. Go with Rand's; as good as it's going to get
shut it down Rand!!!! Worse that ACA but now GOPs fault!! Disaster for 2018 and 2020
we need more squeaky wheels like you!!!!! End the entitlements - create the plan you ran on @realDonaldTrump! Save the Americans!
can you provide some constructive ideas? don' just whine as not in charge  be part of the solution. #USSenate
Keep up the fight!
Ram it through in the dark of night. Great for the Kentucky poor
1No repeal without replacement 2do not let Russian interfer. slide! 3Do not let Kentuckys poor loose subsidies 4 Soc Sec is our $$
please don't let another generation fall. Please don't let a soft bill continue to rob us.
They just don't understand. The cost of insurance premiums will never go down as long as the cost of care keeps going up. Common sense
I think Ryan is the problem in the House.
Senate can do as the Dems did, change rules pass a GOOD Bill.
@lheal @observer @SpeakerRyan Get government out of insurance. I don't need more taxes to pay for ur elite grand coverage.
Repeal was promised, not amend... stop the RynoCare amendment pkg. No subsidies for Socialist states Medcaid expansion.
Thank you Senator @RandPaul!

 Obama's $2T Speaker Paul Ryan
Must go now!
but you've never spoken against them this is just some hissy fit against Trump, utilize some of your fathers integrity please
breakthrough cancer research with wasps that destroy cancer buried by pharmaceuticals curing things would bring down costs
what about those sweetheart deals big pharma gets from Washington to gouge us to death  where's your consumer protection on that
like the pancreatic cancer medication were not allowed to sell in the U.S. so they can radiate us to death for $$$
you're not addressing the reasons hc was on the table to begin with the consumer is getting ripped off 1000 $$ for inhalers etc
you need two things patients have One bill not one for everyone and every machine in the hospital AND insurance mobility
but what's the solution. You can't say citizens can't have welfarecare but allow hospitals to charge up front penalties
Republicans healthcare plan:  Stop being poor.  You equate healthcare to Iphones.
we need a single payer system to replace the ACA.
he won't last till 2020 he s going to prison soon. TRAITOR.
But first it will also loom over GOP 2018. @RandPaul
Squishy Legislation Wonâ€™t Fool Voters: Ryancare Will Loom Over Trump 2020 http://bit.ly/2mBPRwj 
liar, liar. Like a true politician. @POTUS and @jackiewalorski will both lose my vote if this passes.
@realDonaldTrump
This plan will get incumbents all voted out.  Dems hate it.  Repubs do too.  Trump voters will toss Ryan & friends out!!
please stay to your course and do not cave into pressure from trump. This bill does not help the majority it hurts them
@TrumpsDisciple @observer @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse Trump shouldn't trust anything Paul Ryan says or does,he's a traitor
Yay!  Good job, Paul!
I agree voters won't be fooled by this SUPER SECRET PLAN that had no details during the campaigns that RYAN claims lead to victory
and he wonders why he and Romney did not win
What u r showing means nothing to us.  How will it manifest itself for Mr Small Business and Miss Poverty?
@bmwx5melissa @observer I'm not paying for healthcare for someone too lazy to get off the couch or immigrants
I'm with you on this!  It's not right at all!  I'm sick of taking care of someone else other than my  own
#StandWithRand Clean Permanent 
#repealobamacare  @PRyan  AKA The Wisconsin Weasel LIES to #WeThePeople
they are bought off by soros
Please stop @SpeakerRyan and his RinoCare!  We want #FullRepeal
@AppSame @observer 
everytime I here @SpeakerRyan speak, I think what he's saying makes sense on reconciliation or filibuster. @RandPaul is the speaker lying?
no to paul ryan. What about ppl 26k a year
Rand, thank you for all you do!
@FlashMaster659 we have a majority for longer then 3 months why rush this?
@FlashMaster659 yes please take your time and do it right it'll haunt you if you don't.
@TrumpsDisciple Yes it will. It's now an Albatross hanging around the Necks of the  GOP for the next 100 years
WH & GOP establishment saying 'Take it or leave it' on RINOCare. the proper response:
if this passes it's a slap in the face to his supports &I'm one of them. We don't want Ryans bill period. Plz Block it
Senator Paul, please specify or provide link why you disagree with three phase plan Ryan just explained on @TuckerCarlson
let's keep your southern and midwesterm states poor and under educated so you guys can stay in control & wreak havoc on us.
@Stackstn14 @observer I think people should automatically be enrolled in free basic plan, with no IVF, sex changes, immortality.
@LorenzoCastane3 Why can't they just get out of the way. Gov less = best. Repeal. Deregulate. Ignore the MSM and control impulse.
#lyingMitch @SenateMajLdr is backstabbing @POTUS with false claim parliamentarian controls, not just advisory. @seanhannity
Thank you for opposing #RinoCare . This is not what we voted for!
it's looming over them in 2018
Will every federal employee including Congress be required to use the new health care plan? If Not nothing less than total repeal.
#StandYourGround Rand 
ahca will return mkt to indiv & group to preaca, return choice to indiv & sm group, bgrant mcaid, repeal taxes & mandates, support
so just repeal Obamacare Care.  I need the Government forcing me to buy some bullshit plan I don't need or want
#RINOcare
Federal government has no business in healthcare; full repeal is only option.
On top of that- your plan looks amazing!  I read it and couldn't stop saying Yes. Yes! YES!
too bad the omnibus spending bill didn't knock Ryan off & 2 bad he wasn't voted out as Speaker! Where was the Freedom Caucus then?
Push harder for complete gutting of obamacare. Start from scratch. It worked quite well before.
Keep the pressure on. We need free mkt solution. Complete repeal of ObamaCare!!!
Please get the government out of this market. Government intervention is what keeps prices high
.@RandPaul @GodBlessDJTrump My $ is on Trump. ACA is multi-layer mess, and I see layers being peeled back methodically, in phases.
@KamVTV @observer lol
RT
stand your ground senator and Thank  you.A statement I can agree with
Make sure it isn't the actual bill that will be passed.
totally agree Rand!  America does not want Ryancare!  Repeal fully Obamacare!!
Do not FIGHT, SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
@cherokeesher2 @observer as will your effort to make it even worse. Your party has overplayed  its hand.
Your healthcare doesn't cover everyone. healthcare must be affordable for everyone.
your wrong Paul....Trump says fix it...if you guys cant we will find honorable replacements for you
Why not limit receipt of ACA's medicaid expansion to states that allow interstate insurance markets? Solves Comm. Clause problem.
put your healthcare bill idea out for people to read. What you're saying it's what we've been saying for seven years
@KamVTV @observer this bill they are giving us is bs.. phase one stinks when do you get to add your stufd
Many feel thats the object !
@RussJensen5 @observer Globalists are pushing for Obamacare life in order to drop up Trump.
Globalists are pushing for Obamacare lite in order to trip up Trump.
@SWFLBeachBabe @observer this could single handedly be the deal breaker for the party base. 2020 who knows to far out
@SpeakerRyan Terrible Bill... Ryancare isn't worth the 123 pieces of paper it's written on. Repeal Obamacare!!!
no gov run health care. complete repeal. open market across state lines. create welfare program for pre-existing condition
@KamVTV-Go back to the FREE MARKETS that 85% of Americans had before obamacare. Do something for the other 15%. No brainer!
me too. Hoping they shoot it down and get Rand's plan in.
I think it is the best term for it honestly. I don't think it will make it though. Too many people like us who
#Congress If there's a health insurance question on my 1040 tax form, you did not #RepealObamacare. 

Get out of our business!
@KamVTV @observer you want it to fail. Guess what it's a democratic nightmare not the republic
Ryan is John Boehner JR........
I'm not sure what your point is. You have the option to talk to them so why not go talk? Is it really that hard?
@KamVTV @observer so Obama and the Democrat want us to believe this is the Republican fault? Nice try selling it.
@SueSabo Got to get Government completely out of healthcare!
How the hell smart can voters be. They elected Trump.
I think a better name is RINOCare. All the flaws of Obamacare, with few of the benefits.
what a shit show
We deserve better than health savings accounts that low income people can't even use. We need better replacement
Why is Congress even conducting any business before #TrumpRussia & the potentially impeachable accusations Trump made on Twitter?
#AHCA
We need better healthcare, not worse healthcare.  How can you be so sure insurance companies will have lower premiums
@JohnKasich only republicans who will stand up for their beliefs regardless of who is in office. The rest are a bunch of puppets
STATE LINES!!
TRUTH
@adlangston75 @observer it's not a squish it's a betrayal.
@The_Virg_ @observer No thanks to #RINOcare
Ryan is such a disappointment.
Senator Paul.. Please help make the Bill better.  Threats do not accomplish what you think.
@realDonaldTrump @StevePieczenik We need to take the time to get this right or it will haunt us.
Can't help but wonder if Paul Ryan's handling of all of this was designed for failure.  Boehner said it would never go
@SpeakerRyan Paul Ryan complained for years about ACA and we've waited for his "A BETTER WAY" but AHCA is much worse than ACA
Don't let it happen. Rip it up! Govt insurance for those in need.
This bill is a vote looser in 2018. This is NOT what we voted for. Constitution shall rule. Healthcare is a States issue NOT Federal
Senator get on board and work for us.....
keep up the fight, we need a better plan, not alike plan that Ryan is pushing for!
@Dc37Deborah @observer   Ryan will be gotten rid of and forgotten by then!
Always a fan of your Dad's
both of you need voted out...stop covering for your rich lying so called president
Free healthcare for all. There's no such a thing as making it a personal vendetta. From Obamacare to Ryancare?
@POTUS President Trump you've heard people say The media didn't make u so the media can't take u down. The People made u. #AHCJOKE
don't trust ryan think he is a spy for dems and working with Obama and shadow gov! put health care before us and let us vote
Repeal first. Then no entitlements. .Minimal  Medicaid.  We have too much already.  May God guide you all.
Help keep the debate in the public's eyes. We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to heal our Country. Don't F__K ItUP
you are not correct on this one! Help small business and independent contractors!
Lets just call it health care and return controll of it to the private sector where it belongs!
Please discuss w/ Speaker n fix differences. Do you really think Pres Trump will accept an imperfect Plan? Set aside ego
, Trump will loom over Trump.
Good Call Senator! Thanks for speaking out for market forces in Healthcare
Don't give in to Trump's intimidating tactics. You are smarter than him.
plz keep up the exposure of how Ryancare is wrong.. it does not make Am great but makes us slaves to big gov
U r great-always standing 4 constitution & ordinary Am. men & women, thanks 4 not caving on rino h/care bill.
Stop the socialization of our government, thats your primary purpose. Make it an ideology if that's what it takes.
It's true. UR Obamacare Replacement will certainly fail because U missed the monstrous problem U do not even seem to know exists.
Remember: 

2018  2020

@RandPaul supports Trump and REFUSES an Independent Commission into Russia.

What are the Republicans afraid of?
. Paul Ryan a player plays both sides cannot be trusted
we demand the same healthcare u get. Single payer now
Mr. Paul.. We don't need a replacement plan. Just repeal. All we are going to have is another government ran healthcare
@SpeakerRyan this new plan is worse than the current law.  Fix it or forget it.
