Lol didn't take long to give up on that promise huh
You piss on the Constitution every day that you stand with BLOTUS.
Glad your kid didn't get to close to Biden, good job dad.
Only 2 senators have taken this oath seriously.
Your good self and send Wyden 
The only 2 senators to vote against #SESTA #FOSTA
All 97 others have shredded the 1A
#letussurvive
just what you need Rand, your very own STORMY!!!
WE LOVE YOU RAND PAUL!!!!





It’s truly a shame that your ego sabotages your effectiveness EVERY DANG TIME.
I like & support you. I like & support Our President more. If you take your oath seriously, DO SOMETHING about Mueller!
Wanna defend the Constitution? Then start defending Mueller, Damn it!
وانا من الشاهدن
Your really a joke everything you ever propose is turned down by your republican idiots
You did not protect our republic or democratic beliefs. You just passed tax a law that benefited the already wealthy. dislike you.
Maybe start by making a statement about the Justice Department taking a dump on Attorney Client Privilege by raiding Cohen’s Office
Hold Trump accountable. 

If you don't, quit claiming patriotism.

#ComplicitGOP #PutinsPuppet
Obviously not.
Then do it. Defend us from a puppet in the WhiteHouse who is apparently controlled by the Russian mob
If this is true, you must #ProtectMueller #RuleOfLaw #ChecksAndBalances
Lol, are you talking about yourself?
Congratulations 
Then why don’t you do it ya fucko!
Then when the hell are you going to call for the impeachment and removal from office of @realDonaldTrump? You should be leading the charge if what is above is true.
Bullshit. You defend your corrupt cronies. Mueller had nothing to do with the raid on Ray Donovan, I mean Cohen.
Rand are you #morallybankrupt or #mentallydeficient or both? #YouAndYourDadAreGarbage
If you really believe in our constitution, protect Mueller!!!!
In regards to Mueller. It was done at the request of the US Atty’s Office for SDNY with court permission, granted under the most stringent standards. Mueller deliberately stayed out of it.
This tweet is comically dishonest. If you truly cared about defending the Constitution you’d stand up to this President’s relentless assault upon it and all we hold to be right and true about our democracy.
Seriously?!?!?!?!? So you bash our Law Enforcement?!?!?!? You want to give the Executive Branch power to do WHATEVER he wants with no answer to our laws?!? Go ahead and blow off the FBI and see what that does to our country! CHAOS! Worse than now!
Then:  #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller  #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller  #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller
Another putz who will go down in history books as a traitor.
You can't mean that and say that Mueller over-reached. A federal magistrate had to approve.
Protect the constitution,not going well.  Obama/Clintons, IRS,DOJ,FBI totally lawless.F&F, Benghazi, U92-1, raid on Trump attorney
Such a joke!  Seriously?  You wouldn’t know anything about taking an oath and adhering to it.
What are our thoughts for attorney client privileges?
Is Zuckerberg under Oath - if not, why not ??
Republicans should be outraged by what’s happened to President’s lawyer! Why aren’t they supporting our President?! What a double standard, Hillary’s people not treated this way #EndTheWitchHunt
Meuller, a Republican, appointed by a Republican and confirmed by other Republicans. Trump, has been a Republican and a Democrat several times over.
And yet you are not leading the Senate to rein in the lawless WHPUPPET? Where are your convictions Senator?
Now is the time to protect Special Counsel Mueller. Not when there is a Constitutional crisis should Trump fire him.
Let us know when you are ready to start...
You Rand Paul have no idea what was contained in the search warrant application. But a federal judge did, and the judge disagreed with you. your fired Paul
Sen. @RandPaul: FBI Raid on Trump's Attorney Was 'Great Overstep' by Mueller https://bit.ly/2qhFyyM 
What r u doing and others to stop facebook and other censoring conservatives and removing our 1st amendment rights? Ex: diamond and silk were removed fb told them they were "unsafe" for America. Twitter is also censoring conservatives where we cant even talk to one another. Help!
then do your job and let Mueller finish his job.  The raid on Michael Cohen was not done by Mueller it was done properly by getting approvals from several other layers outside of his scope.  Witches: FLYNN, Manafort, gates, page, 11 russians
Perhaps then, rather than going on @FoxNews to unfairly criticize an @FBI search that was carried out under a legally obtained search warrant and authorized by a Senate-confirmed Federal judge, you should just keep your mouth shut and follow the Rule Of Law of our great nation.
Really? Then why are you questioning Robert Mueller's probe into the president* and Russia? Right now, Mueller appears to be the only serious person in D.C. who cares about our Constitution.
Apparently not. Your remark about "Mueller" overstepping by raiding Cohen's premises proves that you care about nothing but personal game.

Shameful.
The Constitution is a beautiful document.  That said, it saw some Americans as not fully human AND didn't allow women to vote or own property.  Maybe it's a living document that should improve over time?  So fight to protect what is right and good and work to improve the bad?
Then why have you met with Russian they please traitor.

Rand Paul has no idea what was contained in the search warrant application. But a federal judge did, and the judge disagreed with him. https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/983744864612421632 …
Come. On.  FBI just doing it's job.  You should too.
Looks like you took an oath to jerk off Chrump and your party colleagues as and when required. Fake libertarian little dripping bitch.
If that's true, then you would stop spewing ignorant, undermining, incorrect statements about yesterday's raid, which you know is legal and had to make it through the legal review of DOJ, SDNY, and was approved by a federal judge. Inf fact, justification exceeded probable cause.
But you're not honoring that oath. You keep wishy washy and protecting Trump. Your Trump loyalties lie in the fact of a tax break which gives you millions of dollars.
Bullshit! You are defending and giving cover to the most corrupt President in U.S. history. Failing your oversight responsibility.
Just saw your commentary on Faux channel.
You too seem to have wandered to the dark side.
History will not be kind but before that, neither will be the voters.
Sen. @RandPaul: FBI Raid on Trump's Attorney Was 'Great Overstep' by Mueller. #FoxNews You’re not doing a great job of defending the Constitution by siding with an Enemy Of The State.
That is truly laughable.
Sure does not look that way!
Don't run for president...... . CROOKED @EPAScottPruitt
Says the guy who doesn’t believe lawyers can break the law. That isn’t in the constitution rando
You're lying, you are NOT protecting the rule of law nor are you protecting the American people!!!
Lies, Lies, Lies and more Lies:
Sen. @RandPaul: FBI Raid on Trump's Attorney Was 'Great Overstep' by Mueller https://bit.ly/2qhFyyM 
Disgraceful!
You’re not doing your job protecting our constitution and nation against a man obstructing justice and violating every emolument written
Obviously not doing such a hot job there.
Really?
Do something to make this stop. We have constitutional rights and they are being trampled in. Stop looking for crime and investigate crimes we know happened. The trail will lead toHillary Clinton and Obama. They won’t be held accountable. #pissedoffamerican



@FBI Raid #WitchHunt
Ur Next Punk.
Please speak up about these unconstitutional actions being taken against our president! I fear you may be the only one who will! @POTUS
Well, please reconsider your support for @EPAScottPruitt  ... that is not a defense of the Constitution, it's the defense of an ineffective egomaniac #FirePruitt
Why aren’t you doing anything about the foul man infecting the White House and abusing our country & constitution? 

Do something before it’s too late.

We will remember.

#TheResistance
#GetTrumpOut

The @GOP is a dead party.
This is a worthwhile video...
If you mean that protect mueller!!!!

This is the time to be in the right side of history!
This is the deficit hypocrite Rand Paul created when he voted in favor of a trillion dollars in new corporate tax cuts.
The CBO will release its economic and budget outlook report this week showing that the federal budget deficit will be at least $1,000,000,000,000 every year Trump is president. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stancollender/2018/04/08/trump-trillion-dollar-budget-deficits-officially-begin-this-week/2/#1e994ab11f66 …
Repeal Lautenberg and restore rights to millions and carreers of LEO and Military.
Republicans who worked with Cambridge Analytica - faux patriots all of them- invited foreigners to assisting them to get power, and in so doing ILLEGALLY benefited from illicitly acquired Facebook data:  #BlueWave2018
Pruitt being "constitutional"?
Rand Paul called Pruitt the “bravest and most conservative member of Trump’s cabinet”.
PRODUCE ELEFUNT IN CANADA.

Your oath apparently ain't worth squat. Pruitt is a crook.

.@EPAScottPruitt is likely the bravest and most conservative member of Trump's cabinet.  We need him to help @realDonaldTrump drain the regulatory swamp.

#VoteThemAllOut
Scott Pruitt took the same oath br0
You are a fraud
I’m a follower of your politics, but Mr. Pruitt?  Sorry!  No!
God Bless Rand! I pray for more clean hearted Americans such as yourself. 
That is disgusting. I love my kids. I want them to drink CLEAN water. I want them to breath clean air. I want them to eat food with no poison. WHAT DO YOU WANT ? Cheaper food? Really?
When are you going to start?
except when it comes to Pruitt
every day.... AHEM  EVERY DAY FOR THE ENTIRE TIME THIS HAS BEEN @RandPaul PINNED TWEET I HAVE TO "RE-LIKE" IT
re-liked again
A pumpkin patch in every yard...whether permitted by zoning laws or not!!!! #MAGA
Another natural pathic doctor murdered and Monsanto is trying to control marijuana. Our government s murdering Americans has got to stop

Pruitt gave pay raises to staffers from funds set aside for scientists in emergency situations to protect the public? What about liberty for citizens of Flint! That IS UNETHICAL! Pruitt puts profit over public safety - reason EPA was created! FIRE PRUITT NOW!
Supporting Pruitt just shows your hypocrisy and that you are not draining the swap!  Pruitt is out of control!
Every member of Congress did that!! Very few back it up!! #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA #BuildTheWall #KeepAmericaGreat
Senator, if the US pulls out of Iraq, will the opposing forces take over similar to North Vietnam and South Vietnam?


@realDonaldTrump took the same #oath to protect the #USA #Constitution.  Hardly a day has passed that he has not attacked the same #contitution from #1stamendment to every amendments, yet no #congressman objects because #Zionists own your derrieres!
#DreamActNow they took an oath to do the same thing
Interesting that every time I visit your page here @RandPaul I have to retweet and re-like your pinned tweet. Twitter is definitely playing games.
Congratulations on your win!   The laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico & Canada have tough immigration laws, but USA?  "ACT CONGRESS!"
Rand you may have to go man.
Just to be clear: hate and death threats to Parkland MSD survivors is now official Republican policy
Until R politicns condemn loudly widely
Glad to see that you didn't feed any children to #PredatorBiden!

You took an oath to protect the businesses and your voting records clearly show that you don't believe in applying the Constitution to the private citizen. Your inability to understand the purpose and intent makes you dangerous to our democracy.
You see the private citizens as a tool that can be used  to benefit the deserving few. You believe that a .10 cent per hour wage should be acceptable, you believe no female should have the right to make any decisions without the males approval. Your a danger to a modern democracy
Just a reminder:
Stop the illegal invasion Rand!
And to you mr. @JoeBiden do you solemnly swear not to grope little girls religiously?  No you dont... @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
Please, do an investigation in2 Facebook violating people's 1 st amendment rights, violating law about cruel & unusual punishment as in blocking some1 from their family & friends 4 30 days, surveillance w/out a warrant, no due process 4 those they accuse & violating other rights
Many of us are asking why you voted no We need to know
Look who all voted NO to info sharing and more training on identifying human trafficking. 

Your time is short. #FollowTheWhiteRabbit …
Step down
When Founding Fathers forged this Republic they discarded all others and began anew. What was their logic? #Rights , it is a stated right to abolish a Government, an Executive, a Court, per Declaration of Independence. No need to wait for an election.


Rare video of Ron Paul on the 2nd Amendment in 1989 https://youtu.be/r_HjVBZw5pE 
Since I am being force drugged against my will, people who defend the Constitution are not heroes, they are criminals!!!
Thanks to the Constitution, people have to battle it out in the courts just for the right to collect rain water!!!
Don't ever email me again to support guns.
The Smear Pack's are afraid that you will start pushing the illegal spying by the Obama administration Fake accounts popping up
What are you doing about Trump’s attempts to destroy the rule of law and rule the USA as Putin rules Russia?
I wish he was ruling the country as Putin rules Russia. Then I would not be force drugged. Putin outlawed that.
Wish everyone else that took the oath was serious about it. But most are there for personal gain. The hell with the American people. Which is why the Swamp needs to be drained
Then why are you supporting #ConventionOfStates foolishness?!! 

We don't want #Congress making decisions about rules for running a Constitutional Convention!
 
Very disappointed.  I'd just forgiven your support of the #TPP Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal.
#DrainTheDeepState
Please reject a Convention of States.  If we open it to the liberty minded side,  we open it to the leftists.
You are no different than trump, who signed the BILL, a so called REPUBLICAN. So What Up With the VOTE POWER, You are just trying to save your BUTT, SO SAD!!!!.. DRAIN THE SWAMP, start with the people whom is running along side trump."NASTY REPUBLICANS LAW MAKER" BAD LUCK!!
Thank you for your service and for doing what you can to uphold the Constitution. The Foundation upon which Tyranny is kept at a distance. @Rainmaking It's Rainmaking Time!
The Constitution does nothing for me. I am being force medicated with drugs that make me feel like shit...to all you vets out there...thanks for nothing!!!
Liberty, justice and fair trade for all!  Most importantly freedom!  
Please retire you RINO
