...you don't need to...go talk to Trump and get rid of Ryan
tweet @POTUS to LISTEN TO @RandPaul and not drop thinly veiled threats on twitter that Rand will get on board.
...Rand can run around looking for the hidden law, he can certainly find Trump...art of the deal
I read the #RandCare proposal on January 25th. What's Trump's excuse?
...Trump is the President...Rand is capable of going to him with his ideals...
The details are there. For all to see. #transparency Rand is capable of SO MUCH MORE than hand delivery.
...Trump doesn't make laws, it's up to Congress & Senate to get it to him...and Rand needs to lock Ryan up
So why are you putting the responsibility on Rand to talk to Trump on this? Contact your state Reps to support #RandCare. #action
I support you and your plan. Don't pass Ryans bill. It's bad.
Ryan's Bill cuts Medicaid by $880B, HURTING People w/ Disabilities! My ASD Kid on Medicaid Waiver wait list for 11 yrs
Nobody with 2 brain cells to rub together ought to be voting for it....
@realDonaldTrump said u will get in line.I thought everything he said was true? He bullies until ppl like u folo him blindly. SAD!
#noAHCA It will cut Medicaid by $880B Having a devasting Impact on Individuals w/ Disabilities My ASD kid on wait list for 11 yrs
keep government out of it thank you Senator RAND Paul
#Obamacare#ReincePriebus#Paul Ryan did not win. Donald Trump won. Down with Paul Ryan. We support #Rand Paul.

Keep fighting. Full repeal of Obamacare.  No RyanCare. PS We need a new Speaker. One who is loyal to DJT & the voters.
Without loyalty
You can Have No Trust
We Don't Trust Ryan the lying
@WaspZealot I am so mad at GOP Establishment! So arrogant to think they are above the voters!if they can't get on board, time2go!
You want it your way! Work with the president, Rome wasn't built in a day Sir!  Can you be part of the solution and make it work?
highway and senator paul informed president trump of what speaker ryan doing the other day on 45 minte news internivew.
like I said, if they'd work together it would be helpful but everyone has there own agenda.
the highway liek some people suggest. Everyone going give some and take some. So everyone little bit what want.
@zoombouse -No plan is going to be perfect. Provisions to tweet are necessary on overhaul of this magnitude
@redmanblackdog We stand with you Senator Paul.
it is called d Trumpcare...
We stand with Rand you have a plan that will work! #StandWithRandsPlan. It is the best solution so far
You sir are supposed the will of the people .  NOT YOURS !
@MSNBC @freedomcaucus @CNN @SenSchumer Rs refuse to take in account ACA the good benefits.Instead,Rs color ACA ALL bad for Repeal.
#BringBackCapitalism! This is barbaric #communism! #RestoretheFederalRepublic
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Listen to Rand.  Repeal the whole damn thing like you all promised.
don't back down Rand, you're all we have!
-I'm glad we have you fighting for us, no one else gets it!
But you sure can run your mouth. Just like your father.
then fix it Rand. Stop whining. get to work on the other Republicans. Goodness sakes 3 branches and you all fail.
only the first step...have faith that he will continue working to get what we want!
Fight, fight, fight!
NO to Ryancare! This is NOT repealing Ocare!! Please Stand with Rand on his plan!! Ryan must go!
@potus @presssec @scavino45 Please do NOT support RYANCARE, Repeal this unconstitutional beast. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #TermLimits
@networksmanager @potus We need to put Trump GOP / Constitutionalists in Speaker seat. Let's get Paul Ryan to step aside. #MAGA
Thank you for standing your ground on this
politicians  let their egos make decisions. Fixing it is good. The people want it fixed. Do what we want.
keep with it Rand. We want full appeal first. All conservatives in Illinois are behind you.
keep up the great fight Senetor.
give the people the public option. That will fix Obamacare
@sturgill_dean then bring solutions to discussions w/ @realDonaldTrump real and get negotiations going.  Stop dragging @$$
Stand your ground. Total repeal, open up ins sales to all states. Eliminate cap and no insuring preexisting conditions. That's it
That's why I voted for you Rand
you will vote for it ... you all will. This is just noise
Keep fighting Rand, we are behind you and the Freedom Caucus.
Thank you!! 100% support you and this position! Stay strong! #IStandWithRand #RepealAndReplaceRyan
you can be replaced. Stop fighting President Trump and let's move along
In a Freemarket economy why should it be illegal for a Doctor to charge a rich person more, for medical services?
get rid of Ryan.
@millennialviews Stand Firm Rand. Do not waiver or equivocate. RINOcare is Obamacare Lite. Bad for all Americans. No @SpeakerRyan
U have 2take on med pricing! Look ensure in a Hosp is like $12/18 btl; they charged for ensure I took2myDad&took it
@jaysdeal66
Join ranks or Alinsky followers i.e. progressive Left will win. Negotiate in private but present solid front like they do#MAGA
Thanks for standing up for KY and Americans!! DC better catch up with you or they won't make it the next round.
how do we get @POTUS to REJECT Ryan care? Is he listening to the people that put HIM there???
the government has failed the American people over and over again it is time for the people to take back control of their lives!
Good! It's time to seriously consider Ryan as Speaker. We are furious he was voted in again.  Vote Jim Jordan as Speaker!
We need more like @RandPaul he is a modern day founding father #FullRepeal
please help us get the best possible. This only once in a lifetime chance we have
Thank you for your honesty, Senator.
Thank you @RandPaul. Keep on fighting for us.
THANK YOU!
Shame on you! You liar! You're the one who's failed us! It costs you nothing but our rates triple! Problem with healthcare? You!!
Obamacare didn't fail: you failed us. Under Trumpcare you won't pay an extra dime but those of us over fifty see our rates triple.
Stick to your guns Senator. You're doing great.
I agree with you Senator. Hold firm.
DO NOT VOTE FOR RYANS CRAP.
thank you
I would not want to see you do that, I say go talk to Trump and figure a way to fix that crap. Show them what a smart man U are!
@NetworksManager @POTUS meet with Dr who was on Tucker 3/13/17. He knows his stuff. I think it is Dr Umber??
@NatShupe as Ron Paul's son I find it hard to believe he may vote for anything that has government involvement
@Trish061616 so how about publishing your plan so we can see it. Be part of the solution not part of the problem.#RepealAndReplace
@NatShupe Please help GOP get it right!!!!
It would be so much easier to just fix the ACA rather than start all over.
I am thankful for you/your convictions to stand firm with those of us who voted to repeal Obamacare and replace with the right alternative.
Thank you, Mr Senator for being so outspoken about not supporting Obamacare-Lite. #FullRepeal
@NetworksManager please don't back down. There aren't many politicians that actually listen to the American people. We need you
I don't blame you! Instead you should insist on Ryan's resignation!
@NetworksManager thank you. Fire @SpeakerRyan
I oils not expert Republican who wants to be reelected to vote for Obamacare light.
stand with Rand, and Trump, Ryan is the enemy
keep fighting for us! You are truly fighting the good fight.
...also doesn't kill enough poor people.
Keep them honest Senator.!! But please talk to President Trump and come up with something together.
thanks for the no vote in advance
Cheaper to have employers pay employee what they spend on ins. to create HSA.    Workers get huge raise & buy health care sanely.
This is about your money or "other people's money"  No one spends OTP as frugally as your own.  Make basic health care about HSP.
what about the unemployed? Disabled? Are not eligible for HSP
I hope you continue to fight for a better plan. This is a great opp to uncouple insurance & health care.  HSP and catastrophic ins
Please don't!
that's right talk to media anyone who cannot help pretty hardheaded and selfish especially since it doesn't affect you. Where is
the senate plan u say I have
Please stay the course. Many support your position. We do not want Federal Socialized Medicine!
Wish "they" would start listening to you.
why can't we have not only ins. competition but know what dr & hospitl cost r.  Then have competition b/w them?
Thanks Senator!
stand your ground
You cannot vote for this plan. I agree. Fuck Trump.can you just be on the side of the citizens of the USA?
Good. Take the ACA and fix it.
NO to fix left wing extermsit aca that hurt American lifes and business it time to repeal and replace with pro
@Debbietazz Hope you don't give up on making it the best it can be.
I don't hate to agree with you I'm just sorry that I have to agree with youse
what are you going to do about it? We still haven't heard your plan. Health care is a legit need for everyone. Come on, unite us.
Thank you!
80% of what we want is better than 0%, & 1000% better than #Obamacare. "Repeal Only" with no folllow up (60 votes) cheats all.
I totally agree with you
I support you in this fight.  Stay with it!  You are doing what is best for the country not for political reasons.  Thank you.
keep up the pressure! #RinoCare is just as terrible as Obamacare
just keep moving the ball forward. This is the time for action not grandstanding!
thank you for standing up for conservative principals. Keep fighting the good fight!
Trump needs to keep his promise.  Rhinos thought HRC was going to win so they never bothered to work on a plan.
they said they worked on it for 7 years. We believed them
Then you are voting for failure

You have NO chance of getting 60 votes needed

Ryan's plan has best chance

Grandstanding Rand
your starting to convince me senator
Wish we had more politicians like you Rand, we might actually get a decent healthcare plan if we did.
Why not address the problem instead of the symptom?  Single payer is where all civilized countries are!
dont give in to the rhinos..remove Ryan as speaker!!
Come out for Medicare for all. People already paying into it.
@5228027s Alright Sen. Paul. We support you. Put forth a new bill and shred obama care lite.
Please pass your plan NOT Paul Ryan's! Still too many insurance lobbyists involved in writing it.
@SpeakerRyan need bill banning all healthcare related industry frm contributions to lawmakers. Conflict w/taxpayer best interest!
thank you. Hope we have more like you who will vote against this huge betrayal to the American people.
Fix ACA, you know it's problems, fix them but I'm glad you won't vote for trumpocare
The Majority of Americans Voted For President Trump and the Rest of Congress ,All talked Repeal to the American People Now Repeal
incorrect. The majority of people voted for HRC. She won popular vote.
That is not elect president and the reason elect the president the way do is so all America have fair
actually the EV is a huge issue now with improper rep re: gerrymandering-so pop vote is still tht.
@zeroinscwmy premiums went up 400 percent. Ryancare does nothing for me or America
my premiums tripled.
The government needs to stop supporting everyone. They force people to buy HC. They want to raise our children. It's not working!!
The Voters stand with you. Total Repeal 

Why won't Paul Ryan get the message? We want RandCare
full repeal briefs well.
anyone?? Have heard a single person talk about how many lose health care without a replacement plan in place.
under full repeal Senator, w/ no replacement, how many loose coverage the first year? During the transition to replacement.
FULL REPEAL! we don't need another bas bill. Repeal and start over!!
repeal and replace @SpeakerRyan @POTUS needs more allies
I guess you are loyal to chuck schumer
.@RandPaul @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer
You should be @POTUS instead of @DonTheCon_Trump
Thank you!!!
What's this I hear about Obama stealing 250 bn from FANY MAY FREDY MAC investors to prop up Obamacare? Lawsuits filed?
Stop this Insurance  backed trash bill:Obama care light or Ryan care. Trump will lose election on this if passed .Syria invasion 2
NOMANDATES ?? If I decide 2quit MY JOB (takeAbreak) WHY PUNISH MY FREEDOM with paying InsCo?? Absolutely an OXYMORON 2Americans
Stay strong, we're counting on you!
amen
Sir, don't vote for it.  Pull it out, check it out, approve some, change some and make it right for the American people.
keep fighting the good fight!
Please don't vote it in.  I also don't see why my state gets to tell me what I must have for healthcare!  Keep on fighting it!
England and Cuba health care puts over paid under served America to shame and its the greedy Doctors and insurance industry fault @RandPaul
Keep up the good fight.
good job fighting rand. If you cant bet ryan at least break it up so it can be piece mealed- not a win but fixable
Keep fighting for a better plan.  Thanks for all you are doing!
Why the publicity stunt? Grow a pair and call @realDonaldTrump
Like your dad said - Eventually all central planning fails ...
I believe you are a doctor so you know very well that the health system rest on a tripod.
AMEN !! #StandWithRand
is just upset @GOP isnt using his plan..they ALL need 2 get together & improve ACA or create plan that's GOOD for the American ppl
appreciate you, Rand.
@janey1792 We don't want a mommy state insurance plan from either party. Free market should decide.
tell them you will vote yes when they all agree to use the exchange for thier families. #onesetofRules

trump knows best
Please push your view to @realDonaldTrump  Heath care is finacially draining me that I do not go to Doc when sick I am sick now
Geez, Rand.  Get with the program, will you.  It's a consensus bill.  You're not a dictator.
I think #SenatorRyan is trying a grandstand play in hopes it vaults him into the spotlight for Gop nominee, for president.
and WE THE Paying PEOPLE continued to be taxed for others entitlements.  Seniors and the disabled continue to loose 
you do realize those entitlements you speak of with Obamacare, are the only reason many seniors can afford health care
please stop it mr paul,im one of the 50 yr olds who doesnt have insurance,cant afford it,i need aforadble insurance!!
#DirectPrimaryCare start with patients.
Republicans never wanted ANY Social well fare programs&we no Republicans have no interest in HC, only $!U got stuck w Trump's idea
stick to your guns Rand Paul.  Don't let Paul Ryan ruin it for the rest of the country
I'm with you Senator!
Senator r u willing to compromise through the legislative process?
Then, stop wasting your time and our money, whining on social media! Offer solutions or leave! Enough is enough! #DTS
wasting his time? he is exposing #ryancare & the establishment. he did propose his own conservative, free market plan
