@DMashak all are treated generally equal under the law. Rich ppl can afford better,well paid lawyers.
Wrong > #RuleOfLaw means 1 set of laws for all applied equally to all w/o regard to wealth, status or govt position @RandPaul
we have as code to universal laws fir all as you will get. Fame/money give advantages others don't have on occasion.
#Equity & #RuleofLaw are UNALIENABLE NATURAL RIGHTS no matter how corrupt govt operates now @RandPaul
Meaning #HIGHCRIMES&MISDEMEANORS http://www.constitution.org/cmt/high_crimes.htm … #PokemonGo @MNStateFair @PoliticsMN @CRNC @UofMCRs @MN_YRs
These folks all take oaths of office & must be held to them @RandPaul @mnstatefair @PoliticsMN @CRNC @UofMCRs @MN_YRs
balances as each fight for their turf. Cong gave up, press part of DNC.
Congress didnt give up,Congress = complicit>Budget>Boehner14& Ryan15 @RandPaul @mnstatefair @PoliticsMN @CRNC @UofMCRs @MN_YRs
Is that why GOP state legislatures are trying to keep minorities from voting, or limit the power to their votes?
then ID for spray paint, cigarettes, getting SNAP, lottery tickets, all things minorities do, is racist?
SNAP, lottery tickets, cigarettes? I'm fairly sure more whites than minorities use those?
you mean b/c there r more or as a statistical %? Doesn't matter, ? applies. Racist to say minorities can't get ID
Voter fraud was your logic 4 theses laws, doesn't exist. So it must b 2 steal votes
um, voter fraud and stealing votes is the same thing. I was responding to your racism claim.
I still have faith that you'll be POTUS one day. Keep making a difference for us all.
Would much rather have @RandPaul than I would Trump or Clinton.
considering @GovGaryJohnson as well.
I mean, considering only 9% of people voted for Trump or Clinton... I think if more people hear about him he could have a good (1)
chance. (2)
I do think he has a chance but some of his ideas (although I agree) are considered extreme. Libertarianism is all or nothing.
I know, & I wish people(a certain percentage of Americans) could realize the things they consider too extreme really isn't extreme.
and oddly what they think isn't extreme is extreme to us lol
Dear Rand.  I'm a big fan of yours.  It's time for you to endorse @GovGaryJohnson .  Trump has flipped out on us.
rite on please prosecute her
oh really !! Even yellow and brown? For some reason this wasn't your opinion a few months ago !
Go back to Europe.
Many yrs ago as I child I naively believed that was w case. Now, have no faith in corrupt political system.
LOCK HER UP
"Except women. Men have the right to force them to bear children against their will." Right, RP?
@478_5386 
No

Be
Above the law
Of
The land
@jdarsey51 that's not obamas administration,
Clintonionists excepted, of course.
@jdarsey51 here we go! Racist to obey the law ! Wait until refugees get here lawlessness will rule the land!
until you break it, some have more rights when they break the law..
@jdarsey51 

If that's true, then it's time to end affirmative action
tell that to Mr Trump.
This is why we need Gary Johnson, not Hillary or Donald.
@_Proud_American so why is Hillary in handcuffs on her way to her new home a jail cell
yes known fact why is trump out and not in jail
@HeartlessHRC thank you Rand for calling Clinton out for criminal behavior. Stay strong!
then why in the world does she get away with her mis-deeds ???  shes a criminal !
Thank you for your diligence Stand firm for our country!
@billpostmus Rand is on fire. Outstanding job sir! Stay motivated
EVERYONE - EVERYONE in Washington who has let the lawlessness and corruption get to this state is complicit.
W/ NO intent of making excuses 4them;there R the willing who go along to get quid pro quo career advancement(cont)
&less willing,who go along 2avoid retaliation like No raises,no promotions&social shunning
@Carolin17951107 whether you're in Congress or not, everybody should. Be treated the same under the law. Obamacare.
yeah yeah, but we are not 
Preach it Rand!
@billpostmus The problem with this statement Rand is it doesn't apply to elites like @HillaryClinton Congress should investigate.
@alllibertynews @RandPaul Not libertarians they're REPUBLICANS IN DRAG !
@billpostmus Do you mean HILLBILL ?
@billpostmus except for @HillaryClinton who is not subject to laws for the common person!
Accountability and Trust in Government is most critical in our new Transparent Age. "Truth Justice and the American Way".
I actually agree w R Paul on this TOTALLY AGREE
@AppSame Also if you are a former Secretary of State or any other politician!
Thanks for that insightful tweet! it's now on my https://www.rebelmouse.com/NahBabyNah/  site http://rbl.ms/2aRwt8d 
@NahBabyNah Ron Paul said that?
great interview thank you for saying all that please continue to speak out about the Clinton's America needs your voice
@ericbolling 
That was a great show.  Especially when Rudy was talking about RICO.
@_proud_american Yessir...every day!
how about instead of fighting for your political party you actually fight for everybody and do something about the Zika outbreak.
Thank you, Dr. Paul for your courage and integrity!
most of usd agree with you.killary has the KKK backing her & only cares about her self
Your dad was repeatedly raped by the Oligarchy.  Time to rise up against them, Rand.  GET LOUD!!!
Justice is suppose to be blind, but not for the Clintons. Sad!
Inclulding Donald Trump and his University
Gotta respect the RAND always lookin out for America n it's citizens thx u sir.. #StandWithRand
The witch is high as a kite and has zero regard for national security. She's an untouchable mob boss.  Indict now
#Bush above the reach of #law and #justice #deceit #fraud #AnAmericanChilcotReport http://www.opednews.com/articles/An-American-Chilcot-Report-by-Lance-Ciepiela-Articles-Of-Impeachment_Chilcot-Report_George-W-Bush_Iraq-War-160714-948.html … #warcrimes #torture
Powerful interview. I had to share it on Facebook.
Rand true but current Federal laws are not enforced, there is 2 stardards one for you politicians and one for citizens
yes  but also when under the influence?
if only you would've been the GOP nominee...
Not according to Hillary. She says it's the White guys fault!
What about judges and prosecutors Rand @CoxLanham71 # they own the law, John Heyburn told me so, activist need legal restraints
amen
can we start a "Right in Rand, Write in Rand" campaign? You're are only hope. #writeinrand
I would never vote for anyone that  Paul, Cruz, bushes and the rest support. I'm done with them
I wish @RandPaul was still in the race.
not if you know the right people.  The law is there to keep everyone else down and to provide a framework for organized corruption
Really so why did 2ppl caught with illegal Guns &DRUG get NO Charges Filed against them oh bc they were BLACK football pl
He didn't say things don't happen. Under the law there should be no difference!
But there is and paul is full of crap he acts like everything is against blacks & white get all the breaks Thats BS
whether u like rand or not he is always proving he tries to represent & protect the people not like most of the other politicians
@RandPaul
WAS I ?
excellent job speaking last night on @oreillyfactor you are a knowledgeable weapon that can help save #SCOTUS  @mike_pence
Super fantastic interview. Hit 'em hard!
great interview. well said. lets hope it plays out as you say.
The law should be written so that applying it equally doesn't result in racism our discrimination. It isn't, now.
@RandPaul @RyanRMiner
#ClintonAccountability
.@RandPaul You should be the next President! Voted for you in the Indiana primary.
@os4185 I saw you and it was awesome.  I served in the military and my clearance would have been pulled then court martial
.@RandPaul How is THAT gong to happen with Killary in the WH? The @gop has betrayed people who long for justice and rule of law. THANKS:(
justice is supposed to be blind after all. Lately these days she has been peeking under that blindfold.
.@RandPaul   Pathetic when Rand Paul speaks straight and honest to the people, that neither side wants to hear the truth #RandPaul2020
.@RandPaul White, middle aged, heterosexual males are the ONLY unprotected class of people in the USA.
Sharia Law?
Well, considering... http://www.globalresearch.ca/america-created-al-qaeda-and-the-isis-terror-group/5402881 …
yet everyday Americans are placed in UNCONSTITUTIONAL guardianships and their estates depleted!
@TheVoiceOfPaulR comey has a long history with the Clintons
@TheVoiceOfPaulR my theory comey was hedging his bets
@TheVoiceOfPaulR exactly right!But that is not the way it is in the United States malicious prosecution and refusing to prosecute
What about old white wives of ex presidents?
Why doesn't Director Comey agree with you? #CrookedHillary
You sir are a good man. Please support Trump. We cannot have Hillary running our Country.
he is going to support johnsonweld
Should be.
My testimony on unconstitutional and counter-productive drug testing needs to be heard in Washington

@RandPaul
TED!!
abolish the FED !!
You forgot politically connected or not!
*gasp* treating people the same instead of different depending on how resistant they are to sun burn!! Well I never!!
don't be discouraged Senator. Truth wins in the end, even if not in our timing. Thank you for being a voice for Liberty
unless your last name is Clinton
Yes. Hillary need to step down, go to jail or renounce her run for POTUS. She has done more wrong under justice vs Martha Stewart.
I wish you were on every cable station #WethePeople have ZERO faith our government will hold @HillaryClinton  to account.
