@RandPaul Bernie never said shit about free houses or lunch, troll.
@RandPaul wait... don't we literally have free lunches in schools?
@RandPaul how about an emancipatory unconditional basic income?
@jonathanpress @alllibertynews @RandPaul how about if you don't work, you don't eat.
@Pale_Primate @RandPaul There isn't enough work for all. Automation is real, and we need a solution: Basic Income, not forced labor camps.
.@RandPaul - Do you want to get rid of free parks, free libraries, and free K-12 since "There is no free lunch"?
@EricJafMN @RandPaul None of those things are free.
@RandPaul Right, and no free lunch for Wall Street or Oil Companies either correct?
@Mr_Repertoire @RandPaul Senator Paul opposed wall street bailouts.
@RandPaul @HarryIsaacJr Is only free lunch if you eat someone else's lunch.
@RandPaul @SFR_UIowa  #StandWithRand #DemDebat
@RandPaul @Mpoppnot  Thats right. The  rich are gonna finally cough up their faiir share of tax money to move America forward!!! @SenSanders
@RandPaul you and all your rich selfish friends will pay for it!!! Free lunch on #trump and #RandPaul 
@RandPaul @MichelleGregoi1 True, technically, but, to the extent anything is free, false. Parasites get a "so low-cost it's free" lunch
@RandPaul business 101 there is no such thing as a free lunch
@RandPaul @coff33loveit thanks Rand..now run along...
@RandPaul No except for government employees!
@RandPaul Then there are $1000 lunches while everyone else goes hungry.
@GaryAllenMiles @RandPaul you won't find those expenditures with Rand. Only at Clinton fundraisers
@adlangston75 @RandPaul Because his fundraising has foundered to the point no one wants to spend $1000 on lunch with him.
@GaryAllenMiles @RandPaul
@adlangston75 @RandPaul @daveweigel So he got a pay off to commentate on the sidelines. Now that his campaign has ceased to be relevant.
@GaryAllenMiles @RandPaul @daveweigel
@RandPaul @realkodybrown lazyass dems want everything to be free. Free food free houses free lights. They don't want 2 pay for anything!
@RandPaul nobody's suggesting we give out free houses or cars, just feed the poor and take care of the sick. You know, as Jesus would do
@D4LTINO @RandPaul at gun point?
@RandPaul He'd give you free stickers, but shockingly he RAN OUT!!!
@RandPaul @News3LV Clearly not if we go to lunch with you #cheapskate#badLibertarian
@RandPaul @J_H3avy no there isn't but that doesn't mean lunch should leave you in debt for the next 3 decades.
@RandPaul Tell that to Wall Street
@RandPaul Says the rich guy who inherited money. "My dad worked so hard! He paid for my college so much! I feel like I've earned things!!"
Except when it comes to the top 1% that @RandPaul and the GOP keep voting to give them in tax breaks.
@RandPaul The only Conservative or I call Conservatarian in the GOP race. You have my vote for President!
@RandPaul apparently being in congress get you lots of free lunches.  You leave congress richer then when you went in & become millionaires.
@RandPaul @freedomtex Ppl think everything will be paid for by others. They're in for a rude awakening. #freelunch
@RandPaul too many people in the USA to do that here, and some Maltese people still pay to go to universities in other countries #DemDebate
@RandPaul Malta has a small population so they fund free university, and healthcare with that, no over priced medical for anyone #DemDebate
@RandPaul You should have done that at last #GOP debate but you chose not to attend. Therefore you have no standing. #GOPfail
@RandPaul hillary has that bill clinton arm motion down
@RandPaul Malta has over 1 million tourists a year a lot of people from other countries pay for university, pay for health care #DemDebate
@RandPaul there is no free lunch and it is time for your billionaire chronies to pay for it. They had free ride for so long. Tax them!
@RandPaul You let the top 1% have a free lunch by letting them hide their Millions of Dollars overseas in tax shelters #FeelTheBern
@Tedswayze @RandPaul except for that inconvenient fact that he doesn't.
@RandPaul I think they addressed that. Are you paying attention? #demdebate
@RandPaul Socialists like to spend everyone's money, even when there is not enough. His reckless ideas can only lead into deficit and debt
@RandPaul For a guy who gets his salary from the people, his healthcare from the people & even his lunch paid for by the people, say what?
@RandPaul  Thank u all forall your doinfor yourLiberty n Rand he has the knowledge n intelligence courage guideance, all we need #DemDebate
@RandPaul there seems to be for the big corporations, you just have to invest into a politician
@RandPaul That would mean someone would have to be generous. Google the term.
@RandPaul Bernie's stuff sounds attractive until you realize it must be paid for, which means coerced redistribution.
@RandPaul Sanders left his wallet at home, wonders if the middle class can spot him a few billion bucks #StandWithRand
@RandPaul Well let's see, start with reducing military budget and perhaps if we hadn't spent trillions on ridiculous wars we'd benefit US
@bretrobi @RandPaul is actually for reduced military spending. He is the only Republican not willing to start WWIII
@adlangston75 @RandPaul certainly not arguing that. I'm aware of his position. Which I agree with
#DemsDebate
Humans start sufferings
The moment we wake up
Get out of the bubble
What Free lunch?
@RandPaul
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Y is Paul posting 2 #demdebate? Guess can't get traction with #GOPBeastsofWild party? Pls go over 2 Fox!
@ny_red1 @RandPaul remember the #RandRally ?
@RandPaul exactly right. Which is why the super rich will pay for it. #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul are you paying for free lunch during commercial breaks at the #DemDebate ?
@RandPaul what about @POTUS secret stash? Can't he pay for my stuff. Bernie says he will lol #DemDebate
@RandPaul  No free lunch it cost everything cost lets help get that down by #StandWithRand for our Republic #DemDebate
@RandPaul but if we just tax the rich some more, all our problems will be solved. If that sounds facetious, that's because it is.
@RandPaul make Bernie #FeelTheBern Dr Paul :)
@RandPaul who said free?
@RandPaul @johndobbs you are a bright and principled guy, why advertise being supported by those liars at @Heritage foundation?
@RandPaul TANSTAAFL
@RandPaul there’s no free lunch, but when Hitler invented libertarianism he chose to give it to the world as a gift.
@RandPaul
.@RandPaul The capitalists will steal your lunch money, beat you up, charge you for your hospital visit, then refuse foodstamps #DemDebate
@HCELindsay @RandPaul or @HillaryClinton will charge $500 for a dinner and $100,000 to hear her speak
@RandPaul nope just #obamaPhones and mandatory health care. #RandRally
@RandPaul ........unless ur in Congress. Then there's no tab!
@RandPaul you compared universal healthcare to slavery. If I pay taxes, can I get something out of the government for once?
@RandPaul did u see Hillary's ad during debate?  It's Shocking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM8jfZTC6Mo …
@RandPaul Tell that to a hungry child.
@JodiRuth @RandPaul they know more than anyone that free lunches don't exist.
@RandPaul not in this country .. unless you are talking about the 1%
@RandPaul You and Wall Street have one.
