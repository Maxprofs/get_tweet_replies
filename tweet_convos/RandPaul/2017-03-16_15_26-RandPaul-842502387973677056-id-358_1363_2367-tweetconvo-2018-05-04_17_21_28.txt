Well you have had plenty of time to do it. So stop talking and do it.  You guys talk way too much
Now get to work and put something together that All Republicans can agree on!
Why haven't you are your posse developed a viable plan over the last 7 years?
@CBJAndBuckeyes @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal So why don't you have a better option.  Seriously you've had 7 yrs & 50 attempts.
Rand Paul has a bill in Congress right now. Much better than Obamacare Lite!  >>>>>> https://www.paul.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ObamacareReplacementActSections.pdf …
Read it.  Wouldn't call it "better" however some of it is better.  COULD be a starting point.
Get rid of it! Stop wasting time. Just repeal! Forget replace.
@StrHon2016 @RandPaul @RepJeffDuncan go back to way it was then make some improvements #leavemedicarealone our seniors deserve it
#ResignRyan  you've betrayed conservatives for too long #swampratRYAN congress has accomplished nothing
I don't understand folks like you! always so quick to attack those in your own party, I'm sick of it!
Ryancare is not what Trump ran on. We voted for repeal. Give voters what u promised
You got my vote, I got to keep the MANDATE AND HUUUUUUGE DEDUCTIBLES
There is NO ONE in Washington, DC, that my neighbors & I trust MORE than @realDonaldTrump now! YES!
HE'S EARNED IT! HE'S IN THIS FOR THE PEOPLE. A TRUE LEADER! I'M WITH HIM!
Right on 
@realDonaldTrump Seniors don't want Ryans back stabbing plan. We voted 4 repeal. Trump will lose 2020!
@Patriotvnvet @RepJeffDuncan Exactly Senator Paul! We want full repeal! #repeal 
Paul Ryan is one of the few actual constitutionalists left in Washington
LIEberal Troll.
thinking Rand Paul and typed Paul Ryan, brain fart
@PattyButts @RepJeffDuncan if @SpeakerRyan wrote it, it's a pile of . He is not a conservative bought & paid for to go against us
I agree wholeheartedly Senator Paul. We must reign in these RINO's. Force them to start with a clean repeal.
WE HAVE 2 START SOMEWHERE & THIS IS IT. BAD MESSAGE TO DEMS. PUT EGO AWAY & PASS IT!
Beginning to think Rand is the only R with a lick of common sense.
. I agree only certain few care about we the people.  #maga.
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal Fire Ryan
I don't acceptance Obamacare lite! I want full repealing Obamacare now! I want zero Obamacare now!
Non working healthy kids with kids, should learn responsibility by having to make co-pays.
next time tell the truth you promise to get nothing done that would be the truth same on republicans
Why do you all want to repeal Obamacare? It's a good building block. Take what's wrong with it and make it better.
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan exactly. Give us th bill you promised. Don't worry about perceptions. Rep take your black eye now.
Amen, Senator. The GOP can do better than that.
@Nenicho1211E @RepJeffDuncan If you R Clowns don't back this & Pass this,Trump will & should Destroy You All so it will Pass G'td
VOTE NO! THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WANT - READ OUR POSTS ON TRUMP'S FB PAGES MAIN ONE & STATE PAGES!
The Freedom Caucus is making us damn SORRY we elected a Republican. Get your act together! #MAGA
Hold strong. No separate deals with each state. No free health care for illegals. No plan 2 and 3
"WORDS&FREEDOM  MATTER" PLEASE VOTE NO FOR "TRUMPOCARE" @realDonaldTrump @CNNnewsroom @POLITICOMag
@hectormorenco @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal @POTUS NOT EVEN what we we're promised! NO NO NO!! Ryan/Pence untrustworthy.  REPEAL!!
Bill needs to be done right for all people and to really lower costs not what Dems did with ACA.
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal Agree 1000 percent! Keep Fighting!!!!!!!
DISUNITY is not from God but the enemy.I pray God's wisdom to fix #RepealAndReplace,UNITY of MIND
@hectormorenco @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal dont give in to ryancare. He's out to sink trump
@realDonaldTrump Should hang this failure around Paul RINO's neck and make Rand House Speaker.
@hectormorenco @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal Agreed! Not what we wanted!
@hectormorenco @RepJeffDuncan Senator Rand you are 100 pct right. @POTUS is pushing the wrong bill. Ryan care IS Obamacare
Senator Paul keep after these rhinos. they are not true Americans. just power mongers.
not another O care in a different dress & hair do full repeal & free market or nothing less u promised
Vote No...this is not going to work!!
I don't trust Ryan or the never trump republican that talked shit about him during his campaign
nothing is also not what you promised the http://people.You  have had 7 years-times up!
trumpNOcare is just a name for billions in tax cuts for the rich as the poor/older folks are shafted
you need to support the president. I think you just want to leave us with obamacare! 
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal 
I'm disappointed about repeal/replace...I don't want Obama care "LITE",  Try again!
If you think the majority voted for a #Libertarian if-you're-poor-go-fuck-yourself approach, then–respectfully, sir–read the room.
#Trump 
U should run for POTUS & change the bill. O right U did run & LOST.  Trying 2 disenfranchise trump voters?
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan , Better work together & get this AHCA passed! We Trump supporters are not hard right people!!
Don't pass hot garbage ! Repeal and Replace as promised! We trusted, we voted, we will vote again!
@sluggoD54 @RepJeffDuncan why doesn't pres realize Ryan is selling us snake oil?
I'm pretty sure he does. Trump's playing the long game.
@Jude_Eden @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal Not #FullRepeal but #FullBetrayal. Republicans that ran on it need to fall on it.
You must Have a replacement Healthcare Bill VOTED on be Repealing Obamacare or else Republicans will lose in 2018>
and when Democrats have control again you know they will put in a single payer healthcare plan>
Rand, Jeff and the rest of you Conservatives don't be stupid.
Am people agree w you
Repeal
Let free market take over
POTUS said repeal and replace. This is not it..put a stop to it NOW
@jeffkatzshow @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal
the day goverment gives pple what they wnt will be a day we'll all b free frm governmnt
Please Repeal in Totality!  Then replace.
Do you think a flat insurance tax would be better? So people pay proportional to their income?
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal  let the Obama care collepse and than redoe the healthcare tired of Democrats
market system!
We DO NOT want OBAMACARE LITE!
stand your ground 1)repeal 2) remove state lines 3) not necessarily replace. I want free market health care choice.
Fed ees/congress have huge ins pools from which to choose. Why can't everyone be included? Or a non-fed pool for ppl to join ?
@danrandolph10 @RepJeffDuncan Get over it Rand and support your President.
WE DESERVE BETTER! Full Repeal should have been ready 2 roll on jan 20! What a joke u all r.
hardly a surprise..been shining us on since 2010..
so why expect a change now?
@jizzi1 @RepJeffDuncan but it is a start! Work with it!
-It took 8 years to create ACA. It works for millions. The greedy insurance & drug co's are the problem. Keep it.
Reason voters can't everything we want in Phase 1 is b/c Senate nds 60 votes-but they'll still nd 60 for Phase 3 @RandPaul @TanyaBr62551176
Thank you Sen Paul for fighting against OCare lite. We want full repeal and govt out of HC
it's a MUCH better plan than ACA is! Get behind President Trump's health care plan!!
we must have healthcare for Autism, life long diseases as a nation certainly we have the heart & money for this health coverage.
the promise was "We're going to come up with a plan that has better healthcare for more people at lesser cost"
@jefflcohen @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal True but need to compromise in order to pass legislation. Need to make best deal we can
repeal Ryan!
We can do WAY better in both areas.  Repealing & Paul Ryan.
just avoid all this noise and move to single payer, it's inevitable and the best for the most people
Health Care has Never been a Conservative Idea. If we have to pass it to move on lets go. LETS GET TO TAX CUTS.!!!!
The only thing missing in the article was a plan for how to repeal and replace RyanO.
Ryan's wife was (is) a lobbyist for clients such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. She earned Millions with it.
No. She was last lobbyist 17yrs ago. Tax lawyer. Her employer Pricewaterhouse made millions. She's stay home mom
And no one was surprised!
ryan is a snake and liar repeal and replace him
Why does @mike_pence keep telling ppl its repeal & replace when truth is its just rearranged & renamed
because he's buddies w/Ryan. Both RINOs
USA HCA 100% access for 100% healthcare while reducing NATIONAL DEBT $i,000,000,000,000 in 5 years.
USA HCAccess plan to replace ACA is SILVER BULLET, keeps all promises. "Thepuppetrevolution@gmail.com"
So if you are this confident you have a better plan. Then publish it and let us see what you have.
I just gave your PAC some money. Obamacare was terrible and this plan is bad of a different type. Fix it.
Healthcare for ALL!!!
% agree!  Don't let this bill pass!  Illegals should not receive bennies!  Penalties remain in tact!  Ryan = LIAR.
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal REPEAL the "new" Obama/TrumpCare! Nix the political agenda! Thank you Duncan and Paul!!
Just repeal. Gov't doesn't belong in HC.
.@RandPaul @RepJeffDuncan
Current US state healthcare system is a bad, complex mess:

All you libertarians do is polish GOP shoes and we know what the GOP do=fuck the poor + basically nothing.
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan @POTUS is working trying to get the it fixed. You can't just repeal you have REPLACE work together
@RestoreHistory Dude, you're irrelevant. Flyover America disagrees with you. But I agree McCain is crazy
I don't want ryancare either or rinocare! REPEAL 100%
Is this true @SpeakerRyan?
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan you should have done this in private along time ago. Get this done and move onto tax reform
Full repeal.Severance packages for Medicare/SS recipients into their HSA, MSA, IRA, etc accounts. Politicians out !
Paul Rand, u need 2 get w/ the program. Many Dems voted 4Trump, NOT th REPUBs. Give us what U have.
no it's not!
Let's visit the fact that taxing citizens to fund HC is unconstitutional. No illegal aliens to get benefits. #MAGA
You did such a poor job at replacing. Why should I trust you can after you repeal??? #savemedicaid
Tucker Carlson's interview w/Steven Weissman Feb 21st.
instead of attacking each other how about working together
Mr. Paul Please include healthcare sharing in healthcare reform. & also ensure the 30% continuous coverage penalty does not apply. Thanks
So what is trump tumpeting about saying 12 people r now on board...that weren't?? What backstabbing liar got bought
SAy NO to Obamacare Lite! We need TOTAL REPEAL, that was promised!
Nor is it what we want. Repeal Ocare than BUTT THE HELL OUT OF OUR BUSINESS! SUPPORT & DEFEND is all
@freedomcaucus @RepJeffDuncan If that's true, then how come the changes the Freedom Caucus is asking for are fairly basic ones?
I don't care what it is, just get rid of the mandate
can we sneak adding "Pelosiesque" into the lexicon as part of the bill? That was pure wordsmithery!
But it is what trump promised; he ran on single payer
@PatVPeters @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal Paul Ryan is just doing what the Democrats are paying him to do.
We need this win! How do we get this done?
@SpeakerRyan @potus we must all work together as a team. Listen to everyone's input.if it make sense, then add it to the bill
U Reps keep acting like FOOLS and U will LOSE Hse & Sen nxt elect.  YOUR FAULT !  GROW UP
Tell POTUS to ask Angie how she provides excellent universal healthcare at 1/2 of what we spend. NO LOBBYISTS?
Seantor are you supporting this healthcare bill in its current form?
Keep on them Senator Paul!!
we cannot have ANY benefits for illegals. I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS HAS TO EVEN B SAID OR DISCUSSED/ARGUED
I would be happy with the health plan that all the gov officials have what you say? free health care 
you are now irrelevant  @GrrrGraphics @RepJeffDuncan Clarify that please you mean the establishment @GOP #draintheswamp
@GrrrGraphics @RepJeffDuncan
#StandWithRand

#HappyStPatricksDay
i dont like this paul ryan, he stinks. Get rid of him @RandPaul @RepJeffDuncan
What a set of snakes
1st problem with new healthcare bill is Paul Ryan!
@SenTedCruz Just introduce Amend requiring Congress to be included in Obamacare-Lite. GOP plan will die on its own.
I'm a progressive democratic - I think some of your health care ideas make much more sense than Ryan
Time to amend it to free up the markets and get this passed for those dying because of Ocare! no dorking around

Rand, you we're elected president.  Trump was.  Time for you to get with the program.
No it's not. But neither is whatever you're proposing: not that you've ever given details. Are you just a big mouth
Just repeal ACA & let the Chips fall where they may! Stop welfare & let the chips fall where they may!
#AHCA is a defining moment @realDonaldTrump owe American people to get this right @SpeakerRyan step 🖓
You are correct!
Of course not! He promised universal care:"Everyone will have care".
@NetworksManager @RepJeffDuncan #BringIn @RandPaul to write #HealthBill
get on board or get off the train and join your globalist comrades
@realDonaldTrump Medicaid mustgobacktoaStateControlStatesmustbeonestodecidedhowMedicaidspentNoFederalmandates
we need Rand Paul as speaker for the house
stealing healthcare so the rich get richer and Americans die, is not progress, its REGRESS.....
keep at it Rand, see the Pres again one on one determination!
EXACTLY! NO ocare-lite!! Get lyin fed out of my healthcare & my insurance! #DTS
.@RandPaul @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal Pass the law to lose the House
If you don't want to investigate trump just because he's a "fellow republican", maybe @SenJohnMcCain is right about you.
@SRGullickson @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal Irs Ryans version & hes an obamaite..
if it's not what President Trump wants, he won't sign it...that's what I heard him say.
@NickDeSenso @RepJeffDuncan @DailySignal No it is not. Why does Rachel Maddow's twin keep pushing it?
Paul Ryan is a neocon in a church suit. Draining the swamp should start with him.
keep standing for us!  Let the free market work.
Why even offer a Trump care. Let everyone pay for their own health and if can't afford it too bad. Isn't that your motto
