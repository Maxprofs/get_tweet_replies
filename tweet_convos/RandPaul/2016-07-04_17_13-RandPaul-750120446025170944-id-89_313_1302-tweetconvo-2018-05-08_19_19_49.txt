Why wouldn't you endorse Cruz and help us w/nightmare of Trump?
Why would he endorse a liberticide Christian zealot who pledged to go for another war in ME ?
Christian zealot? I'd rather fight radical Islam in ME than wait until it's here.
+ Rand & Ron are libertarian-leaning conservatives, makes no sense at all to endorse Cruz.
No because Trump's so much better for the Constitution right?
On abortion and gay rights, he is more likely to attract libertarians than Ted Cruz, yep' !
I like him okay but not enough to make him prez. Weak on foreign policy & military.
Total opposite, I like both Trump and Paul for their stance on military, dovish foreign policy, much better than HC.
Do you need to wear the shirt to remember your dad's name?
2020 man....get ready.
Chainsaws are *not* something that a surgeon should be using.

Chainsaw and shorts don't go together. Safety glasses should also be worn.
props for cutting down the tree. Even if you murdered that wedge more than you got murdered in the presidential primary.

I would like to see you, Dr. Rand Paul, as VP. You are a true Patriot. We love you.  Keep up the great work.
@alllibertynews @RandPaul Is he going with aliens to make up his "mind." IF he still has one.  Peace out. VA Lies; VETS Die.
Trump is a true American Patriot. What is the point of your comment?
What are U smoking or drinking? Comment was towards RandPaul & His "father" aliens abducted. Really?
Hum?
@DelegateIhle what kind of moron operates a chain saw in shorts?
@LucasGraham86 Love the shirt!!
@NoahhhBallard Great photo op. Real nice work boots you wore. Phoney.
I often do yard work in my old Ron Paul Revolution shirt from '08. Great minds...
after that stump gets cut flush don't pay more than $100 to grind it or you're getting robbed because of who you are.
Let the professionals handle that.  We can't afford to lose you to an unfortunate chainsaw accident.
NICE SHIRT
lol that's pretty funny
Would be more useful with a time machine. Just sayin'. #ChristmasinJuly
I'd like to see obama cut down a tree,he'd cut off his leg. Happy 4th
I'm wearing one of my Ron Paul tshirts today too! What could be more patriotic?
A tree-hugger will hate you for that Rand.
I would have guessed he used a sledgehammer to take down that tree. I can do a better job than that!
Of course I am
If the tree is a Democratic tree please dig the roots out!

Thanks. Hope the same for you.
Nice shirt.
