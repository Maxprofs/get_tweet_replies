@evan2048 @Nigel_Farage @RepThomasMassie HAHAHAHA Nigel Farage with #Liberty in the same sentence.  That's a hilarious joke.
Farage is awesome. The best the Brits have
he's an authoritarian who's reasoning to leave brexit was all cultural and anti immigrant
Independence Day Tyler. Don't hate on Farage he's an ally
As others cuck,Farage is one of the foremost defenders of western civilization.
belief in libertarian values of open borders & free trade doesnt make u a cuck
open borders is not a libertarian value
Nigel farage is pretty far away from anything remotely close to libertarian
Is Rand meeting with @realDonaldTrump anytime soon?
Dr. Paul, please sir, I beg you, to the barber. I would even pay for it.
@rambousekf @adamjhannah wtf wtf wtfffffffffff

Useful @NigelFarage, if you are in a photo with him, you must be highly suspect.
@daveweigel @Nigel_Farage @RepThomasMassie Farage is one of the most despicable individuals on the planet.
gross
you dress yourself, Rand? Think carefully before answering, confirmation and denial both have unfortunate implications
get a hair cut =) @daveweigel @Nigel_Farage @RepThomasMassie
