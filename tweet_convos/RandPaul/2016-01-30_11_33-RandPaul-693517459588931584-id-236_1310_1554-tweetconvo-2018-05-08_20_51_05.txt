@RandPaul @tedcruz Paul if you guys were smart, you would united against the establishment and put aside your egos. #WakeUpAmerica!
@iMaGiNeprints @RandPaul @tedcruz Supported Cruz until he showed his true colors. The only genuine candidate is Rand. Not voting for Sachs..
@Lebronatron @RandPaul @tedcruz Cruz has always shown his true colors. Wishing you a continued 'blissful' life.
@iMaGiNeprints @Lebronatron @RandPaul @tedcruz Cruz is a sociopath and a liar
@JshHardy @Lebronatron @RandPaul @tedcruz Amazing, you must be ignorant of facts, won many cases in front of the SCOTUS. What has Paul done?
@iMaGiNeprints @JshHardy @Lebronatron @RandPaul @tedcruz
@freedom3556 @JshHardy @Lebronatron @RandPaul @tedcruz Check your facts, you are wrong. Cruz has stood UP for our Constitution all his life.
@iMaGiNeprints @JshHardy @Lebronatron @RandPaul @tedcruz
@RandPaul @tedcruz shameful is your endorsement of Mitch McConnel
@jenabeelondon @RandPaul @tedcruz Don't forget Ted Cruz voted for Mitch McConnell for Senate Majority leader!
@JustinSzew309 @jenabeelondon @RandPaul @tedcruz It was unanimous! At least Cruz didn't endorse him. Rand is desperate. Clearly.
@Kerugma @jenabeelondon @RandPaul @tedcruz lol giving Cruz a pass for voting for Mitch but ripping Rand.  Makes you look foolish
@JustinSzew309 @jenabeelondon @RandPaul @tedcruz Who challenged McConnell? Who else to vote for? Nuff said. Rand endorsed in senate race.
@Kerugma @jenabeelondon @RandPaul @tedcruz Rand endorsed before Bevin decided to run against him...who else to vote for? Nuff said.
@JustinSzew309 @jenabeelondon @RandPaul @tedcruz Endorsing and voting is not the same. Do you know the difference between them?
@Kerugma @jenabeelondon @RandPaul @tedcruz Don't forget Ben Carson endorsed Rand Paul!  Yet he's running for president right now. (2/2)
@RandPaul maybe don't post the recipient's mailing address?
@RINOPundit @RandPaul She posted it first. It's all over the Internet.
@SahmHello @RandPaul should've blurred the address. Full stop.
@RINOPundit @RandPaul Yes, she should have before she posted to the Internet. Which everyone who has it can now see all over the World.
@SahmHello I meant @RandPaul should've blurred it. Initial poster took it down because the address was visible.
@RINOPundit @RandPaul I've see it everywhere already, on numerous posts that had nothing to do with Rand. So, it really doesn't matter now.
@SahmHello Rand Paul, champion of privacy rights, posts someone's mailing address.

Go be stupid somewhere else.
@RINOPundit @SahmHello Privacy? Since when is twitter private?
@RandPaul @tedcruz Is this really a good time to attack Ted when he's the only thing standing between the US and totalitarian populism?
@RandPaul @fpatterson1050 @tedcruz come on Rand!  You are better than that!
@Back2OurFoundrs @RandPaul @tedcruz  Order of most missed votes: Harry Reid, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz.
@RandPaul @go4marshall @tedcruz  '

@RandPaul @tedcruz Rubio did the SAME! NO ONE in MSM/FOX reported it!! http://time.com/4201580/marco-rubio-iowa-mailer/ … VOTER SHAMING by Rubio crew TOO!
@TIO2X13 @RandPaul @tedcruz News seems to be picking winner & losers; can't respond to New Yorker shame ltr inaccuracies,; Red journalism?
@RandPaul @Patriotic_Me @tedcruz Embarrassment is the Secretary of State having to debunk it.
@randpaul @tedcruz Well said, Ted, urging #IOWAPrimary #NewHampshire Christian voters to "pull back from the Abyss. Trump is heading over it
@RandPaul @tedcruz odd strategy I learned about @Morning_Joe
@RandPaul @tedcruz Please dont go down the personal attack road.  Be nice, be original and honest and you have my vote.
@Tyberious @RandPaul @tedcruz hypocrisy is being tea party and then backing Mitch over Bevin, but still like your policies
@TDKYRay @Tyberious @RandPaul @tedcruz #standwithrand
@aaronmg412 @Tyberious @RandPaul @tedcruz I stand corrected, even though I still have problems with Mitch.
@TDKYRay @aaronmg412 @Tyberious @RandPaul @tedcruz I think we all have problems with Mitch.
The rest of the world is alarmed that a majority of US #GOP voters may be dumb enough to elect DTrump @randpaul @tedcruz @johnbarronusa @pbs
@RandPaul @tedcruz You might want to black out the address on the envelope? That is pretty shameful! Other candidates are doing this BTW!
@RandPaul @hillarysusans @tedcruz Sec of St Iowa says not from Cruz campaign .  Remove erroneous tweet
@PeggyODL @RandPaul @hillarysusans @tedcruz I guess it was OK when Joni Ernst did it.
@sirvitup  The Iowa Sec of State has determined they were NOT sent from Cruz campaign
@PeggyODL Evidence of that ?  Is there a link?
@sirvitup yes trying to figure out how to copy it to you
@RandPaul @tedcruz Ted was coming back to vote, but was told they would still be 7 votes short. Did townhall instead
@RandPaul @tedcruz #IowaCaucus #FoxNews Ted is  traditional dirty corrupt career politician Wall Street bough & sold
@RandPaul @tedcruz Iowa voter outraged at Cruz tactic says: “That’s what you call a bully, I wish he would quit.” Well said. Cruz is a bully
@RandPaul @tedcruz hypocrisy is not criticizing those candidates that sent out very similar mailers in 2012.
@RandPaul @tedcruz Rand Paul will make a great counter balance to President @realDonaldTrump .
@randpaul These deceptive @tedcruz “voting violation” notices are fraudulent fake-official garbage. What would he do as president?!
@RandPaul @tedcruz you should be only going after Hillary and Bernie instead of other Republicans Rand! Looks like your a atypical looser!
@RandPaul @tedcruz This seems borderline illegal. To send something in form of violation with a threat of a "notice" if you dont comply..
@RandPaul @JaredLeSage The campaign need not have ended; should not have ended...
@RandPaul @tedcruz @curtismuddog His is a miserable fraud. Too bad we get what we vote for. Just like we got Obama, ..twice
@RandPaul @tedcruz Paul if you guys were smart, you would united against the establishment and put aside your egos. #ATimeForTruth!
@iMaGiNeprints @RandPaul @tedcruz they both know politics is a contact sport. In the end they are pretty aligned this is politics.
@RandPaul @Bonfiredesigns @tedcruz Cruz is just another puppet of the few. The majority wants @realDonaldTrump I am sick of politicians 
@RandPaul @tedcruz wow creepy. Nothing like bad promotion to feel like more gov. overreach. Fear's not a good motivator.
@RandPaul @tedcruz Among 500 other reasons why I'm supporting Trump.
@RandPaul @tedcruz #TRUMPTYDUMPTY
.@RandPaul it would be nice if your staffers could remove his address & RT this back out~@tedcruz
@TracyJeffords @RandPaul @tedcruz The individual who received this put it on the internet himself.
@RandPaul Shut up. That vote was lopsided against. No point. Just theater. Ted sponsored the bill.
@PROUDofTEXAS What bill! You're a perfect example of lunacy. This is about @tedcruz shaming voters that did not caucus last time! @RandPaul
@vietnammongoose @tedcruz @RandPaul I was right.
@RandPaul This is why the fake @tedcruz supports NSA spying. He collects data that's useful for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. #IowaCaucus
@LibertyDisciple @RandPaul No wonder!  Trust the gut. >>> @tedcruz sucks.
@RandPaul @tedcruz And what would he/his people do as POTUS?
@RandPaul @tedcruz A lesson from @glennbeck spreading fake information as Beck has done on several occasions in the past month.
@PittsSteeler @RandPaul @tedcruz @glennbeck It's not fake. Cruz's campaign admitted to sending these out. #Fact
@SahmHello @RandPaul @tedcruz @glennbeck The information is fake meant the scare voters into voting for the #Canadian
@RandPaul Thank you for your effort. As a retired ICU RN I respect who you are as a professional/what you stand for. Upholding constitution

@RandPaul @tedcruz I don't no what's more of a shame. u supporting McConnell in his primary?? I can see u backing trump.  Sellout
@RandPaul @tedcruz Ted Cruz is a liar and a hypocrite. Why should an American vote for ted
@RandPaul @tedcruz shame Lowa now and the country with him as a President, say no to Cruz!!
@RandPaul @tedcruz Cruz is a bought man, all you will get out of Cruz is what we have now,MakeAmericaGreatAgain!!Trump!!
@RandPaul @tedcruz real classy Rand.;-/
@RandPaul @tedcruz Paul it was not going to pass anyway and you know it.  You are the one slinging political bullshit
@RandPaul @tedcruz Cruz is the LAST person I would vote for. He is dishonest & would be least likely to get anything constructive done.
@RandPaul @tedcruz Ted's vote would not have made a difference. U needed 6 more. Huge difference vs #IowaCaucus
@RandPaul @tedcruz
@SheilaInCT Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, with hillary in the wings are
@RandPaul @tedcruz Watch it Rand, you may not be on President Ted Cruz's cabinet if you keep playing ugly. Cruz 2016!
@RandPaul @tedcruz just give it up Rand, much like Sen. Rubio, it isn't your time.  The desperation you both seek POTUS with is revealing

@RandPaul @tedcruz For once, I actually like something @RandPaul said. It wasn't a bunch of bitching & whining, he is right about @tedcruz
@RandPaul @tedcruz This was done in 2008, 2004 and nothing was said. WOW... WakeUp Paul and join conservatives instead of being against.
@RandPaul @tedcruz Ted isn't your enemy- you are usually on the same side. Focus on Hillary and Bernie- the real threat to American freedom!
@RandPaul @TrumpMyPres @tedcruz Trump
@RandPaul @signoftria @tedcruz are you kidding me they actually have a voting report card!! What a joke
@RandPaul @2ward4ward @tedcruz Wow. That letter is outrageous! Is Cruz really mailing these 2 people? This will only turn folks against him.
@Upholding_Truth @RandPaul @tedcruz Yup typical #Cruz 'whatever' it takes #politics
@RandPaul @tedcruz and who are you trying to shame, Rand?
@RandPaul @healthandcents @tedcruz Sheesh Rand.....delete this!!! You have the address. See why we object to any access to our information?
@tthompie that person posted it first, so they waived reasonable expectation
@nickyahogan An compound error. No one accountable. No problem.
@RandPaul @@tedcruz Just like DT, we're still waiting 2 find out what Paul stands 4 (other than NSA) He's been battering Cruz from day 1
@RandPaul @2ward4ward @tedcruz  Rand Paul getting on the action now Your better than the other 2 Senators. heir sell outs. I'm for Huck!
@RandPaul look I like you but you have no chance against Trumpster Ted does attack trump not Cruz
@RandPaul @PJStrikeForce @tedcruz  Voter Intimidation is so wrong in so many ways.  Abusing public info will NOT get ppl to register to vote
@RandPaul @RickCanton @tedcruz what's the matter Rand r u 2 afraid to criticize trump? Is that y u keep exaggerating about Cruz.
@RandPaul @MarshallFSmith @tedcruz  TOo bad you didn't think of it Paul
@RandPaul @tedcruz It's truly disgusting.
@RandPaul @MiaCMitch @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Senor Cruz is using Voter Suppression tricks 2 STOP voter turn out! DISQUALIFY Senor Cruz NOW
@RandPaul @tedcruz McCain Campaign Treachery SteveSchimdt NicoleWallace even wrote books about it, help make a HBO movie, now r with MSM
@RandPaul @tedcruz Not very bright if you believe Ted Cruz personally did this. I would look within the campaign. McCain/Romney Treachery?
@RandPaul @tedcruz Vermont Republicans aren't Stupid Back Sanders because he's not going to take your guns #IowaCaucus personalattacks=FTB
@RandPaul @tedcruz Wow, Cruz must be desperate. Looks like a pretty creepy invasion of privacy...much like the NSA.
@RandPaul @valsocal @tedcruz little bit of a skeeze factor going on lately?
@valsocal @RandPaul @tedcruz It's desperation. The pundits were right. When election day nears people see one's true colors.
@RandPaul @tedcruz They send these report cards out for all the candidates in Iowa. Don't attack Cruz for it.
@RandPaul @tedcruz these people are sick and evil. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@RandPaul @ThePatriot143 @tedcruz Reminds me of a communist country!
@RandPaul @DaveosaurusText @tedcruz
@RandPaul @tedcruz He was out campaigning Rand. You are so disingenuous. I've lost respect for you.
@RandPaul @SECPrimary @tedcruz The depths u people will sink to is staggering! U shame white voters in2 voting but you suppress black voters
@RandPaul @tedcruz I agree...something very slimy and creepy about Cruz
@RandPaul @tedcruz It's on CNN. Cruz says he will not apologize. Secretary of State of Iowa, Paul Pate says it's a false representation...
@luvinlife1967 @RandPaul @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump
CRUZ is a nasty guy!

Nobody better at dividing & blaming than Ted!

A REAL POLITICIAN!
@1sonny12 @RandPaul @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Yes, but I think he is worse, he followed Obama's way of embarrassing Iowan voters. It's evil.
@RandPaul @tedcruz that bill was going to be defeated. Another symbolic vote. Cruz' vote was meaningless, pointless to go back to DC for it
@RandPaul @tedcruz Wow! I saw the Secretary of state response, I was wondering what the mailing was. This is indeed designed to scare.
@RandPaul @girl_iowagirl20 @tedcruz STUPID move on Cruz's part. But WORSE is your NASTY DISHONESTY about him. Losing +respect for you by day
@RandPaul @ThePatriot143 @tedcruz Rand, you LOSE and talking sh*t on the successful candidates does not make you a winner, it makes you sour
@RandPaul @ThePatriot143 @tedcruz Looks like every Rand supporter re-tweeted this message.
@RandPaul @ThePatriot143 @tedcruz That right there would make me MOT vote for Cruz! They need to hang his TITHING record on his door!
@RandPaul I had to block one of his supporters for trying to "public shame" me for tweeting what she deemed unhelpful, I guess, about Cruz.
@RandPaul Apparently a few of my other followers are experiencing the same problem. I believe Trump about no one liking him once they know
You are starting to loose my 2nd place support @RandPaul by attacking @TedCruz knowing full well he supports auditing the fed.
@RandPaul @RestoreHistory Did @tedcruz break another RNC rule? 2 strikes
Yo @tedcruz, why are you sending this crap? Admit you're wrong and move on. @RandPaul is trusted, has the high ground.
@RandPaul @tedcruz People I know you are disappointed in @tedcruz, but blaming Rand won't help. http://time.com/4201323/ted-cruz-mailer-iowa/ …
@RandPaul @AlexisinNH @tedcruz I still am a bit confused why we keep trying to get disinterested, stump-dumb people to vote.

.@RandPaul. Is it worse than endorsing Mitch McConnell like U?
Nope.  You lose. 
I trust Ted
@noprezzie2012 @RandPaul Paul endorsed McConnell before Bevin was in the race and Bevin endorsed Paul. You make no sense.
Kinda convenient for Paul...eh? @jonwaters0288 @randpaul 
He knew...and didn't want to lose McConnell's embrace.  Gross.
@noprezzie2012 @RandPaul so you are saying Paul should have endorsed McConnell's Democrat Challenger? You can't have it both ways.
Oh Puhleeze.  Refresh your memory with the video.  He's an establishment boy. @jonwaters0288
@noprezzie2012 like I said. He endorsed McConnell before he had a challenger in the race. His challenger now endorses Rand......
@RandPaul @tedcruz this is a shame
@RandPaul @TWTHEREDDRAGON @tedcruz sometimes we don't like the candidates, but there's no refresh button either.
@RandPaul @PaulaFeese @tedcruz typical dirty politician don't be fooled Iowans he's not holy he's sneaky. Save USA Trump!

@RandPaul @tedcruz you two used to be my only two republican options, now only you are Rand.
@Onderdonkyo this is twitter. fuck commas. I need as much space as possible

Don't lose it over great marketing @RandPaul it is great! @tedcruz @SenTedCruz GO CRUZ 2016.
@RandPaul @tedcruz Slimy move: "For he is like one who is inwardly calculating...his heart is not with you." Pr 23:7
@RandPaul @tedcruz He need to go back to Canada and run as the Prime Minister
@RandPaul @JonPlank @tedcruz In defense, He said he knew there was not enough votes. May be just an excuse???   http://www.glennbeck.com/2016/01/13/from-the-horses-mouth-why-ted-cruz-missed-audit-the-fed-vote/ …
@RandPaul @tedcruz The #AudittheFed was DOA even with Ted you still lose by 6! He's better off beating Trump & Dems so we can audit it. Duh!
@RandPaul @tedcruz May God bless Ted Cruz and you too Mr Paul.
@RandPaul @TedCruz #Iowacaucus #AudittheFed Doctor Paul - Hypocrisy IS Mr. Cruz. Period.
@RandPaul @tedcruz WHOS IN CHARGE HERe?
@RandPaul @tedcruz That is unbelievable. Almost as sinister as LA Raza sending me instructions on how to vote as an illegal citizen. 
Bid difference in not voting in election vs missing a bill w/ no chance to pass or be signed into law? @RandPaul @tedcruz #NoToRand #Iowa
@RandPaul @tedcruz Recent news: Flyers did not come from Cruz. We still don't know the source yet.
@RandPaul @tedcruz oh, shut up Rand. It's over for you. Go home.
@RandPaul @tedcruz Could have saved a lot of money if they just went to a Federal Pen and picked any smooth talking white collar inmate.
@RandPaul @Patriotic_Me @tedcruz Confusion caused by a desperate move
@Patriotic_Me @_HankRearden @ASerignese Sec of State n IA just nailed him 4 phony report card mailer. Meanwhile Cruzbots ignore the fact.
@RandPaul @tedcruz Base. Common. You'd think a man running for the Presidency would be above such methods. Not liking this side of Cruz.
@RandPaul @tedcruz hmmm what happened to anonymity at the polls???
@RandPaul @DMashak @tedcruz Wasn't a fan of Ted's excuse for missing the Loretta Lynch vote among others.
@RandPaul @DMashak @tedcruz Sad thing is think @marcorubio is doing it also. All politics, all the time. Just like Obama!
@ringod01 @DMashak @RandPaul @tedcruz @marcorubio Actually, Marco isn't. That strictly an Obama/Cruz thing. Rubio voted FOR audit
@RandPaul hypocrisy is missing 247% more votes than the median, then attacking colleagues for missing votes.
@Dr_Texan @RandPaul Cruz missed over 20% and Rubio around 25%.  So it's not even close.  4% is much less than 20%
@Brendan_Noble Paul misses more votes than most in the senate, so Pot/Kettle situation. Citizens missing biennial votes is a bigger deal.
@RandPaul @krom1781 @tedcruz https://twitter.com/LiberalsBoreMe/status/693519746134704128 …
@RandPaul Are you sure @tedcruz is responsible for this? His supporters are saying Rubio is responsible.
@krom1781 @RandPaul @tedcruz the Cruz campaign confirmed it was from them according to @politico
@RandPaul @DMashak @tedcruz Go Away,Fly! If U DONT VOTE, you should be ashamed! You didnt say anything when JONI ERNST did it! Why is that?
@RandPaul Come on Rand, you can do better than tilting at windmills. @TedCruz's vote would have made no difference to that. @josephdavis9143
@RandPaul @tedcruz  Hey Ted - Brilliant idea -- You sure know how to get voters to vote for you -- NOT #noonelikesyouted
@RandPaul @tedcruz one more thoughts  #defeatthewashingmachine said the #blender

@RandPaul @tedcruz Donald Trumps weakness is his "shrimp fingers" short fingered Trump. @realDonaldTrump roght?
@RandPaul Maybe if you hadn't tried to embarrass him during his #DefundObamacare filibuster, he wd have showed up for your AuditTheFed vote.
@RandPaul @tradethecycles @tedcruz Great Point! Ted you're records not much better

@RandPaul  good job privacy boy posting guys address, quit whining about audit the fed it would've never passed anyway #IStandAgainstRand
@RandPaul @tedcruz Excellent way to "get out the vote" for the other guy!
@RandPaul hypocrisy is endorsing Mitch McConnell the problem in DC that @tedcruz doesn't get along with.
@RandPaul @tedcruz  Wow so this is to guilt trip people into going to vote by calling them out..and then vote for Cruz? That's pretty dirty.
@RandPaul @tedcruz petty.  GO get 60 votes.
@RandPaul do you know the difference between a vote that would not be signed by Obama and a vote for President?
@RandPaul @tedcruz Yeah, bad call, Teddy. Very Obama-ish. Just one more reason the liberty vote will stay with the Paul family.
@RandPaul @tedcruz brother, i support you, but i think you need to get over that
@RandPaul @tedcruz This mailing is a very big mistake.  I thought more of you. It has occurred just as Rubio via @FoxNews is attacking you.
