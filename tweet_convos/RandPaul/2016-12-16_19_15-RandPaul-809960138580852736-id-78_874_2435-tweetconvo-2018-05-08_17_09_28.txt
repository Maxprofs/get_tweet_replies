damn! We were told rump was picking Joey buttafuoco for that!
You will watch quietly as spending increases and massive tax cuts for the wealthy. Enjoy! 
the wealthy should have tax cuts & so should everyone else who pays taxes
Yes, the wealthy have struggled the last 30 years. It's time for the system to work for them!
...the more money they have the more they do with that $. They don't keep it under a mattress u know.
Trickle on down! 
well what do u think the wealthy do with their money?
The lower n middle class spend nearly every penny (direct stimulus).  Wealthy, save, often overseas. Don't change spending
actually they invest, which is effectively spending money. it goes into the economy.
