It's not, really. Did you listen to Dir. Comey today?
[sarcasm] No outrage?  Matt, you may be right.  Sen Paul prolly didnt bother to listen and repeated others.[/sarcasm]
Your convoluted wording aside, you fail to note that Dir. Comey gave, repeatedly, sound logic for his recommendation.

@RandPaul
I agree w this meme..but ONLY bc Clintons are held to a different standard. #Trump has how many lawsuits? @NotMattShaw @StarsBear @RandPaul
I keep hearing the “different standard” line. What does it mean? How are the standards different?

@starsbear @randpaul
Trump is accused of fraud,rape etc.Yet the media says nothing.Clinton did nothing illegal yet is castrated @NotMattShaw @StarsBear @RandPaul
“Castrated” is probably the wrong word there. Also: Trump hasn’t been convicted, either, and…

@starsbear @randpaul
..such requirement. In fact NO prosecutor agrees with Comey at this point. He invented a standard for Hillary.
If James Comey can't or won't do his job, he should be relieved of his position
What job didn't Dir. Comey do?

@RandPaul
She broke the law, ignorance is not an excuse, Hillary is not above the law, & she put lives in danger
You’re not answering the question. What didn’t Dir. Comey do?

@randpaul
Sheeh, She committed several crimes, the FBI investigated and Comey didn't recommend to prosecute her
Did you watch Dir. Comey’s testimony before Congress?
@alllibertynews Many with authority engage in misconduct @DebiUnruh #freedanielholtzclaw

Now? They've had their own sets of laws for years.

THE FIX IS ON!
@TheJusticeDept Ponzi scheming criminal unaudited Fed rep @HillaryClinton walks into a bar looking for @SenSanders endorsement...
see you in hell Hillary! I have email confirmation you're going there.
Thanks for sharing that update - it's now live here: http://rbl.ms/29ztuyb 
@Jake_Witmer The DOJ is in bed with Clintons along with the FBI and media. Congress is useless. THERE'S NO ONE TO TELL.
@alllibertynews sneaky way to ask for Money
U must be following Charles Ortel's work http://WWW.CHARLESORTEL.COM  Lessig makes GREAT points in "Republic,Lost" on corruption-HELP
It's a waste of time.The DOJ knows this but they don't care.These are revolutionaries who are in charge. #trump
@MelBchREALTOR. THANK GOD NOT FOR LONG !!! GO TRUMP PENCE
And sadly, they know it! That is why the corruption never stops with them!!!
this is so true if she wasn't Hillary Clinton she wouldn't get away with the stuff she has done
#thanks for sharing about Hillary, have a great Tuesday :)
.@RandPaul - AND we must ALL vote TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT - not divide votes (which helps Hillary win)
#Trump2016
.
@Jim_Peoples_ investigate them both !
Keep fighting for this, we need this. If she gets in we are doomed. GoodBye2constitution. Hello2Tyranny #stillranding #randgirl
The only way anything happens if the ENTIRE GOP gets behind Trump. Which is not happening due to big baby EGOS.
@alllibertynews seem the same in Canada
I must say Rand is perhaps my fave republican but I disagree, exceptions for the exceptional VOTE HILLARY 2016
I LOVE how you are the ONLY one who is paying attention to the REAL issue at hand. Love you Dr. Paul #Stillranding
#StandWithRand #UnSuspend #PresidentPaul2016
@alllibertynews Sadly the #DOJ is just as corrupt. #truthmatters Where's #Justice ?
Citizens don't C DOJ/FBI credible, if issues not swiftly handled legitimately/equitably, compliance 2 their authority N jeopardy
@Eyes_of_justice #RiseUp #AmericanRevolution #JoinTheFight #AgainstPoliticalCorruption #AgainstCorruptGovt #AgainstCorruptAGLynch
there was nothing to prosecute her on. get it through your thick skull.
@alllibertynews 
One set for the wealthy and their thugs, and one set for everyone else.
@RandPaul
yeah if I did this in my job, my career would be fit for the gallows and I'd be in jail *shakes head*
Come help Rand tell them Hillarys not above the law America we cannot have another career criminal in WH say no plz thxs #SWR
@barb49_c   Obama Law !!!
@TamraTellsIt Please speak out against Civil Asset Forfeiture that deprives many of due process. There are reasons ppl are angry.
I wonder if @peterdaou still thinks #Hillary is a good choice.
Black Lives Matter, Muslims, New Black Panthers, LGTB, and such fall under the Clinton set of laws.
uncle Steve says why?Obama's DOJ is OUTSIDE the law!!!! The current DC RULERS MUST GO!!! Lest WETHEPEOPLE be ENSLAVED! FollowLEARN
Show us
- and what about the chapter 11 reorganization referred to as bankrupt? Common practice acquired co's
http://ow.ly/rIyV3025zrF  for Clinton Foundation 100% fraudulent
don't know why we are surprised - could have saved the year long research
yes we demand Justice
@matthius98 And one more for Petraeus
where was your voice when Bush destroyed America.
I wish you hadn't given up the run...Will you try again?
Is there a petition the American people can sign 4 an investigation n2 the AG & both of the Clinton'sAll 3 seem 2 b holding 
@realDonaldTrump please RT we need action on #BLM violence! This appears to be gathering steam http://petitions.whitehouse.gov//petition/form …
DOJ is bought and sold like most of the US SAD our country is DYING!
agreed but we must take on election fraud
;  Whistle blowers are really screwed as far as rights go.
Our Corrupt Pm Cameron made his own laws to protect himself after lying in court, tax (cont) http://tl.gd/n_1sosjcg 
..again, another poster slogan for fascism. negativism is all you have?
she is sending out good signals to the world!!
I hope you and your peers don't sit idly by and let this travesty remain as is?
Hey Rand! Stop using our SS+Medicare money on your stupid investigations! You damn fools waste our money+Do Nothing!leaveHRCalone!
and one for you...
@RandStudents Senator,what am I signing?
I feel if the millions spent on these investigations had been put towards education we might have produced better future leaders.
I'll take thinking over feelings.
What Law was broken, and how ?
@TeaPartyExpress GOP is an outrage. DO YOUR JOB
she is not above the law. But she is accounting. Crooked. And a. Liar
@TeaPartyExpress Good to hear from Rand. Wondered where he'd gone. Dont always agree but he's a great Senator. Need his leadership
Time to recognize communists kicked out of USSR have been embraced by Dems.
@Patriotic_Me
We've long known about the two sets of laws. In regard to being a Senator, you too Rand, fit into one. The real '?' is which one
RT
@Patriotic_Me lawlessness begets lawlessness. Respect for law is either universal or it's not.
@Patriotic_Me .I'm hoping we prosecute Blair. No one should be above the law
nothing new it's always been that way. This is why she can't be president.
unfortunately she is above the law that's why like him or not Trump must win
.@RandPaul Tag @TheJusticeDept - prosecute her!
 You really had an opportunity, Rand & you faltered. Now we have Clinton & Trump. Johnson isn't that great either. #Disappointed
don't forget the police, they can murder you and never face real justice.
This corrupt woman deserves to suffer for her transgressions. #OffWithHerHead #HillaryAntoinette
@PattiBerry31666 This in itself is a crime on the Rule of law!!! Congressional Hearings should be held on Comet, lynch,HillaryBill
.@RandPaul I hope you will be involved w/ @realDonaldTrump in some capacity. Will you be attending the Convention Senator? #MAGA #Trump
I thought you were above the rhetoric.
#usa's elite is above the law. As are cops. 
Pseudo#democracy
@TheVoiceOfPaulR there have always been two sets of laws one for regular people and one for people of great wealth and influence
Some of the emails were retroactively classified. Another GOP witch hunt. How many taxpayer dollars are being wasted on this?

how can anyone vote they need more investigation into Hillary since its proven she did it. Have her under oath and recorded.
more tiresome BS from the GOP.
stop the partisan political BS. The FBI did their jobs. The Director has a long history of integrity. I believe FBI over you.
@easkelson she pwned the DOJ
tell DOJ @LorettaLynch #Bush is not above the law as well - #warcrimes #torture #NurembergPrinciples
@sabine_durden Pressure was exerted,whether Comey wants to admit or not.He's also very political in a self-promoting way like this
that will never happen!  Hill & Bill get away with it all. Discusting
THATS IT! I've had it! I'm changing my last name to Clinton and gonna run a muck!
please make it #Right
@alllibertynews so really 4 sets because different laws for blacks and whites too... Or at least different punishments
@Hiking586 The US truly has become a #BananaRepublic where #CorruptPoliticians are above the Law & rule the Nation for "Donors"
Tell who? Lynch? Comey? Obama? You were elected to deal with it!
Clinton is the most despicable person who even ran 4 potus. Lying, untrustful, murderer. ISIS ppl have better than her. USS SHAME
@P0TUSTrump Was Dr. Paul speaking to me. I think the DOJ might listen to ohhh mabey a US senator 5 years in. A guy named Ron.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul
this thing with the Clinton's didn't just start here in the past year or two - they've been above the law for a long time.
@P0TUSTrump If HRC gets away w/this email mess, & lying about it, it'll bring her down anyway b'cuz smart people won't vote 4 her.
@P0TUSTrump I fully agree...
@Nolamagee and one for those more sophisticated than KILLERY.
DOJ will be busy investigating police for the foreseeable future. They will not mess with federal govt Except the military
I don't like Hillary Clinton but you are a fool! Learn the law and learn the legal standards. Until you do, just be quiet!
agreed, but that also goes for Congress. Congress actually goes beyond the political elite and actually  exempts itself from laws.
@tommyshida U have to ask :What do they have on everyone?
Boo Hoo  Do you really believe the Secretary of State had criminal intent. Be serious! You sound ridiculous.
and another set for Obummer....the lawless current administration has cost this country any respect it use to have.
you are a #LibertarianFraud. Shut up and fight for a spot in line to kiss #TrumpAnus.
hasnt it always been that way with them !!
@tommyshida you are a senator. Do you really need Twitter people to do your fucking job?
@lisawls Everyone is equal. Someone is more equal than the others.
Rand Paul for SCOTUS!!!
why don't you tell me what average citizens can do legally to end this government of criminals?
@AlexisinNH What is the worst about Hillary, she never created a job that was not paid for by taxpayers or corruption.
#NotFit
Please #UnSuspend & give us #PresidentPaul2016 as We #StandWithRand to save US. Lesser of 2 evils in 2016 still evil & 2020 2 L8.
@catoletters She IS above the law; that's the unmistakable conclusion of the FBI; she broke the law, but won' be held accountable.
I think you mean one for Republicans and one for the average person.
I would sign your petition except... I don't want to donate to your campaign.
Any military person with a clearance will tell you efforts to circumvent security protocols is a crime.
what are your views on the recent killings of African American men by police in New Orleans and Minnesota?
like I said earlier if Clinton gets away with this how can any judge prosecute any crime in this country The law has no meaning
No it's, not, and she isn't. The law is under her. You're in congress, clarify the law.
Drop dead Rand Paul
#AverageAmericans who follow the law r #outraged There are lots of #criminals who have #nointent #bullshitcall
I think Comey feared for his life like 50+ others who crossed her path . . Evil . . The Whore if The Earth
@govtstheproblem Too late. Congress did not do enough.
@RandPaul
why should we waste our time telling DOJ. Thats your job.Why did we send you people to DC your unable to get anything done??
a link to your website to donate is not a petition rand...
Bill was impeached 4 perjury & obstruction of justice, but Hillary's allowed to run for president. We've come full circle.
I'd side with the FBI director all day every day. #termlimits
@KansasGOP gop goverment is very sad people keep talking about clinton email is getting old
why should anyone obey their laws...we are free...
justice in America is officially a joke.  Corrupt..... @FBI  @LorettaLynch @TheJusticeDept #pssstmeetmeonthetarmac
@DavidGoodfriend 'respect @JamesComeyFBI ruling'.  Hilarious !
https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/07/fifteen-secret-warrants-in-force-granting-bulk-data-collection-in-the-uk …
she isn't, GOP needs to be INVESTIGATED...... Look out
There are many elites that will never answer to the laws.
@ScotiaBuck ....give it up....no one cares that you are outraged....focus your outrage on your racist nation and make some changes
seems like intent is only important with the clintons. #defineSex
let's be honest, three sets of rules, the Clinton rules, the elected official rules and the rest of us
@RandPaul
NO
Prosecute her for what?
isn't that what we have congress for?  Checks & Balances..oh wait, it's probably not the right move if running for reelection
James Comey was ok Hillary has put a lot of good people n harm's way her dishonest narrative & lying to the public disgraceful
Americans must now live in fear of their government, the socialist are in full control & will protect the governing elite
Thank you, where have you been? Havent seen you in awhile. I was hopping you would pop up. We need to hear from you all.
This is all adjutation  propaganda. #weareconcerned
Tell Congress to stop wasting tax payer money to interfere in a political campaign. Of all the problems in US, this is ur focus!
If you take out Clinton you could be stuck with Trump!  Think about it!
what about the Minnesota cop, he's not above the law either #PhilandoCastile
tell the ophthalmologist to still to medical degree and let lawyers do their job. Don't see lawyers giving eye exams
Well dr rand lets talk about that illegitmate child you have, and that mistress u been entertaining.
impeach her before she is in office... Just like her husband.
from Sun to Sun as an American citizen AS A BOONE from our Fighters & Freedom in the Revolutionary War I thank you Randy Boone
@catoletters Corruption of this government is not going 2 stop. Until some drastic measures r taken from the outside 2 clean it up
If she gets elected and Republicans lose majority guns are her 1st target This cannot be allowed to happen
Yeah I agree if HRC wins this election which u know will be rigged to the hilt we are done.
III% just sayin.
maybe get Goodell on the case! He seems pretty unrelenting! Our government needs to step up! This is a national disgrace!
she is a danger to our National Security & Our Nation.
take you blinders off they're both hiding things from us, neither deserve us to look the other way.
@RandPaul
the Clintons have lived by their own rules for 40 years why have an expectation that would change when she is presumptive POTUS
signed! Again her security clearance needs to revoked asap!
the irony is that Comey essentially handed Hillary the "dumb blonde bimbo" defense when he said she didn't under what (c) meant.
That's what the citizens of Kentucky elected you to do.Take your 5 minutes in front of the Senate every day. Get other Senators 2
If it'd make a difference, I'd sign it from England, m8.
others are going to start invoking the @HillaryClinton rule. No justice under the law.
endorse gary johnson if you want this shit to stop son
can't find anyone to bring a case?  The line is enormous.
Strange bed fellows indeed!!!
far beyond talking to a government agency. why should the taxpayers follow any rules? serious question btw
Our betters should not be subject to the laws of common folk. This isn't the 17th century.
