@RandPaul has changed politics. Common sense and rational thought has been brought to the debate table on a public level. #StandWithRand
@RandPaul Rand..I have to admit..You've been pretty funny tonight. I like a good Trill every now and then myself, but #GoBernieSanders
@RandPaul you of all people are talking trash? Really? Maybe you should spend more time figuring out how to remove the snow with no govnt
@JohnTom68918151 everyone knows the Feds don't plow snow idiot. Point was your libertarian ideology is moronic. Rand and Ron Paul are frauds
@RandPaul @tylerjferrari too bad he has just as many votes as you lolol
.@RandPaul Not sure you're one to be throwing stones. What's your polling average again?
@SethMillstein @RandPaul  At least he had the common sense to quit.  O'Malley is just playing the spoiler.  He needs to dropout now.
@dkmich huh? Rand Paul is still in the race.
@RandPaul CC: @LogicallyHank and @OnlineNels. #RIPOMalley
@RandPaul @ImpactDemocracy - what r u afraid of  #theBern    . .  \
.@RandPaul Isn't that like the pot calling the kettle black. Don't stoop to Trump level. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html …
@RandPaul I hear you. Waste of time listening to candidates with single digit polling numbers. Oh wait.
@RandPaul you can drop the attitude, you're polling lower than @MartinOMalley is and at least he gets to debate with the grown ups.
@RandPaul he on the big stage randy not u,
@RandPaul "I can't bring myself to live tweet Martin O'Malley, sorry Twitter. #DemTownHall" 

Why, were stuck at the little kids table?!?
@RandPaul Cowardly move to tweet about former Gov. @MartinOMalley & not include him in the tweet.
@RandPaul The kid said to Hillary there was a reason he got the question.  Obvious the questions were pre screened.  Waste of time.
@RandPaul this is not the behavior of a U.S. Senator. Certainly not worthy of POTUS.
@RandPaul @RWilliams977 your poll numbers aren't much better
@omar_rumman @RandPaul damnnnn
@RandPaul lol ok tough guy
@RandPaul  Of course not. You're out in John Birch/Lyndon LaRouche-land, not in tune with non-nutcase American working people..
@RandPaul 
@RandPaul @PeterBeinart Big goddam deal.
@RandPaul lol you couldn't even make the main stage at the last debate .
@RandPaul I wish you had. He's the most articulate one of the bunch. If only he didn't constantly laud Obama . . .
@RandPaul I can assure you, the rest of society thanks you for that
@RandPaul he's a great actor that Martin O'Malley...
@RandPaul @neighhay Martin O'Who?
@RandPaul  you were great on MSNBC @allinwithchris.  Now you're ruining it with your negativity.
@RandPaul That's funny, because America can't seem to bring itself to tweet about you either!
@RandPaul @CLGrossman OK everyone. If Rand can't, *you* can.
@RandPaul I respect you more than all other Republicans but you're only slightly more relevant than he is.
@RandPaul because you empathize a similarly useless position within your respective political parties?
@RandPaul  He awesome have a blast you rock Rand #StandWithRand
@RandPaul and he was maryland gov...twice...
@RandPaul Couldn't bring yourself to participate in the last debate either. Less relevant than your father.
. Similar to how voters feel about you @RandPaul I can't bring myself to live tweet Martin O'Malley, sorry Twitter. #DemTownHall
Sorry @RandPaul. #Trump and #Cruz already make the jokes around here. So does #BenCarson. Oh, and #JebBush and #Rubio and...say, wait a min.
@RandPaul throw'n some savage shade right here!
@RandPaul it's ok, we're not interested anyway
@RandPaul he's polling higher than you...
@RandPaul Don't blame you, I turned it to Hannity.
@RandPaul @ImpactDemocracy  Just support overdue min. wage hike. Some dems might even vote for you, then. #ItMatters  #ReaganTookOurJobs
@RandPaul GOP voters can't bring themselves to remember your name.
@RandPaul @aldotcom got better numbers that you...
@RandPaul That's OK. It's a good representation of how he is perceived by the people in the room. Works out!
@RandPaul @fantasynickr
Hey man, maybe instead of live tweeting this you should put more effort into not losing so fucking horribly. Just a thought. @RandPaul
.@RandPaul pretend he's a priest that's what I do #FatherMartinOMalley
@RandPaul sad because your tweets were the only thing keeping me awake in this.#snoozer... Guess I will nap until you start again
@RandPaul you are omalley of republicans
@RandPaul that's too bad. he's a pragmatic person with authentic vision.
@RandPaul Appartently nobody on Twitter is either.
@RandPaul @NoahCRothman Try it you are both 
2% 'ers. Lots in common, zero chance.
@RandPaul game respects game, and irrelevancy respects irrelevancy, I guess.
@RandPaul -Understanable
@RandPaul Yeah, because you're doing so much better than he is in the race. You silly clown.
@RandPaul Aren't you guys polling at the same %? #SorryRand #DemTownHall
@RandPaul probably polls higher among Democrats than Martin does too
@randpaul He's still running?
@RandPaul how about they talk about balancing the budget. #DemDebate
@RandPaul If you do ask him why he's even bothering.
“@RandPaul: I can't bring myself to live tweet Martin O'Malley, sorry Twitter. #DemTownHall” wah wah...
@MWvonWalter @RandPaul He's had some great and pragmatic responses...
@RandPaul you're throwing shade
.@RandPaul The most I could muster was a snapchat to friends/fellow Rand supporters. #DemTownHall #StandWithRand
@RandPaul LOL
@randpaul @aldotcom Dr. why not lets Establish obamas Eligibility, since thats NEVER been Legally Established, before Cruz?,
@aldotcom @randpaul since the State of Hawaii says NO obama birth records exist, NOW, or EVER, and even the former Gov, couldnt produce them
@aldotcom @randpaul and why did nancy Pelosi send 2 different letters of eligibility,one to Hawaii,and the remaining 49 States a different 1
@RandPaul he's the Rand Paul of the Democratic party.
@RandPaul I follow @SenSanders because I like his politics, but I follow @RandPaul because he is freaking hilarious #DemTownHall
@RandPaul you've got the same poll numbers as he and I 
@RandPaul
@RandPaul hitler did not live tweet when he invented libertarianism!
@RandPaul THANK YOU!
@RandPaul ...good. Go work on that fine campaign for latest @gop dipshit.
@RandPaul please, no one cares what you think
@RandPaul @Roth4Israel 
LMFAOOOOOOO
@RandPaul BREAKING: TWITTER WONDERING WHO MARTIN O MALLEY IS
@RandPaul my thoughts exactly! Lol #StandWithRand
@RandPaul Go home Rand, ur drunk.
@RandPaul it's just not worth it
@RandPaul You jelly?
@RandPaul "..120 events with bigger and bigger crowds." O'Malley audience must have broke double digits.
@RandPaul Martin O'Malley's polling better in Iowa than you are, so...
@RandPaul I should fall asleep any second
@RandPaul I'm curious to know your stance on fracking?
.@RandPaul di-... Didn't you just do that?

And scoreboard ;)
@RandPaul Will you be voting for Bernie in the general after that?
@RandPaul lol i enjoyed u picking apart Bernie
@RandPaul no worries, we've got it!
#DemTownHall
@RandPaul  god bless you an your family.. the Apple sure didn't fall far from the tree @RonPaul
@RandPaul O'Malley is more suitable for u rand, Bernie and Hillary are top notch unlike u
@RandPaul lol
@RandPaul Lucky him!
@RandPaul come on!
@RandPaul good call
@RandPaul YOU HAVE TO HELP US ALL AMEN.
@RandPaul Can't bring myself to watch. I'd get more votes than O"Malley
@RandPaul why you're at 2% he's at 1
@RandPaul   You mean you don't want him to bring what he did for Baltimore to DC?
@RandPaul go away
@RandPaul you guys have similar national ratings, no? #DemTownHall #omalley
@RandPaul but but
For 2nd time today- @MartinOMalley playing the Iowa Waltz. Just chilling before #DemForum at Drake. #iacaucus 
@RandPaul nobody cares about you anyway. Fake Doctor!!!
@RandPaul Who's he?
@RandPaul tax and ban Marty can!
@RandPaul don't be sorry, it's pointless!
@RandPaul In some ways you are the Martin O'Malley of the GOP. People head for the snacks in the fridge when you are on.
@RandPaul me neither
@RandPaul But I need more of your burns!
@RandPaul oh...give it a shot.
@RandPaul thank you for sparing us that awkwardness, Dr Paul!
@RandPaul AMEN.
@RandPaul  why not? He's powerful enough to try and tax the RAIN!
@RandPaul Based on recent polls, @MartinOMalley is technically a one-percenter
@RandPaul you can't help someone polling as low as you?
@RandPaul Is that who's next? Is Hillary in the bathroom or something right now?
@RandPaul why is he still there, got maybe 1% in polls?
@RandPaul #airingofgrievancesround2 #itsafestivusmiracle
@RandPaul  Beautiful trolling of the Bernie fans
@RandPaul he's a dork anyways
@RandPaul 
@RandPaul This guy understands. https://goo.gl/tmIa1Q 
@RandPaul I understand.
@randpaul mate
