@FoxNews @RandPaul And the Bushes wisk their families out of the country after terror attacks.
@Marionmarooned @FoxNews @RandPaul Rand Paul has never defended Bush's policies on this or even his wars. He is the anti-war guy
@adlangston75 @FoxNews @RandPaul Oh sure. But this gets down to my fundamental confusion about cons who think Clinton should be in jail
@Marionmarooned @adlangston75 @FoxNews @RandPaul Hil is/should be IN JAIL! World would be much @ peace! BTW Take MY FAT$$ GOV. 'Bumstead!'
@FoxNews @RandPaul This has been known for decades now. Oh wait,dem voters refuse to believe it.
@FoxNews @Jmsox83 @RandPaul  Hillary has been bought & paid for by our worst enemies.That would be conflict of interest & disastrous in Pres
@FoxNews @RandPaul HILLARY AND BILL CLINTON USE POLITICS TO MINT MONEY FROM ALL CORNERS OF WORLD NO MATTER TO SELL THEMSELVES OR AMERICA

@FoxNews @RandPaul Not a Paul supporter but his comments about the Clintons taking money from Middle East regimes was spot on

@FoxNews @RandPaul mooooo........ @hateful_heretic low...........
@FoxNews @RandPaul If @HillaryClinton is elected, rape will become legal and encouraged in the United States.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @HillaryClinton thousands of convicted rapists will be released from prison as their crime is no longer a crime
@FoxNews @RandPaul @HillaryClinton I wonder if the women in Europe who are being raped by muslims will support her the way American women do
@FoxNews @RandPaul @HillaryClinton until they learn the hard way that the candidate (hillary) they voted into office lets them be raped?
@FoxNews @RandPaul You're not going to get much leverage by using middle eastern women or women in general  from this crowd.

@FoxNews @RandPaul and yet #GOP is cool with Trump who treats women the same way.
@FoxNews @RandPaul #gop treat women like cattle for free. #choice #pp #gopdebate
@FoxNews @RandPaul The Bush family has had ties with middle east oil ignoring human rights violations.  Even the GOP god Reagan screwed up.
