@SeabreezeCheryl @RandPaul @BernieSanders @benandjerrys What makes you generalize so loosely?  You must now know his supporters hahaha
@RandPaul @BernieSanders @benandjerrys You're not consistent enough for them to figure out your flavor.
.@RandPaul @hedeen89 Be careful what you wish for. I foresee "Bland Paul"--no sugar added vanilla. (No offense, just their politics.)
