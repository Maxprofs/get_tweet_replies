@Mike_Beacham @POTUS @RandPaul and this was two days ago? Any update since.........?
ACA Was originally designed by conservatives & it the same blueprint used for Romneycare
Don't say conservative and romney together.  Romney care is not conservative.  The constitution doesn't guarantee health care.
sorry 2 burst ur bubble the blueprint 4 ACA & indvdl mandate was creatd by Heritage Foundation n 90s
The Republican Chaffee plan of the 90s,  backed by Bob Dole and the likes, looked a lot like ACA.  GOP conservatives killed it.
question really is did the conservatives genuinely block it or did Koch Bros revoke $$
Let me guess:  Everybody is going to get "access" to catastrophic health insurance that doesn't cover any EHBs AND tax cuts for the rich?
Should the healthy young not get health care and just go to the ER? Is that fair. Everyone needs to have skin in the game
Steve Bannon looks like a homeless person in suit. He got demoted today. #BooWoo
What are the details
@realDonaldTrump Rice is from Benghazi fake news to now throw here under the bus for Espionage! No Russians involved! No report@abc@nbc@cbs!
Laughable...
.this is why Paul is speaking out about Rice. A deal was struck.
So, @POTUS & @RandPaul play some golf, Paul tweets "smoking gun" #SusanRice as trade for renewed #RepealAndReplace?

Sound about right?
Run with it....
Rand needs to make sure Freedom Caucus is a major force, FC truly is looking out for us taxpayers!
America needs a healthcare plan that doesn't suck up all our $$ to pay for health insurance so we can't afford to pay for actual healthcare!
Seriously serious? I have trouble taking him seriously....just saying.
It bombed
acctNonfixedvoiptztbdkynyny – at Crooked Oak Golf Club
The ACA was NOT affordable.  My friend's premiums went up 40% two years in a riw under the ACA.  He lost some coverage, too.
Yup hope he does it right but not holding my breath
Some say let it crash and burn so they can really see what they signed up for.  Nothing makes them happy. Let them be miserable...
Great news for those of us who were not impressed with the debacle that was in play. Repeal & Replace or be replaced @POTUS @RandPaul @GOP
Wanna bet it includes something to screw over the poor and needy?
Helth care??? WHAT ABOUT BEGHAZI
@benshapiro @POTUS @RandPaul Deal, he'll. Just REPEAL the unconstitutional crap sandwich. Then get D.C. out of the way!
Did he also tell you that after discussing this little health care thingy with Dr Kevorkian, he became optimistic about a money saving deal!
No deal..... He is getting impeached.
Its pointless
We will. believe it when we see it
Does anyone here really think single payer will be the answer? Hahaha you guys make me laugh, keep working Senator! #StandwithRand
You need to include democrats in your planning.  We are your constituents too.
Why would I want Fed gov mandated healthcare? How stupid is that? I notice that Congress is exempt. Must not be very good.
A deal that satisfies Rand Paul will never fly with moderate republicans.
Rand Paul spent the weekend with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Now he has joined his team and rhetoric on healthcare and wiretapping. "Puppet"
Paul is desperately trying to normalize Trump.
Watched morning Joe. You're a slime! You don't deserve to represent our country. Senator for sale...one game of golf!

Well, that's par.  Wasn't Rand the last to have Trump's ear on the subject last weekend on the golf course?
Perhaps #POTUS talking 2 Newt & being reminded who his friends are. Conservs are in his corner, working for us. Rand is MD, knows his stuff.
Please listen to @RandPaul Mr. @POTUS. Unlike others he has a good plan that will take care of #OCareVictims like me.

Reform or Repeal?
#FullRepeal No #Ryancare
 kill Medicaid. Please no more Medicaid bloatware. End price discrimination. Require transparent pricing. Add limited universal Medicare.
Are you looking at a future in politics? And do you think linking yourself to a traitor is a good way to achieve that?
POTUS not qualified to discuss anything.  #keepObamacare
No deals just do what you said repeal
ROTFL
Are we supposed to take him seriously now?
Lying liars lie.
Sorry NBC... no cred
"...While at one of @realDonaldTrump elite golf courses."
@benshapiro it’s a
“meeting of the bar hair-pieces”
@benshapiro @POTUS @RandPaul Good, that's who he should be working with.
@maggieNYT It’d better include insurance for everybody.
Has to be a total repeal.
Ought we take his remarks seriously or literally?
A deal with Paul is not a good deal for us!
Can we be a little less naive?  There's no reason to believe Trump knows the details of a health care plan -- absolutely no evidence at all
He can make a deal with Paul. But can he sell it?  Not exactly the same thing.
let's get it done then
When the President feels compelled to mention he's "serious" that says a lot. Like the Penn.Ave. Bates Motel wasn't serious enough already.
@POTUS needs to talk to @AtlasMD .
@POTUS needs to talk with any physician ...pick one!
So, is he saying he wasn't really serious 10 days ago?
YES
It would be an actual disaster... unlike #ObamaCare which is working great for most people.
He's talking about a deal with one of the most conservative members of the Senate. People should be worried about that
Is it: Kentucky gets free medicaid forever, everyone else gets nothing?
This should have been posted on April fools day
That's really terrible news for anyone who cares about all Americans' access to decent and affordable healthcare.
Doubtful. #Trump doesn't know anything specific about health care reform.
Right now roadblock is House Tuesday Group not Freedom Caucus; @realDonaldTrump needs to realize that & get Rand Paul & @tedcruz on board.
Things are starting to unravel in former administration, I want answers on leaks
So much hate let the liberals burn themselves out, we need to fix this country.
There's a pair. A healthcare plan cooked up by these 2 anti-vaxers prob. won't cover childhood immunizations. Can U say "Measles epidemic"
My specialty is deals where both sides make a deal with the Devil. Welcome aboard the Trump Train, Senator Randy Paul!
@RandPaul Senator, please explain why you believe that members of congress deserve better healthcare than their constituents?
These libs seem to feed on morning Joe, C. Mathews and T. Noah. Sucking down that cool aid. Spewing it out on twitter.
Okay #fakenews
@MeetThePress @POTUS @RandPaul He's lying.  Otherwise he'd be working with Dems, not Rand Paul.
Republicans own everything. Democrats own nothing.
YESS!!!!
Translation: Trump grabbed him by the pussy. #GOPhypocrisy
He's a god among the bots and #kremlintrolls
@suburbandit I keep being proven right. Where did you go to school - everything you were taught was a lie. Not your fault you're so gullible
The only thing that keeps getting proven is how badly a man can need validation from a perfect stranger over the internet.
What can I say I love being right and I love rubbing it in your face even more still not tired of winning this is Trump country now
Evidently not as much as you love cognitive dissonance and self-delusion. 35% approval rating is winning? Did you study math at Trump U?
You still believing them fake news numbers. Same ones that said Hillary would get over 300 electoral votes same one said Trump wouldn't win
Kristin will be reprimanded for saying anything halfway positive.
Let me guess liberals happy with Obamacare every young or old american cant have choice with the gov. We Want to choose insurance on our own
Yep, everyone buys their own insurance including pols and corporate honchos
Every plan, individuals only!
@realDonaldTrump If it's with Rand Paul, the bill sucks!!
finally!!!
Free Markets only
.@realDonaldTrump is pissy that he lost. That he's a LOSER!
He would make a deal with the Devil, to get a win. Any win.
Most Americans dont
 want  gov control on healthcare  isnt about rich or poor this about freedom of life or death as my choice not gov.
Or Co. No health insurance thru employment, except the military!
if he wants to be the dealmaker, he has to include both sides. otherwise he is in politic play land.
That's where you are wrong. We don't need dems anymore.
I hope both @RandPaul and @POTUS realize the undue burden Obamacare has put ONLY on Middleclass business owners and single payers.
@MeetThePress @POTUS @RandPaul now if only we could believe anything that comes out of his mouth?
Except the #healthcare Libertarians like @RandPaul prefer is private health care. No subsidiaries. Trump doesn't care about the poor perfect
But @POTUS is a pathological liar, so....
@kwelkernbc dont be fooled. Trump is looking for distractions from latest breaking news. #CountryFirst
@DagnyDelinquent @MAGAtrump5
include @tickerguy in the discussion and we have a chance at meaningful change.
he did not tell you anything you liar
That's why @RandPaul provided cover fire for  Putin's bitch today.
YES!
Don't let Trump make you his media pawn. He is an opportunistic compulsive liar.
Tell @RandPaul that @AmbassadorRice "Dissembled"  NOTHING
Straight out of @HouseBenghazi report V.5 p.18
Good!  Conservatives trust Rand!!!NOT Ryan!!!
This is a distraction so we won't notice trump going to Mar-a-Lago next weekend.
building new nuks to kill us more important
#StandWithRand
Oh I thought they were coming up with their Susan Rice conspiracy! My bad.
They'll do anything to aid the rich on the backs of the ordinary American citizen
That's all any of them have done since WW II,try to destroy the New Deal!
What specifics? Oh Trump said so, well that's good enough for me.
Rand Paul just another PARTY FIRST scammer. Screw the people. Sad
No he's not
He is so desperate. He has run out of deals with Satan so he needs a new set of devils
Good for you Kristen, actual real news from NBC. I'm impressed.
They just need a better plan!!!
Very good to hear. @RandPaul is the best ally versus both left and right regarding fiscal reaponsibility and common sense.
@realDonaldTrump #healthcarereform that ship has sailed.

Happy he spoke with @RandPaul and that they can work out a great deal for all of america!
I remember your mom from my days in Art Museum Area RE 35 years ago. A few  years earlier, Andrea Mitchell was at KYW covering City Hall!
^5....Medicaid/Medicare for the poor,disabled & Seniors....Medicaid to states...let the free market handle the rest.
Let's hope it ends with the govt staying completely out of my healthcare.
We can only hope.
Mondays are GOP recycling day! Just like there's Tweet Saturdays and Friday is Take Out the Trash Day!
Well, this will go nowhere fast.
What horrors do they have in mind now
Would that be on the tee box or the green?
@SenRandPauI made a deal and SOLD HIS SOUL TO SATAN, or as you refer to him, @realDonaldTrump Paul would sell out his grandmother. #noballs
Paul has the largest set in D.C.  I hope you're kidding.
#talkischeap
Rand is the man to task with this. Not Ryan. I hope Trump has learned this.
I think Sen Rand Paul maybe the best person to help him get it done. Though republicans shouldve had something on table a looong time ago
This crap is Ryan's plan more than Trump's. It'll all change if Citizens United could be dismissed. Corps don't get sick&never die!
Why are you speaking about American healthcare like it is a game show - "Lets Make a Deal"?  Sick way to think about it.
Rand is the man with the plan.   Go with him Donald.
Because the bill would be a deal. Literally losing hope in ppl.
Doesn't Rand Paul's idea screw Americans even more? He thought TrumpCare was too generous...
wow, now youre just wasting twitter ink with your silly bullshit...learn to report  without lying through ur teeth , THEN WE WILL LISTEN
It's not a "deal", it's a LAW.  America isn't a business and we aren't his customers.  Try writing a law for US instead of insurers.
You believed him? 
Just remember up is down, no means yes to this psycho! Good convo means he lied and he thinks @RandPaul bought it!
shiny object.
No one likes the sound of that
And you beleive him.  ?
Healthcare that meets POTUS's campaign pledges, that the Freedom Caucus & GOP Moderates can support! Wow, that's something to see?
Is that why rand tweeted that bs about susan rice?
Pretty much. @RandPaul is transitioning well into a world of alternative facts & fake news.
Wow @NBCNews there's a whole #SusanRice scandal going on but not one word on your twitter feed? Very suspicious. #MediaBias
It's not a scandal.  She was doing her job.
To spy on people is her job? Wow! You are delusional.
How goes his tax audit?
You keep asking for something not legally required, Sherlock, while your lib heroes start getting locked up - 1 at a time.
Hi Scout. He's hiding something. If 45 makes it through year's end, I'll be shocked. Time will tell.
lmfao I'll be shocked if the msm talks about susan rice sometime this century
Wait... people ACTUALLY believe the Russia crap? BAHAHAHA. Zero evidence, sorry miss.
The American people don't want this deal.
Did you ask him why Jared is in Iraq? What qualifies Jared to deal with a military intervention?
What qualifies you to question it or even understand it ?
Did you ask him about WaPo and CNN stories?
He can make a deal with Rand Paul and lose Charlie Dent and other moderates.  So what, who cares?
Blah, blah, blah...
Good thing he had that ultimatum to show that his word is useless even with republicans and he doesn't know how to do deals.
Reform? Not repeal?
Good point
