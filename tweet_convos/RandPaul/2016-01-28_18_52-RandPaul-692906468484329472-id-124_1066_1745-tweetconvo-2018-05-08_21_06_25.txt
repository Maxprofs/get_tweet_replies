@FoxNews @RandPaul He said "OUR" African American community.  smh
@VeryVeriViral Nothing wrong with it; he's proud of proclaiming their inclusion and value to our society. I think it's refreshing in R Party
@StephenGamble12 But it's rhetoric. His policies don't bear that out. A flat tax, for example, doesn't help the middle and lower classes.
@VeryVeriViral @StephenGamble12 a flat tax does help lower and middle class as opposed to hidden taxes buried in everything. U need econ 101
@disturbedsauce Nein. Econ 301. (And common sense).
@VeryVeriViral LOL you don't understand that progressive taxes get included in everything you buy. 
You pay their taxes anyhow.
@disturbedsauce I def agree to an extent.
@VeryVeriViral As a real libertarian, what if I told you the top pays more money in a flat tax no deduction scenario. Deductions R loopholes
@FoxNews @RandPaul really glad he has taken sociology serious and understands the issues! On point with criminal justice reform
@Detroitgem @FoxNews @RandPaul And reform it how?
@kevin_covington drugs would be misdomeanor instead of felony, nonviolent felons will be able to vote again, & police can't take ur property
@RandTheBrand I'm a policeman and I see what drugs do to families everyday and the people dealing it should not get a misdemeanor.
@kevin_covington @RandTheBrand but wouldn't you agree that your perspective is skewed? You only see the worst.
@PhatMagic350 @RandTheBrand yes, but it's the only way I see it. If they are addicts there's no other way to see it.
@kevin_covington @RandTheBrand OK, but I challenge the notion that it's societies responsibility to save people from themselves.
@PhatMagic350 @RandTheBrand Ok so what's the answer?
@FoxNews @freedom3556 @RandPaul Fox don't even try to take credit as if the GOP approves. U guys blocked Rands message every chance you had.
@FoxNews @BanGunFreeZones @RandPaul #StandWithRand #RandRally
@FoxNews @immanuelg @RandPaul I still #StandWithRand #CommandoForRando Americas worthit!
@FoxNews @RandPaul Do you believe it's skin color related or socioeconomic?
@FoxNews @RandPaul F##k you, Black people do not have trains, boats, and planes to ship drugs to America, they are just pawns as usual
@FoxNews @RandPaul stance aligns him with PRESIDENT SANDERS.RanPaul could be the first crossover candidate for VP.Feel the Bern.NEO
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews  It so nice not to have to see Donald Trumps face and hear him bashing everybody on Fox. It is so refreshing.
@FoxNews @bill orally
@FoxNews @RandPaul he's completely right. #StandWithRand
@FoxNews @RandPaul for sure
@FoxNews @primatemachine @RandPaul and so has the obsession with policies that are surging the costs of electricity. @EPA @POTUS
@primatemachine @FoxNews @RandPaul @EPA @POTUS "Electricity Price Index Hit Record—Again--in January"
@FoxNews @mikesmith8026 @RandPaul maybe they should stop doing drugs
@paultowey4 @FoxNews @mikesmith8026 @RandPaul lol I would really like to know who is the "they"
@FoxNews @blackrepublican @RandPaul No it hasnt, no one is forcing them, they choose to do it.
@FoxNews @ZeroSum2016 @RandPaul this is the future of the GOP
@FoxNews @RandPaul maybe because the AA community is disproportionately dealing the drugs?
@FoxNews @RandPaul smartest thing Anyone from the GOP has said through heading towards the primaries !
@FoxNews thank you
@FoxNews @RandPaul 
it took a debate to point this out?
typical republicans #GOPDebate 
#Clueless
@FoxNews @RandPaul one of my favorite answers of the night
@FoxNews @RandPaul Damn... Even Ben didn't have a Damn thing to say!... #Rand Paul, you got my vote!
@FoxNews @RandPaul What a courageous candidate... Saying things like that in this country could kill your career...
@FoxNews @RandPaul Rand, you do know you're at the Republican debate, right?
@dilgentbureauct @FoxNews @RandPaul yeah, for President. President of the United States. That includes all citizens not just half
@FoxNews @RandPaul  The war on drugs doesn't work for anyone, not just African American's. Legalize, regulate, and tax. Problems solved
@FoxNews @RandPaul liberal liberal liberal lib lib lib liberal
@FoxNews @RandPaul  like u REALLY CARE.. RAND
@dellajean521 @FoxNews @RandPaul I think he does.  Look at what he's done for sentencing reform, or partnering with Dems for CJ reform.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Crisp answers all night. Absolutely the only individual with responses that were substantive w/o deflections in any way.
@FoxNews @blackrepublican @RandPaul The best way 2notB impacted by drugs is not 2 use them. Liberal policies have destroyed black families.
@FoxNews @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul So he wants to end the war on drugs and let the drugs complete the destruction???
@JanetPursley @FoxNews @RandPaul A lot of us do. The War on Drugs has increased drug use and created a criminal underclass in our country.
@BDMcPeak @FoxNews @RandPaul So you think making mind altering drugs legal will get rid of crime? LOL! Haven't seen results of drugs huh?
@JanetPursley @FoxNews @RandPaul  Nothing will get rid of crime. But judge the War by its results, not its intent.  It fails and harms.
@FoxNews @RandPaul the best, most remarkable moment of the debate.
@FoxNews @RandPaul this is how you improve the GOP base, speaking about the issues.
@FoxNews @RandPaul  glad he's there in lieu of the big cry baby
@FoxNews @RandPaul Rand Paul is he too far behind to win & is just throwing jabs at Rubio & Cruz in desperation.
@FoxNews @RandPaul i have so much respect for his father @RonPaul , while they are different, you can see his political influence over rand
@FoxNews @RandPaul want to see all the people effected by this dam drug? Go to Broadway in Camden! You'll see all types out there hooked!
@FoxNews @RandPaul not only the African Americans! Hispanics, and whites have been hit hard too! That dam herion has taken over!
@FoxNews @RandPaul Dammit PC I meant dammit Anglicans. Let's blame everyone else but our own race. Never look in the mirror. Easier.
@FoxNews @RandPaul  damn white people
@FoxNews @RandPaul When you allow States to make marijuana legal..you have already loaded the gun. @UXYC
@FoxNews @justinamash @RandPaul its a lazy mans folley to sell drugs. Get rich quick never works out.
@stljcmo @FoxNews @justinamash @RandPaul he's not in favor of illegal drug dealing.  In CO licensed people now deal pot, not criminals.
@BDMcPeak @FoxNews @justinamash @RandPaul ha! I know as my son is one such lic.  The issue he mention  Ferguson, detroit, chi, was my point.
@FoxNews @Frmaza @RandPaul I'm sorry, is Rand Paul actually campaigning 4 the Democratic nomination? Seems like more pc propaganda/posturing
@FoxNews @RandPaul when you put yourselves in the crosshairs, you get what you deserve.
@FoxNews @RandPaul is breaking the law a color thing or is it the act its self?
@FoxNews @justinamash @RandPaul 
Bold radical stand -- breathtaking! 

#BringBackRon
@FoxNews @StoneColdChik @RandPaul well they shouldn't so drugs and get caught up. I seem to have made it without dope and jail time
@FoxNews @RandPaul  Rand is the only credible and honest candidate on the stage. #RandRally #GOPDebate #RandPaul
.@foxnews @randpaul #duh #GOPDebate
That's true. Time to end the #DrugWar. @FoxNews @BennettMorris @RandPaul
@FoxNews @RandPaul Sounds like Iowa loves Rand Paul. Cruz reminds me of Hillary, oozing lies.
@FoxNews @RandPaul  And why is that Rand? Maybe because they commit more drug related crimes on thier own!
@FoxNews rand Paul should not even be on the stage.
@FoxNews @RandPaul look!! Their parents fucked up why should I have to use my tax dollars doing so. Jail them bastards. Full term.
The context of drug crime affects the population convicted of drug crime. High crime areas always get more attention. @FoxNews #GOPDebate
@FoxNews @RandPaul he didn't even answer the question, which was about use of technology.  Totally off tangent.
@FoxNews @RandPaul someone actually making sense.
@FoxNews @RandPaul and why is that?
@FoxNews @RandPaul @BillHaslam no meds for needy but drug lord gets em all...
@FoxNews @RandPaul can you say that on fox news??
@FoxNews @RandPaul not true
@FoxNews @RandPaul WATCH ON OANN!! COMPLETE COVERAGE OF TRUMP EVENT!!
@ZaunerZauner @FoxNews @RandPaul Drug use even between races, incarceration isn't.  Isn't that a problem?
@FoxNews @RandPaul wait what. Stop enforcing laws because 1 group breaks them more than others. I'm confused.
@queencitysjmill @FoxNews @RandPaul On issue of drugs, usage rates between black and white Americans are roughly equal
@jtbussell @FoxNews @RandPaul didn't know that. Not sure how that stat is compiled. Is it a percentage thing vs overall population?
@queencitysjmill @FoxNews @RandPaul Yes, % of people that are black use drugs less than % of people who are white https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/30/white-people-are-more-likely-to-deal-drugs-but-black-people-are-more-likely-to-get-arrested-for-it/ …
@FoxNews @angela_rye @RandPaul look who woke up.
@FoxNews @RandPaul @AhMaDeWiS this was golden.
@brooklynjnoubi @FoxNews @RandPaul lol that's my nigga even though I don't smoke
@FoxNews is that the drugs or the person who is at fault?
@FoxNews @RandPaul Why is he the only one saying this? Because he has principles and a backbone! #RandPaul2016 #StandWithRand #RandRally
@FoxNews @RandPaul  daa...that's because brothers in the hood do disproportionately much more of the crime by FBI stats.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Anyone who is pro drug war is either Racist, Badly misinformed, or plain stupid.
@FoxNews @RandPaul We need to legalize drugs, rape, theft, looting and murder so it doesn't effect the black community.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Rand you are a smart & decent man BUT you are in the wrong party!
@FoxNews @RandPaul he speaks the truth,the truth isn't always what people want to hear.
@FoxNews @RandPaul That's where whites go to buy their drugs
.@FoxNews why tweet this, when you obviously didn't want the other candidates talking about it? "OK go to commercial, STAT" #GOPDebate
@FoxNews @RandPaul "whoa!!! You're a Republican sir!! You should be blaming black america for stuff!"
@FoxNews @RandPaul You don't have a chance to win. Go home
@FoxNews @RandPaul say whay? 
@FoxNews @RandPaul now ur just pandering.  U didn't even mention welfare
@p9cker_girl @FoxNews @RandPaul how is he pandering? That was a factual statement.
@FoxNews @RandPaul #BoycottFoxNewsDebate #BoycottFoxNews
@FoxNews @RandPaul From what I've seen the drug problem is worse in White Suburbia.
@puppyprotector6 @FoxNews @RandPaul Exactly!  But the incarceration rates aren't very high in white suburbia!  It's a fairness issue.
@BDMcPeak @FoxNews @RandPaul I agree.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Absolutely Correct.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Hey, screw this debate stuff, Rand. Let's go fire up a couple a fat ones, ok?
@FoxNews @RandPaul there ya go rand, pander.
@FoxNews @RandPaul hmmm.
.lots of white people in my town are hooked on heroin. But @RandPaul knows everything...
@LifeInThe513 @FoxNews @RandPaul I don't get your point?  he's not saying that only blacks abuse drugs?
@FoxNews @RandPaul I know, they should stop selling so many drugs.
@FoxNews @RandPaul if you break the law you live with the consequences... no way around it
@ArthurJackson98 @FoxNews @RandPaul Should middle class people face fewer consequences for breaking the same laws as the poor?
@BDMcPeak @FoxNews no they should face the same consequences. BUT Just because you're poor and break the law doesn't mean you get a break
@FoxNews. no...it affects all.
@FoxNews @RandPaul  Black life's matter!
@FoxNews @RandPaul sounds like Bernie f*@king Sanders
@FoxNews @RandPaul how? Did the society make blacks use more drugs than whites? Or do they just break the law more than whites?
@jcartlidge88 Neither. Blacks are disproportionately arrested for drug offenses. http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8913297/mass-incarceration-maps-charts … @FoxNews @RandPaul
@aikaflip @FoxNews @RandPaul and you know this how? Are you on the streets dealing with this problem? Or do you just use google or Facebook
@jcartlidge88 I gave you a link to the data in the previous tweet. Read it for yourself. @FoxNews @RandPaul
@aikaflip @FoxNews @RandPaul i did. So what? If people don't break the law they won't be incarcerated. It's just that simple isn't it?
@jcartlidge88 It's not that simple. Punishments aren't equal. Non-lethal drugs like marijuana shouldn't be illegal. @FoxNews @RandPaul
@aikaflip @FoxNews @RandPaul it still just boils down to responsibility for your actions  don't want to go to jail don't break the law.
@FoxNews @RandPaul war on drugs. That war started 100 years ago. Stop talking about it and do something. #drugs #GOPDebate
@FoxNews @RandPaul No it hasn't. You are creating even more racism. One does the crime, one does the time. Simple.
@ElcaminoJesus @FoxNews @RandPaul black and white Americans use drugs at roughly the same rates but don't do the time at the same rates
@FoxNews @RandPaul then maybe don't take or sell drugs
@opinionsamerica @FoxNews @RandPaul I think the point is that blacks and whites use at the same rate, but aren't jailed at the same rate.
@FoxNews @RandPaul What no love for this comment
@FoxNews @RandPaul they ask the only guy on the stage that's showed a bit of interest in the topic. Ask that to one of these 1 trick ponies
@FoxNews @RandPaul don't sell or use illegal drugs and you won't go to prison. It's actually pretty clear.
@ericcochran1 @FoxNews @RandPaul well, you will if you're black or poor.  If you're white or middle class not so much. That's the problem.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Idiot!... Obama and the dems keep black ppl like pets on welfare... w/no jobs and no hope. What do you think will happen?
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump wall will sifnificantly decrease drugs
@FoxNews @RandPaul that's why you have 3% of the vote. Go HOME @RandPaul
@FiVe_Oh16 @FoxNews @RandPaul you disagree with what he said?
@tiga_style @FoxNews @RandPaul 100% disagree with what he said.
@FoxNews @RandPaul No, the Great Society has. Johnson proudly declared he would have the black population voting Democrat.
@FoxNews @RandPaul duh
@FoxNews @RandPaul can I retweet/love this a million times
@Carol_M_Lee @FoxNews @RandPaul Don't the crime if you can't do the time.
@Nathan_Harper_ @FoxNews @RandPaul don't imprison so many people for non violent crimes and arguably one race over another unfairly
@Carol_M_Lee @FoxNews @RandPaul Places like Ferguson is primarily black... Are we supposed to have an equal opportunity program for jails?
@Nathan_Harper_ @FoxNews @RandPaul no. can't look individual cities. Must look at whole country.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Really???
@FoxNews @RandPaul   I wonder why?
@FoxNews @RandPaul   You get caught with drugs and you go to jail.
@bladesSOH @FoxNews @RandPaul But you don't go to jail if you're middle class, if mommy and daddy can call their lawyer.  Thats the problem.
@BDMcPeak @FoxNews @RandPaul   Some people think they can beat the rap and do opposite what their lawyers suggest. Most don't plea.
@FoxNews @RandPaul No Trump? Not watching. Instead, i'll tune in to Trump's Veteran Fundraiser tonight on @CNN.
@SoCal4Trump @FoxNews @RandPaul @CNN WATCH ON OANN!! COMPLETE COVERAGE OF TRUMP EVENT!!
