#votegaryjohnson2016 and let @GovGaryJohnson use his idea of free market healthcare to help lower medical costs!
@EvilEsq @RandPaul    Hillary gets the monopoly.
“@FoxNews: .@RandPaul: ObamaCare actually makes it illegal to sell inexpensive insurance."  @IngrahamAngle @LouDobbs
How can any U.S. Senator stand by and ignore the corruption of the FBI, DOJ and Presidency? You are part of the problem.
MARY JO WHITE/ERIC HOLDER/LORETTA LYNCH/JAMES COMEY MADE $60B NETFLIX LOOT PONZI SCHEME
Rand, we thought you were dead! We wanna write you in! Can we vote for you anyway?
this is all about the insurance companies they're the ones that lobbied for this mess.
It also makes it illegal to not have insurance.
Inexpensive insurance is an oxymoron.
#think
It was designed to fail and all would be left is single payer govt. health care. People are too stupid to see it.
@politstrip @RandPaul Hillary is proud of it. It was Hillary care before obama. I call it shittycare
@burniethompson @RandPaul Oh what the hell would he know, it's not like...he's..a doctor....
free market will open up possibilities for all Americans. @GovGaryJohnson will get this done for the people not gov't.
Insane!
Of course not.  It's always been an insurance company bailout.
. obamacare closing rural hospitals too. A disaster
I've always said that Gov't. hates competition & loves monopolies when they are only providers.
Sure does. & If I sold a product the government forced people to buy from me, would I raise the price? You bet your ass!
Exactly why @RandPaul @gop Blocked the Public Option! They give a shit about Americans only Corporate Profits!
@bridget4kicks @RandPaul That's socialism at work:kill free market capitalism in favor of  the overhead over Govt kickback programs
Love Outnumbered without Julie. Give us one hour without an arrogant democrat.
as an underinsured nurse, I say get rid of it!!!!
Please do something since talking has done nothing! Unbelievable with all corruption she has been accused of
Harry Reed needs to be held accountable for this Debacle
All of you had your chances to help American to get healthcare coverage. #ACAIsHereToStay  for those who need it
How much of Obama care did John Roberts rewrite. What a mess

#StandWithRand
#obamadontcare
What a position to put the amercian society in. #ObamacareFail
@MStuart1970 @RandPaul ...inexpensive insurance was better than no insurance.
Actually #ObamaCare makes it illegal to be free.
Essentially true but misleading, it prohibits an insurer selling a product that doesn't cover the basis benefits expected
WOW This is good to know
I don't believe that. That has to be a lie.
This guy knows what he is talking about!
You mean fake insurance that pays nothing. Kind of like how the USDA doesn't allow dogshit to be sold as hamburger.
Very true and if the REP Govs of 19 states would take in the Medicaid expansion, maybe ACA will work with more premiums..
America got ¨Grubered¨.
this stuff and your love for the constitution is why you were my first choice for POTUS
not a single GOP voted for Obamacare and that showed competence!
@GrrrGraphics @RandPaul    I cant believe i now pay $500/MONTH!  STOP the MADNESS!! This is killing us out here!

"inexpensive" or catastrophe insurance  is a rip off for consumers. A decent person would keep those predators away
OF COURSE IT DOES THE ULTIMATE CLUSTER FUCK THANKS DEMOCRATS
I remember the excuse of we having to pay big premiums because of all the indigent pts, Obamacare is a good thing
Insurance companies pis'd cause Obama care won't let them send you from dr. to dr. over BS
I think the phrase you're looking for is "illusory insurance."
♡♡♡RAND♡♡♡ Nothing excites a girl like fiscal responsibility☆
obamacare os choking our economy to death. Im losing my #insurance for the 2nd time in 3 years at end of november :-(
youre nuts. Obamacare being implemented was the first time I have been able to even think of buying health insurance
Am even tired of this #ObamaCare
Two things to consider: 1)insurance is not healthcare and 2) most healthcare is about medicine.
is pissing on your head & trying 2 convince you its raining!  #LyingLiberals #ObamacareFail now my OK family has no ins.
OMG!  #LyingLiberals must think the American People are idiots! Biggest "spin" BS ever! Live payday2paydat already!
source, please
People don't realize that everyone with Insurance has ACA = Obamacare in one form or another, how you buy it and who pays diff
As far as I'm concerned it should be illegal to have Obamacare. It ruined Americans affordable insurance & their lived!!
Nice plan @BarackObama
I'm 63 and my deductible 5000. My whole social SS check pays my monthly bill. We are retired. I can not afford doctor
.insurance has never been cheap but Obamacare has insured people that was not eligible. Needs work not repealed
Trump is the only choice so kick the RNC in the rear and instead of criticizing him actually support him! 
obama care needs repealed
UNBELIEVABLE ! J Gruber the Dems TOADY, after scamming us all, is still involved with our healthcare!!!
If it's 'inexpensive' insurance, then it's probably not too great.
Untrue cost value ratio would mean couponing in grocers would also be bad. Try again.
Obama goes to bed laughing every night knowing  those very people who support him he is looking to make their life hell
Great interview Rand!!
Whats going to happen if Hillary gets in office? You might have your check garnished to make sure you pay your fair share
duh!!  
Funny thing is now the Democrats saying  " the Republicans voted for Obama  Care"..... what a bunch of jokers...
Why have you not pulled Clinton to the carpet for lying to YOU under oath about weapons deals with ISIS?
you got that right
this picture is misleading. I dont believe Rand was the architect of Obamacare. I believe that is a man named John Gruber
Obama care minimizes your choices and gives you less coverage
http://facebook.com/fixamericafirstpac/ …
I wanted to know what he was going to say about penalties. It's a big issue!

Help me Rand - so I am federally mandated to buy something I CANNOT afford and will be "taxed" if non-compliant?
ironic
Hillary The Grandma Behind The Obamarape... It Was Hers From The Conception...
Why am I not surprised!?
Defend he must because it is bust.
