interesting, who writes those tax laws with loop holes that assist the wealthy? What's wrong with a basic flat tax for everyone?
@robdelaney you kind of look like a sock someone tried to make look cool. Does that make sense?
No, it doesn't. @RandPaul @robdelaney
thank you for your input, I will note it in my official report. 
@Enrico056 GOP wanted the first thing to be gutting the ethics committee but I guess crazy debt it's a consultation prize
@PoliticalLine Consistency from a Republican, how refreshing!
You'll find that Conservatives are willing to call-out their own party members for bullshit. @RandPaul @PoliticalLine
@PeterSchiff if @realDonaldTrump really wants to MAGA, he should keep Dr. Paul on speed dial!
@LeeAnnMcAdoo how will the budget ever balance after the past 8 years..
Republicans are just as scammers as democrats, Socialist at the corporate level
Who cares about US debt. Shackled to it for the next 100+ years. You think the central banks going to let us go?
Nobody speaks English or cares to keep to agreed definitions. Rand Thank you for trying tobring us to our senses
You'd be a real good guy if you said who told you 'they are just numbers'. Representatives not taking it seriously should go.

@justinamash LOVE RP on Bill Maher! Grand Rapids Independents for Rand Paul! Make the budget balance again! Defend theConstitution
you are absolutely correct!
Don't let them spend $10 billion of our tax $ for a stupid wall! Then they will use boats, tunnels & rope ladders!
Thank you for saying what needs to be said and for not supporting this travesty. I wish more seats were filled behind you.
I 100% agree.  Republicans are just as stupid with overspending as the Democrats.
No excuses Rand.  Help get rid of this turd or risk becoming one.
What did you expect? Their moral compass points to the bank, not church...lol. #heelspurs
@PeterSchiff well it's nice that this person wants to say something but in this video i only saw accusations and no proof.
Uhh... news flash there Rand...Republicans only care about deficits when Democrats are in power.
thanks for working on the healthcare issue.
@ToddHagopian bravo rand
so nothing changes then, hey
@PeterSchiff my only critiques would be that monetary reform's needed. you cannot balance on a fractional debt based system
@LeeAnnMcAdoo The swamp is so deep that it even seeps over to R side of the street, Trump will ship in a pump though.
I wish you were my Senator!
@LibertyNews1776 
Please don't start with on the downside. Please focus on what the people need - healthcare, judges, immigration
audit the Fed!
@justinamash your ignoring  the most important parts of the agenda @realDonaldTrump has established, which was to create jobs=$
It took a lot of money to create this mess, This "Law of the Land" This 'Tyranny', And It will cost a lot money to get out of it.
can Republicans ever just win ? Can't they just compromise among themselves instead of moving left on the floor of the Senate ?
not surprised. They only want a balanced budget when the money isn't headed to their lobbyists.
Why a $20.000 reward by Wikileaks for the killers of a DNC staffer (Seth Rich)? Explain how and why Assange knew Mr. Rich.
You're asking the wrong person. It has nothing at all to do with Senator @RandPaul
repeal the ACC then control immigration most important.
@justinamash top three ways to get the budget in balance, NOT INCLUDING social benefits (easy targets)? GO!
I agree with you dont pass it. Also encpurage my sentors @timkaine @MarkWarner do not pass this budget. We as a nation cant.
so hey Rand how close do the new Synergies Get us to a balanced budget? You don't know do you!!!@realDonaldTrump
@alllibertynews Thank you for speaking up sir
man this new congress needs their asses checked at every turn. thank god for the critically thinking conservatives like him.
We disagree about much. But I applaud you for calling out craziness of adding $9.7T in haste to repeal ACA & need for replacement.
you are not in a hurry you work for us period don't like it don't run again
love that, keep fighting Rand
So what is your point? Where is the leadership, or are they the same place on the ethics agenda!
I guess this will be Obama's fault too huh?
go get PLEASE
Yes. If they say "number don't matter." Then let's have them put in smaller ones then.
@realDonaldTrump #Liberty #thinkaboutit #tocos
@emh434 sounds more productive than the House's first order or business!
You are better than divisiveness. Fight it. Speak solutions to power-- not just grievances.
thank you for being one of the only GOP leaders to take fiscal responsibility seriously.
you never cease to surprise me. I mean: WOW! Thank you sir!
@robdelaney No, the first order was to gut the office of ethics. Going further into debt was the second priority.
thank you for fighting for fiscal responsibility...praying for you and our Congress to be good stewards of our tax dollars.
Rand gets it!! Do you?
I have never seen you so frustrated. This proves you are the only faithful hearted strong minded hard working partriot in Wa
@LeeAnnMcAdoo republicans r just as bad as dems.. glad trumps not a real rep or democrap
what's new? Just because we have the majority doesn't mean they will actually act fiscally conservative.
proof that the swamp didn't drain.  Amen Senator Paul.  Thanks for being our voice.!!!
@LeeAnnMcAdoo gotta be in comparison to the Canadian Parliament huh?
Give 'em hell, Rand! Thank you for trying. 
The unbalanced budget DOES matter!
got to balance!
Inject some responsiblity.  Proposed law: If congress passes a budget that doesn't balance, those approving lose their salaries.
Rand is the man.
@robdelaney maybe it's because the GOP has never actually been about Conservatism. You all aren't rushed, just hypocrites.
I may not agree with many of your positions, but I appreciate your principled stand
@ghostbusters224 VP Pence said the 1st order of business is 2 repeal Obamacare...
you are my hero. Thank you for taking a stand with fiscal conservatives like @justinamash @RepThomasMassie @BenSasse #liberty
I love @RandPaul
You should exchange the word "business" with "government". I don't know many businesses that refuse to balance their budget.
I'm fiscally conservative but socially liberal.  I'm a pro Immigrants but also pro (cont) http://tl.gd/nnapjd 
@justinamash Congress?
Respectfully Senator Paul,  First order of business should be term limits.  Government is broken
lets start taxing the rich accordingly and the budget will balance quickly
the rich will create a foundation and donate all their money to it. Example: Facebook CEO.
stop making me not hate you! Dammit you seem downright reasonable...
should be president. Don't understand how he didn't get further in the election.
"First Order" = Freudian slip? #AskAStarWarsFan
get off your high horse and support every attempt to send Obama's legacy to the dump then fight for the budget issues!!!
maybe you can flip or vote the other side to help prevent this crap.
@robdelaney You guys should budget a couple more land wars.  Call it a hunch.
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @FoxNews DON'T pass such a budget!!  Else you will be of the swamp drainage!  Cut all UN exp first
I love you
thank you, Senator Rand, for being a man of principle.
@realDonaldTrump please help us please talk with @RandPaul and balance our budget!
good thing you are there. Never heard of R congresses running up deficits. Except all of them.
@justinamash Never thought I would say I agree & @RandPaul makes sense in the same sentence  #TheResistance #DemForce
@justinamash rock on Senator Paul!
Thats exactly like every single middle class family I've ever seen.
please keep holding their feet to the fire
Impress us- pass a budget that DOES balance.
Has there ever been a balanced budget in the last 50 years?
Federal governments don't have balanced budget amendments so it can run deficits when necessary. A senator should know this.
@hosvblog One of the very few in the District of Corruption who isn't bought and paid for! Fiscal responsibility?? How dare he!!!
I don't agree with you often, but thank you for pointing out hypocrisy of @GOP.
@PoliticalLine anyone making memes of his poster yet?
@robdelaney umm, what the clown show is actually doing is blowing up deficit by killing ACA
isnt that the agenda of every republican congress? Put them nukes on layaway maybe?
Senator, hang tough. So many of your constituents will suffer if KYnect goes away as result of GOP hubris.
That's the problem with "Do Nothing" RINO's! Spending freight train out of control!
I expect my Florida Senators and Representatives to back your budget ideas. @HouseGOP @SenateGOP #NoNewSpending
are you the only logical person in DC? Holy crap we are doomed.
@justinamash Reps not a $ Conservative party.  It's give $ to the rich party.
@realDonaldTrump Are you going to get on board?
Better than Nancy Pelosi saying you got to read it to find out what's in it!! Rand help the Republicans then!
Repeal and replace Obamacare! We don't care as long as Obama is gone!!
uh huh. Believe it when I see it.
sing it, sir.  You're doing good work
to "kiss" Trumps "rear" on everything!
so cut out the waste and balance it. Welfare, HUD needs to be adjusted and all the other freebies need to stop
Thank you Senator Paul..we must BALANCE the budget, and then next step: begin to pay off the national debt!!Stop wasteful spending
Rand you're one of the only Senators that is making sense on either side. Keep up the good fight!
why didn't the #GOP nominate you?    Thanks for the common sense
@JohnBoozman @SenTomCotton I support this move to balance the budget - even if it does cause somewhat difficult spending freezes.
it doesnt cost the govt $350 billion, it stops the govt from stealing $350 billion from me and you
grove, ok!!! right on, i spent my summers on lake eucha as a kid. we would drive to grove for walmart and eating out
@DerekOden3
Today's budget waived the existing rule against unbalanced budgets made by @SenateGOP, who are all deficit hypocrites except @RandPaul
A balanced US Budget is long over due. A balanced budget must be a priority, whatever it takes! Cut costs & every needles $ spent!
Paul Ryan and McConnell must be removed to the basement for progress to happen.
LOL gotta love Rand.
I don't agree with you on much, but I'm very happy to hear common sense coming from any of y'all!  Kudos!!
Offer a balanced budget in year 2017. Cut a trillion. Take a stand. @gardgoldsmith @libertytarian @JustinRaimondo @StefanMolyneux
I like you.Wanted you for President till you said that the money I paid to Social security was an entitlement.Thank you as senator
Because Trump is the king of debt, expect to see his shady business practices become unhealthy budget policies.
you know that you're literally the only person in that room who gives a shit right? I mean thank you for giving a shit, but yeah..
I may have to pin this.
didn't for 8 years either where was the outcry then,should have been done long ago, you expect to balance trillions now
They were never good@balancing ne budget but they were always good@lying about it; never understood the dems 4not tellin the truth
no wonder you weren't nominee, you're way too logical and level headed. Not to mention honest, that didn't play in 2016 #rand2020
it's their betterway
@1791L I see you like Rand Paul
boo
welcome to the new republican party.
Call them out!
quit sending money to other country s
always been a fan of you and your father. Keep fighting the good fight.
save and fix ACA
fix immigration and the tax code.  The budget will follow naturally when Americans feel they own it again.
Good start @RandPaul. Restore your dignity and keep speaking out to force Congress do their job. Work for the American People.
Well you certainly do get a big heck yeah for standing up and speaking substance instead of the drivel from VPEOTUS and Ryan
Wow!! I was sure none of your kind existed in Washington!! 
Thank you for having common sense and calling the legislation what it is, a budget. Senate will flip in 2 yrs b/c of the RINO's.
smoke and mirrors! Say anything to keep power
No follow up as to why you think so? Why are you and some of your colleagues so skeptical without proof? I don't get it it.
sounds good y don't we
Time for @realDonaldTrump to stand for Americans. @SpeakerRyan and @MitchMcConell we need a balanced budget. You want it, find $$.
.@RandPaul U rock! This #beer is to U!
residual income here online
our govt would never give a security clearance to someone w/ the equivalent foreign debt our national purse has & for good reason
#StandWithRand
Balance the budget!!!! More debt means more taxes.
Thank you.
.  Unfortunately, it looks like Sen. Paul is preaching to an empty room.  I hope someone is listening.
neither party wants small government, those are just buzzwords
It feels weird that someone has to go out of consensus to state the obvious
Love seeing you call out the fake Conservatives in the Senate!!! #StandWithRand
excellent job Dr Paul!
Even though I don't agree with the isolationist views of Paul, he is damn right about the economy. I hope congress they listen.
Mr. Paul the reason why GOP is adding $7 Trillion to deficit is because  GOP member are in cooperate America's back pocket
And GOP complained about ACA. What a bunch of tools.
Man, so depressing to hear "it's just numbers" when we work our butts off to pay the gov't. Wake up GOP, listen to Rand!
you have ppl who know money and how 2 generate & make it grow - keep an open mind Not politics as usual BUSINESS mindset very diff
Pathetic! I hope that's not true. Repubics need to go to.
Sure, like Congress will ever pass a budget again. Onward to Year 10 of the Continuing Resolution!
Repeal Obamacare NOW
get um rand
Welcome to being in charge GOP!
Thank You for starting off the new Congress with a principled stand for small government!
Get them randy.
TELL IT LIKE IT IS @RandPaul !!!! 
#RandPaul2024
New Democrat lite majority*
