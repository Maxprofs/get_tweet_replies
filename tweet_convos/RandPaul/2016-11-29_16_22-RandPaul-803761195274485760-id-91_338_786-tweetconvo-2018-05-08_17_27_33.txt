@alllibertynews @FoxNews @RandPaul  rather than "stick-your-nose-in-everybodys-business" approach #MakingTerrorists #blowback
OH, kinda like this...
Keep it up @RandPaul
I truly trust in Rand Paul!
The next military operation in the Middle East ought to be named:  Operation Steam Roller.
@GotchYaSon
Was really disappointed in Primaries @RandPaul sounded like a standard neocon. Heritage did his thinking like the rest
What sounded neocon about him?
For all the "firebrand Libertarian" hype, gotta say I was a bit disappointed is all.
I really don't know what you're referring to. In my eyes he was unique and a breathe of fresh air.

I stand with Rand.
Shut up Rand.
#standingROCK @alllibertynews @RandPaul #STANDwithRAND #wikiLeaks #findjuLianassange @cheryLfurer PERETUAL #war / #guerra MUST STOP
If only Rand Paul had been the Republican nominee. We would be in such better straits right now.

exactly!
What are the lessons? Can u explain how there is only one real country, Israel, just 70 yrs old in middle of 5000 yrs of tribalism?
who the heck do u want as SofS?
@spaghetti in light of our conversation today. Glad some politicians aren't blind to the solutions
ummmm stop trying to make rand Paul happen
@alllibertynews @RandPaul Rand you don't know your ass from a hole in the  ground.
@alllibertynews @RandPaul Bolton should be on trail,there are SUCKERPUNCHERS and FIGHTERS,describe the US
but you can't bury your head in the sand either.  You can't ignore the problems in the world.
If Trump were place @RandPaul as SoS, they world would be a safer place.
the problem with realpolitik is that u only reap where u sowed
U can't expect to influence @realDonaldTrump #NoLatch! Ok?
he's a good choice
Read "Ghosts of the Assassins.
Bolton is a nutty extremist. The Bernie Sanders of the Republicans.
@waynut1_0 @RandPaul  Ok Rand Paul, you just qualified yourself as a nutjob now. I'd pick Giuliani or Bolton over you any day!
Good thing ridded world of tyrant.  Maybe diff outcome if BO/HRC had not drawn line then pull stakes, turn tail, ran.
I like u @RandPaul. Loved your dad, but it doesn't look like u will approve of anyone, so... I think it's not your job to pick.
There are bought and paid for by their masters
let's make Guliani Attorney General and he can lock Hilliary up!
And,  this is partly why his campaign failed!
@realDonaldTrump choose @RandPaul for SecState
@PKClark1980 @RandPaul  #StandWithRand he will not lead u astray n always tell u the truth believe him plz thxu God Bless..
Don't have to be repentant. Needed to be done for all. We just pulled back too soon.
But you have? What makes you so insightful and no one else?
I wish the next time we are Attacked and thousands are killed, we within days turn around and respond with overwhelming..
Dr Paul I'm a fan of you and Mr Trump, so who do you suggest he choose?  Remember a boss can instruct.
Personally I'd recommend you be considered.  Do you think you could work for DT?
->  @RandPaul is clueless.  Its why he never  got past first base in primaries.
why is not Rand Paul in running for sec of state???
because @Rand Paul had the courage to say anyone who claims only they can fix it does not get libertarian support!
The problem wasn't the war.  The problem was in the nation building afterwards?
Senator, I don't know about Rudy, but bull dog Bolton should be allowed anywhere neat the State Department.
Bulldog Bolton perception about diplomacy, is like Netanyahu idea of peace. To put it bluntly  its Warped.
its time that this country abort itself from the pregnancy fail ideas of the past. Bolton is a Nucleus waiting to explode
okay and what about Obama allowing 1.3 billion to Iran, or 1 million + a year to Pakistan who harbored Bin Laden etc
Finally something that makes some sense coming out of your pie hole.
Just lost my vote Rand!
MORONS!!!
Donald Trump loves the poorly educated. #CheesyDon
What do the other 99 Senators think?  I don't care what 1/100 of the decision makers thinks.
Coming out swinging
Go Rand!
Got Sand? Rand?..@realDonaldTrump
Bolton is one of the few with his head well set over his shoulders. Yah bless him.
I agree with Dr Paul on Bolton.  Giuliani, maybe learned his lesson after that
EXACTLY!!!!!!!!!
I am thinking that Rand Paul looks like the scarecrow in the Wizard Of Oz.
really rand Paul? Anyone in world but Bolton? That's why you got bounced early in primaries - don't fight petty fights
it takes Rand Paul of all people to speak the truth
-Rand is very intelligent!
Bolton did repent, he's a singer now!
LOL
Get lost Rand. He's a dope just like his dad.
pathetic GOP elites trying to make Giuliano &Bolten unqualified for SCOUS. Its a shame
Why now.! Pathitics
@casey2513 @RandPaul So who is your choice Rand?
Guiliani also let them destroy the WTC and kill thousands of Americans on his watch. Also Denies attacks prior to Obama.
John Bolton would be put our enemies on notice as Secretary of State!
Agreed
that's why nobody wanted r paul. He's as bad as obama.

Rand Paul not happy with Giuliani or Bolton. Jill Stein says send 2.1 million to make them accountable.
I like rand Paul
But yet Rand you're an over glorified overrated politician that failed to run for president.
ad hominem logical fallacy. Do not pass go, do not collect $200.
I really like Rand! He gets it! We all need a magnet that says Defend America! 
He's right. Bolton and his neo con friends want to turn the military into beat cops/ social workers. Force fed Democracy.
#silenceiscompliance
So, who listens to you - a member of the Swamp - any more?? (A Deplorable)
I have to agree. If trump chooses Romney, I will trust his judgement
Rand I think your hair curlers were wound too tightly again!
yeah Rand! Can't you see the answer is trillions more dollars and millions more deaths!
Tucker Carlson! Bravo! Keep up the good work.
Good interview. Agree both of them are bad choices, hope Trump sees it that way too. Romney could help unite factions.
I agree. Although I feel like someone would always need to be peering over his shoulder, JUST to make sure ..
and mitt is not bad for him?
