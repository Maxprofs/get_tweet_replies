@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI The majority of the American people don't want it repealed. Only you politicians do.
you are mistaken. Repeal it all and let the free market do its job.
The free market was doing a job alright. Denying coverage to me and to my son's chronic asthma. Polls show majority want to keep ACA.
who's fault is that? Mine? Other Americans? No. So don't ask we pay
just don't ask other insured people to pick up the tab
That's the whole point. This should be a single pay solution.
then don't call it insurance. Words have meaning. But just the same, when did my bills become your responsibility?
since ACA was enacted, healthcare costs have come down. And, they are rising at a slower rate than before. ER's expensive
@SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump income tax penalizes working Americans for being productive.
consumption tax is fair. Makes everyone a taxpayer. Repeal income tax
fight to make that happen please
Sooo Sessions lied like Flynn, and your defense is he "said" he would recuse himself if necessary? Boy
how did you become a politician with that argument
@WendyDamron @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI yuppers
The US Citizens want Obamacare gone! Finished! Removed. It has taken time but we now know what it is!
agreed! @senrobportman @SenSherrodBrown
MIKE It's your turn pal..step up and make this happen. DO NOT wait any longer! #MAGA
.@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Our #ACA insurance needs far outweigh typical party lines. All incumbents should fear our vote. #utpol
If you can repeal with 51 you should, but also replace, don't leave people in the lurch.
WORK with them and get something done, stop fighting over bills!
Can they do that with 51 votes not 60?  I thought that was the issue?
2 yrs ago they KNEW Obama would never sign it so it was simply theatre for @SpeakerRyan
@FBI arrest these men. They knew about Sessions.
How come we never hear a plan to lower health care cost. We just have plans on how to buy insurance.
:  Yes, please get it done. No more excuses.  If McConnell won't push for this, he should be replaced as Majority Ldr
Keep fighting the good fight and stand strong for our new President!!  #MAGA
We want same healthcare Congress & families get & for the same price they pay
@ginareyna @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI NOW
need to weed out the rinos.
noon stop obstruction.  Political ideology before country I see.
Let's see a plan and how it compares to Obamacare.
Thank you for stdg strong on #FullRepeal!! You are the True Conservatives in Congress. God bless you!
Sir, all of you had 8 years to work on this. It is hurting our small business. Why isn't it done?
what's the replacement? You are idiots - already voted on 60 times.
#Spreadinglikewildfire
Thanks for standing up to RINO's who want to undercut President Trump. This needs to be a full replace
Do it!!
#dontfukthisup
GOP Congress passed a the bill that Obama vetoed. Trump would sign it. Why all the delay?
no.
nope
Please have a replacement prepared and ready before a full repeal. Doing anything else is irresponsible
WE DON"T WANT IT REPEALED, and what excuse is there that GOP has had all this time and no replace plan
actions have consequences. I'll haunt you for eternity
So what's your plan for replacement? Don't ask the public to agree until you have an alternative.
just to make it crystal clear. If you succeed in a #FullRepeal how are you going to make sure I don't die?
oh wait. That's YOUR day and age.
it's your job to resolve issues not just dump them. In my day and age, we fixed things that are broken, not throw them out.
I'd love to have you tell me to my face that I don't deserve health insurance because then it's too expensive for everyone else
you have yet to show me how you're going to make that happen.
I'm 26. I have a serious illness. I need health insurance
if you had I would never have been able to get health insurance due to pre-existing condition
The lie of Democrats: Healthcare is a right paid for by OPM.
ACA repeal would give millionaires an avg tax cut of $50,130 and multi-millionaires an avg tax cut of $197,340
Nobody's stopping you but yourself. You can't blame Obama anymore. You just know it will be a mistake.
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Please keep Govt out of Insurance business! Do not replace, have Torte reform, reg changes
all for it but you guys need a plan NOW!
still have yet to here a replacement plan. have had seven years and all GOP had said is "repel/replace"
Suggestion-we shld now call law ACA-not Obamacare-reminds dems of savior--will resist repeal--calling it ACA may bring more supp
THANK U
we the voters will repeal you at election time...we wont forget taking away coverage from us. Good luck
What do you propose to replace for the 20million who depend on the ACA? Still waiting!
sirs keep fighting the good fight america stands with you
@peddoc63 @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Amen! Tell us who we need to call...
respectfully, where is the plan to replace? You had 8 years to get a great plan for day 1!
That was when Obama said it cant just be repealed, but it has to be replaced. Repubs parroted since.
@peddoc63 @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI That's The Easy Part!!
^5
Appears GOP nvr thought they'd be majority, not prepared.
@EyeCandyTMGayle @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Nothing but "Repeal, the Unconstitutional Law"! No exchanges, but repeal! NADA, GONE!
10&14 GOP POWER  We Sent$2 SCF We Begged STOP ACA=We Got Screwed DONT LET THEM DO IT AGAIN REPEAL ACA
so why is the GOP controlled Gov STILL sitting on their ass and doing nothing!?
Doesn't it matter what your constituents want? We want health care, not tax cuts for thr wealthy.
@silverbird458 @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Pay attention America. They're about to gut you like a fish with Health Care!
I am one of your constituents. I oppose the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. People Will Die If You Repeal It!
still waiting on your big idea that is so much better #DoYourJob
@Depasquallers @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Thank you Sen Lee!
@Depasquallers @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI No REPLACE! No govt in healthcare!! Rinos R using REPLACE 2 stall REPEAL?
Why a half-dozen repeal votes when Obama was POTUS, and zero repeal votes yet?
#repeal repeal repeal! Replace it with NOTHING!!!!
how about you have a conversation with those of us that live in Utah on what we would like to see.
well you do not have a plan to replace it.  All talks nothing else.
sweet, copy and paste pontificating...
#RussianHackers installed #FakePresident

#DoYourJob   Investigate    Subpoena #TaxReturns
joke is on us! All 3 of you are 
One of the 6 repeal bills that B.O. vetoed should be forwarded to the President to sign!!!!
you are seriously embarrassing.
@GOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SenToomey You better repeal it!
60 times you voted. Love your Mormon values. Fuck em all. I got mine. Party before country.
come on Mike, man up and be an American.
@varadmehta @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI and then you made Paul Ryan Speaker. Bad judgement
As usual words without works. What do you think Heavenly Father thinks of your discrimination & hate?
Obamacare needs a tune up not a junkyard...
Bull Shit
The ACA has helped me greatly.  I am one of your constituents, Senator Lee.
plz have the stones to make the case that healthcare is not a right. @SenTedCruz was weak on this vs. @SenSanders
@marcorubio @TedYoho @RandPaul 
Yes please!!Full repeal #Obamacare We have greatest HC in the world! Fix insur after
good luck. GOP has no moral courage and no principles. Did @SenTedCruz even say #Full Repeal in debate w Sanders?
disgraceful & diabolical u all r. Did nothing for yrs. now hurt people that need coverage the most
@varadmehta varad: doesn't this mean ACA reform is dead for now?
I'll send my medical bills direct to Cruz office. #loseCruz2018
Or you could be an adult and pay them yourself, deadbeat.
@SpeakerRyan follow @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI suggestion
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI I would say that y'all have proven to be jock-straps for Trump's lil Cheetos. Sad about Rand.
- just get the bill pushed through. You've had 7 yrs to develop a replacement, let's do it. Get ur done
@SenTedCruz@SenRandPauI The emphasis must be on how med care works for the masses. Just get it right. Good luck.
As a women who has survived #breastcancer twice, thanks for wanting to take away my protections #resist
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI You all voted for it when you knew it wouldn't be signed. I'll believe it when I see it.
It is not govmt job to provide ppl w/health Ins. ACA mandate shd be repealed & NOT replaced. Not Law!
How would you tell the 4.4 MILLION children that you don't want them to be able to see a doctor?
GOP better start showing the public something about a replacement plan soon. No confidence is starting.
First start paying for your own #healthcare
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI so you all are for cutting health insurance? Cool.

-former Republican
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI  Just send the same bill to President Trump;hopefully, he will sign it.
@WashingtonDCTea @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI  Why in the hell was there not a bill ready Jan 20th. Republicans all f'ing BS talk
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI You work for us. You asked to, remember? Stop abusing and hating your constituents.
KEEP FIGHTING TO END THE OBAMA DEATHCARE NIGHTMARE! RAISE SOME AMERICAN HELL MAKE THEM CRY UNCLE SAM!
That's what I thought! 
What is the ceiling?
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Why do you hate America and her people? We deserve an answer, since you asked to work for us.
make NOBODY EXEMPT  from O care. Watch how fast it disappears
Just do it, please!
frist time in my 52 years making 30k a year that in up owning 599 in taxes who would have thunk it
I know you don't care that pregnant women will lose healthcare but what about the fetus?
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI ACA Repeal is #RepublicanSanctionedMurder
Repeal the "Obama" and replace it with "Trump" #TrumpCare #easyD
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI You got nothing else after 8 years of whining and opposing?
I hope you are comfortable taking heath care from the most needy. In this country we help the downtrodd
you are all party over country. How do you sleep at night?  
so what are you guys doing?
repeal it even if there is nothing to take its place.
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI tax returns
no Cadillac tax. 80% of obamacare is ore existing conditions. Repeal. Replace
, I agree let's do it!!!
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI What else you got?
push Paul Ryan out of the way! Only one exit when the house is on fire!
I believe that this was all show votes never intending  to repeal. Poor leadership
@MiltonWolfMD @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI You know why it isn't? Because they knew Obama would veto the bill.
the GOP plan will screw millions of Americans out of there insurance.
ACA has caused many middle class people who had coverage to lose it to to have premiums/deductibles so high it's useless.
you think a $1500 tax credit and an hsa is going to cut it?
Have you seen the entire Rand Paul plan?
they also want to do away with the preexisting conditions clause.
That is not true; they have a far better idea to cover pre-x conditions so it's never a problem again once implementation.
.@vikingbiker1
@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI  #StandWithRand
: try acting like adults with responsibilities and work on a replacement plan before you repeal anything.
They have a plan haven't you seen @SenRandPauI on the news multiple times recently; but Paul Ryan plan is not #FullRepeal
Rand has a great plan.
Is it available online do you know? @VoidMfg @SenRandPauI
I think these tweets are a signal for us to contact our Senators/House Rep with message #FullRepeal
agree. Hoping we can get #FullRepeal trending until tomorrow morning. I'm calling Sen Scott and Sen Graham tomorrow.
Are they voting tomorrow?
too much turmoil in government now. Make some improvements and work on bigger fix for a later date.
No more conscripts. The bully is gone. So "get 'er dun"!
@sendavidperdue Take your q re Ocare from @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Don't listen to @JohnnyIsakson or @SenateMajLdr
where is your replacement? You okay with people dying? Liberty only matters if it can be exercised.
you are literally congress. why not vote on it instead of tweeting endlessly.
It's looking like they're going 2B minority & tweets are to stir support.
Smart girl.
Sorry, pal. They're on solid ground.
@Mary86802059 @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI I have paid for my own insurance for 40 years because I made it a priority in my life
@Mary86802059 @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Did we have people dying in the streets before ACA I don't remember seeing any
Agreed! "The ACA is hereby fully repealed." Elegantly simple. You're the Man, Senator Lee! Go Lee go!
worthless CINO. Glad I don't believe in fairy tales.
repealing ACA really means being a Christian. 20 million people? Who gives a rats ass. Party before god
2 million went on obamacare. The rest were pushed on single payer medicare.
Far more people lost coverage because of ACA than gained it; plus it's a job killer.
don't be stupid, it doesn't look good on you.
That is just the facts.
.@joe_r_hooker @ZTedster
Lynn , Lynn! You believe that?
I believe that all federal employees should be required to use the healthcare replacement package. @GOP
The RINOs would repeal in a heartbeat had they been forced under Obamacare.
Those were fig leaf votes for fundraising. Now that their bluff is called they fold. They're LIARS.
No, they're very much for real; you haven't seen Rand Paul on TV multiple times recently advocating his replacement plan?
.@ZTedster http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2017/01/the-real-changes-in-health-insurance-enrollment-under-the-affordable-care-act …
this current lolly-gagging suggests those efforts were a joke-purely political. Prove me WRONG...
agreed.
C'mon Mike don't perform for these goons, you know better! Besides you're my representative, not theirs
mike i appreciate the effort you put into this tweet, but you linked the wrong @RandPaul account
Oh right, you don't care 
Lee, Cruz, Paul: They are a part of the few who really do care.
Nope
I can't believe the incompetence of the GOP, didn't you have a plan? What will  people who have ACA do?
It is the RINOs lying, not Lee, Cruz, or Paul. The RINOs only care for themselves, NOT the USA
Please.
Explain why average citizen cannot have the same health insurance as Fed Employees. Plz.
You do realize how spiteful and insensitive that attitude is, when so many of your constituents have benefited greatly from it?
What about tens of millions of us hard working taxpayers who were damaged, losing our insurance? We don't count?!
More have been harmed by ACA than helped; just saw stats earlier this week; plus it's a job killer. #FullRepeal
Agreed. ACA will cause irreparable damage if not repealed outright. The market must run the medical industry.
I think these tweets are a signal for us to contact our Senators/House Rep with message #FullRepeal
You tagged the wrong guy! His handle is @RandPaul
Healthcare - incentives to cover, tort relief, catistrophic care grants-insurors take pre, 26yr old kid
Total repeal and free enterprise will sort it out, quickly and efficiently.
Less than 20% of Americans want a #FullRepeal. I'm all for minority interests, but not #MinorityTyranny
I seriously doubt that 20% number.
