@RandPaul hahaha..thats the dumbest thing you said today
@sweettweettdude @RandPaul awww...socialists are so mad because they love big government!  It'll all be okay. I promise.
@JustinSzew309 @RandPaul yes I love my library ..my cops..my fire fighters..my gov workers plowing snow..but not mad #NothingButLove
@sweettweettdude @RandPaul Yup...but you also love paying burger flippers 15/hr.  Raising taxes doesn't help cops. It helps lazy burnouts.
@JustinSzew309 @RandPaul the police force we have today is a form of socialism
@sweettweettdude @RandPaul I've got to hear this...please explain why you think our current police force is a form of socialism.
@JustinSzew309 @RandPaul DUDE..I  dont have time to teach politics..we ALL chip in & get services..cops..fire..schools..libraries #Socialism
@RandPaul #SaveThePlanet ... oh i forgot. you are a Repub that doesn't believe in Climate Change. typical .. typical
@Social_Johnny There is a HUGE difference between "that problem doesn't exist" and "it's being handled wrong." Do not conflate the two.
@RobNacc there is but you first have to acknowledge that the problem exist in order for you to "handle" anything
@Social_Johnny @RobNacc Rand Paul did that. He said it exists. But forcing regulation just moves jobs to countries with no regulation.
@johnbeeney101 @Social_Johnny @RobNacc that's the worst argument I've ever heard
@neutralidiot @johnbeeney101 @Social_Johnny How? Give me one reason why that wasn't a good argument. Just one.
@RobNacc @neutralidiot @johnbeeney101 mixture of deregulation & trade policies that has already seen jobs move out this country since 2000s
@Social_Johnny Strong benefit of outsourcing has always been a lack of regulations abroad. Increasing them here will only encourage that.
@RandPaul I feel bad for your former patients
@Trumps1stMember @RandPaul lol you're a trump supporter which means you're a liberal.  Nobody cares what you think
@JustinSzew309 @RandPaul Are you aware there has never been a human born on earth named Justin with an IQ over 38. Prob not huh Justin
@Trumps1stMember @RandPaul Hahaha definitely a Trump supporter.  What is it like being such a moron?  You're all so predictable. It's cute.
@JustinSzew309 @RandPaul Youre projecting again 'Justin'
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly

Here's Some Climate Bull-Shit
@MrToaste @RandPaul @TaylorEgly If this is "Science" then I should be able to put a bra on my head and create a supermodel w/ a Ferrari, lol
@unameitdestin @RandPaul @TaylorEgly

For a Second there LOL
@MrToaste @RandPaul @TaylorEgly "Weird Science" movie was mid 80's, I guess they were trying to figure out how 2 explain ice-age turning >
@MrToaste @RandPaul @TaylorEgly > into global meltdown and still be believable. Never explained, expect us to believe. Fantasy like movie
@MrToaste @RandPaul @TaylorEgly Id rather "believe" in Kelly LeBrock giving me a Ferrari than the gov. Hoax that's costing us $$$
@MrToaste @RandPaul @TaylorEgly How do these people sell this BS w/ a straight face? Oh, almost forgot, politicians, no conscience required
@RandPaul @alllibertynews I  you rand Paul 
@randpaul Check out the guayusa mission on google its huge for helping sustainability
@RandPaul @SusanCoach4 RAND PAUL FOLLOW THE PEOPLE,ENDORSE TRUMP!WE R TAKING OUR Country BACK and VOTE BACK.U WOULD VE AN ASSET TO THE TEAM!
@RandPaul @alllibertynews say no to TAX
@RandPaul rekt
@RandPaul @alllibertynews The voluminous IRS forms and procedures are so convoluted it's ridiculous. Flat Tax-easy and fair across the board
@RandPaul @alllibertynews I  you rand Paul 
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly looll
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly how about @RandPaul  for supreme court
@RandPaul @alllibertynews And say yes to hemp!
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly I agree! I'll stick with Trump!
@alllibertynews Why are you still talking?
@RandPaul @alllibertynews axe TAX
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Outstanding point!
@RandPaul @alllibertynews after working for several DOE contractors, gov is the biggest waste of paper and money.
@RandPaul Bagging on Bernie isn't going to get you into the WH. Get the 28 redacted pages released/leaked/whatever.
@Casandra_aqui @RandPaul if he got the 28 pages leaked, he could not say he had a part of it Only Hillary could do that and get away with it
@johnbeeney101 Hillary would eat them before she would release them. If Hillary is POTUS they wont see the light of day. @RandPaul
@RandPaul @alllibertynews really SIR...geeezzzzeee
@RandPaul Funny !
@RandPaul @alllibertynews but millions of trees are cut down for Christmas! And then  throw to the curb...
@randpaul 
Hi.I am to be connected.
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly AND .... TRUMP !!!! AMEN !!!!
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly #RandallCarlson https://youtu.be/R31SXuFeX0A 
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly  We should , private sector & Govt sectorr immediately decrease  consumption of  trees &  promote  tree implantation
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly what? The state our country is in and you are worried about trees...get your priorities straight!
@randpaul @tayloregly (235,757 followers) Thank's for following: i appreciate it. Keep Brightmind: http://www.facebook.com/Fathonie.AbdullahGafur.5 …
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly 500 trees. For the country that's not bad.   Regardless of who's running, the IRS should charge fees if you want paper
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly if we dont stop we will all die. Trees give us life & in turn we give them what they need ... symbiotic relationships
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly  But Bernie, you need to take action, this world has to take action, NOW
@RandPaul @48THPOTUS  lol this guy good stuff
@RandPaul @alexryanhannah Big government correlation is obvious.
@RandPaul I'd rather say NO to all your Republican constituents.
@RandPaul @TaylorEgly have some great policy's my hope if ya don't win you have a position where ya can make real change your a positive
@RandPaul Or, I dunno, work to digitize the tax forms?
@RandPaul What an idiot tweet
@RandPaul @TheNationOfCoop  that's the dumbest thing he has ever said and that's a competitive category.
@RandPaul Easy fix dipshit. Make industrial hemp legal. Which Bernie will do. Stop the scapegoating of hemp #votehemp #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul You were my favorite Republican till you bashed Sanders instead of Hillary.  That woman is evil.
@RandPaul @ThreeBlindMice6 clever
@RandPaul @Fmiranda94 trees are not the issue
@RandPaul Save the planet Say no to Rand Paul #DemTownHall
Sorry Rand, at least @berniesanders and the Democrats show up when the American people want to hear what they have to say. @RandPaul
@fixbrokenstuff @berniesanders @randpaul please you and Rand just move 2 Venezuela and get in line for a free bag of spaghetti in a 4hr line
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmPWpJG7Z_s … @BenCartwright58
@fixbrokenstuff ooooo what an unbelievable find...I can't believe we were supporting an imperfect mere mortal capable of making mistakes lol
@RandPaul fun fact, there exists a farm/forest where trees are grown SPECIFICALLY for making paper to not harm other areas of trees.
@RandPaul what ever you say rand pulp
@RandPaul Appreciate your humor! : ) #WeAreBernie
@RandPaul  Brilliant statistic.
@RandPaul @DarfishIzady funny
@RandPaul plant a Dem ..between the hot air and the bullshit the trees be just fine...
@RandPaul "drops mic"
@RandPaul @StudyingLiberty 
The only thing he had said yet that I agree with.
@RandPaul Save the air and water. Regulate and tax corporations. Make them charge the full cost of their products and let consumers decide.
@RandPaul @Ianblaster I'm unfollowing you
@RandPaul  go outside and play. You not invited to this party Paul
@RandPaul "killing 500k trees a year" like it is a terrible unsustainable industry! #forestrylife
@RandPaul how about all the trees killed for the Rand Paul printed material. That my friend is a real waste.
@RandPaul landowners are doing the same when they can get information and have their forests certified so don't go around saying we are
This would be a good point coming from an 8-year-old but probably not an adult running for prez. It's a mystery why you're losing @RandPaul
@iamchrisscott @RandPaul then sure, keep the 2000 pages long tax system to pay tax that goes to foreign aid n bailing out banks n corporates
@RandPaul the US is planting more trees than we are harvesting most industrial timber companies are growing sustainable fiber and many
Seriously @RandPaul please focus on the 28 redacted pages. You are uniquely positioned to make it happen.
@RandPaul the amount of people paying taxes is not based on the amount you pay. You don't need more paper based on the amount of money.
@RandPaul stop pretending like you give a damn about a tree.
@RandPaul @otos_austin savage
@JoshEisenhower8 @RandPaul he's whipping up a Bernie storm
@RandPaul You do not have a career in comedy ahead. Same with politics #loser
@RandPaul You're great, but if you can just accept that climate change is legit I'll love you forever
@RandPaul no Bernie means no more tax forms? Let's not be disingenuous about this. Forms will be printed every year. Nobody is ridding taxes
@RandPaul less loopholes for the rich, less paperwork, Rand
@RandPaul dumb and lame !
@RandPaul don't listen to them Rand. Their uneducated. They know not what they speak off
@RandPaul maybe we can start using computer
I'm glad my taxes go to these programs @RandPaul They'll work better when we help #Bernie #getmoneyout
#Bernie2016
@OthewhomaniT @RandPaul Please government, save me from my liberties and self determination! You know better than I ever could! Please!
You don't #getit Government is of, by, for people & protects ur ass @Purest_99 from @RandPaul & #GOP who want to privatize w no protections
@OthewhomaniT @RandPaul I own guns for my protection.
Yeah...you can't shoot your way out of #oligarchy @Purest_99 @RandPaul Like I said you don't get it. Blocked for willful ignorance
@RandPaul this is almost as bad as something trump would say
@RandPaul @karecki1 

When did the GOP start caring about the environment?

1 hr ago?

#ilovelakes
#DemTownHall
@Kurtis_E_Flush0 @alllibertynews @RandPaul @karecki1 Conservatives do care about the environment- we just don't like the Feds telling us how
@RandPaul Never heard of paperless?
@RandPaul Lol that's your anti-Bernie campaign? We know he's the candidate that can get republicans & Dems in congress to work together
@RandPaul 
That's awesome. How about "save the endangered animals, farm and eat them"
@RandPaul @jjauthor not a support of his but you can still raise taxes and get rid of the paper.  Just sayin
@RandPaul think you forgot which side you are on. ...
@RandPaul .... Say no to Democrats. My head hurt watching it. Felt like I Was watching Honey Booboo
@RandPaul come on, you would make a fantastic Vice President for #BernieSanders. Represent the middle class for a change.
@RandPaul RAND JUST MADE A MORTAL KOMBAT FINISHING MOVE! BERNIE GOES DOWN
@MGrantArsenal @RandPaul the current tax code is nonsense.
@RandPaul about to watch you on @seanhannity
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Save a tree don't file your tax return.
This is a really strong argument @RandPaul. Maybe after your nap I'll bring you your crayons and some safety scissors.
@RandPaul I think you're reaching with that one, good effort though :-)
@RandPaul how about we just print one version.. English!!!!
@RandPaul so, we don't have to file taxes if you're president??
@RandPaul Paperless Audit the Fed. Is that why we don't have the Clinton Emails yet? #papertrail
@RandPaul *whoosh* Swing and a miss
@RandPaul seriously??????????
@RandPaul Now that's just fucking stupid. 500k trees are less than .5% of trees, and guess what? They grow back. #DemTownHall
@RandPaul I'm loving your twitter game tonight, Sir! Lol
@KathrynHaushalt @RandPaul  I'm liking it better than the Seinfeld thing he did a couple months ago
@hedeen89 @RandPaul I must have missed that.  He's pretty funny tonight, though.
@RandPaul love it
@RandPaul these tweets are the EXACT reason why Rand will never win. He's trolling, while otter candidates are classy. Plus that hair.....
@RandPaul I would hope that if the IRS doesn't go bye-bye...you would support eliminating the SSTAX cap. What a scam on Americans!
@RandPaul file electronically
@RandPaul Trust me. You want Bernie to win the nomination. He'll get crushed in the general.
@RandPaul Bern does away with tax forms - he simply takes all your money and everything else is FREE! What a joke he is.
@RandPaul #DemTownHall the tax system is to blame for climate change? At least you said climate change, that's a start
@RandPaul Oh, FFS.
@RandPaul you arnt even relevant. .go away "Dr."
@RandPaul since you don't believe in climate change STFU
@RandPaul FYI, in case you've missed.  We do electronic filing now. We've progressed to 21st century.
@RandPaul And of course that is @BernieSanders fault. If you want people to take your candidacy seriously you've to be better than this !
@RandPaul Are you drinking? How can you think that is clever?
@RandPaul I'm a climate change believer but I kekked
@RandPaul lolol damn.
@RandPaul he also failed to mention terrorism as one of our major problems...... Dude is a clown
@RandPaul could you produce some evidence to back this up?
@RandPaul "Trees are killed"? I'm an environmentalist and even I can't believe you just said that. #DemTownHall #Bernie2016
@RandPaul may be my favorite tweet of the night
@RandPaul 4 separate ideas in 1 sentence. ^ #what
@RandPaul Electronic taxes
@RandPaul HA
Extraordinary reasoning my dear @RandPaul. More than making up for the exit of Piyush Jindal.
@RandPaul ugh, you're the worst
@RandPaul you gotta take the L on climate change!
@RandPaul winner of the Internet
@rosesandrevelry @RandPaul he really gets us millennials
@RandPaul Shameful. If you don't think climate change is a serious issue, then you can't be serious about the future of humanity
@RandPaul been sitting on that one 
@RandPaul True that. How gov't taxing people and so many of them always need help doing it. Always making shit complicated.
@RandPaul not to mention govt printing money to try to stay on top of debt!
@KatherineDurde1 @RandPaul Just FYI, money is not made of paper. It's cotton and linen. No trees are harmed.
@ChrisMarsh4 @KatherineDurde1 @RandPaul wow, it really is the fabric of our lives! $
@RandPaul NICE!
@RandPaul I think you are they guy America is saying no to. You are no where in the polls and Bernie is killing it.
@RandPaul At least you're having fun
@randpaul  Bernie has always spoken highly of you.
@BinghamtonDaily @RandPaul Bernie speaks highly of everyone.
@RandPaul killing it as always. #StandWithRand #DemTownHall
@RandPaul this comment wins
