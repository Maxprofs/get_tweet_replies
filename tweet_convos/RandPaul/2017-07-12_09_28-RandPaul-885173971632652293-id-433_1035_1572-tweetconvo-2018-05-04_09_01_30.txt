Your strategy worked to perfection!
They found the Monolith 2001.  Bill Clinton should had been kicked out of office the minute the DOE uranium and plutonium was missing. @CNN
Al Gore was very pissed off at Bill Clinton.  Mid 90's
Congress & Senate should be required to use the new healthcare. Maybe then they'll appreciate the impact their decisions have on us.
FULL REPEAL the American people are counting on you. Don't vote for a phony bill @SenMikeLee @tedcruz
The free market can and will, if given a chance, control costs. #Artcle 5 convention. Thank you for representing THE PEOPLE!!
Where's the Repeal!!! Let the free market have its way. Every insurance co. for him/herself. #whathappenedtofreedom
Think we need to just fix medical costs, make insurance companies except preconditioning diseases.medical not entitlement.
The GoP and the Dems are in it together. We were promised repeal, that is "repeal" now the repubs are pushing repeal and replace. $$$$$
Trump wants a repeal too.  Stick to your guns.  State welfare can supply health care to the poor like they were doing before O care.
Again, stick to your guns! #FullRepeal only!
Time to vote out any @GOP congress members who vote to keep obamacare... guess they did not learn from last election! REPEAL FIRST!!
We did not vote Republican--We voted for DJT who happened to be repub! NO ALLEGIANCE TO ANYONE NOT WORKING FOR US!! Maybe time for INDEP!
@POTUS promised repeatedly while on campaign stump he'd ask for #RepealACA. He's as culpable as the @GOP in my book. Where's his voice? Zip
Trump started the repeal/replace immediately, same day with better ins that covers EVERYONE & he swore not to touch Medicaid. #LIARS
And yet here we are hearing ACA care and mandates will virtually be intact in new GOP bill. That's not keeping his word...unless he vetoes.
My comment was sarcasm
..............
We have to get this bill right. I don't care if it takes longer just get it right. Mental illness, drug rehabilitation and pre-existing too!
Laughter is good for the soul.
Support Cassidy - Collins, a proposal to reform Health Care access, and NOT another deficit-increasing tax cut handout for rich folke.
Repeal. Should be the only option now. Too many RINOs in DC.
You know better than most that you need a super-majority to get REPEAL through Senate. Can't be done ~ Yet
You and Kasich new better than to take Medicaid and go wild with it so you could be re elected. Shame on both of you!!!!!
Please stop it!  #fullrepeal
Then convince them to your solution but get it done no excuses we are sick of this BS!!!!
We can still dance https://youtu.be/GZaoarJz8Gg 
That is right! A bunch of corporate socialist that know nothing about TRUE capitalism, sportsmanship and survival of the fittest!
Crap! Why can't #GOP get it right. If GOP can't #repeal the monster #Obamacare like they said they would, they'll lose seats 2 Dems in 2018
We don't want it! Let the Dems own this
You got any better http://suggestions.you  had 7yrs to do this well why complain ,no work ethics in washington.its what's in it for me.
If it was the same, democrats would vote for it. You have a duty to the people yovite fit the new bill.
Ridiculous
Amazing isn't it. 8 years to make a plan and a very willing President and all we get is this nonsense.
#IStandwithRand get govt out of healthcare and give us a free market.
@sizzlesride @YouTube
Just repeal.
We stand with Rand! #FreeMarketOnly! #FULLREPEALONLY! #UnitedforFreedom!
Thank you sir for standing strong #FullRepeal we at #unitedforfreedom are in your corner. #standwithrand
#ThanksForStandingWithThePeopleForFullRepeal 
#StandWithRand 
#CongressDoYourJob
#UnitedForFreedom
Thanks for keeping up to date.  Sounds like i don't like the new version
Thank you Senator Paul!! You're right! This new bill does not work! 
#StandWithRand
#FullRepeal
#CongressDoYourJob
#UnitedForFreedom
The so-called leadership is committed to big govt, K Street & DC control over the citizenry. This betrayal will be repaid at the ballot box.
Mitch needs to go. What a joke on the country.
Why does my govt continually bailout those we HAVE to give our money to rather than those giving the money?
@SenMikeLee @tedcruz @SenRonJohnson, REPEAL Obamacare. #KillTheBill2. Let's try something new:  Keep your word; deliver on your promise.
REGULATE INSURANCE AND PHARMA before anything else.  Stop lobbyists and drug commercial money.  THEN begin to restructure healthcare.
Keep fighting the good fight.  These Republicans would be lost without your leadership.  Stand tall.  Trump and Pence are idiots on this.
You can't nurse a lame horse to health by working it.... FULL REPEAL OF ACA!! NOW!!
If Repubs capitulate now, the Republican Party will die off and single payer will become a reality.  FULL COURT PRESS ON FULL REPEAL!!
Sen. Paul thank you for standing on conservative values. Stuck in ca. Don't have input. Stay with it
I think the bailout language is wrong here. Saying bailout suggests the ins cos are at fault for losing money, when the gov't is the reason.
I agree with you totally on ideas, but I think your rhetoric, at times, uses leftist premises.
Senator Paul, why are democr...er...Republican leaders not listening to us? Why are they betraying the people?
, an enhanced Medicare for all would be cheaper in combined state and federal costs, insure all, and make America more competitive
Repeal OBcare, make associations for biz..we will b able to afford insur. again.
Thx
Sounds like someone preparing to cast his vote to keep ObamaCare ~
#FullRepeal. How many times do the American people have to vote for elected officials to hear us? Listen to the votes and not #Resistance
@POTUS. ..what are you doing????. Repeal please.
@debra_bonanno @YouTube 
REPEAL, REPEAL, REPEAL.. obama ruined healthcare insurance forEVER
Something now.this is your once in a lifetime opportunity with a majority and a republican president. God bless you and family
We are suffering with Obamacare and you all need to learn to give up some and compromise cos Obamacare is imploding.Please help us and do
Mr. Paul, I admire you a lot, but I believe you should find a common ground with that passing of this healthcare bill. People are suffering
@realDonaldTrump  Stand with Rand on this.. American people want what was promised. Govt out of healthcare. #freedom  # liberty
Do your best to provide the Best plan and get everyone in board! Prayers and Blessings! Dems don't give a **** about us!
I stand with Rand on this
You better do something no matter what in the next two weeks so we can get to tax cuts or you guys will be toast in 2018
The longer it goes on the further down the rabbit hole we go.
Vote no
A better health care bill would be the elimination of the HMO'S controlover our health care decisions
Time republicans start acting like republicans and stop acting like democrats.
The medical assoc.,doesn't need a bailout they make enough money off of the workers backs
Thank you!!
Maybe don't endorse McConnel
We need to drain the swap of these career so called republicans, they campaigned on repealing Obamacare, but they r making the bill worse
You all are a joke - het aomething done!
So sad....REPEAL IT ALL...please...
Your right. Pool us independent contractors together and it will keep healthcare cost down.Thats what we had before. Thx for trying.
Can't we get rid of @SenateMajLdr, s repubs follow Trump's lead AND KEEP PROMISES.  OLD SCHOOL, OLD WAY NEEDS TO GO. The senate does nothing
Then get rid of Obamacare and let free enterprise take over again
Your starting to sound like a broken record...you had enough time eight years and did nothing? Most people would get fired in the real life.
Don't know how you keep your marriage because in the Senate you are an obstructionist holier than thou PITA.
Get it together Rand Paul we didn't vote for you .we voted for President Trump you need to do your job or we will vote you out ....
Thank you Rand for standing for freedom and choice. Big government is bad for all of us. GA reps & sens are not listening to the people.
I hear you are trying to pad your bank account over the healthcare bill. 
Bad idea !
Who names their kid Rand?
Only in Kentucky!
If you don't support it, neither will I. @realDonaldTrump, are you listening?
Please refuse to vote for this garbage. At some point Obamacare will collapse.
I'm over this garbage plan. Tired of my taxes paying for others insurances. No bail out, it's a bad Bill. No preexisting after start of plan
Cute.   Why can't you simply repeal Obamacare like you all said you would?  Why should we reelect any of you?  You can't do one simple task!
You need to be a little flexible, a new health care plan is needed to support the people who were given a false bill of goods under ACS.
I doubt that this congress has the ability to send any bill to President Trump that @RandPaul will vote for.
Do not let them ruin the country, we are counting on you Sir.
Rand Paul should crawl back under his Goddamned rock. And stay there.
There bull headed. Keep on them.
Pete Townshend does not approve of this Senator.
And another thing. Why can't ANY ONE of you stand up against the Democrats in regards to the continued BS we're having to endure.
LIARS!!! You're all liars! This is NOT what the majority wants! You republicans are weak as HELL!
@RandPaul pretty much the only responsible member of the senate.
Please keep fighting for us , Rand
sounds much worse. So what's the next?
And the difference between Republicans and Democrats is?  Pubs want your freedom and your money. Dems want your money and your freedom.
REPEAL REPEAL REPEAL. Congress stop stealing OUR money and giving it to industries you let profit and DESTROY. What kick backs this time???
Ocare is a money laundering scheme. Billions went in to "set up" exchanges/fund that were Medicaid expansions & $ shows bk up in DC or Pacs.
Tell your colleagues if they pass a bailout for healthcare companies ... they will have a mob worse than the tea party on Capital Hill!! 
I support this. Full repeal is necessary and thats mr President promised us during campaign. Anythinflg less is a slap on the face.
We know you will do the right thing, unlike one of Texas senators "Jc"
You are my senator. Why aren't enough people willing to work together?  It is all so distasteful
Keep fighting senator Paul.
@GOP:THE LAST SIX YEARS REPEAL O-CARE & REPLACE IT WITH A POLICY FOR ALL AND YOU FAILED AS WE SEE AND THE GOP HAS HSE, SEN, POTUS! U R FIRED
You want to keep Obamacare? #sickening
Can't you please compromise & go with this new bill so we can get on? Can't understand this hard line stupidity that's stalling our economy.
Shit Sandwhich
What is it @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan not hearing from we the people?
Full repeal the damn thing already. 
2018/20
@RandPaul don't let this bill pass, we want your bill.
Reason for the lack of freedom language in healthcare legislation is D & R agreement in Sal Alinsky politics concerning healthcare control
I dont understand the GOP.  They will get blamed for not bailing out O-care and now they will get blamed for this incompetent Bill.
@AnnCoulter @limbaugh @LouDobbs @seanhannity Rand Paul is doing all he can to stop Dems & GOP f/ transforming America into Obama's image!
Kill that bill
Love you man, but might have to compromise. I wish Hamilton never existed and Jefferson was still in office but here we are.
How about a congressional vote of no confidence of its leadership, McCarthy, Scalise, Ryan, McConnell? Send them packing!
486,000 Kentuckians will lose health care if the ACA is repealed. How can you be so cruel to your own neighbors?
"We" really do need to defeat @SenateMajLdr & @PRyan in their next election.
Broken campaign promises. 
Hang tough Sir
why can't we look at health care reform in stages? refinement is a process colored by real world outcomes.
Could be worse, could have been like Democrats and just passed it regardless.
it's only PHASE 1 ok Rand? get the bill passed immediately!
When Meeting with Mike Pence He Will Lie To you About Trump care it stinks @JohnKasich @GeorgeWill @BillKristol @GenMhayden
It's past time to get #GovtOutOfHealthcare #MAGA
GREAT song! 
Sadly we will again and again and again....
Sadly #PoliticsIsAllAboutTheMoney
Sadly you are wrong, #PoliticsIsAllAboutThePower money is just a conduit for achieving it.
Presumption is noted. Honest difference of opinions
Where is the beef? REPEAL Every Word. @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
Repeal only for now
Keep up the fight! Repeal that sham!
You seriously need to get on board with compromise and negotiations. It isn't "your ideological" way. Regulate commerce. It's your duty.
How much are you willing to sell out?
please at least repeal, end penalties
I voted for those that said Repeal. There was never a replace. I thought congress was writing bill not lobbiest!
Love it. I thought the repubs would do better than that.  I erred. The swamp absorbs all apparently.
Restore public confidence by restoring our liberties. As you said, ACA is modern day slavery. #Obamacare #healthcare #NegativeLiberty
So you just want to leave HusseinCare in place then?
Good. I'm glad you're looking out for our negative liberties. It seems only a handful are. We were promised FULL REPEAL of #Obamacare
Not a surprise
It's not about the people
It's pure greed
Obama & Dems didn't care what 1/2 the nation wanted for healthcare. Why does the GOP?
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY OVER THE HEALTH CARE BILL! WE THE PEOPLE LOVE YOU! VOTE NO FOR ME PLEASE. I STAND WITH YOU!
Where's the repeal bill the @GOP passed for 7 years until we won the Whitehouse, now nothing?
Be a Positive Force, stop sounding like a Curmudgeon! Do U want a Dem bill?
Do not repeal or replaced   let  Obama
So disgusted with the GOP, time to vote them all out!!
That's BS. What the hell they thinking? Liberals should be rejoicing.
Fire McConnell...He's working against President agenda!!
Please vote no.... I'll never be able to respect you if you vote for this
U are an obstructionist like the Dems. If u don't bend & find middle ground for us, u will find yourself out of the Senate next time around!
Then for God's sake stop complaining about it and help to fix it! All you seem to be about everything is negative. Fix it Senator!
NO, NO, NO, NO. STOP! Repeal, or GOP will lose!!
How do they STILL not give a shit about what the people want?
All Rep Senators called for Full Repeal..They lied!! Question?? Why not stop the dance with the CBO and work with them on Bill. ??
That's because the GOP really wants single payer just like dems. You are stabbing your voters in the back as usual
Oh, Senator. You don't mind spending. You just don't like when it doesn't circle back into your own pocket.
Rand, 15 minutes and a crayon to rewrite the health care bill.......
That's great Rand. Working class can't afford the premiums and it's always gotta be your way or nothing. Thanks a lot.
Sad
#FullRepeal
Thank you.
Everything the government touches turns to 
Agreed 100%.  Why we need to return to limited gov and libertarian constitutionalist policies
Whatever it is you don't like it , like your dad. Obviously anything to stop Trumps agenda ! Glad you didn't b/c pres !
