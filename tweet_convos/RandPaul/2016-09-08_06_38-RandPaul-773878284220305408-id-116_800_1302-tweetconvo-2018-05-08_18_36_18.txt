Apparently you missed the part where she helps them transition into clean-energy jobs... @RandPaul @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn
what clean energy jobs? We have nothing!
because I can't afford to pay 42% taxes so illegals and refugees can have a good life
So much stupidity here. Where do I begin?
1) I highly, highly doubt you pay 42% in taxes.
@Becauseofbrave
2) Illegal immigrants don't get benefits, but they do provide billions to Social Security 
@Becauseofbrave
Hillary said she will give millions of illegal immigrants full healthcare coverage.
Ugh, please show me where she said that.  Or do u make this up as u go?
look it up! Even Chelsea said it. I'm sure there video.
@TOVAOD @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn
I want a president who can give the inaugural address standing up. @realDonaldTrump #Deplorables #ClintonCollapse 
And maybe she could help us Veterans get the help we need, no one else is not even you
"We're sorry. The person you are trying to reach has become disconnected. Please check your number and try again" #HillarysHealth
@JustHillbilly @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn  

OBAMA : #HillaryClinton is the biggest fraud in politics.
you should endorse @realDonaldTrump
@kayleighmcenany @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn Rand surely you are not in the climate changes hoax club ?
And you'd prefer staying with dirty fossil fuels rather than transition to clean energy jobs?
RT @calidakotagirl RT. @RandPaul
.@HillaryClinton should use $ from @ClintonFdn to shore up miner's pensions. After all, it's her agenda that bankrupted the coal industry.
maybe Trump could donate from the foundation he regularly steals money from but doesn't donate to
#StandWithRand
Hillary destroyed the coal industry and the nation gets to pay higher prices for electricity.
#neverhillary, corrupt to the core!!
@TrustyGordon @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn 

Come now Rand!  You can't expect her to share her blood money... She's got use for it
@kayleighmcenany @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn And #DirtyDonnie should start making things right with all those charities getting 0$
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn Randy man, how much have taken care of your home?
even worse now illegals are being hired by outta state contractors to do all local work
U should B honest w/ the miners & tell them it's the future that's hurting their jobs
So you think that somehow Hillary Clinton finangled the low natural gas prices?
@SL_OKC @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn Good one!
Right.  The lack of coal to mine had nothing to do with the coal industry dying. The mines are mined out!   @RandPaul @kayleighmcenany
Interesting idea - I don't know enough about Clinton Fdn to know what they fund...
@kayleighmcenany @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn This doesn't look like a confidential email so why would it have a header?
Oil industry is next. What the hell, do the natural gas industry also. Then maybe farmers andStarveUs?
Great idea Rand. #NeverHillary
This picture is worth a 1000 words.
@RegularJoseph1 @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn Why don't you just do what God told you to do & go back to saving poor kids sight?
@kayleighmcenany @HillaryClinton 
Lets just "take the Oil""Build a WALL around the Oil","Put a DOOR in that wall" then huuh insult
@nepafortrump @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn great idea
@kayleighmcenany @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn Thought you might be better than that Rand Paul. Shame on you .
@kayleighmcenany @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn What a terrible selfish thing to say. Clinton Fdn. helps. millions of people.
thanks so much and keep coming out making the same statement she certainly should do that
BURN!!!
Hello Senator, you are a man of integrity. You said you would support the nominee & kept your word.Tks
@positive_sway Who knew Rand Paul was even alive
Question: If Clintons use Foundation monies for own use, then should monies be declared as taxable income???
I agree!!! Very well said!!!
 #ClintonFoundation. That is one brilliant idea. Hoping the word gets out there.#Brilliant 
@Pudingtane @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn Thank you for keeping your word about supporting Trump! Have regained respect for you! 
@kayleighmcenany @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn Maybe if you did your job better you would not have to look to charity to help.
@jr7jc @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn and Obama's!!
@kayleighmcenany @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn B.S.
no actually it is the fact coal is 19th century technology.
Thank you for being our voice against @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn she waged war on families not just coal! #ProudKYCoalFamily
I won't hold my breath.
@kayleighmcenany @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn she will not. Clinton family will take money to their grave.
.@RandPaul @kayleighmcenany Most of my family have been miners. What is hurting mining pensions is the degradation of UMWA, not HRC policies
I could NOT agree more!! Kudos to you for speaking out!!!
@realDonaldTrump Join @RandPaul! Call on Hillary to give CF $$ to shore up coal miners' pensions, whose jobs killed by Obama & HRC policies.
Yes Clinton Foundation should help miner's retirement fund.
or help flood victims-hrricane- zika- tax forms say it was 4 WJC library- $$ aftr that donat 2 America
Thank U for keeping your word in supporting Trump. It really makes a difference to all the Republicans that go to the polls! 
How did she as Secretary of State bankrupt the coal industry?
#HillarysEarPiece will put all the coal miners out of work for GOOD!
we the taxpayers should not be bailing out any companies pension funds. This directly the fault of Hillary and Obama. No more bail

Great idea!!!Unfortunately Clintons take more money than they give!
~~GREAT IDEA~~~~
HRC should cover the cost of putting coal miners out of business
get off your wallet Clintons. Help Coal people like you do all the African Countries
THIS STOCK CHART TELLS THE ENTIRE TALE $ANR
. shame on her
Great for the miners. But what about all the rest is Americans who have pensions robbed from them ???
I just listened to your filibuster on spying. Keep defending us, nobody else in Washington will @tragedyandhope
That would probably get to close to her pocket book!
I think low energy prices are hurting the industry.
how about investing for 21st century jobs, instead of bitching about coal.
good, the coal industry shouldn't exist in this century
what ever you say rand go back to sleep your 15 minutes are over didn't u get the memo #nevertrump
Election Fraud Videos:
is it true that her policies did this? CPP is what you mean?
very true
what a ridiculous statement. You are better than that Rand. @HillaryClinton had nothing to do with the downturn in coal. #GOPLies
Glad Paul is MY senator representing KY. & we will send him back. He's fighting for KY's economy not NY
good Im glad. I actuallt genuinely respect @RandPaul and his dad. ALOT. Thats why i think hes better than a baseless attack. 
,her ultimate goal for America is to build her $$ dynasty, while knocking Americans down and dependent

Do you like to breathe, doctor? Do you think your grandchildren will? #cleanenergy
they deserve every ounce of support
You know that will never happen. She would be more inclined to fund new abortion clinics or refugees.
hilliar he didn't praise Putin..Putin said hey was intelligent..I killed an sold out America troops 4$
please elaborate on the cause/effect. What agenda? No other causes for pension bankruptcies?
Mining didn't decline under bush? Weird. @RandPaul @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn
either that or low gas prices....
- go Rand Paul! Right on the $
#RandPaul should use his esteemed elected position to find alternative employers for his constituents.
Interesting point.  Helping children in Africa great, but help begins at home.
maybe Trumpette can pay back everyone who's he conned from for so many year's. Release your taxes DON!
No, it's healthy competition from easier to produce LNG. Know your economy.
The only people voting for @HillaryClinton are the ones saying "its time to have a woman president" qualified or not.
She is NOT qualified. Her criminal history & lying DISQUALIFIED her years ago. America VOTES @realDonaldTrump
Ah yes, the Secretary of State's well-known, octopus-like reach into domestic energy decisions
That would probably be illegal. Shillary and Slick Willie should pay OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS!!
Hillary Clinton has never been the POTUS how did she have this POWER! Seriously Ridiculous Propaganda
Rand is becoming a good shitposter, not quite @GovMikeHuckabee level, but p. good!
Has she been to Louisiana to visit flood victims yet? Oh wait, it's a Red State...nevermind.
Breathable air is an agenda?
