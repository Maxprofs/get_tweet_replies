@RandPaul He's the GOP frontrunner, moron. That's why they ask YOU about him.
@GidgetWA @RandPaul He's the http://realclearpolitics.com  frontrunner. Which is the only thing that matters to any news organization.
Our candidates can actually HANDLE complex policy questions, because we're actually interested in making gov't work. Yours aren't. @RandPaul
@RandPaul Just you because you guys complain when they ask actual policy questions.
@RandPaul Why would they? @realDonaldTrump is doing his job: destroying your joke of a political party.
@RandPaul. Can we point out Trump's West Virginia ego stroke was a parroted version of Obama 2008? Does he knows how clean coal works?
@RandPaul #its clear trump is an idiot
@RandPaul to be honest rand no one asked u any questions what so ever at last debate, did they?
@RandPaul He's the Republicans' mess. When my dog makes a mess in the yard, we don't ask our neighbor about it.
@RandPaul Why would they ask about a candidate in the other primary?  Or are you just whining now?
@RandPaul Dude, he's your problem, not ours
@RandPaul lmaowut?
@RandPaul Oh, no, that's just for you. You made him --you're stuck with him.

 @mrwolfeofficial
@RandPaul "us"?
@RandPaul Trump is a Republican candidate, so YES... You are getting asked more about it.
@RandPaul Well, not really you, anymore, right? You're off the hook.
@RandPaul @SportsGuyGURU Because Dems are more interested in debating substantive issues instead of Trump clown show you all legitimized
@navyvet50 @RandPaul @SportsGuyGURU "You all" would imply you know very little about @RandPaul -makes more sense than any candidate R or D.
@RandPaul That's just for y'all since your constituency is made up of the type of low info "morans" that elevate Ferret Top & RaFail Cruz
@RandPaul @davidcsmalley  the face palm is strong in this one
@RandPaul The questions asked during the Republican debates are guns, war and Obama. The GOP can't handle real life questions.
@RandPaul you know the dems competing for a different party's nomination right?
.@RandPaul Trump is the end result of your party choosing to run an 8 year campaign of pandering to the most racist, bigoted elements.
@RandPaul you guys created that monster and now you complain. Should have toned down the crazy paranoia. GOP deserves this mess.
.@RandPaul Why would they? It’s YOUR party that overwhelmingly supports Trump's overt racism.
@RandPaul because the only party Trump controls is yours
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  is @GOP and YOUR very special problem. Good luck with that. (NOT)
@RandPaul Toughest question Dems will get at debate : Who do you like better, MaryAnn or Ginger? What a sham the DNC puts out. #brokeparty
@RandPaul Ok that was funny.
@RandPaul dreamer
@RandPaul @LibertyBell1000 maybe never get around to it because praising each other for length of debate
@RandPaul Trump is irrelevant to any serious discussion about the future of America.
.@RandPaul Borne of GOP distrust for the establishment, I'm going to say ... just for you. #DemDebate
@MrDewMaster @RandPaul @BBatdc @realDonaldTrump @BernieSanders @GOP really feel many DEMS will vote for either TRUMP or CRUZ in election
@RandPaul who's this "us"..? We're all Americans here, buddy
@RandPaul that's just the poor journalists from Fox News.
@RandPaul #StandWithRand #RandRally  Its just for us them rules only purtain to us onesided evil has no place in gov
@RandPaul @BurdsIVue To be fair, they're the moron party that's letting him run...
.@randpaul Just for you. #DemocraticDebate
@RandPaul why would they? Democrats never attack their own. #DemDebate
.@RandPaul oh, I'm sorry... Didn't see you at the last GOP debate... Must have missed you... Oh wait
@RandPaul #StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul Dems know Trump can't win fairly. Can't alienate Hispanics, Muslims, GOP, Women,  Dems & win unless you buy the Electoral College.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump  Donalds probably in the audience rooting for Hillary 
@RandPaul it's just the RNC valuing ratings of policy discussion. Keep up the good work Dr Paul
@RandPaul We support you! We may be broke, we need real "change". Keep up the hard work! Let us know what we can do to help.
@RandPaul #DemDebate you should be running your ads on the breaks.  Show them real hope.
@Trumps1stMember @RandPau,check please
@RandPaul certainly won't ask about @RandPaul.... #RandPaulPoliticallyImpotent
@RandPaul us
@RandPaul its a soft ball debate what would you expect they just praised Obama. #DemDebate #Healthcare #Obamaphones #RandRally #randpaul

@RandPaul the Press like Donald. I'd be surprised if he doesn't come up early and often.
@RandPaul no #RandRally? How is this not helping #DemDebate trend?
@RandPaul Save your money and just be a Senator. Drop out now!
@RandPaul he's YOUR front runner
“@RandPaul: Are they going to ask the Democrats tons of questions about Donald Trump or is that just for us?  switch to the better party
@RandPaul Bill Clinton fell asleap in a tribute to #MLK.
@dirtmeister @RandPaul no, he was just thinking about his many girl friends
@RandPaul well he is a part of your party  you can keep that lovely guy  don't get mad get glad get a glad plastic bag man  lol
@RandPaul I respect you but I think that is just (R) strategy. We expect intelligent debate. I applaud you for boycotting the 2nd tier
@RandPaul Yes! They will protect Hillary! But Trump will win their Debate!
@RandPaul Hillary just said the potus is the hardest job in the world??!!!  That prob won't resonate w/ most Americans
@RandPaul it doesn't matter what they ask you guys all you talk about is BO as if he is running
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Trump's really rich.
@RandPaul it will be whatever increases viewers. #money
@RandPaul crybaby
@RandPaul I think we should all make a conscious effort to stop using his name. Like Voldemort or Beetlejuice.
@RandPaul Someone found the salt shaker
@RandPaul i hope not
@lancedarcy @RandPaul trump is a dem
@RandPaul I'm sure they might be one question. Maybe we'll hear stuff we didn't hear @ GOP debate
@RandPaul Honestly, why do you care? You have a primary coming up, stop watching tv.
@RandPaul The socialist gathering.
#DemDebate
@RandPaul Who's US? You were left off the debate stage! #RandPaul
@RandPaul You should have a drink then tweet every time they say his name
@RandPaul you didn't even show up. #gohome #DemDebate
@RandPaul
#WordOnTheStreet #Trump
When viagra + self loathing don't suffice as reasons to live, #Republicans join the #NRA + jump on the #TrumpTrain
@RandPaul what the debate you weren't in?
@RandPaul sick burn
@RandPaul Us? Sorry, didn't notice you at the last debate.
@JMWeeks11 @RandPaul He skipped the clown show.  Why be on stage with a bunch of liberal RINOs?
@JustinSzew309 @RandPaul He was pouting because he didn't have the support to be on the main stage.
@RandPaul just for you
@RandPaul Just you...  The rest of us know he's a nutter!
@RandPaul nobody asked you, you quit.
@RandPaul just for you guys! You love Donald so!
@RandPaul I'm betting Donald makes a large appearance tonight as well!
