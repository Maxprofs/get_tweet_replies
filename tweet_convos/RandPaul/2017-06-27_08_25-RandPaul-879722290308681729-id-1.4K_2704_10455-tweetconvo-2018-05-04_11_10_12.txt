I'll discuss w/ him how to fix bill & get more to a YES on real repeal, things I've tried to tell Senate leaders with no result so far
Keep Pre existing! No Free for illegals, refugees or ppl that are able to work ! Take care of elderly , disabled , Vets , working Ppl
Please stand your ground @RandPaul. We need more in the Senate like you. My MS senators are establishment 
Get them to repeal it Rand. It has to be done.
Premiums will continue to rise regardless of plan (and rose before o'care) until the actual cost of health CARE is addressed.
As a country & as a people, we are judged by how we treat those most in need.  We should take care of sick, without condition or exception.
Yeah Rand, keep holding out for your way. I'm sure you will do so much better getting your way 4 healthcare from the minority side of fight
Agreed. Let's get it right this time versus just ramming some more garbage legislation through.
Why are you fighting against the agenda that THE PEOPLE voted for?  We support @POTUS way more than you!
I'd B happy 2 C a full #RepealObamacare Our govt has no business in our #healthcare What is the real reason premiums & deductibles R so 
#FullRepeal

@FoxNewsSunday REAL, FULL, 110% REPEAL of ALL parts of this SOCIALIST plot. NO Socialist Med.! Free USA=supply, demand, pmt. plans, Drs...

Paul was on Wilkow today. Very good.
He did a great job explaining his plan proposal.
Yes, he did. Sold me on it.
Youre awesome senator paul!!!
Sometime it looks like you will do anything for attention.  Do you really care for us....
Just lead baby!
@POTUS, @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP #Promise us #Repeal
Absolutely!!!!
Are you nuts? Healthcare is a right not a product
Get government out of health care. Leave it to the free market system. Thankfully we still have you senator.
Just repeal it.
Were broke and we demand repeal
keep fighting for us RP!
Throw the baby out with the bath water or throw the dirty water out and replace it with clean water?
This Healthcare Bill basically is a crimes against humanity it's inhumane an unethical for the American people he needs to be revised
True, and the Senate shouldn't pass something so widely opposed. That's what they did with the ACA.
Another problem with health care, lawyers and law suits.  That's why in part it's so unaffordable.  Somewhere there has to be a balance?
I trust you Senator to make sure this gets done right, thank you!
@TheKuhnerReport  Senator Paul, I heard you on the Jeff Kuhner show today. As always you were very good! I'm with you! #FullRepeal
Fix Obamacare care w single payer option
Let's get it together and make it happen for the American people.
Work it out
Make sure you come to an agreement that works & saves us working people $. NO taxing us for employer paid Health benefits -dirty sneaky tax!
Keep it up Rand. ACA sucks, but a poor reform isn't not what we asked for.
And it's still not a real repeal...one bill for Republicans, and keep Obamacare for Democrats, that's what him and Trump put together.
Sen. Paul,plz lead w/courage.Find way 2 path u describe.Add other GOP views either initially or w/subsequent opportunities built in. Easy!
I hope y can meet somewhere in the middle
Repeal no replace get the Feds out of health care
Soooooooooo, what'd he say? 
KEEP GOING Dr. Paul, just get it right
@RealBenCarson had great ideas for sustainable insurance
drive consensus but do not stall this thing mid air
Why is government in Insurance business anyway?  As a veteran look at the VA!  Protect my Social Security I paid into. Nothing else
He needs to understand how much better it will be for everyone with government out! Better n cheaper! N we can still help those who need it
Please try to get thru to him! He does not seem to get it! Does he think we voted for MORE government in our healthcare? Seems like he does!
Go get 'em!!
won't happen, gop version dead in the water. time to admit failure, move on
Yes.....President Trump needs to listen to Rand Paul!!! Paul Ryan is not his friend!@
Wouldn't it be easier to just repeal Obama care? We already have Medicare and Medicaid...the spending has to stop
Most could say the same about YOU Randy Paul.. But I suppose you're in "good company" these days!! 
@realDonaldTrump Keep up pressure. America became great by true capitalism and survival of fittest. Not welfare and state intervention. MAGA
Repeal only 
Honestly, just give us money to spend on medical tourism. That'd be better than any system, and could even replace Medicaid.
Get r done, Rand!!!
How about recommendations instead of obstructions and objections Senator! Go to work. #termlimits #GOPlackofleaders
Open state lines as promised!
Instead of potshots,what solutions do you bring to table?No one should just point out negatives without solutions.Get on Foxnews w/whatugot.
You tell it brother. One cannot drive out darkness with darkness! #SonOfMan #SeedOfDavid #Messiah
It's an awful bill. You should know better.
Allow the medical co-ops so we can finally get the care we need!!
Please request small copay added to Medicaid to reduce OVERUSE & abuse of durable goods benefit-tried of watching kids & gkids playing on it
Repeal BOCare, get rid of mandates, open up across state line competition. Prem will come down.
Don't be a simpleton. Prices wont come down until the root of the problem is dealt with - big pharma & huge hospitals.
Take @newtgingrich and your knee pads
Giterdone, doneright!
Repeal OBAMACARE!!!!
Stay strong.
Full repeal
Let's be transparent with everything that's in it!!!
Look at Canadian healthcare but give more funding. We are severely understaffed. Because we have businessmen running hospitals with no brain
$10 says he can't tell you what "preexisting condition" means
The only people who like Obamacare are those who get subsidies. 300 million who don't get those subsidies and pay dearly or hv no insurance
there is no repeal in the GOP health care bill.
YOU NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT RAND!!! AND GET THIS PASSED RIGHT AND SOON OR YOU WONT HAVE AMERICAS HELP TO KEEP YOU IN.ITS OUR FUTURE.RID US OBC
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE REPEAL THE BILL IN ITS ENTIRETY NOT IN SECTIONS - THEN pass a safety net for poor and promote competition & options.
Good luck Senator! Seems there are very few in Congress who want to see it repealed although they campaigned on it. Many who lie!
Whatever you do get something done you can do more work by staying out of in front of a camera
It's needs to be stopped period
Why was your interview with Varney cut?
Roll OCare back over 5 yrs, cut taxes, then get out of small biz way. That has heart. @ALFlovesgrass wants to grow & employ more peeps in GA
Figure out the budget of a person who makes $40,000 a year. Where do you find  $6,000 a year that can pay for insurance?

Stand with Rand Paul for health care bill. Paul Ryan needs to get his house in order. Or get out of the way
I followed u bc I feel your knowledge reg. HC is essential to translate what some aren't getting. IK u can help get the votes  with tweaking
No, single payerThat's the far left way.Choice, for americans.not Obamacare.Put insurance back into Americans hands.Not illegals or refugees
Illinios is broke Democrats, Detroit is run down, Democrats, California is going down. Democrats. Americans are on the hook for Democrats
Tell Potus that if MEDICARE IS TOUCH MANY CONGRESSIONAL PEOPLE WILL BE W/o a JOB. YOU WILL BE FIRED. DONT TOUCH MEDICARE!!!@realDonaldTrump
Repeal. Call it dead. Just say no one has to do what ocare says. Its dead. Go back to free market
Most of Obama care is Catastrophic care with 6000.00 deductables and no co pays most americans cant afford to use it.
try single payer
he is right
Agreed Senator, but get something that is at least a partial fix...
What's it gonna take. NO RECONCILIATION. JUST REPEAL
missed you this morning on CBS...wanted to hear you...good luck with @POTUS
Well it needs to get done!!! Imperative! So do what you must to pass it. Just repeal ACA, then craft a new package.
Which Senator/Congressman will make the brilliant leap to eBay/Amazon type markets for health care?
We voted for repeal
Hang tough Rand!  This is barely any change let alone repeal. You lee and Cruz are our only hope!
Please make it happen! 
Simple. REPEAL Obamacare!
Then, get the government back into the Insurance business If You must,
Keep the heat maybe they'll get it right eventually
Repeal&Replace Obamacare!Absolutely no tax payer funded abortion. Abortion shouldn't B legal so why would we want to pay for it?! Plz  help!
Be sure the improvement helps we the people and not the corporations or campaign donors!!
well keep in mind, with or without it there's still going to be a lot of people without healthcare and Obamacare is about to implode.
You law makers should have had something ready way before the election
Yes! Show your fellow Senators how it's done - this is a BAD bill
I was told their are not enough republicans in Senate to repeal, need to do something to show you are on right track for ALL people
Good luck this bill is not a repeal. Who's getting the money?
You have lost all of my respect. I considered voting for you. Yuk
Let's put in a bill today: Effective immediately Congress/Senate must buy on open market like middle income citizens. Then u will see action
Fix and vote
Health care costs so much because the government is involved, restraining market forces. Get it out of health care or quit wasting our time.
So sick of voting Republican loyally every time and not a damn thing happening #Wall/Health Care....Sick! MAJ. BARTON, USA Retired
We want a full repeal but damn. At some point you guys gotta deliver amd rip the band aid off.
Let the free market across all state borders fix this mess
We the People need Government out of Healthcare altogether.
Get your sh*&/^ together Paul if their is no mandate and choice is given it is repealing worthy. ..we're not stupid
You are but 1 of 52. You love the power to ruin it for the majority. Just get it done! A no vote supports Ocare
Thank you Senator
Get there soon
Keep preexisting. Lose all the fat. Open the markets/borders. Put medicade/care on a sliding scale like food stamps.
Needs to be total repeal. Taxpayers are broke. Credits for those who do not pay taxes is ludicrous, cut taxes for those who pay. Free market
Health Insurance should be affordable for every American,  who gives a care whether it is a Republican or a Democrat. Work together Senators
Thank goodness there is somebody in DC that is concerned abt AMERICANS & NOT putting money back into the pockets of the RICH in tax breaks!
Cross state lines. Set up for pre existing to go to designated hospital in their county. Maybe v a.

Don't block good for perfect. Get the changes you can and get it passed. So you can move forward. Also show that Republicans can govern.
We were Promised Full Repeal
Where is your ability to compromise? We voted for Trump--not the GOP! For once-quit grandstanding and get this done for the people!
I have faith in you.
If you need help I'm here
if only there were rand Paul clones! Thank you for being consistently constitutional! Please get through 2 trump
just vote for it or Dems will kill us.
THANK YOU for all your hard work and dedication!! Everything you have done is not going unnoticed and we APPRECIATE it!!
Please get it done! God Bless your efforts

Just make sure this a good deal for all your constituents. Be humble and compassionate.
Just don't forget the seniors. Why don't kids grow up anymore? On their parents plans till 26? Ridiculous! Work, you bums!
I agree Senator Paul but in the end you will vote yes for bill that likely not very good, or you will vote NO to keep horrible Obamacare.
Competition across state lines!
Rand please let's just repeal the whole damn thing!!!!
Help the small business owners we are hurting.
Senator Paul has authored near perfect bill which fixes rotten core #healthcare,read it study it learn it and adopt it.
Trump has the political capital to take this to the people.Put Congress on obamacare.Expose the big pharma insurance corruption.But he won't
When do the conservatives get to write the bill and not the swamp dwellers?  Lobbyist, lawyers, deal makers, gvt workers
Rich people do not need a tax break!!!!!
I hope you can convince Pres
Can we stop making it mandatory? We the people should have a choice to have insurance or not.
The solution is, Remove The Government From Health Care.
good for you Senator  this must be done in the right way
Then do it!!!
You do realize full repeal is impossible right?
United Nations! Send troops to Sweden. Watch the videos it is being raped and tortured!
Keep fighting for full repeal! Thank you for your dedication to American values
You can't get a full repeal in reconciliation. You won't get a bill through Congress w/o debate & compromise, like reasonable men.
JUST PLZ MAKE SURE THE POOR DONT GET SHAFTED. WE CANT AFFORD DOLLAR A DAY/ BROKE AFTER BILLS/ NOT EVEN FOOD. REMEMBER 4GOTTEN. U WORK 4 US
Just regulate the HC Industry. Install caps on all procedures. No need for CEO's to make $100/yr. without the restrictions nothing works
We voted on repeal, not replace.  Stay strong.
Actually it needs to be chit canned. FULL repeal, free market only. You BOTH campaigned on this
Senator the people don't believe the 2nd & 3rd phase will ever happen. Full repeal now!!
It's penalizing working people that no matter what you do fall thru cracks.  They cannot afford healthcare and employer does not offer.
Hope you're a good salesman!
WE NEED LOWER PREMIUMS!! DEFUNDING OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD
Please break it down for him so he understands. Be spectacular!
Single payer all the way, save money and save lives!
When will Congress stand up to the health insurance cos and big pharma? Until we get out from under their grip, no plan will be affordable.
Keep fighting for the American people
Get the damn thing passed. Seriously.
Government has no place in healthcare. Healthcare is not a right afforded to anyone. It's a benefit to those who work and have worked for it
Thinker like you with a doer like @realDonaldTrump is a win in my book. @POTUS be wise and listen to @RandPaul. He is the goods. #USA #MAGA.
Well go get it done!! Don't kill the debate!
Sir help prez us working class can't pay for illegals n moochers anymore we can't even use our insurance the hca is a scam help us sir!
Their will not be a middle class American. Rich & poor! We can't support all of them!
Please pass the bill and fix later
Then why didn't u have ur own for 8 years.  U r bs
They were never serious about repeal. Lobbyists own our Gov. Sickening greedy leaches. Millionaires when they leave office. Investigate them
Make it happen Rand
Repeal ACA and replace with Americare and eliminate the insurance companies from the equation
Thank you for trying @RandPaul
I think you guys needs come together both side for the good of country
In premiums for age, coverage stays as long as premium is paid, ppl can buy more at the return of premium if they want..
Thank you ! Do it right! Get ins Co to refund premiums to ppl that don't use their ins in 15 yrs, balance if ppl haven't spent over, no hike
Please don't cave . stand up for the American people. This bill is only for the rich.
Do things that will lower costs, not increase costs.....
