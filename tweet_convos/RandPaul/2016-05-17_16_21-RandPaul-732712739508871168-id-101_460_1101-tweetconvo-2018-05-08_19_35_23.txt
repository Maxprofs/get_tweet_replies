#hitler used his #atheism to invent #libertarianism to spread coal across the nation! #StandWithRand
That is so much bullshit... He publicly spoke about his catholicism & wrote on Mein Kampf.
Nazis were such atheists, here's their "atheism with us" uniform belt. Gott must mean atheism.
why do Atheists always feel the need to defend Hitler
you managed to navigate your vs you’re, remarkable for an atheist! Nice job.
so... no actual rebuttal from you then? Thought not... hence the passive aggressive.

@Prof_Werewolf @lucasvixes @RandPaul
Why do you feel the need to tweet us pics of your Nazi belt buckles. It's weird
Lower the taxes on the peasant class so the Lords in Congress can't give our money away!!
Just to clarify any confusion, Rand Paul is no longer a POTUS candidate, but is running for his Senate seat- correct?
yes
Good. We need more like him!
yeah, like 99 more. Lol
McConnell must not have spent millions 2 go after him. Rand fell in line. Did he endorse Cruz?
why would he?
NJ, DE, & NV have already proven that states can effectively regulate internet gambling within their own borders.
For consumer protection, mandated age verification & personal liberty, please support online poker licensing & regulation.
@freedomtex I really like Rand, one of the few in congress.
Perhaps your anger is misplaced...

Closing coal plants reduced the number of smog days in Ontario from 53 in 2005 to zero in 2015.  Can't argue with those numbers.
How about supporting HR2058
you champion small business and yet focus solely on lifting coal companies at the expense of the little guy.
your fixation on coal will get you fired. Why not talk about SOAR - initiative to teach coal miners computer programming.
@KYGOP We have to defeat the Progressive Liberal Socialist agenda, they've thrown out everything great about America . Estab.Out!
