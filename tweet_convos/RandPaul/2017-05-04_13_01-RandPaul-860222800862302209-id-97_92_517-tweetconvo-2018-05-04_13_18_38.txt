Many thanks for your committment to a #FullRepeal and freemarket principles. Make the rest of the GOP toe the line! #UnitedForFreedom
Faux News.
Do you think Rand Paul is a fake?
Great point, Andrew.  Only a fake American would think Rand Paul is fake.
I think he is fake. And I am a DAR. Don't get much more American than me.
How is Rand Paul a fake?
I am his constituent.
Didnt answer the question.
As his constituent, I have heard him make promises he hasn't kept. I have seen him betray the people of his state. I see it every day.
#FullRepeal on socialized healthcare. No replacement. #KeepThePromise #UnitedForFreedom
Federal gov't has no power to provide goods and services to some at expense of others.
#Constitution #Liberty #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Common sense tells you, you only have to look to history to see socialized anything has drastically failed. Trash Trumpcare Obamacare.
#FULLREPEAL #UNITEDFORFREEDOM Get Government out of our healthcare.
Rand on Fox News shortly!
#FullRepeal  The fnd of Const lies on single prop-all powers not delegated to fed by the Constitution are rsrvd to the States or to people
#FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom Honor the SEVEN year promise of REPEAL. Government doesn't need to be in the healthcare business
#FullRepeal
#FullReplace
#ConservativeValues
#KeepYourPromise
#GovernmentOutOfMyHealthcare
#UnitedForFreedom
The tweaks to Obamacare in the House are not even close to #FullRepeal. Stop this outrageous government overreach. #UnitedForFreedom
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! #UnitedforFreedom!  Keep your promise!  We're depending on YOU!
Do you mean tune into #FoxSexualDiviantsandLiars? #TrumpRussia
You're swore an oath to do no harm. Denying people healthcare because of prior conditions is harming them.
Pay attention. He is actually trying to make healthcare affordable for more people regardless of preexisting conditions. #StandWithRand
We trust you to hold the GOP accountable for a #FullRepeal like they promised. Please hang in there, Senator. #UnitedForFreedom
You do realize that you r talking to 25% of America right? Shame if u don't cuz the other 75% r voting u out!
#trumplesscare
So, to find out abt what's happening in the government of the greatest Western superpower, you have to watch @FoxNews ???
Repeal Obamacare! Do your job!
While you're on Fux Fake again Randi, will you ask Handjobity if you can lick ASS-ange's balls the next time he visits London to blow him?
You are a do nothing politician. A step in the right direction is better than no step at all.
How come no one talks about buying insurance across state lines anymore? #KeepYourPromise! #FullRepeal!
Repeal Obamacare. Give the people what we voted for in November. Stop the selfishness of Washington. The middle class needs relief.
How about you join your constituents in Kentucky? Or, at the very least get your fax machine fixed. It seems like you are avoiding us...
Sen. Paul, pride comes before a fall. It's NOT about you but It's about the President & people who voted for him. Don't obstruct this bill!
is it true that House healthcare bill will result in increases to Medicare and Medicaid? Hope not.
Don't vote for any Senate plan that takes out the amendment that let's states opt out of Obama's preexisting condition mandate.
Thank you for the work that you do Senator!!
Troublesome individual market: create super-groups, encourage competition within states
Leave the group mkt alone, let Ins companies take the risk, not the taxpayers.
I LOVE THE IDEA OF FORMING GROUP COVERAGE! Best idea I've heard yet! And you are right...Ins companies HATE grp coverage cuz of cost
Ins co's don't hate group coverage.  They run into issues with individual. Now it's even worse since OCare
Is it true ACHA R&R is DOA? Do you support Justice dept action on never lawfully ratified 14th 16th & 17th amendments as incentive?
If you're positive.
Wk with rep to fix health care. Y'all had 6 years to Wk on it!
Love UR Pre-EC suggestion 2day abt single payers grouping in2 a pool. Worried abt bill passed 2day-it's uncertainties- possible higher costs
We need you RAND PLEASE stay by the PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump side your the only HONEST 3 men we can trust  @Jim_Jordan @DaveBratVA7th 
@DonaldJTrumpJr  @RogerJStoneJr  We Need #Americanfirst Team PROTECT & SUPPORT OUR @DonaldJTrumpJr NO ILLEGALS GET HEALTHCARE FULL REPEAL 
I liked the idea about AARP also, no money to croony capitalist insurance companies 
@RandPaul is a big backer of allowing individuals and small businesses to join buying groups to buy insurance. This is good for America.
You've exempted yourself from #AHCA yet wish to push it on the rest of America? If this is a good plan, why grandfather yourself on #ACA? 
#RepealandReplaceRandPaul
watched-we subsidize through our taxes already, AND through our pricy premiums - it would be good to subsidize with only  just our TAX $$'s
I agree with you on group plans. Another big problem is the cost of medicine in this country & ppl need to stop getting rich off sick ppl.
IMO: #BigPharma shouldn't be allowed to advertise drugs to the American public. Put those ad $$ into lowering costs and doing more R&D!
. 100% AGREE! If ppl want info they can get online BUT advertising on tv is ridiculous!
Why...
Senator  I just finished watching your interview on fox and totally agree with you on the health care bill many great points
Do you actually like the bill?
REPEAL Obamacare completely, please!!
Your point abt the individual market w @TeamCavuto brings tears 2 my eyes. My family is in that very spot. #thankyou #notforgotten
You are the best thing going for this country Dr. Never give up your fight.
And again you speak crap. Many people will fund Anyone but you during your next election. You just seem to love to be off in LaLa Land, sad
You did amazing on Cavuto....get president to agree to the group pools like AARP...brilliant idea
Great interview Sir.
I agree with your AARP comment.
Thank you for the explanation of the healthcare reform
BACK POTUS TRUMP NOW OR PLAN FOR RETIREMENT IN 2018!
We stand with our ally the Republic of Korea, but we need to address trade deficit. What’s the plan POTUS? https://www.citizen.org/media/press-releases/todays-five-year-korea-fta-data-show-march-imports-korea-higher-all-one-month …
We don't see you enough will be watching Fox to hear your great message "follow the constitution to make America great again"
Oh good. More fanatic right-wing propaganda! "Whoo hoo! Look how we just screwed the poor, elderly, and sick!" @TYTNetwork @justicedems
U wont sign nothing unless its call Paulcare.
Rand: Moderate republicans are worse than liberals!!  They are lying to their constituents and America! They have bought into NWO! CLeanse!
Don't talk down the AHCA, Obstructionist
Please continue to stand for US while considering healthcare. Do not subsidize insurance companies.
He just doesn't get it
shoot it down Rand
Rand,  your thoughts on the passage
I dont think U would get behind anything, Trump wants 2 pass. I believe U R still butt hurt about losing 2 Trump.
Kill the bill!
Watching 
Ok but are you voting yay or nay on this bs health care bill?
As long as you leave in the special Pre-existing Conditions provision for members of Congress you are a HYPOCRITE and a LIAR. #AHCA
I'll be watching and listening.

Will you please define the dangers of government control of health care and how it cannot be a conservative position? It's not about money.
The safety, security & salvation of all nations are at stake. All who serve in government & media must understand & be warned of THIS:
don't put a wet blanket on this
I'm watching... be nice.
Tuned in!
