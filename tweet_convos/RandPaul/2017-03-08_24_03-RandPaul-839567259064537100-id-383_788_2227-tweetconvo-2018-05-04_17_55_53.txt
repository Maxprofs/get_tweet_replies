On Sept 17 2008 The Big Banks Collapse. We had to write the biggest welfare ever to #WallStreet
Need your help Senator!  McCain/Graham pulling dirty deeds & "we the ppl" R aware. Support POTUS 45.  
You seem like the only valid person.I am a libertarian.We really need you, please be careful.Need changes!
if anybody worthwhile in politics reads this, how bout force insurance companies to compete for business.
also eliminate any and all taxes and penalties to WE THE PEOPLE
stop funding pharmaceuticals that over charge American people for drugs w/ more side effects than cures.
lastly force them to ad homeopathic medicine & natural cures & can't say no/jack the cost on pre existing.
I want your health care plan not paul ryans
even republicans are backing you now. #2020
please keep speaking up for a more conservative option.
Sorry, but Boyle is a tool.
your a chicken. Discuss with the president instead
I'm with you, Sen. The Dems established a progressive health ins system; doesn't mean we have to keep it.
Whatever. Let us know when you talk to actual media and not #FakeNews.
GET RID OF HMOS and put their profits to work for us! Get back to before HMOs. They failed.
Can you reveal what your replacement health care is? Ryan's is terrible. If it passes, people will b mad. Don't think Ryan cares tho.
why can't we have Medicaid for poor and pre exist conditions and go back to what we had B4 then do the other stuff? State lines.

Don't let them sign the Lite.  Please... Repeal and Replace only.
When you talk American Healthcare Act you should say what you don't like and how would you get it passed.
You were my preferred presidential candidate. I'm grateful you remain a practical thinker & steadfast on principals. Keep fighting
Breitbart???  Really?!  New low.... Lost my respects. 
@realDonaldTrump Paul Ryan: Loyal to his donors atTrump's expense.He & Romney conceptually like Obamacare.
If nothing else, Paul Ryan is loyal to his donors.
Why would you bother with @BreitbartNews ?
what part of repeal it now are they missing??? Now not next year or in 10 years #Doitnow
Need cross state buying, tort reform, pharmaceutical regs, make politicians chose - lobbyist or people.
@TomCottonAR @tedcruz #GETITRIGHT
Get 'em RAND! You & @freedomcaucus @SenMikeLee & others need to go on FULL offence to kill ACA 2.0!
Republicans ran on repealing every word of #Obamacare, we look forward to seeing them deliver on their promise to America! #
.@RandPaul Keep fighting the good fight against this new healthcare bill! I hope more stand with you to defeat it. #cleanrepeal
Hot News: @RandPaul Discusses #TrumpCare with @mboyle1 & @BreitbartNews before discussing #CareLess w/an American news outlet. #KremlinGate
Praying for all the ones with good intentions in DC.
paradigm shift must land directly on the patient & not physician practices.
zero patient responsibility mentioned in MACRA.  All the cost & responsibility on physician practices. No savings.
Under your plan, my inlaws will pay 7,000 annually for health care, they make 20,000.  #voteoutpaul
What is a senator doing giving an interview to a blog instead of esteemed journalists?  #voteoutpaul
You have a lot of your base supporters on edge over this Mr @POTUS. @SpeakerRyan is NOT who we voted for!
wow. #BreitbartNews??? No self respecting American would entertain this news org. #comeonman
Have you talked to Pres Trump about it yet?
I voted to get rid of Obamacare. Not replace just get it gone.
Keep speaking out!!! We are listening...GO GO
Stay strong, Rand. This will come back to haunt Americans if we don't scrap OC completely.
Don't give up healthcare fight. Repeal Obamacare!Give us h.c. in free mkt. Get govt out of healthc
.
Stay Strong, however please Do not hurt OUR President..You be part of the solution.. not the problem. I have always liked u!
You will fall in line when it's time to vote. As you always do!
Re-think your strategy.  Don't fight in MSM.  Work behind the scenes to make changes.  Support Trump.
Ask when government workers will be required to be on same plan as rest of Americans.
you mean #rightwinglunaticnews !
We are with you.  Fight this Ryan Left Wing Ryancare government interference in our lives
Thank you, Senator Rand Paul for your opposition to Obamacare Lite.
WHY would you give ANY of your time to the atrocity that is Brietbart?
TrumpCare passed House Ways and Means with ease.  You, @RepDaveBrat @freedomcaucus will surrender meekly as well.
Thank you for standing firm. We the people voted for a FULL REPEAL, NOT Obamacare Lite. Free Market now.
Keep the Govt out of our healthcare / health insurance. Do NOT intertwine the IRS with our health Ins.
please tell me you don't believe in this alternative news conspiracy theorist rag!
cost of medicare and supplemental plans and copays, make it so elderly and disabled can't afford to live and get care.
I can't quite figure out whether you are batshit McCain crazy or are looking out for the people.
Please keep opposing this.
Health insurance is a responsibility not a right. Stop government controlled healthcare now!! Repeal it and forget it!
don't back down.
Thank You @RandPaul for opposing this mess. @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews
come up with a solution sir
You are a United States Senator!  Why would you speak to such a dishonest and inflammatory publication?  @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews
Health Plan will fail. USA is ill nation. Make healthier to save $. Plan perpetuates ill state. USA loses.
Screw your plans, KEEP OBAMACARE
Why would you give that propoganda mill an interview??????
@realDonaldTrump  just repeal 100%...dont need to replace...NO GOVT in healthcare...FREE MARKET
WAIT A MIN! Let's Vote On Exact Same Obamacare Repeal We Sent To  Obama! NO TAX connections!!! #FullRepeal
Where are you on Your Opposition??
Wouldn't you worry they'd misquote you to suggest you support the bill? I mean "creditability" isn't in their job description.
keep fighting!
I am not paying for healthcare for someone too lazy to get off the couch or legal or illegal immigrants
So you are part of the #russiagate conspiracy then?  Where do you want your subpoena delivered, traitor?
I sure wish they would listen to your plan.  I'm doing my best to email and tweet Congress to help
Senator, please resubmit your repeal bill.  I support you!
Relieved to hear you oppose
we the people do not want anything with obamas name on it. His legacy was to destroy America
pls..add dental and vision..crowns etc for those w low income 26 k a year. Im disabled and cant survive and single
It's not Obamacare Lite. It's not RyanCare. It's RomneyCare 3.0. Give credit where it's due.
my healthcare is $16,000/yr wth deduct for 1 person bronze plan wth $0 subsidy 4 me! Help!
@NetworksManager @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews Send Pres. Trump exact same repeal sent to Barry with updated dates + names. #FullRepeal
Let's call it what it is shall we @RandPaul! This is not @GOP #Obamacare . The #ACA is Obamacare. The #AHCA is #TrumpCare. AND IT SUCKS!
is #FAKENEWS!
Thank You.        STOP  #Ryancare
It might be political suicide to take millions of tax credit at the Onset. Could phase it out gradually.
Work together with Ryan for compromise. Make Public statement with him Thursday.
Tell @POTUS @realDonaldTrump OK on tax credits if it 'replaces' medicaid expansion NOT added to it...
...Goal would be 2 replace ALL gov insurance w/grants, tax creds,etc 2buy private
It's not Obamacare Lite.  It is straight up Trumpcare.  Big failure.  Republicans have had over 6 years to fix and you come up with crap!
We need a full repeal of Obamacare as promised....Nothing else will be acceptable to We the People.
No Score = No Vote. Need ALL phases carefully planned out BEFORE signing phase 1.
I agree with Jeffrey. Cool your jets Rand.
What's the over/under for when you cave on this??
- Don't you dare call it Obamacare  Lite. Call it what it really is...GOPDon'tCare.
Keep up the fight Senator, I don't trust Ryan and neither should you!  He does not have the voters best interests at heart.
#cleanrepeal or nothing.
Just #repealobamacare and let the free market work.
Does @SpeakerRyan know that you are a doctor? POTUS should give YOU the lead on this.
bae  #StandWithRand #StillRanding #FullRepeal
FELLOW AMERICANS PLEASE READ!
ahca returns indiv and small group mkt to pre-aca, repeals tax & mandates, bgrant to mcaid to states, yeah
Thinking outreach needs a bit wider then 1on1? Why not combine the 2 bills into 1?
We already know what is going to happen.  The GOP will repeal & never come to agreement on replace.  GOP will screw us over.
Dr Paul your version would leave me the patient that @RepTomPrice is talking about without ins! Disabled
Disabled people qualify for Medicare
Maybe you should refuse to go on overtly racist 'news' sites. Just sayin'.
Sur, We support U in trying to cut out the Tax Credit insurance company rip off piece Ryan plan proposes!
We the voters smell lobbyist at work on Speaker Ryan & don't like it! Do whats right 4 the people!
@FlashMaster659 @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews Stand firm for free market solution.
@FlashMaster659 @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews I'm with you Rand!!!
Are you and @freedomcaucus & @justinamash going to team up to destroy @SpeakerRyan 's garbage Obamacare 2.0?  Please say, "YES!"
What I would like 2 see is the new plan & old plan on same website 2 compare & contrast online...
I agree completely we need a clean repeal and a completely NEW replacement plan, keep up the great work you're doing for us!!
Maybe you should discuss the ACA with someone who does not have their insurance provided by tax payers!
plz get right!!
@MariahTamaya @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews #Repeal #RINOcare
Please keep up the fight Rand
I fully support Pres Trump, but the proposed plan is still Obama Care! Replace in entirety!!
Why is that majority of Conservative Americans knew Paul Ryan was a snake? Has come back to bite us in a$
standardize preventive check up. Conduct check semi-annually. Incentives healthy people but w/Standardized rates.
long term healthcare for senior citizen is a huge issue and needs to be part of the new healthcare.
You must Repeal and Replace Obamacare together or The GOP will lose in 2018
as long as insurance companies keep making massive profits, healthcare costs will rise
Yes we want to get the best deal possible. Please you all work together to be willing to give and take.
The Dems seem to gather the wagons and keep their dirty laundry to themselves. You all are going to lose like you all did in 2010
Rand u have to save us. Please explain to DT that his plan will lead to the same death spiral as Ocare bc no young ppl will buy it
Stand your Ground Dr.
#Ryancare does NOTHING to reduce HC costs! We waste $1T on HC compared to peer Nation systems. Fix it!!
Run and I'd vote for ya. Just stay true to what you say.
Support you here, Rand.  This can not be screwed up, if it's GOP bureaucratic bloated mess, will be used to discredit limited gov
It's ALL FUBAR.  How about doing what is right and give American single-payer?
because  monopolies raise costs  exponentially
yep now you are backing down
Did you finish the crossword puzzles?
conversation AND compromise are           good  keep working do NOT give up
I'm going to stand with Rand.  Please fight this.
SAY NO TO #RYANCARE (Obamacare Lite)
Brietbart?!?!! How can we take you seriously when you turn to these guys for publicity?!?!
Please tell us you will repeal all healthcare coverage for Federal employees and their families? #MAGA
Yes make the break from ACA as messy as possible. Good medical thinking Dr. @randpaul.
Why is there no discussion about preserving the cap on annual out of pocket expenses?  Prevents bankruptcy
Sen.,keep the great work. Eventually, and together, conservatives will shed this blight caused by the Dems
you mean Trumpcare?
- I voted for #cleanrepeal @realDonaldTrump !Don't lose your base pushing thru amended Obamacare!MISTAKE!
thanks Rand you know what is right
The right to health care is guaranteed in Venezuelan . Can't we lean from others mistakes?
Try and do what's best for Americans for a change.Not for your party or yourself, Americans.I highly doubt you're capable.
Keep up the fight we are behind you!
Fight on against Obamacare Lite horrible plan, repeal Obamacare!
defeat #Trumpcare its bogus. #midterms are coming.  Will you be back for another term?
We elected the republicans 2do what we asked them to do.So Republicans work this out or 2020 won't be good
I am a bit concerned with the subverters in this process. Wish you had more involvement.
@Azi @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews We'll take what you've got Mr. Paul,Mr.Bannon. We're already paying for it.
I do hope there is compromise and negotiation, because this seems to be not what voters had in mind.
Rand pass h c Bill. Live to fight another day. Asap tax reform next.
why have anything w obama's name on a healthcare bill in the first place if this is sup to be a repeal?
keep fighting the good fight. This bill sounds like a disaster. We are trying to replace Obamacare with Obamacare.
@NetworksManager @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews dude, it's called negotiation and compromise...don't u have a wife for heavens sake.
Please work with @POTUS to repeal and replace
It does not make sense 2 me that I have 2 join associated health Plan-because of preexisting condition??.
@freeandfunny14 @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews @nypost Please NO $ should change hands in NEW healthcare plan = less opportunity 4fraud.
Senator should be discussing the plan with your peers, and across the aisle. Stop politicking, do your job
If Obamacare is unsustainable, pre-ACA status quo was catastrophic fail #singlepayersolution @mboyle1 @BreitbartNews
Ryan's Plan does NOT REPEAL OBAMACARE!  Its just 'revising it' and that is NOT WHAT WE VOTED FOR!
@BreitbartNewsf I have preexisting health condition I will not get healthcare Insur unless i join associated health plan?
keep up the good work
