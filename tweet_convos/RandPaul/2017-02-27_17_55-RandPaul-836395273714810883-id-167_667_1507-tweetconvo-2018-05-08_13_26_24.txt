falsely assumes if Fed-AhCA fails to takeover health care that ACA will stay
ACA will fail, of course, reportedly will disintegrate w/in 2 yrs. Fed AHCA gives MUCH 2 states #aStart #Window
#AHCA does give much taxpayer money to states, along w/ mandates/regs, but Conservatives oppose Fed health care.
yes of course but as with abortion Save as many as you can til you get full repeal Roe #ruinedlives #ocare
Problem w/ #AHCA is, after Ryan got it, he kept way too much of ACA-policy to be effective at allowing interstate trade.
I initially agreed but that bill is not one up for vote today.
Agreed. Instead of allowing interstate trade to lower cost AHCA expands ACA-subsidies (isn't ins & will lead to more fraud)
wow. It's amazing to see 3 highly educated morons working in concert.
My son, age 32 pays $233.76 monthly. $5000 deductible. Had an x-ray, cost $1100. Insurance paid zero. California
Pay a little more and have a lower deductible. Its called "the market". Or is someone else supposed to pay for him?
A little more?? Not enough words to explain, but you do not understand ObamaCare in CALIFORNIA.
that's right. Tweaking the ACA is better than replacing it. That is what the Republicans are suggesting.
actually they say REPEAL and REPLACE. Thats not 'tweaking'. Stop using rhetoric/talking points and try listening.
#PaulRyan: To #repeal #ACA we must pass #AhCA

#FullRepeal @SenTedCruz @FreedomCaucus
Rep. Jim Jordan introduces a clean repeal of ObamaCare http://video.foxnews.com/v/5351830315001/ …
So no replacement?  Just going to let Americans die? Is that how you make America great?
My son, age 32 pays $233.76 monthly. $5000 deductible. Had an x-ray, cost $1100. Insurance paid zero. California
without it he'd be paying $800 or more. Would that be better?
he is already paying around $600 monthly. Earns 50,000 yr. how is that affordable? Single and 32 yrs.
then he is making more than me and $600 is less than I paid on cobra. No sympathy. Yr greedy

yes
Absolutely correct @SenatorCollins @SenateGOP
#DefundTheGOP
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI Thank you for once again highlighting your hatred for America and her people. Disgraceful.
My son, age 32 pays $233.76 monthly. $5000 deductible. Had an x-ray, cost $1100. Insurance paid zero. California
U R Wrong! @SenTedCruz  Primary Care docs knows that ACA has provided good healthcare to many previously shutout.
2 yrs ago, GOP Congress voted to repeal #Obamacare. That 2015 repeal language should be the minimum. #FullRepeal @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI
Many docs are either leaving or not taking new patients. It's been a disaster for most.. not to mention it's socialism
yup
Ratero >>> @SenTedCruz
you are responsible for Obamacare being in place
Why can't you do it now? CAN'T YOU ALL MEET AND WORK OUT A PLAN THAT PLEASES EVERYONE?
@POTUS absolutely 100%. No more unConstitutional fed. mandated med. ins. for us. No #OBAMALITE tricks!
Full Repeal, Yes! Replace NO!  Let capitalism replace.
And again: Who pays for uninsured in emergency room, admitted without insurance or income?
Please get rid of penalty. I am a tax preparer, ppl who can't afford insurance are taxed$1000s. Making hard working ppl poorer.
yes
#FULLREPEAL @POTUS
But don't replace. Gov. needs to get the hell out the way and let the free market do its job.
Maybe you should make TAXES a priority and let Obamacare implode?
If it were 2yrs ago, yes! Now we need to work together! Not have a pissing contest!
AND STILL NO REPLACEMENT PLAN!  #SHAMEONYOU!
My plan is to count on Ted Cruz to be personally responsible to pay my medical bills.  Or I'll die!
If you clowns ever arrive at The Pearly Gates, you'll be asked why you screwed so many poor Americans.
The Pearly Gates won't be an option!
poor americans make better choices instead of robbing me of my sweat equity
I just heard the Pearly Gates slam shut on Jason. Eternity is a long, long time.
ummm no man can pluck me out of the Father's hand.
No one but yourself.
can America get on the gold-plated healthcare YOU and your corrupt cronies are on?
take health care away from 20 million and you own it. GOP will never recover.
Duh? No plan. All bluster and heartlessness. On your head be it.
How are you proposing that we provide medical care to all citizens or don't you think some people deserve it?
#repealandreplacetedcruz2018
all 3 must take responsibility ACA could've been so much better if you'd worked together from the start
#FullRepeal is a battle cry- your lives are not worth the cost of fixing a healthcare system that WE broke
thousands like me would love to sit down and explain why our lives should matter and we should be able to have health insurance
you may have privilege enough not to suffer serious illnesses. Don't let that blind you to real humans with real problems.
You literally have provided zero evidence that your #FullRepeal plan won't kill me. And you wonder why people are protesting?
wait for the details. Unlike ACA, it won't pass until you can read it. ACA has made it impossible for me to be cvrd.
we've BEEN waiting for the entire time they've been trying to repeal. You could read full text of ACA prior to passage
not so. Remember Pelosi. They voted within a week of the final draft of thousands of pages.
"final draft" which was almost identical to the previous drafts. I did read it so I can confirm. Not saying keep ACA
saying if you dump it it will cause more harm than spending all the energy repealing on fixing it
they're adults with adult pants. Pull them up and fix this shit
Trump is all about efficiency and results. Look at campaign spending vs results. Less govt. middle man will result in lower cost
I'm 26. Graduated summa cum laude, work for a huge worldwide company. Can't afford my health coverage without insurance.
without ACA refs, I would not have health insurance and may be headed down the road to death- pre-existing conditions man!
This is real life where consequences are higher. Like life and death
In school, deleting your whole paper and turning in something blank because "it wasn't so great" would get you a 0
wasn't the GOP voting to repeal every day or something? And yet no better plan in play, still!
ACA repeal would give millionaires an avg tax cut of $50,130 and multi-millionaires an avg tax cut of $197,340
Since ACA, my family policy(BC/BS) has increased from about $1600 per month to over $2700 per month.
ACA has dumped more on ER. Can't afford deductible, can't find participating providers. Lots no policy.
Repeal. Replace with commercial, competitive across state line policy. Open, not closed market.
Maybe they were lying to their constituents knowing Obama would veto. Time to call their bluff.
@ keep the government out of healthcare. Eat plant based diet and cure most American sickness!
Referring to bill as ACA may bring some non-partisan supp--"OCare" brings emotion to dems
Stop bragging about your failures; it's pathetic.
Giving the Trump Admin a chance to see if they can do better than the states.
Prior to Obama, the states did a terrible job providing health care with out of control costs.
A society is known by how it treats it's vulnerable citizens. Unborn and elderly are at risk in the US!
You should meet with your constituents to discuss their healthcare needs. #TownHall
I live on $753 a month in SS benefits.$133 in FS. Obama stole 500 million from Medicare.cut med benefit
Rescind your own health care  & retirement package that my tax dollars pay for and then we'll talk.
^5 Health  Ins Co ...and physicians..know the ACA is about to go off a cliff...must repeal&replace
@SenRandPaul Republicans can be such a disappointment. 8 yrs - you should've had a plan ready to go Day1.
In case you have short memories, we voted for DJT because he's not like the majority of lazy Republicans.
Repeal it.  Help those with chronic conditions but let free market fix it. Supposed to be conservatives
enough talk. Get it done!
Desparately need consumer protection provisions and cost control.  I have indiv policy very nervous.
No more excuses boys, get it done.
repeal these senators! Your constituents deserve better! Cruz definitely getting repealed soon!! Byebye
Which one of the 63 repeal votes was that?
Remember this?
and then what?
Repeal Congressional healthcare
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI Are you going to give us all access to your insurance and at an affordable rate?
Please Guys, This must happen Soon or "you all"  lose your edge ! @SenateMajLdr
@SpeakerRyan @SenTedCruz @TGowdySC @RepChaffetz @TomCottonAR
sweet, copy and paste pontificating...
how about actually offering up a plan...
if your plan doesn't cover pre-existing conditions, you don't have a plan...
and probably don't care about the American people.
@Pjw20161951 @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI *2 Govt has no biz in healthcare biz- except to prosecute carriers who set up senario for
My son, age 32 pays $233.76 monthly. $5000 deductible. Had an x-ray, cost $1100. Insurance paid zero. California
Now we know it was all fake!!!
@Pjw20161951 @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI  Yes! Gruber/Barry  were hoping O/Care fail would usher in Univ Health Care aka Socialism!
Just like VA healthcare.   We vets just dying for that care. Killing patients is much cheaper than healing them.
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI go ahead and kill more Americans than in the war
the very insurance you were once on. I live in Texas. I won't be voting for you.
where's the replace? You should work for us.
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI that a bunch of crap. Give people the plan u and all Senator have that only fair
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI All Fed Govt employees & Senators must B on same hlthcare as citizens who pay Ur salaries!
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI YES 2 Full Repeal! Get govt out of hlthcare!  Govt messes up everything it touches ie #SS
haha CONGRESS No the house and they were WRONG give us something to replace
And ~2,533 days ago Obama signed it and y'all sat on your asses and did what's typical. Nothing
Go for it you 3 braniacs! You will become The Three Stooges of America!Save this tweet, mark my words!
Pelosi, Warren and Clinton already took that job.  "We must pass it to see what's in it." LOL
Is this why you won't investigate #TrumpRussia? Trying to benefit from illegitimate election?
Don't  disgrace Benson. He had sense.  FBI, reported in NYT & by CNN,  no link between Trump & Russia. Keep up.
what happened to repeal and replace DAY ONE
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI
What will you replace it with? You had six years to come up with a replacement and failed. SAD!
Repeal? Hell, I don't hear much about a replacement for ACA; that makes much sense - - unless U R Rich!
Sincerely We The Tax Payers r shocked 2C how SLOW the Congress WORKS! We would lose our job in 3Days!
. No more political games!!  Repeal and have to wait for replacement NO WAY!  FIX IT! NO REPEAL!
do not throw the baby out with the bath water.
Pay for the wall, the 54 Billion on defense, can't wait to hear how ACA is too expensive
Senator. You and your colleagues need to yank Ryan and McConnell's heads out of their asses.
BTW #investigatetrump we want answers. #IndependentInvestigation #DoYourJob
psycho!
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI screw over as many Americans as you can. Must be nice all that privilege.
as a constituent of yours with a chronic illness, will I be able to afford ins? #highinterestpools don't count.
As a healthy male, I lost my FT job and ins after Obama signed the bill no one read. Still without. Did you care about us?
Here's how you pass it. Make Senators and Congressmen be on it. Total fairness and agreement. PERIOD
less than 2 years from now, constituents you ignore will repeal you!  Polish that resume. #TownHall
get it done!
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI Keep going at your own peril #CorruptGOP
They were sent to repeal & replace. Better happen in a timely fashion or they'll lose jobs
Lets hope this happens. I do not want to see Republicans renege on this important issue.
YES!!!!  This is a must. I am worried with all the "replace" talk.
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI You  represent ALL of your state NOT just ones voted GOP. Dynamic world. Change or get out.
Unlike DNC who screwed millions to get votes.
GOP has no clue what to do with health care.Follow GOP ideology = lose next election. Existential issue
LYING TED AT IT AGAIN DISGUSTING KOCHSUCKER .
... full speed ahead, please ...
 but make sure replacement is better. Fixes problems.
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI  #StandWithRand
Please put away the arrogance and quit trying to re-invent the wheel.  JUST FIX WHAT IS BROKEN.
With the government system, that would take much longer.
OH AND BTW, 2 years from now you will be unemployed.  We are working on FULL REPEAL too.  Only WE have a plan, LOL!  Enjoy!!
will be interesting to watch all ghe Trump voters in 'blue wall' lose their coverage.
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI LYIN TED
@RandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI lol, come up with a decent replacement... but let's be honest. Y'all are incompetent
I hope you are well with letting people die!!! You SUCK!!!
So where's the repeal & replace??? Should've been  ready to go on 1/20. Just get it done!!!
.@SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @SenRandPauI What will you do for the millions of Texas children w/disabilities who rely on it for chance at life?
And while you are at it ... I vote for all fed employees being req'd to use ACA replacement @GOP
and you've have 6 long years to study/understand it & you still have nothing!!! ACA Repeal=Death
Sen. Cruz go for it!
so your saying that for 2 yrs you guys have been pickin' boogers what the heck? Where's the new plan?
sick of this BS! Fix the #ACA DO NOT REPEAL. What is your plan @GOP cowards?
Rand Paul once said Donald Trump is a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag,,, Now he kisses his ,,,,
You don't get it. The replacement is the problem, not repeal. Medicare for all. Fund w/cap increase.
YES, What happened 2 the "Plan"?
you mean the one from 2 years ago, 2 years ago, 2 years ago, 2 years ago, 2 years ago, or 2 years ago?
still don't have a legit plan to replace? Ohhh go suck an egg!
Ted Cruz's Biggest Liability Is Probably His Constant Lying
Cruz once called Trump a 'sniveling coward', now he's kissing his,,,,,,
Repeal & replace w/ single payer, Medicare for all! 
Everyone should have to suffer equally. Socialism is anti-American and always brings death and poverty when fully implemented.
make it happen
