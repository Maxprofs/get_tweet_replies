@RandPaul @BernieSanders ....are you really trying to downplay bernie??? In hopes of getting one of the other republican cronies in ?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders hope bernie has a heart attack. He looks like he has an anger management issue.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders #StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul When is @BernieSanders not shouting?
@RandPaul If you would focus on the issues you have in common with @BernieSanders you probably can get a lot done. #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders not really "premium" is not a buzzword
@RandPaul we've been conditioned to hear those regularly over past 7 yrs. No Longer shocking.
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @BernieSanders  #SWR #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Rand is jealous because he got booted off the debate stage.  Bahahahahahahaha
@RandPaul @BernieSanders he doesn't want to lose support when ppl find out he's raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders enjoyed your noshow at the debate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders go away!! Bernie!!!!!! We need Bernie
@RandPaul @BernieSanders what is the real cost of not doing it?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Piss off Rand. Close the tax loopholes for the wealthy and corporations. #RandPaul
@3arle2 @RandPaul @BernieSanders you probably should know rand's tax plan before you troll.
@RandPaul just out of curiosity where are you polling and why do you think you have any chance ...your black out won't end because your lame
@RandPaul @BernieSanders  I thought you were better than that rand . Bernie more honest than ANY of you.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders that's bullshit homey. That's why you got banished to the kid table at the last republican debate..
@RandPaul @mlong42947 @BernieSanders He's a Tard-
@RandPaul @BernieSanders you didn't even make  the stage last time
@RandPaul @BernieSanders You skipped your debate and now you want to participate in our debate?#Women4Bernie
@RandPaul @RobKowalWGBB @BernieSanders It's a little comprehensive for a minute answer so use the Google http://www.wsj.com/articles/bernie-sanders-releases-medicare-for-all-single-payer-health-plan-1453078558 â€¦
@RandPaul @BernieSanders at least he didn't silence his own voice like you did to yourself at the last debate #DemDebate #GOPDebate
@Jennifer_Henke @RandPaul @BernieSanders pay attention Rand got more press
@Sid_1070 @RandPaul you are absolutely right, unfortunately that is what this political race has come down to, who can get more press time
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie, what is the rich's fair share of taxes? They ALREADY pay vast major of taxes while many people pay no taxes
@randpaul @berniesanders So you think you can just take our taxes and give us nothing in return. No wonder your campaign is DEAD.
@RandPaul we already know there is no issue that @BernieSanders won't try to demagogue.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders 
While the GOP has no sane proposals at all.
Oh oh, living in the past.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie has actually laid out the costs of his proposals AND how they'd be paid for :) I #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul Pffftttt.
@RandPaul @mlong42947 @BernieSanders What about shrill 
@HillaryClinton #BunchOfCrazies
@RandPaul @BernieSanders 1%! 99%! MILLIONAIRES! BILLIONAIRES! BREAK THE BANKS!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Agree.  He is such a populist, a sincere delusional with simple rah rah answers to complex questions. #nopragmatism
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Benghazi!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders they all seem mentally ill, delusional.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders sir, we can afford the cost if we drop tax credit we give to millionaire.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders at the #GOPDEBATE it was War, ISIS, Bombing, Canada Birth Certificate #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders The old fool.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders nothing more than the rantings of a mad man 
#DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders go home Paul your drunk.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Telling folks all these things you gone do but never how you gone do?Sounds like somebody else out there
@RandPaul @BernieSanders why aren't you attacking @HillaryClinton
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Find the plans to pay for each proposal at http://berniesanders.com 
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Show me the money!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders lol maybe the debt ceiling wouldn't  get raised as necessary to pay for it all
@RandPaul @BernieSanders are you even relevant?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Real costs or nominal? You've been known to conflate the two.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Are they having a debate?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders he won't admit that the national debt already equals the GDP. There's not enough $ at the top to pay for all this.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders "KOCH BROTHERS!"
@RandPaul @BernieSanders how is that different than any debate this election cycle.  Your comments included.
@RandPaul How much money did it cost O'Malley for the only on-stage seat to the Bernie/Clinton debate?! #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders ugh, can't watch that shit anymore.  The sum of the IQs on that stage doesn't break 100
@RandPaul @BernieSanders So many lies they cant keep up withem all they kinda just run together story always changes #SWR #DemDebate
@RandPaul #demdebate  If you had run a similar campaign to Bernie, on the Repub side, about campaign finance reform, you would be doing well
@RandPaul 

Friend, I believe in you, but our cause may be better served if you were on the democratic ticket.
@RandPaul who are you again?
@RandPaul Millions of Americans are disappointed that you are just a shadow of your father.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Yea, he can't do that; republicans own that strategy.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders he is the liberal Donald Trump.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders I literally just said this to my friend. Now I know why the yuppies eat his crap up.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders at least people still know he's running strong. What's your excuse?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders there's a reason his initials are BS
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Since when do Leftists care about costs?  Well, unless it's for something proper like defense, that is.
@RandPaul what has happened to your campaign, stalking @SenSanders on Twitter while you refuse to debate?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders it's simple! Raise taxes on the billionaires and we'll all be swimming in money!
@RandPaul @BernieSanders  Its all a show lookattem their faces scripted standin dirty knowin they are up too no good period #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Kinda like the Republican debates? #demdebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Hey now, coming up with actual solutions is hard work.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Must be done, must change, must be fixed. How, how, how Bernie? Oh yea, government, government, government
@RandPaul @BernieSanders 19 trillion!!! And Bernie wants to spend 19 billion more! #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders same old Bernie song and dance, don't answer the question just rephrase it
@RandPaul @BernieSanders just because Bernie identifies the problem it doesn't mean he has the solution.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders That's all Bernie does...he shouts buzz words and uneducated youth buy it all "hook, line, and sinker"
@RandPaul @BernieSanders campaing finance reform is the number one issue facing this nation.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders did you watch the republican debate?
@RandPaul I wish the gop debate moderators had the courage to give you guys this type quality questions
@RandPaul @BernieSanders
@RandPaul @BernieSanders That's how he hypnotizes people w/o offering anything of substance #RandRally #NotFeelinTheBern
@RandPaul @BernieSanders all trump does is about buzzwords....scary because it works.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie will spend us into oblivion. Please save us from outrageous spending, Rand! #StandWithRand #DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Bernie's D- must have been in math.
@RandPaul Bernie sounds like an angry Long Islander, O'Malley sounds like my grandmother trying to break up a fight, and Hillary is Hillary
@RandPaul @BernieSanders Did you miss the 140 economists endorsing him on his plans? Or the trillions of dollars in savings had under them?
@RandPaul @BernieSanders You arent even polling
@RandPaul .@BernieSanders Bernard needs to drink some tea with honey.

#RandRally
#DemDebate
@RandPaul @BernieSanders my favorite buzzword is "poop".
@RandPaul go to http://berniesanders.com  Doc ... you can get em all right there
@RandPaul @BernieSanders we can't afford it.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders that's cause @SenSanders can't hear himself talk
@RandPaul @BernieSanders at least he got invited to debate.
@RandPaul @BernieSanders trigger!!
