@RandPaul private enterprise with few restrictions always will do a better, cheaper more efficient job than the government
@RandPaul federal gov is spending over a trillion dollars/yr on healthcare. That's why we can't afford it. All the hospital beds are taken
@shicks_sam @RandPaul Maybe we should check a few pockets because that ain't going to healthcare
@EJRaoulduke1976 @RandPaul Supply and demand. The gov supplies a trillion dollars to seniors for health care and now prices go up.
@shicks_sam @RandPaul Then those seniors pay inflated rates and insurance companies pocket a large chunk
@EJRaoulduke1976 @RandPaul there is no price discovery. There is no free market. Medicare and Medicaid over a trillion dollars
@RandPaul What a crazy idea mentally ill people being forced to compete for Health Care.  #Demtownhall
@HerschelEdelman @RandPaul Oh I thought Doctors were suppose to be taking care of their patients not entering competitions.#Demtownhall
@HerschelEdelman @RandPaul Doctors are pricing the cost of their services? So patients should go to the cheapest doctors?
@HerschelEdelman @RandPaul American Medical Association (AMA) has had monopoly on health care system for over 100 years that free market?
@RandPaul more comp isnt needed; Better, affordable & easily accessible care is what is needed, Health care shld b a right not privilege
@RandPaul with more whoremongers taking a cut from costs? Only bad gov. I see is repub controlled gov. Your rhetoric is pandering.
@RandPaul @WorldRyan Dude, you had your chance and flushed it. Stop making it worse
@RandPaul Sure because capitalist doctors are fighting to get a piece of all that impoverished mentally unstable money out there.
@RandPaul because more government is the greatest contributor for increased mental health issues!
@RandPaul yeah, because profiting off people mental struggles and suffering is such a grand idea.
@RileyRandom @RandPaul country is not a communist country. More competition means better rates.
@Haydn_Curtis @RandPaul for them, less economic competition was a godsend. That being said - if it works there, will it work here?
@RileyRandom @RandPaul so it would be hard to say. Like you said, it's debatable. You could argue all day about this; similar to min wage
@Haydn_Curtis but should min wage be tied to inflation? I've always liked that idea more than outright raising, you know?
@RileyRandom I think min wage has a part to do with it, same w/ how it has to do w/ unemployment. I'm still very new to min wage debate tbh
@RandPaul competition leads to cost cutting, which undermines service for these patients.
@RandPaul ....and more mental health providers and facilities
@RandPaul promote the general Welfare---> get EVERYONE covered via single payer...there's FULL access for ya.
@MAHAMOSA @RockyjSquirrel2 @RandPaul His ad reads like something out of France. 50% youth unemployment
@Jasper1166 @MAHAMOSA @RandPaul Whose ad?
@RandPaul I've seen ppl raped/die in those places for whistleblowing whitesupremacy, burning kkk robes, complaining of them killing my dad
@RandPaul more health care companies, that's why your not in the race
@RandPaul You want people with mental health issues to compete for healthcare? Sounds sadistic to me.
@RandPaul I wish u would run to win. UL nvr get RNC nom. I would vote for u if I thought it would help. #scvoter #Rpaulistrustworthy
@RandPaul Really Dr. Paul?  More competition in health care?  If Having heart attack I'll visit ER's and compare, like when buying a TV.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul .. what?
@RandPaul So more insurance companies to deny more people's claims? Good call.
@RandPaul shut up
@RandPaul Competition should not be a factor. Get profit out of healthcare and get equal access for all.
@RandPaul 
Why do Americans spend more on health care, and die younger
than in nations with socialist health care?
...
#MoreFearMoreProfit
.
@RandPaul we've tried that, big Pharma and insurance companies are more interested in profiting and raising drug prices.
@RandPaul free market doesn't work for health care. That's ok. No system is perfect.
@RandPaul oh yes that's worked so well.
@RandPaul my dad Vietnam Vet - unable to navigate beaurocracy.  Need more help, less 'choice' in some areas.
@RandPaul That isn't going to bring down the cost. You have no idea how healthcare works in this country do you?
@RandPaul trolling the #DemTownHall because you're only polling at 2% of GOP? Sorry, we don't want you either.
@RandPaul Rand, that doesn't work with mental health.
@RandPaul because those that need it most can afford to buy it from a private enterprise trying to maximize the bottom line?
@RandPaul it's worked so well for the prisons
@RandPaul that's not how it works in Canada and we have better care for a greater proportion of our population.
America tried that and it's not working. We can't afford any more generations of mentally unhealthy people @RandPaul !
@RandPaul The ACA (insurance monopoly act) might have something to do with the lack of competition me thinks...I pay cash for my care
@RandPaul Unfortunately the biggies stifle competition by monopoly.   Break up the rich investment units to avoid manipulation!
@RandPaul You think mentally ill people have any income to profit off of? Come on quit trying to leach attention from Bernie killing it.
@RandPaul where there is people poor and in need there's money and business to be had, right doc?
@RandPaul no. Tried that. It works for iPhones not people's lives. Grow up dammit. Youre too smart to be so juvenile.
@RandPaul No, let's have universal coverage with single payer health care and not pay more per capita than any other country.
@RandPaul if u want ppl 2 have more n better access 2 mental healthcare,  republicans should quit cutting funding 4 it #keeppsychcntrsopen
@RandPaul Please explain what u mean. that makes 0 sense
@RandPaul incredible how all our private competition just leads to higher prices and oligopoly that hurts consumers
@RandPaul more competition means jack shit when vast majority of people cannot AFFORD those services b/c of the unfair system #DemTownhall
@RandPaul other studies show no benefit http://homeless.samhsa.gov/resource/a-comparison-of-public-and-privatized-approaches-to-managed-behavioral-health-care-for-persons-with-serious-mental-illness-18002.aspx …
@RandPaul IF WE DIDNT HAVE THE FEDS IN EVERY PART OF OUR LIVES WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF!!
@RandPaul The same ins Co cover most states yet costs continue to rise in states with multiple providers. How's that competition work so far
@RandPaul if more competition guarantees the best results, does trump's lead in a field of 16 prove he's the best republican for president?
@RandPaul @handymayhem we have lots of competition more than any other country why then are we not the best ?
@RandPaul #Shhhh! #Competition is #Evil. #America was built with it.
@RandPaul you can have competition with single payer system. Your way will make insurance companies richer
@RandPaul privatized mental health services has been tried & often has negative impact https://www.aacap.org/aacap/policy_statements/2004/Privatization_of_Publicly_Funded_Community_Mental_Health_Services.aspx …
@RandPaul subtract "mental" and the statement is still valid and all encompassing.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Your style of "competition" won't bring the prices down. #cartels
@RandPaul bc "competition" in healthcare has worked so well, amirite?!
@RandPaul than you create same problem as the the prison system: more convicts and mentally ill is good for business.
... @randpaul More competition for MH services by lowering costs!! Make services more affordable.
@OldeHippi @RandPaul Yeah, like all other medical services and cable/internet providers, and road contractors and pro athlete employers and
@RandPaul puppet, you used to have principles and ethics
@RandPaul Screw off. We tried that. Keep polling at 2%. Single Payer.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Sooo, competition for who can make mental health patients fork out the most?
Sorry, I luv ya’ @RandPaul, but your @GOP team had their chance with #healthcare. And you punted. For 50 years.
If you want people to have more and better access to mental health care lets have more competition not more gov #DemTownHall
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Our mental health system is already maxed out with just those in GOP  Pres. field #DemTownHall
@RandPaul do your thing.
@RandPaul Just say no to government mental health screening
@RandPaul and how exactly does that work?
@RandPaul
@RandPaul I'm genuinely curious (and concerned). Explain this, if you can muster the intelligence to form sentences.
@RandPaul competition got us in this mess. Let's try healthcare instead of war. No more corporate controlled government. #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul Abolish the useless private medical insurance racket. Encourage competition at the level of care, not competition for leeches.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul what about if you can't afford it because your poor? Too bad?
@RandPaul They'll charge insane prices for basic human rights
@RandPaul RAND!!! Stop using words of logic! Just sink to their level! Call them racists and move on! It's the American way!
@RandPaul this is the stupidest thing I have read all day.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul I don't think we need competition in health care....Really, making money off of people's health. We are not a libertarian country!
@RandPaul
@RandPaul #DemTownHall Wrong side of history again, Rand
@RandPaul We must recognize that NOT all people who have Mental Health crisis are dangerous. Some are very docile. #IndividualCases
@RandPaul
@shupe_laura @RandPaul instead of corporations and billionaires controlling with insider trading and monopolies?
@RandPaul Informed Consent includes access to alternatives to psychiatric drugs
@RandPaul Competition is stagnating because the companies are in cohoots. How do you fix that without forcing competition?
@RandPaul  caring competition not oppressive government Control
@RandPaul the problem with Competition is you have to have someone to compete with
@RandPaul yeah because the old model has worked wonders!!
@RandPaul companies are going to compete to treat homeless veterans with PTSD and schizophrenia?
@hjfrousseau @RandPaul How can companies compete with the mandated mental health drug companies over medicating everyone?
@RandPaul healthcare providers have been getting bought up and shut down left and right since the "ACA"
@randpaul Get rid of the shrinks and you will have mental health.
@RandPaul
@Don_Vito_08 @RandPaul Is that your only tweet?  Need to do better than that
