thanks Ron Paul for voice on misuse of Americans' taxes, waiting on @SenatorCollins and @SenAngusKing to explain yeas to Mainers
Thanks again @RandPaul why can't you @SenatorCollins and @SenAngusKing just say it...it's the jobs, just say you both voted for the jobs
very bad when the means justifies the end...those weapons are killing thousands of Yemen innocents
and voting against mandatory GMO labeling, that's when you first lost credibility with Mainers

AMERICANS VOTERS LISTEN 2 RAND'S MESSAGE
A POLITICIAN WITH PRINCIPLES INTEGRITY VALUES
if I were voting GOP and I have come close...it would have been for you.
Why is he in the Republican Party for then?
back Trump and save America
How about GOPers who don't want US citizens getting healthcare but send their Tax dollars to allow Israels free healthcare to boom
#StandWithRand the American way isn't they way we've been at all..
@realDonaldTrump @LynoMN #TRUMP2016 OIC+IslamicLaw+U.N.+Globalism+ICANN+Terror+Censorship watch
They didn't hate us until we tried to use them, I didnt have any problems in Pakistan backpacking in 1987 - but it was coming...
he should get behind trump!
How can any moral being not want to burn USavages flag - symbol of perpetual war, PhD Orwellean liars &absolute EVIL in this world
Who would not hate a serial rapist paedo priest who lies invades kills destroys tortures occupies profiteers & plunders your home?
why US gives money to Saudis and Saudis give money to al Qaida. DoesUS carry responsibility for money &arms that'regiven away
@FixUSANow or even here in our own Country!
Or strafe your ships ?
Call on your colleagues to help you stop this nonsense!
@SeanKD agree brother Paul.
stop the sacrifice of America on the alter of a global agenda.
Please also help us in #FlintWaterCrisis and my Kratom community by giving us a voice! #IAmKratom #SaveKratom
All the love to you, Rob. Thank you for giving my community a voice!
we agree.  I can't believe everyone doesn't also agree
kinda looks like NC, last night. =\
You think the Zionists love us? They use us for these wars that are creating blowback. How many more wars & money for #Israel?
CORRECT mate !
You and @BernieSanders should get in a room together & don't come out until you find a solution we can live with- then pass it.
Whole countries, all in those countries, that get aid from us hate us and burn our flag? C' mon, that has to be a huge lie.
.@RandPaul @Paolalopez1971 
Bravo Mr Paul
(At least there is one intelligent Paul and it's not this one @SpeakerRyan )
@Gordon22114 Globalism is just another try at a Third Reich. We've been there & done that. Stupid idea to think it would work!!
@billpostmus Thank u senator Paul!!!
Then stop it. Period. MAGA!
Good Job Rand!
and now we are spending tax payer money for part of CLINTON campaigning by OBAMA, they have no morals !!!
.@RandPaul @4everchiefsfan Thank you!
amen
UNDERSTAND THIS-DOCTORS
THIS SURVEY PROVES WE MURDER OUR UNBORN=@CivilRights& @LorettaLynch OBSTRUCT JUSTICE2
Too bad none of the jackass socialists that represent CT think this way. Second worst rated governor in America is Dan Malloy.
.@RandPaul actually it isn't! Ya'll take more than you contribute to the federal government but that's a good sound bite!
how about saving us from our dipshit Governor??? @MattBevin
With #CongressionalDebtAbuse 9/20 $19,524,335,895,543.03 we should not be making #ClimateChangeWelfare Pmts to Foreign Countries @RandPaul
#hitler invented #libertarianism
please don't forget many Americans (I'm not from KY) don't want our taxes spent on #Israel either.
HOO AND DEMOCRATS HAVE A PLAN
why was I included in this silly tweet?
this is such a myopic simplified view
@FrenchForTrump But you drink their oil & make drug deal with them so you are debtor cause of fractional reserve @federalreserve
then follow your conscience instead of misguided loyalty and endorse #JohnsonWeld2016 . This country needs your honest voice.
MORE MONEY AND HELP - LESS HATE
DID YOU ENDORSE trump?
How about ending tax exempt status for the NFL as well.
HRC will finish sending the jobs overseas that Obama started.  Economy is only fair because of lower gas prices.People get a clue.
How about standing up for our right to use natural botanicals to help ourselves? #PocanSalmonDearColleagueLetter #IAmKratom
Dr. Paul Thank u for standing up for America's rights, let's take care of her first!
Unfortunately, @SenateMajLdr and rest of crooks in Congress D/N agree w you. They loot Treasury regularly instead of helping US
@JaniceMontalto And how many days have you spent promoting Trump to help you do this. Remember Make America Great Again.
Then do something abt the senior senator from #Kentucky He is a pimple on the butt of the Bluegrass state @senatemajldr
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @SenateMajLdr Please propose Iowa-style, permanent districts nationwide. Gerrymandering killing us!
Than you better swallow your vice full pride and endorse change, TRUMP or your just one my hypocrite
@CoxLanham71  Why has the congress failed to make DOJ do its job related to the contract aliens signed for citizenship?
my Tennessee senators suck. I want to work on replacing them w liberty candidates! Ones who will #standwithrand
You are a true patriot ! God bless you for being loyal to your constituents. We need many more like you in Washington.
I love it when Senator @RandPaul brings the fire, his words inspire.
Nice sound bite but tax dollars been going 2 countries who hate US forever.
Is this bozo running for reelection ?
Yeah, it's the only time they look like they doing their job.
I agree! We are paying either bribes or protection money as if it helps in any way.

Here is the list of traitors who voted to sell $1 Billion in weapons to Saudi Arabia yesterday. At least 1 senator didn't sell out
THANK YOU for trying to stop weapons to Saudi Arabia, unlike some others @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress
@SenBennetCO too bad you don't stand for Colorado the same as @RandPaul stands for Kentucky!
keep up the good fight for us all!
Paul, I love ya, but I have high doubts you'd be president. Unfortunately I am just a kid.
will you stand idly by while a racist runs for president?
I agree must stop the racist @HillaryClinton
yes Hillary is the only chance to stop racist trump.  thanks
racist @HillaryClinton will lose to Trump I know thanks for your support
she might but trump is still a bigoted racist as agreed by sen paul ryan
Hillary Clinton is a racist Paul Ryan is a douchebag and part of the progressive establishment
you may be right about paul ryan but wrong about Hillary.  Donny's dad in kkk, Donny refused to rent to black people
Hillary Clinton mentor Sen. Robert Byrd was the head of WV. KKK
I do like you, however, veterans need help. A bit more important than roads & bridges. What r u doing to hold the VA accountable?
agreed! The only one that can and will do it is Mr. Trump. And you know it
how about no more money to any country ever again? Use the money to take care our own country
also execute gay people, subjugate women, fund terrorism...
I admire you Rand. In many ways. Your kind heart, sharp mind & intelligence. I hope you run for Pres again. I'd vote for you.
You really came on my radar when you filibustered to stop drone attacks on Americans. Been a fan ever since. God Bless you!
Thank You
So right. Americans first.
