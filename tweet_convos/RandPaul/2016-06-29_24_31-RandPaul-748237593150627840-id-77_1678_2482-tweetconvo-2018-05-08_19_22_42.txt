might never happen but Senator Paul would be at top of my list for Trumps VP.
@deppisch Your constitution means only what one liberal SC Justice wants it to mean.
@pysih
What we have right now is a SC run by a Kennedy. He's the swing vote. His interpretation is key.
okay, that’s neat, but you’re still a giant sack of racist crap and you should self-immolate at your earliest convenience.
Here, I'm going to need you to stand in front of this trench for a second.
<--my hero. I hope he's POTUS someday...  @LainieYennie
ThankU Senator Paul for clarifying. Unfortunately, mny millenials hv no idea what's in the #COTUS. Mny College profs r Marxists
@RLibertyCaucus "Constitution? What Constitution?" -California
Now THAT is historically accurate. Much better.
Aimee, at what age is a fetus a human? When it starts feeling pain and has a heart beat? Please educate yourself dear
.@RandPaul Will Trump push #CronyCapitalism for S. Adelson? Maybe you said you'd back him, but you took an oath to defend the #Constitution.
So true!!!  What has happened?
@MalibuRumBarbie Bottom line.
@Billright50 OMG!!! I like it
Constitution is a guiding document and is meant to liberate rather than restrain @AuditTheMedia
@alllibertynews

@Christo64255952 HEAR HEAR!
@DisabledVetsCPX exactly. and the 2nd for us to protect ourselves from same government////
@FHTPofKS somewhere the people that represent us forgot what the Constitution was drafted for to restrain government
@RandPaul
The U.S. Government has become a malignant cancer growth and these cells get their nutrition from Liberal's agenda. #weneedtrump
@alllibertynews Yes, so when U all moving to impeach Judge Richard Posner of the 7th circt?? Soon right?
@alllibertynews That's actually not true- it was written to restrain and empower both the government and the people.Maybe read it?
Should not Ms. Lynch step aside in the Clinton E mail case? No attorney would meet with the spouse of someone under FBI investigat
thanks for sharing Dr. Rand Paul, have a gr8 "Thursday" (Want this ? >> http://bit.ly/tweet_thanks_ )

@BednarzJoseph WHY WON'T THE COWARDLY CONGRESS STOP OBAMA. SEN. SHELBY ONLY 1 TO TRY & U TOOK HIS COMMITTEE! LIARS! #TrumpTrain
Tell that to King Obama.
CIA Director Brennan has put off releasing the 28pages, is there something you can do Senator??? It's been 15 years.
And why don't the boys on the hill understand that.
@LRMarsh16 we are safer when central planners are in charge though
it's also a living and breathing document. Which means things change
It obviously was tho....because here we are. It allowed this. Over. And over. Worse each year since 1789. #tcot

Funny, I don't remember the word restrain being in the constitution. But what do I know? I'm not an eye doctor.

@RandPaul

exactly
Until incorporation, the Bill of Rights didn't apply to states, so states could (and did) restrain those rights :(
@BrannonNelson And government does little to restrain those it contracts for the job of restraining us so as to claim ignorance
I saw an article about how Brexit signals end of unfettered capitalism.
If a million pages of regulation is unfettered......
therefore calls for an immediate vote to restore SC to full strength to restrain got overreach?
Why don't you n #Cruz team up FIGHT for U.S.?  #DelegatesVoteCruz /Paul. Settle your differences on Ntl Sec n UNITE U.S.
Marbury vs. Madison - the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and any law that goes against it is null and void.
You were our only hope in this election. Now look the choices we're stuck with :(
The truth, I pray it always stays that way, Amen. @seanhannity @ericbolling @kimguilfoyle
and Capitalism wasn't made to destroy the middle class but is destroying it!!
Actually, big gov't is destroying middle class. We haven't had capitalism in a long time. It would actually work.
I agree !!
Really? This seems... simplistic.
It's hilarious to me that some of the founding fathers thought we wouldn't need the bill of rights to limit govs. power.
that is pretty hilarious. They get so little credit for their lighthearted side.
1/2Its just ironic that because the power to infringe on the rights not existing in the Constitution it wouldnt be necessary
remind our government representatives of that pls.
agreed. look at what we have become, when we ignore the very document, that protects us all
#OneManWithCourageIsAMajority
