Yes, because bankrupting the country by increasing the debt by TRILLIONS is always in a country's best interest...
A "fact" without a source is hardly a fact.  As to Paul's idea that cutting the corporate tax will keep American companies here...  It's called "Trickle down economics" and it was tried and failed under Reagan.  Trickle down economics doesn't work and never will work.
Still no source for the claims.....  According to the federal Gov't, Bush's "war on terror" accounts for roughly $13 Trillion dollars of the current national debt.  Since the President doesn't have the authority to spend money on his own, Congress is responsible for all debt.
First of all.  The President is incapable of doubling the national debt.  The President requires consent from Congress for any and all financial dealings.  Any time the President wants to spend money, they have to request Congressional approval.
Where are you getting the $$ to do this and what happens to the deficit?
The deficit skyrockets.....like was the case during the G.W. Bush administration.
I know...would love to hear RP's answer.

This is bullshit. Entry level workers wages 1990=$3.80/hr in MO
2017=$7.70/hr in MO
That's over 100% increase, & that's not counting '78-'90
That rate is based on averages.
That rate is based on real state of MO min. wage from the the time I entered workforce to now
I imagine other states are similar as far as increase goes
I haven't cared to research that far back but in Virginia it was $4.25/hr back in 1996 and currently stands at the federal mandate.
MO is one of the states that have always maintained a higher than federal standard min. Even still, that would show an 85% + increase in pay
Of COURSE they want to bring down Big Biz tax rates (like Trumps biz) - they should only reduce middle income tax rates & small businesses!
Well, if T pointed his finger and said, “don’t let it happen,” then my fears are calmed. #sarcasm
Thank you @RandPaul for helping @POTUS get rid of the unconstitutional Ocare! Help him give us historical TaxCuts and we will not forget it!


Trump's new policy will increase premiums by 20%, cost the government $194 billion, increase the deficit, destabilize insurance markets, and increase the number of uninsured Americans. There is nothing it makes better; it's pure policy nihilism. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/13/16467910/trump-obamacare-politics-aca …
He is confused. That’s the Obama Nightmare Plan
This GOP?
Nevada Gov. Sandoval, a Republican: Trump decision to end CSRs is 'devastating' https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/whittling-away-at-obamacare-trump-ends-health-care-subsidies-for-low-income-americans …
I don’t believe anyone anymore except maybe Jeffrey Tucker
u know our corporate taxes are lower than u claim and cos. are more profitable than ever. ur giving  rich the break and the rest the shaft
The US actually has one of the lowest corporate tax rates of any industrialized country....  Businesses are not leaving because of taxes....
What color is his hair NOW??
Tax cuts for the rick won't help anything.
How about C-139 Rick Sanchez?
From now on, anyone who pays more for health coverage or loses it due to preexisting condition can ONLY blame @realDonaldTrump & #Trumpcare.

ThenVOTE for it @ the American people @ make us proud
Just do it.
A fair and simple Tax system for all
If we cut taxes, who will pay for these golf getaways at Trump resorts? Can’t expect the “billionaire” to cover the bill.
But as it stands Senator were really not getting a tax break as a household with no dependents they take away any deductions do the math
Love you Rand! #MAGA
Taxation is theft!
The money parked overseas due to Obama policies is something you should reverse. Why a comp Bill? One paragraph could bring $Trillions back
He always says the right things on tv, then votes against Trump every step of the way!!!
The Corporate Tax Cheats
If 'our companies' are presently making profits at a zero tax [off-shore] owing position, and some at a negative rate, then why stay here?
support HR3282
You are a big coward Rand Paul. The rich run with the rich.Go to Puerto Rico humble yourself. PR’s will move to FL, NY &not vote Republican
Companies aren't leaving. This only helps the TOP 1%.  It hurts the middle and lower income people.  Wake up America and reject this POS.
Ya for the rich !  Puppet
You Kentuckians crack me up take more fed tax $ than you pay in I think we should cut Kentucky off of welfare
The problem is no 1 has the same view on “what is the middleclass.” Ppl earning 100-150k in Ca & NY r middleclass, but may b rich in Iowa!
Rand any interest in Sec of Health? 20% of budget and highest entitlement contributing to national debt. Needs control now. Opportunity!!
Really
Thank you Rand
I hope @POTUS sees this & tells you. its because it doubles the standard deduction from $12k to $24k.  for us, thats huge @realDonaldTrump

Time to vote out RINO’s
Cutting taxes is anti American!!
Hey look at Rand Paul getting on the Trump Train. 
Thanks, I'm glad you're more open on this proposal!
I agree  This could cause a problem, unless fixed, for a lot of the middle class
Your For Big Corporate Tax That Helps your donors .you are bought and paid for @RandPaul and thats what this all about money in your pocket
Senator we are absolutely sure your going to screw up everything in sight.

I am absolutely for helping the middle class for once. and firstly. Pass the standard deduction first.
Really? So far no repeal and replace, no immigration reform, no tax cuts, nothing!!! That is our Senate, can’t and won’t do anything.
Exactly. This is NOT TAX REFORM, it is TAX CUTS, UNFUNDED AND DESTINED TO RAISE THE DEFICIT! It's the MATH STUPID!
Nope, that helps the rich. Reaganomics caused wages to go down not up.
WRONG. Lower taxes, Supply & demand determines both workforce & wages. It's called "competition" and it works. Illegals affect low wages tho
Did he forget that he wants to do all of that on the backs of the poor and middle class?

@RandPaul then get on with it!
But I'm not for putting me under Obamacare
#RandPaul, I think you're for many things right up until the moment you need to vote for.
But then how do we pay your salary, Rand? How do we pay for govt services? Taxes are necessary.
This kind of thinking is the reason that I like Rand Paul
Please do whatever you can do to get this tax reform done! We must have lower taxes for everyone at every level.
Love the way your curls hide your horns. Methinks I need a new stylist. Sometimes you shock even me. #OrderingTheRandCut #TrickleDownBS
Rand paul is as always absolutely for rand paul period
pls work together in senate for God, family, n country--for tax reform, growth, jobs, n prosperity for all americans. dems who resist n obstruct to hurt trump r digging their election graves in 2018 n 2020 cause only ppl they r hurting r we the people.
The plan on the table right now doesn’t do enough for the middle class. We need to plan that Ted Cruz put forth in the primaries.
Thank you
The only way to keep companies here is to pay the American worker the same pay as  a third world country! That’s what you really want!
@RandPaul  Are u absolutely in favor of insuring that the trump kids don't have to pay inheritance tax?
Surely his next sentence started with "but"
Is there proof that cutting corporation taxes will get make companies stay here or come back?
Only way to keep jobs here is do away with the minimum wage. Then people can’t afford your products. You will have to sell overseas.
How about closing loopholes so they pay fair share? That way corporate tax rates can be lowered and the middle class will receive a break!
@DrRandPaul You empower children by teaching them to read. You do not empower the elderly, handicapped, poor by taking HealthCare away!
I hope @RandPaul is telling the truth!
Then why don’t you just vote to do it!
Please fix it, don't be a GOP Sheep!!!

I’m absolutely voting against you next time around
Doubling down on trickle down. We get a pittance & big $ laughs all the way to the bank.
Look @ where the $ goes. If your high on the ladder I’m sure you’ll love it & don’t forget healthcare.
What will happen to the national debt, won't it increase?
Not when you also reduce & eliminate unnecessary federal spending. Which is one of Rand's biggest issues & something he pushes for regularly
#TaxReform #MiddleClass #MiddleFinger
Tell them they can have tax breaks AFTER supplying numerous well-paying jobs.
Get'er done @RandPaul
I never though the GOP would make such sad decisions...the world is rethinking how we look at the GOP do whats right for the ppl...not for just the rich...the middle class build this country did the GOP forget that fact when they made trump the potus
#ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow
Thank you Sen Rand and congratulations on influencing today's executive order!  Always been and always will be a supporter. On to taxes!
Why? #Trump said the stock market is up that means companies are doing well. Why the tax break? Who is lying?
Rand Paul, everyone, the even dumber person's Lyndon LaRouche and corporate shill helping to drive up your medical costs-
Now let’s pass a bill
Good —pls vote for tax proposal!!
absolutely,I&my great beauty @margbrennan discuss & concerned Pres Trump's tax reform,tax cuts for wealthy,could increase Debt in Trillions
Ask @randpaul where he is in his @IRS lawsuit? Doesn't matter because his @FEC bonds are eating themselves (BanNon Pence) Zero is new google
Must cut spending too.   Reform the entitlements that are at least 30% fraud!  #PeakDebt
Did cutting taxes in Kansas keep businesses in Kansas or attract more businesses to Kansas? No? Why do failed policy from Kansas to whoe US?
#StandWithRand
I'm all for taking it from the poorest among us -me- and giving it to the richest among us -you and donnie -   Thank You doctor paul
what's John McCain reason?
Your a hack, once your constituants loose insurance you will be out too.
Yet all this tax cutting and military budget gets bigger and bigger. Then the next proxy way the USA gets involved in.......
Nobody cares about the corporate tax rate. Stop pandering to corporations. It’s sickening.
Corporate tax rates also effect the small business that we currently still have. Closing loop holes and lowering this tax is key.
Sucker. Even businesses that pay no taxes, (there are plenty) won't give up near-slave-wages like China and India. A fool thinks they will.
@RandPaul Thank you for your checks and balances.
How about cut the corporate tax rate so they don’t pass on those costs to us, the consumers, while we’re standing at the cash register?




Flat Tax
@RandPaul @potus @HouseGOP @SenateGOP   Common sense here.  Citizens work more, more income, more tax, more spending.   Everyone benefits.
Than do it no excuse
How can anyone in congress defend not wanting tax cuts , better healthcare and infrastructure for their states ?
Talk talk talk
Mr. President, Using sick children as polical pawns is EVIL... FLAT-OUT EVIL!
Like the one Obama use to sign Obamacare bill
You’re delusional! Absolutely delusional! Please back this Fraudulent claim with proof!
Why work if you have to pay your employer?
What are you waiting for?
