@RandPaul why? Did the Repubs wear a name tag to identify the fascists? #stfu
@stevenwishnoff @RandPaul You say the word "fascist" like it's a bad thing! #noYOUstfu
@eric_poitras @stevenwishnoff @RandPaul fascism is a bad thing
@ecalaPremmuS @stevenwishnoff @RandPaul Its actually a LOT like socialism and communism. I bet you don't know what fascism even means!
@eric_poitras @stevenwishnoff @RandPaul you're right, I have no idea! Is it like dictatorship of fashion designers?
@RandPaul IKR? Would have been awesome if the GOP debaters wore them so we'd know who was the anti-Christ, the Four Horsemen and the Devil.
@Kympocalypse @RandPaul they're all democrats. There were no conservatives on that stage
@imrnlil No conservatives on the GOP stage? Duly noted. 

@RandPaul
@RandPaul Says the dude who couldn't even make his parties last debate.
@ChadwickFurr based on your "this is not a church" pic, Rand is the last person you should be harassing. Hes for separation of church/state
@MuskratLove727 Ok?! Thanks for that.....
@RandPaul as opposed to GOP fascists?
@RandPaul I would much prefer a #democraticSocialist than you!  Go #Bernie2016 #feelthebern #MedicareForAll
@alisonbuckley @RandPaul Hitler was the same thing.
@RandPaul quit throwing that word around out of its original contxt and def. I used to halfway admire you, Doc. Not anymore.
@Anthony_Elias1 oh.. But he did. @RandPaul is the subject of fraud much like was perpetrated on his father.
@Anthony_Elias1 @FoxNews Wow! To anybody that actually reads, that is a GREAT article for Dr. @RandPaul with a horribly misleading headline!
@RandPaul I think the socialists will wear special curly hair pieces, actually.
@RandPaul @GrouchyRasputin just saw this 
.@RandPaul I think Americans want change. The "socialist boogeyman" tag is getting really old. People aren't buying your scare tactics.
@RandPaul perhaps you should wear a name tag to the next GOP debate... Oh wait.
#FeelTheBern
@RandPaul @BernieSanders is a DEMOCRATIC socialist.  It's different.  :)
@RandPaul #RandRally I'm not sure which one either. Maybe they should all be wearing one.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Good idea. #GOPDebate participants should wear name tags, too, so we can tell the anarchists from the apocalyptics and nihilists.
@RandPaul Why because the @gop doesn't have to wear name tags to tell who the lazy republican racists are. Hows your dads newsletter going?
@RandPaul aka @BernieSanders
@RandPaul is an anti-Christ!
@RandPaul appalling comment. Not suited coming from somebody running for @POTUS. This isn't 5th grade, it's the highest office. Shame!
@RandPaul comments like that show you have no respect for the people you work with & represent btw he agreed on your bill to audit the fed
@RandPaul they cared enough to show up.
@RandPaul "Democratic Socialist"
@RandPaul This coming from a candidate that doesn't even make it with the big boys in the Republican debate.  Why are you still running?
@RandPaul @GoldOverFiat @The_Blck_Sheep #nametags
@RandPaul @RealBillyGrant Sanders
@Vol4life75 no thanks Rick! #FreedomNotFreeStuff
@RandPaul At least the Socialist is still at the Grown Up's table and not whining about it!
@RandPaul Ok, I admit that's pretty pathetic. But your gonna have to be a lot more pathetic than that to become relevant again in the GOP.
@RandPaul Like a little yellow star or something...maybe a pink triangle? I know how important labels are to your side lately. 
@RandPaul All the name tags would do is provide you with a distinction without a difference. #DemDebate
@RandPaul Both
@RandPaul hint...it's all of them
@RandPaul OH BUUUURRRNNNNNN
@RandPaul ..Socialist name tags during #DemDebate? As opposed to Republicans who don't need name tags. We know they're all fascists @SMShow
@RandPaul or which one is a woman. Oh wait she will tell us about 20 times.
@RandPaul You certainly had the time to come up with that gem after getting left off the main stage at last Thursday's debate.
@RandPaul at least they all made the main stage. Are you still running curly?
@RandPaul
@RandPaul They are all socialists.  No tags needed.
@RandPaul  You won't need them Rand, they're all red.
@RandPaul Aren't you one? Oh, wait, Libertarians are just Socialist who want to take no ones money and get everything. #NoWonderYourLast
@RandPaul At least, Rand Paul, there's a reasonable number of candidates up there.  And none is insane.  Republicans cannot say the same.
@randpaul I hope you don’t travel on interstate highways. A real libertarian would build his own roadway network. #socialism
@RandPaul you are truly the Guy #America needs but #Sheep wanna flock to #FalseIdols and #Criminals someday they will beg for your help
@RandPaul  Good one
@RandPaul he's the one impersonating Larry David.
@RandPaul @thurlow55 all of the above
@RandPaul haha that's awesome
@RandPaul, your comment makes you a petty little man.
.@RandPaul You don't understand socialism Senator.
@randpaul It will be the ones standing on the far left.
@RandPaul I thought you were above making trollish comments. #classy
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR  #StandWithRand #RandRally
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR Pretty much all offem on that stage ugh #StandWithRand
@RandPaul When I watch the GOP debates, I think similarly, only "which one is the smart one"...it's none of y'all sadly.
@MeanDanceFightr @RandPaul watch better:
@fuckyoupartyUSA If it's not clear, I'm in agreement with you....
@MeanDanceFightr yeah, I thought you were in the same page and would enjoy. Here's some Bernie sanders secrets
@RandPaul They are all socialists.
@RandPaul It's the guy clobbering you in the polls.
@JustinSRobinson @RandPaul And he still has a place at the Grown Up's table and not a whiny quitter!
@RandPaul they are all socialists #RandRally
@RandPaul - Lame.
@RandPaul all of em
@RandPaul shouldn't you be spending your time trying to break that 1% polling goal?
@RandPaul  Are you debating with the big boys?
@RandPaul The z in Nazi stood for socialist. No thanks Bernie. History has proven those ideals are no good. I #StandWithRand
#RandRally
@former_democrat @RandPaul but the S means 'hope'...lmao
@RandPaul haha look at all clowns coming out. You're on a roll keep going!
@RandPaul the socialist is the one that doesnt want drug companies, insurance companies & banks to f&ck you over.  Thats how you tell.
@RandPaul The left cares about money more than health. "Research Obama and Exelon." - Hillary Clinton 2008
@RandPaul Safe to say there are 3 Socialists in the #DemDebate
@RandPaul Of course no name tags required to ID the LIAR of the threesome
@RandPaul say what you will, but the R's are a disaster. Ur a sensible guy. Can't make the stage. What's thy say about ur base?
@RandPaul at least they all showed up
@RandPaul You didn't even need a name tag!
@RandPaul
@RandPaul The socialist will be the one who wins the debate. And addresses concerns of poor and hopeless young adults. He will beat Hillary.
@RandPaul I didn't even know you were running for president until last week, Mr. 2%
@RandPaul id rather be anal raped by a T-Rex than watch a democratic debate.
@RandPaul they let you watch the #DemDebate from the kiddy table?
That wouldn't help. @RandPaul
@RandPaul what is your%?
@RandPaul @TheMorningSpew Lol.
@RandPaul the only people who fear socialism are the ones who don't want corporate socialism & welfare taken away. Hey Rand
@RandPaul Best tweet I've read in a while! Haha....liberals!
@RandPaul and his tainted pseudo-intellectual premises
@RandPaul even with a name tag on no one knows who your dad is anymore
@RandPaul loser
@RandPaul sure would like to hear one of you politicians talk about unifying. Bunch of damn babies. My party better than yours . No mine is
@RandPaul damn Rand someone's feeling the Bern. I'll see you at President Sanders inauguration. #FeelTheBern #DemDebate. Polling at 0% Rand?
@RandPaul Don't quit your day job. #demdebate
@aharbo @RandPaul Remember to see a doctor for that burn and to buy an economics book.
@RandPaul You should wear a name tag that says "Never will be President".
@RandPaul At least they are on stage to wear a name tag! Have a seat!
@RandPaul 
I am still shocked at how " unpresidential" most of the candidates behave. Both Dem & Rep. Childish comments & behaviour.
@RandPaul it's either the old white man or the old white woman
@RandPaul OH SNAP!
@RandPaul At lest they showed up for the debate. Try getting some support ya baby or just show up on Alex Jones again for the nut vote
@RandPaul I listen to Sanders and Clinton supporters fight. It's the best way to realize that neither should be voted for.
@RandPaul how's your life long health insurance and pension via tax dollars going? YOU'RE LIFE THRIVES ON SOCIALISM
@RandPaul posts like this could be the reason you're not polling so well, Mr Paul.
@RandPaul yep Bernie Saunders
@RandPaul you and @SenSanders disagree w Hilary and bernanke about bailouts!
@RandPaul This country is sick exactly for tagging like SOCIALIST, CAPITALIST, COMMUNIST, LIBERAL, NEO... Real issues overlooked 4 decades
@RandPaul they are all worthless
@RandPaul At least he's polling. #pathetic
@RandPaul Hahaha you're gonna make the uneducated kids mad because they have a bern that they need to see the Dr. about
@RandPaul  Bernie: "blah blah Capitalism blah blah oligarchs" 

Steps into the tv world of NBC (GE, Comcast)-----> Irony 
@RandPaul meanness does not work Senator
“@RandPaul: I hope they're going to wear name tags during the #DemDebate tonight so I can tell who the Socialist is...” @Herbs_S_R_A
@WhittyWestside @RandPaul hint: its all of them!
@Herbs_S_R_A @RandPaul I knew you were gonna say that
@RandPaul sour grapes because you didn't get on the big stage at Repubs debate?
@KYGrace @RandPaul And still got more attention!  
@RandPaul hilarious, did you have a name tag for your debate? Oh wait, you're polling so low, you weren't invited!
@RandPaul you will be able to tell soon, he will be the one living in the White House. #DemDebate
@RandPaul and that's the sound of the Rand Paul presidential run coming to a halt.
@RandPaul Go learn about socialism #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul hilarious. #meh
@RandPaul I believe the answer is D. All of the above.
@RandPaul - did they give out name tags at the kids' table?
@RandPaul Well you'll know who is a Democratic Socialist, and that's the one that makes more sense.
@RandPaul afraid of running against someone I see...
@RandPaul They'll all wear the same tag, no? :-)
@RandPaul hey aren't police, fire dept, teachers, Medicare, libraries and national parks all forms of socialism?
@RandPaul trick tweet they all are socialists
@RandPaul the problem is that there are too many people on welfare that want more socialism.
@RandPaul not #FeelTheBern tonight Rand?
@RandPaul really jackass
@RandPaul Hillary is in time for this one!!!
@RandPaul why aren't they all Socialist.  Is there really a difference between a Democrat or Socialist? @talk1073
@RandPaul all the best Mr Paul. Thank you for everything
@RandPaul You and @SenSanders are my two favorite Senators.  Thank you for voting for the audit of the Fed with him!
@Willowmarie27 umm.. That was @RandPaul 's bill.......
@RandPaul but his name isn't socialist tho
@RandPaul don't hate Doc!  There are many socialist programs already in place.  Its time we join other major nations!
@lipskey I take it you don't understand economics?
@RandPaul Or who the old white is?
@RandPaul Why would they need nametags to differentiate things that are exactly the same?
@RandPaul No need.  The old ones are.  The younger one doesn't matter.
@RandPaul triplets
@RandPaul That got me to LOL, well said sir.
