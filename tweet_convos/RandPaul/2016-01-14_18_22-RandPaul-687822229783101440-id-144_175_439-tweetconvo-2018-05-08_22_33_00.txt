@tundra4x4 @RandPaul the federalist papers do you read it?  Most of the gop debaters are promising you things they can't do.
@EricSCodina @RandPaul U might want to make an appointment with the doc 'cause you're blind.  Paul is history.
@bigblueonyou @tundra4x4 @RandPaul what?
@bigblueonyou @tundra4x4 @RandPaul  most of the things they can't do because they don't have the power to do so.Only faux powers.They invent
@RandPaul as soon as the debate is over you need to announce you are quitting. You insulted all Americans by snubbing the 1st debate tonight
@garybob52 @RandPaul Insulted? If you’re not in the big debates you have no chance.
@LucasDerraugh @RandPaul big debate or small debate, I want to see him debate and he is not there. That is an insult. He won't get my vote
@garybob52 @RandPaul If you care about his issues, you’ll get more out of the periscope interview. It’s a show to try for later debates.
@LucasDerraugh @RandPaul keep viewing your periscope.  I care not
@garybob52 @RandPaul That’s fine. It’s a free country, sort of. Calling it an insult though is kind of silly.
@bigblueonyou Yep, get to hear more from him in this then anywhere else. Better the 5 min to make talking points would have been.
@RandPaul yes, I have a question. How are you so old?
@RandPaul #RandRally
