The first rule of dealing with @realDonaldTrump is that you NEVER EVER concede ANYTHING on his promise that he'll do his part later.
Considered, eg, his guarantee that he would never finance his Taj Mahal project with junk bonds. NJ said OK & got screwed.

Or how about his empty promises to Gary Indiana?
Or his broken promises to release his taxes & put his businesses into blind trusts if he got elected? Meaningless promises.
I voted for you because I figured you would be straight with the people why does government have separate Healthcare simple question

RT @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Please call McConnell & Ryan asap & demand that they stop the replace con/charade & Vote on #FullRepeal now.

'Attacking Trump attacks we the people'? You're basically describing a dictatorship. We ALL have rights; please refer to The Constitution.

I'll take Bachelor #1 ...
1/2 Dumb question sir...Why do you have "congrss ppl & senators working on this bill? You say you use "the best & brightest ppl" BUT....
That's why we're in this mess cuz u had ppl who know nothing about insurance writing a health care bill. Call me a moron but I think u...
Hell Alvena I don't get it either & I live here!!! How do they do it in Canada?
That sounds simple but are ur taxes high? I don't know anything about Canada except it's freezing cold! Lol
This tweet sounds a lot like "Let them eat cake." That didn't turn out too well for Marie.
Very true! We must REPEAL this disaster ASAP. It takes 1 year to phase out. Enough time to force Dems to agree on a better solution.
REPEAL THE OBAMACRAP.
Shut up old man.  Where is YOUR plan you promised? 
You're past 30 days, how's that destroy ISIS plan working out?

You are a goddamn talking ape. It's like you're actively TRYING to ruin the country
How come no one is addressing the real issue with HC? $800 for a bag of salt water & Dr's paying high tuition. We are paying into a scam.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING MR. Precedent? I mean Predecent. I mean Pissydent. Oh nevermind. Just get impeached already & make America great again.
That's actually the dumbest thing I've ever heard
7years with @GOP  up their asses that coulda bettered the #ACA and all you can say is REPEAL cuz you hate the greatest @BarackObama #Resist
Impeach now, Replace later
We need to repeal and replace you.
@4Pmr This is Not a Contest! 
Obamacare was a Failure! But it's more Difficult to unwind it than it was to sign it into law.
If they can't replace before they repeal, how can they replace after they repeal??? Older white Republicans must be stupid to go along.
Instead lets replace you! Lets make America Great Again!
RT @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul Please call McConnell & Ryan asap & demand that they stop the replace con/charade & Vote on a #FullRepeal now.
YES - repeal Obamacare then replace with what is appropriate role of gov't to do...
Idiotic.
#StandWithRand @RandPaul #FullRePeal We want Rand Paul Bill!#FreeMarketHealthcare https://www.paul.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ObamacareReplacementActSections.pdf …
Great call.
Even if Obamacare is repealed, your replacement will not pass. You would repeal Obamacare and leave millions uninsured? COLD, JUST COLD!!!!
Wrong. You have no idea what u r talking about and u can't just toss out ideas as solutions w/out knowing details and impacts behind them.

Is MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN about people suffering without healthcare under your watch? I don't think so! You lied to us! #FRAUDNEWSTRUMP
Health care soooo complicated, who knew????????
Repeal now
Yes
RT @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz Please call McConnell & Ryan asap & demand that they stop the replace con/charade & Vote on a #FullRepeal now.
#TheRock2020
U r talking to a brick wall mr Pres McConnell wants to save health law and work with Schumer-NO!
The GOP better get it together or this will be their last Public Office job, 2018 is around the corner. Support Trump or out you go! #MAGA
@POTUS  Must REPEAL - keep the promise!!!  Do NOT let McConnell cave.   @Betsy_McCaughey @VP @SenTedCruz @RandPaul
Full Repeal!!!   Replace with Free Market!!!  Open state borders!!!  #
Get it right no matter how long it takes. #MAGA
honestly Pres Trump .they can't get anything done. tell that  to the piece of work in charge  @SpeakerRyan better hope @pnehlen beats him.
Everybody eats so put a tax on food to pay for healthcare
Let's repeal and replace your Administration.
Ya There Time is Coming to A Close
Yes! Get rid of mandate that makes me pay for nothing except keeping the IRS off my back.
YES!!!!!!!!!
Dont do anything , Let it implode, It is Dem's Baby, What than can they say Oh I know ,"" Trump's fault ""
@Jerzygma the problem is mcconnel and Ryan made a deal with the dems to hault trumps agenda , establishment must go !!!
It's an honest question Donald Trump we paying for the shit you'll see me on the podium somebody will  have to explain
We the people pay for their health care they get the best of the best what's the difference between them and us
You act bad with the news networks fake news come on boy why does government have separate Healthcare than We the People grow some waiting
. Ok.  So, you're insane.  Not to mention just plain stupid.
Very stupid idea.  A bi-partisan bill would truly represent the entire US.
@RandPaul 
1 Sz DOESN'T Fit All
Govt HC 4 ALL?
Govt Grocery stores 4 ALL?
Govt Housing 4 ALL?
STOP Entitlement Syndrome
Repeal opens up free market system. Competition drives down prices.
What about your campaign promise, to do both simultaneously? Yet another broken promise, to we "the people"! #FakePresident
Yes, before O'Care healthcare was affordable! The problem was never insurers it's Pharma & Hospitals charging to much! O'Care made it worse!
Actually, it's YOU who the Republican Senators "should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!"#Trumplethinskin

@ElArroyoATX
@tedcruz @RandPaul YES! It is what you all ran on and what we voted for! @senrobportman, what are you doing?? Get it done!! REPEAL FIRST
I like repeal and never replace better, unleash the free market. It has a proven track record of success compared to governments.
Let Obamacare implode & watch all the babies that feel free healthcare is their right w/o paying a dime. Watch when they realize Obama=loser
Repeal on the basis that obamacare is unconstitutional, then kick it back to the states to decide. No Ryancare!
DONALD TRUMP YOU ARE A VERY VERY MENTALLY SICK MAN AND YOU NEED IMMEDIATE PSYCHIATRIC HELP VERY SERIOUSLY FOR THE SAKE OF AMERICAN CITIZENS
You get dumber by the tweet. Slow down there trooper. Let's work on replacing you firstly.
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Yes.....Repeal....don't Replace! Get the government out of health insurance! #Repeal
So just take away 28m people's health insurance and leave them with nothing? How many of those people do you think would be dead in a month?
#repealandgofuckyourself
YOU should be immediately repealed and replaced at a later date ... after another national election. #25thAmendmentNow
Repeal Obamacare and make the dems and GOP make a plan in join effort. It's a win for you. Go Trump!
Here's an Idea!

Impeach NOW, Replace LATER!!
YES!!!
Stop shoulding all over everything.
That would leave some people without any coverage, idiotic
It's time to REPEAL and REPLACE the entire Trump Administration.
I'm With You Mr. President! #MAGA
Yup, contrary to what you PROMISED Americans.  Healthcare is tricky, huh? At least Obama insured more people, u want to kill them instead
Would like to hear Big Insurance CEO'S testify on reasons they are pulling out of Obama Care in many markets.
Trump's leading a "Death March" to disrupt the Healthcare marketplace and scare American Citizens in need of assured care.  Is he a Commie?
And temporarily leave millions of Americans with nothing for a while? Good call idiot!
We should immediately repeal & replace the POTUS at a later date with one that doesn't use social media as a vindictive tool.
Trump supporters know new AHC bill troubles is not his fault blame belongs to House Senate republicans for 7yrs they lied they had no plan
Or just #RepealObamacare ! Why do we need government to replace?
@TerryLambert201 The Senators need to work not continue prolonged vacations at our expense.  200+ days off is bs! Stop it!
Proving that all you care about is undoing Obama's accomplishments, not the health and safety of Americans. #Nicetry
Try Liberty Health Share. They are a Cristian, non profit organization that saved me thousands per year.
GOPe will not repeal-they like the massive Socialist controls ACA gave to Government. Don't want to give up that power/control over citizens
Mr President it should be completely repealed and replaced. This is what we want and need for our country!
Maybe you should be impeached and replaced.
Keep shielding the murderers and greedy healthcare,criminalizing victims and denieing health care to so called attics now.who did this
Meanwhile, there is NO healthcare access to tens of millions millions during the interim? Do you know what "interim" means?
If you're talking about your person in this tweet...
or THEY should make music together, like we Indians did it in this Disney movie called #jaggajasoos . It's a fam thingy but teaches SO MUCH.
How is this better?!
We should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE the dipshit occupying the office of @POTUS!

#ImpeachTrumpNOW #VoteThemOut #TheResistance
Cancel the Recess!
Why can't they repeal it with an effective date later on...like Jan 1st?
It's astounding, the people who are eager for many Americans to not having healthcare. "Let them eat cake"... worked out so well LAST time.
Anus
So like you want to leave Americans hanging with NO insurance. Real presidential of you.
Sure you do, because you all can't govern, just keep lying Donnie two scoops.
They should impeach you, you fool.
You are playing the capitulation game with people's health. PoS
https://goo.gl/ixql4i  #CanadaDay (Vous comprenez vraiment ce truc vous? En deux mots, ça veut dire quoi?)
Don't replace. Privatize. Get USG out. Allow interstate trade to increase competition. Healthcare market will correct & become affordable.
Repeal and after it is all gone then replace
Mr. President. I voted for you. You know they will never actually repeal Obamacare right?
Batman is dead (Adam West RIP), the Joker has taken over the USA and the Enchanted Kingdom is run by lemmings! Can we have reality back ASAP
Yes, we agree!! REPEAL IT NOW, then call in the private sector they know what to do, the republican and Dems don't.
Get the gov out! 
Yes, great idea. Strip 32 million of their health care, the majority poor, seniors, those fighting addiction, and illness.

@Mona_Lina1
Doubt GOP Senators have enough votes to do that unless...
To do what ?
Unless they have a bipartisan replacement ready to go at same time
This allows GOP to vote for appeal but not replacement
CYA
I think it needs to be repealed.  GOP has majority why can't they just repeal it
Don't believe GOP has enough votes to just repeal
Many GOP Senators (& Governors) in states w/lot of residents dependent on it
LOSE MILLIONS of Women who VOTED FOR YOU! STOP LETTING CNN,MSNBC People continue to "BAIT" U into responding! U display poor character!STOP!
If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE...
Cucci, you really follow this guy? You know he’s nuts, right?
#Repeal #DontReplace
#Repeal&ReplaceCongress
ANY OTHER PRES.U WILL B A JOKE IN HISTORY BOOKS.
SHUT UP http://IDIOT.YOU  HAVE CAUSED MORE GRIEF IN THE SHORT TIME U HAVE BEEN PRES THAN
Check out @KenCuccinelli's Tweet:
Liar, liar, Donald's pants on fire... http://wpo.st/hiqP1 
Total failure they and you ran on this assumption. Who had the plan. Faked America out GOP.
For Christ Sake man, quit putting out tweets about how bad everyone else is! Quit being a 10 year old and do ur damn job!
Don't understand this one.  It's so refreshing that Trump challenges losers in his own party, i.e. McConnell, who have promised repeal 7 yrs
Google Trump interview with Tim Russert in 1999 about the dangers of N. Korea.  Fact is, the nut Kim should have been dealt with long ago.
Ditch Mitch !
Where is your promise for better & cheaper insurance for all within 100 days - EASY!! Another EMPTY campaign promise/alternative fact??!!!

Just repeal it & later form a safety net 4 those who truly need help. Let all else fend 4 their own. Eliminate Nanny State!
No they should start packing, and send out resumes.
I agree
You change you mind like the wind.
Or accept that it will work with some minor adjustments!
So how immediately are we talking? Cuz it's been like more than a day...
Yes REPEAL. Healthcare insurance belongs in the private sector. Open state lines let them compete! Capitalism works
Horrible excuses for human beings, both of you. The only things that matter are giving people healthcare and the climate catastrophe.
Scumbags. Liars. You're just taking away health insurance from people, not giving anything in its place. How do you sleep at night?
Replace #MikeLee and #JerryMoran NOW!!!
