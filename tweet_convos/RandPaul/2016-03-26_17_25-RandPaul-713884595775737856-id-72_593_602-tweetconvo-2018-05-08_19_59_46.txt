@RandPaul @chicagotribune And they are worried about me having a semiautomatic rifle that "looks mean"?!
@Cinci_Sapper @RandPaul @chicagotribune Give guns to animals that been killing each other for 1,000 years and we're surprised they continue?

@RandPaul @justinamash 70 years of costly interventionism in distant lands has achieved a massive national debt. #USDebt #LimitedGovernment
@RandPaul Unsuspend
@RandPaul @LeeAnnMcAdoo What kind of insanity is this?
@RandPaul @UArentCrazy @chicagotribune All aid for bankers united, making profit on every drop of hate they can create. Divide & Conquer
@RandPaul @chicagotribune so....it's a good time to be in manufacturing and selling of arms? Show me the money.
@RandPaul @Tazmanian5 More of #Obama #ForeignPolicy #FAILURE! #ImpeachObama #OiP #tweetcongress #Congress
@RandPaul @justinamash 
..and both of these groups are Obama's "moderate" US-sponsored revolutionaries [mercenaries], right?
@RandPaul Who is making money at the end?
@neoplanta @RandPaul 
The mega-Military-Industrial-Complex [that Dwight Eisenhower warned against], its lobbyists, & bought politicians  :-/
@RandPaul What a great foreign policy we have, thanks to Hilary, Obama, and our corrupt and broken political system
@RandPaul @alllibertynews LOL
@RandPaul @chicagotribune Nopresident could say rhis
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Will they name that one 'fast and fucked up?'
@RandPaul sad stuff
@RandPaul aaaaannnnd that would be why we need to stay out of their business.
@RandPaul @chicagotribune let them fight but lets not fund it.
@RandPaul I completely agree. We back the rebels we often find ourselves fighting against. We fund groups like Al-Nusra which are Anti-USA.
@RandPaul @jtwray67 And this is the cluster McCain/Graham/Neocons want to keep us involved in? This is a foriegn civil war. Not our business
@RandPaul 
Since 2002, US military policy has been perpetual war for perpetual peace.

@jeffdavisshow @RandPaul 
Laughable: Candidate-cults argue what 'so-n-so' MIGHT do in 'foreign policy,'
forgetting history of FP disasters.
@RandPaul you lost. Go away.
@RandPaul @nicholasvirzi those weapons are not gonna sell themselves
@RandPaul @LeeAnnMcAdoo pretty great news.
@RandPaul @justinamash schadenfreude, schadenfreude, every morning you greet me
@RandPaul  I wonder when we'll have a real, full-on battle between the US military and the now rogue CIA
@RandPaul this @TheOnion article right?
@RandPaul @chicagotribune The equivalent of cockfighting for the elites.
.@RandPaul @LeeAnnMcAdoo My thoughts on the matter?
@RandPaul @chicagotribune Would that be the Presidents Bush Jr. & Sr. wars that have cost so dearly in blood & treasure? For what? Oil?
@RandPaul  What happened to our Country?
@RandPaul @chicagotribune It's a classic case of competing rivalries.  Typical of government stupidity.
@RandPaul I suppose our current strategy is "if you throw enough guns over there, maybe the problem will fix itself"? What a mess.
@RandPaul we should get the hell out of there that is why everyone should vote for Berne
@RandPaul such a disgrace!! I wish you were in the White House
@RandPaul you are speaking the #veritas here. Now do something about it. @VeritasRadioNet
@RandPaul The end is us stop trying to supporting a side we agree with at this and the other at that time. Get out.
@RandPaul Us & Us? (Apologies to Pink Floyd.)
@RandPaul You're almost as good as @SenSanders
@randpaul WOW. SENDING ALL THESE MILLIONS MIDDLE EAST AWFUL.  AND ISIS HAS USA MILITARY EQUIPMENT
@RandPaul The only solution is to allow both groups of rebels to immigrate to the US as refugees. They are natural conservatives.
@RandPaul   war knows no end, like dreams of peace it last as long as mankind.
@BrettBagur @RandPaul How else are you going to test who provides the greatest intelligence services?
@RandPaul and people wonder where our tax dollars are going....
@RandPaul @chicagotribune we really are fighting from behind. How much more will we give to futile interest. 18trill. In debt
@RandPaul Glad we have a coherent and coordinated foreign policy at work.
@RandPaul @BaruchSFR @chicagotribune  This is beyond embarrassing its outright wrong illegal n not who we are OMG! #StandWithRand
@RandPaul NUTS!
@RandPaul @chicagotribune CIA needs to go. We have enough security and intelligence agencies let's stop wasting our money and cut back gov
@RandPaul Backing both sides makes no sense, except for the guys supplying the arms!
@RandPaul this is absurd
@RandPaul only person in the race who would end this crap is Trump
@levant3000 @RandPaul @chicagotribune the Pentagon backed rebels aren't Arabs
@levant3000 @RandPaul @chicagotribune 20% states in the article but they essentially don't call any shots for the SDF
@RandPaul @chicagotribune I  rand Paul
@RandPaul Are you referring to the War on Drugs?
