Q: Clinton how are you going to bring coal jobs back to Kentucky? 
A: Put them out of business. - Clinton

that's not how this works...
"Let's not assume trade is the only challenge in the economy." No let's not. You & all your big government regulations are YUGE challenges
"When I was Sec of state we actually INCREASED exports..." yes unfortunately, it was arms to Jihadists #debatenight
Hillary wants us to go to her website to check her facts. THAT'S WHAT I AM HERE FOR HILLARY. I give her website "Pants on Fire" #debatenight
.@realDonaldTrump - "The Fed is not doing its job" I agree. We need to Audit the Fed! http://time.com/4170969/sen-rand-paul-audit-the-fed/ … #debatenight
Rules & laws are apparently for other people, not Clinton. It should preclude her from being president. http://time.com/4393859/fbi-hillary-clinton-email-fbi/ … #debatenight
Trump just admitted to not paying income tax. They're both criminals.
Legal deductions are not criminal. She pays NO TAXES on her foundation slush fund created while on PEOPLE'S PAYROLL
he does not pay income tax. We are all required to pay income tax.
Did you get a refund? If you did? You paid NO tax. 47% of the people in this country pay ZERO tax.
do you realize tax returns are not a 100% refund? It's a small amount of what you actually paid.
In some cases with tax credits its money you didn't even pay in. So my original assertion stands.
incorrect
Now you are stupid. Foreign Tax credits, credit for state taxes paid, earned income credit these are all regundable. No tax.
I'm a little disappointed here. I thought you'd be backing @GovGaryJohnson, not this buffoon on the debate stage.
JOHNSON IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL.  ID RATHER HAVE RAND PAUL THAN. JOHNSON. VOTE FOR TRUMP.
@alllibertynews @TIME is @RandPaul setting the table for a 2020 run?  If he was this vocal in 2015 we would have a POTUS that makes sense.
So why hasn't your buddy Mitch McConnell done something to prosecute her?
cause he'd end up murdered like the 5+ other people
well there's that
@ErvaMinnie @TIME Got that wrong, didn't you.
@trump_first @TIME so true
Joint Donal!Make America Great !
@RIGHTZONE @TIME Rules and laws are never for criminals, they leverage crimes (and lies) into even bigger crimes.
All of the feudal elites & their enablers #PerkProstitutes benefit from special treatment we peasants are denied.
She has "elite immunity."

@Akemm2Annette Thank you Rand for supporting the GOP and Trump-Pence! Hillary Clinton cannot be in the WH.
can you believe their nominee is the spouse of the 2nd President to be impeached in the USA? Who nominates an accomplice for Pres?
@ThankYouBernie @TIME well, then, DO SOMETHING! You guys need to earn your pay.
@TIME
@TIME hypocrite! Trump received loans from Russian Oligarchs that compromise the office of the presidency. That eliminates Trump!
really and Hillary
so who's taking credit for that very informative meme? lol!
@dawterofliberty
Hillary believes she is #abovethelaw
@Gumball55668882 She may be above FEDERAL Law; but no one is above God's law. TRUE Justice NEVER Fails.
@Gumball55668882 @TIME so right you are!!! Why does our country not do something about her
Wish you were on stage prosecuting the case against Clinton you would have ate her for lunch
She is NOT above the law. She needs to be prosecuted. Pretty sad when pres candidate has the FBI on their back.
@jjauthor @TIME The debate questions avoid all of these key issues. It was shameful.
.@RandPaul @ReignsFreedom Thus acknowledging that the "Clintons"' are the current puppets "running" USA for #MuslimTotalitarianDictatorship.
@beccwashere @TIME Well it's hard not to be above the law when you have the United States' various agencies in your pocket.

@karennola719  There has to be a country's right to demand her arrest-get together brave countrymen servants of the people
@KNP2BP @TIME Did the FBI give Hillary , Bill, and Huma immunity too???
@MarieMa49685063 @TIME Senator If there was one person w/balls HRC would be wearing orange vs. getting classified briefings! SMFH!
That is one point I'm waiting to hear in next debate lack exists in all major depts.
@alllibertynews @TIME Says no one ever!!Jajajaja....Yeah TRUMP The TAX EVADER!!Jajajajaja...OMG!!!U should copy Romney!U R A PITY
.@RandPaul @TIME 

Yes it should, but this is #HillarysAmerica and #ObamasAmerica
every time she used the word law or anything to do with the law.Yeah she buys her way out of the law people come up missing.. 
No business is too big to fail/Clinton's not too big to jail.
@TIME Please do something!
@tweet2u2 So why haven't you done something about it Mr Lawmaker? We're waiting for answers!
@tweet2u2 HRC isn't afraid to debate,because she easily creates lies to cover her ass without batting an eyelash
Sen you don't understand, she a CLINTON!!!
Ditto for Trump. #WhereIsGary
You must be joking?! What about @realDonaldTrump? He continually violated many laws. He is a tax evader or he would release them!
apparently several people are above the law besides Trump & Clinton.... let's be real.. #KarenRebels
@TIME  Most Crooked criminal I've ever saw total espionage beyond belief.. #debatenight
@TIME #TaxationIsTheft
@TIME They don't seem to apply to Trump either
Hill is the most qualified and best to work across the isle. Let's elect a moderate and demand congress act moderately.
Trump can file bankruptcy and "take advantage of the laws", but citizens can't plead the 5th Amendment  #debatenight
Apparently not for Trump! He is a shyster and a crooked businessman!
@realDonaldTrump doesn't believe rules and laws apply to him,  contacts are just papers for him to throw out.
@TIME so you think Trump is better because.....
@TIME Trump lies like a dog!  So we should believe his lies???
I totally agree!!!  She is a criminal!
@TIME You're still around? I thought you went back to the land of Oz.
nope, he is back and trying to help us take our country back!
@TIME so true!
we should audit congress.
him too then
@TIME doc! Coal is not a good source of energy! Cmon
@TIME Will you please run in 2020?
