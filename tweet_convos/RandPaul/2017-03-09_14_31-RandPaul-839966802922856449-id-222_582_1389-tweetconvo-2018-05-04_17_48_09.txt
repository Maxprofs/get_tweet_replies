i like that however healthcare costs must not be able to be discharged in bankruptcy or no one will buy it.
In favor of free market solutions, not government controlled health care. We need public controlled health care
Don't look now but you're being rolled by Ryan and Trump
House plan not supported by AARP.  Premiums will increase, drug costs not addressed.  Not what was promised.
I don't see Trump signing garbage. Thanks for your work!
Publicly blasting the new health care bill in public makes no sense. Keep it in house. Makes our party look bad
they eased you out Randy .... Rude!  Hang tough Senator, don't cave like they say you will.
Mr Senator, please only support a FULL repeal, not the Obamacare-Lite plan that's being pushed right now.
Hang tuff Trump i am praying 4 you and our country repeal that shit start fresh
Republicans will get blamed for the whole mess if they just "tweet it"
yes we do!
Stop calling it Obamacare Lite! I have read it  it's far better and you insult others who are earnestly working. You are not the boss!
What is your plan to avoid a filibuster? Obamacare repeal and then the budget will have to be done through reconciliation.
please save us from the morons in dc. Chaffetz thinks its a choice between healthcare and iphone, more like food
Why does it need to be so complicated ? 
Flat rate % for Healthcare and Taxes based on income
No more loopholes
@OJnaitis
hey genius, be the one to take credit for destroying obamacare. do it. don't just whine...do it
#ObamacareLite #NephJC 
meet @othinkagain, a data-entry clerk 10 hours a day, then he also sees his patients
Rand is our guy
 I know!
Govt get the hell out of Healthcare!
And as a conservative, yes I HATE this bill!
@realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls 
For the love of God & country @RandPaul flush this #ObamacareLite turd down the toilet!
great - where are you going to find 8 #Dem Senators to vote with you on full repeal?
TIME TO CLEAN OUT THE REST OF THE SWAMP MIDTERMS!
Keep Fighting Rand!! We need a new Speaker! @SpeakerRyan RHETORIC IS GETTING OLD! 8 Years to FIX THIS!
An "Health Insurance Card" Doesn't Mean you have usable HEALTH INSURANCE! FREE MARKETS!
RINOCARE "Repeal in Name Only" SAME GARBAGE! My Deductibles are RIDICULOUS! USELESS HEALTHCARE Card ONLY.
The RINOS want RINOCARE! We want FREE MARKETS NOW!!
you can't repeal #aca without having a better replacement. That's like going on field with no qb.
Your Fox commts nothing to be proud of. Republicans need to work with Pres., if not you get voted out next time, if people aren't covered.
Pls work together to make a simultaneous replacement. We voted to repeal & replace, if not they'll feel betrayed. Lives are in your hands.
I'm a conservative.  And, no, I don't hate the AHCA.  I wish you'd support it.
There are 3 phases to the AHCA.  Please get behind this bill and support it.  Thank you.
There's NO health care system in world that guarantees health care under total free market.  Learn facts, Rando.
Check out Switzerland
you are dead wrong on this plan. PASS it or it'll never pass. THEN fix it! Stop dividing!
I downloaded the bill. Very disappointed. This is NOT a repeal & replace! Not what I voted for.
~Absolutely, Free market is the only way to go! 
#MAGA 
#FakeNews 
#ExtremeVetting 
#Obamagate
Continue the fight.  Do not compromise, WE all support a true free market solution to healthcare.  Thank You!
Work together, compromise. Please don't stall the process bc of ego. #TiredofboughtPoliticians
Here is a thought.....
My response to you sir, quit whining, submit your bill, & work hard to get the 8 needed Dems to support it!!!!!
please stop being difficult. What you want is not realistic
"The only long-term solution to America’s care crisis is  single-payer national health care program” B. Sanders
Can you pls get Ryan to get it done! We are sick of him.
Give "we the people" the exact same health care coverage Congress gets. It will show a sincere change change.
How can you do away with health care for people? There must be a way to provide it.
#FIGHT #Republicans! No Illegals on #FullRepeal! No tax! Health INS NOT Healthcare!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIFIR_Zj5YY …
Rand I u but u totally mischaracterize the bill so it makes me think U HAVE NOT READ IT.
while not crazy about bill, if Demos are against it, I am for it!
TERRIFIC INTERVIEW! Would that all politicians take seriously proposals set in front of them,how it effects all.
@tekstar77 @FoxNews @edhenry I live in Bowling Green, Rand's town. Let him help. He's a very good surgeon Knows about the business
Your "free market" solutions are those bought with lobby money. Will cost GOP dearly.
yes you will, i ave great respect for you plus you have a sense of humor.  Wish you were from Al
@socalmike_SD @FoxNews @edhenry Senator Paul it is time to park your ego and solve your issues away from Television. #DoingHarm
how did you get the repeal bill through without 60 votes last December?
I respectfully think you're wrong on rejecting the American Healthcare Act! I hope you will reconsider!
Let Congress put out their healthcare plans and what they pay so we can compare our plan to theirs.
#Senate can & should change RULES to pass #RepealAndReplace Total bill. All or nothing!
@NetworksManager @FoxNews @edhenry Your health care bill is what we need!
The problem is Rand Paul's way will never get past filibuster. (R)s will own spiral.
Dems will take back Senate & House & pass single payer. Will Trump sign it into law?
Get the federal government out of the health insurance business.
how much f'n time do you need to bring the party together on one item? The biggest item of most of your pol jobs
Senator Rand, who is exempt from new AHC Plan? If AHC Plan is good, include Congress in Plan!  Drop own plan!
@SpeakerRyan  S-Corp biz owners are taxed on health premiums twice (part of salary & "profits" on K1).  Fix that!
fight on Senator. Don't bend to @POTUS intimidation tactics for #trumpcare support. Serve the people, not @POTUS
My small business has a competitive benefits plan.  We won't offer our employees a co-op. Thanks.
i agree. republicans have lied to us again
Stand firm Senator Paul. No Obamacare JR healthcare plan. We are with you.
Senator Rand, please take over healthcare issue. Ryan @SpeakerRyan is a fraud. @realDonaldTrump help us!
What a joke, 8 years and Paul Ryan comes up with this garbage. If POTUS likes this crap, we have elected conman
@POTUS  Can you go and talk with Pres Trump?  # art of the deal! Does it have to go thru reconciliation first?
You are going to lose your seat, buddy.
Rand is the best politician in our government. Its Paul Ryan that will lose his seat
tort reform.
If you battle Trump, you lose Kentucky. If your freedom Caucasus kills the presidency, you'll all need new jobs.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan completely REPEAL Obamacare & implement the @AtlasMD healthcare concept, be smart & patient!
I support Rand Paul!
they said associations are a part of it.  I believe phase 2/3  It is not always your way.  Quit whining. Unite
- @SpeakerRyan said there are free market solutions in the bill. You two need to get into a room & work together.  @edhenry
I agree! We need these guys to help each other so the bill helps us!
hey Rand, kind of tired of politicians that cannot compromise.
Takes two sides for compromise.
Thank you for introducing a New Bill,  Trump, save him from all those progressives that love entitlements 
some Conservatives are like liberals. You would rather debate for 2 years rather than get things done.
Separate Gov and employers from Health Ins.  Employer give insurance money direct to employees.  Let emp pick HI
Keep fighting Rand.  Government is not the solution it is the problem.  H Ins. was Union & gov way to hide salay
Obamacare gives us opportunity to really fix Health Payment in the USA.  Use HSA!!  Let individual decide on ins
@NetworksManager @FoxNews @edhenry Please take the lead on healthcare sir! #RepealAndReplace
@NetworksManager @FoxNews @edhenry - What is your plan?
shut up and support trump
YEP KEEP IT SIMPLE!
what about a payroll / welfare tax on everyone without adequate insurance?
the holocaust never happened
@realDonaldTrump  Yes, we hate it. Do not FORCE us to buy insurance and pay penalties TO INSURANCE COMPANIES!
free market works only when level playing field and EVERYONE has ALL the info.. that doesn't work for capitalist
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @SenTedCruz @seanhannity  Repeal, yes! Replace, no! Buy over state lines!
Cant just repeal it wont go back to the way it was repeal and REPLACE was promised not repeal what is your plan rand
Yes just repeal! Biggest problem w/ Obamacare is govt run. Insurance is business that should be run in free market.
correct name is Trumpcare Get it right! Obama has nothing to do with this bill.
keep up the fight Sen Paul!!!
U are not telling the truth, 68% of the Americans like the ACA, 38% want changes 2 the ACA,68% R getting screwed
What companies are you suggesting are lining up to do this?
keep fighting.  You are giving me hope in the republican party
Give us the exact same health coverage that Congress gets.
Never give in Sen. Paul. Real conservatives have your back on this one.
I hear that Senate would have to get rid of the Bird rule to get all the right stuff in one bill.True?  Then do.
Thanks 4 standing your ground 
Tell @POTUS don't trust @SpeakerRyan he lies & is only in it 4 himself, he sucks & should be FIRED
@SpecialKMB1969 @FoxNews @edhenry Where's YOUR plan Rand? Don't be part of the problem! 7 yrs later I can't afford my plan!!
1. Access to more carriers 2. HSAs 3. Address underlying care costs 4. Tort reform 5. Fewer regs 6. No freebies
We the people support you in your stand against #RINORyanCare. @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan
stop the grandstanding...ur just like your Dad, MD, conservative idealogue, never a team player.
Government should not get involved in health insurance for working Americans let us choose if we want it...
i support you! Please keep fighting for the American people!
So tired of Paul Ryan & the minions. He is lying to Trump.
I voted Trump, but please save us from this Obamacare Lite garbage! Get government out of healthcare altogether!
Free Market doesn't work without full price transparency and does nothing to help the working poor.
..another thing WTH with Trump going into Syria without permission of a sovereign state? Who advised this? WW3..
Conservatives like Big Insurance money and want to leave the people out to fend for ourselves. #GOPunAHCA
If everyone is covered then it cost too much and everyone gets bad healthcare. Just repeal.
please vote against Obamacare light. It's not conservative and will be disastrous for the country. Clean repeal!
No to Obama care light where penalty tax goes instead of IRS goes2 corporations of insurance companies?your plan
Stop thinking quantity and think quality.
I'll be watching. Donor focused bill.
Change the rules and stop Schumer from blocking vote. #MajorityRules #MAGA #AmericaFirst #TermLimitsNow
Thank you for standing up for all Americans
on the free market people die because insurance companies care about profits and shareholders
Is it true that the current proposal includes funding in the Medicaid expansion for illegals & anchor babies?
Ryan from viscously attacking Trump until he was shocked by his election, now thinks he should be the engineer on the Trump train?
Don't let us down Rand!  #fullrepeal or nothing. "three phases" is SWAMP SPEAK
ANOTHER THING THAT NEEDS TO END
Dept of Education in control of STUDENT LOANS

Passed in Ocare
We'll be watching Senator Paul. American People value your opinion. What does @SenTedCruz @TomCottonAR say @FoxNews? 
or maybe give us affordable healthcare for the citizens of the richest country in the world...
@SpecialKMB1969 @FoxNews @edhenry .... we would want a complete reversal, but will take what we can get. Help @GOP unify @RandPaul
Which bill gives the pt the ability to negotiate their copay directly with health care provider?Real free market
Picking one's insurance plan is not free market!  Who determines standard of care, the insurance co., the gov't?
Or do the  physician and patient decide what care is appropriate? Let's have real free market..deregulate SOC...
@SpecialKMB1969 @FoxNews @edhenry .let's get phase 1 passed. Quit acting like babies. Trump is listening & will do what is needed
Fuck that where's @TuckerCarlson
Good luck with that. How about slowing down the process?
Disgusted with Obama 2.0. We didn't sent them to Congress to produce phony replacement!
I agree let's get serious
THANK YOU..
NO to FREE healthcare for Illegals!
boo, we want Tucker Carlson!! Good looking out for going on, but you should have waited for Tuck, the uncuckable
Really? Calling it Obamacare Lite isn't gonna change the stink of Ryan & GOP has all over it. #ACA
#Tucker PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ask abt BYRD RULE in Senate & how to pass FULL REPEAL!
the economy needs to be better first
Is Paul Ryan lying when he says there will be three phases to his reform & we haven't seen the 2nd and 3rd yet?
Maybe if you got Muslin's with 4 wives and 17 kids and illegals of Medicaid, 40+ would not have to at more
The alternatives would not pass the house and lose too much support, creating an impasse on all agenda
So then let Obama care implode and risk it never being replaced while you have the majority in both houses
Sen Paul, please be easy w/ the "hate". Work together,  not grandstand and it can be constructive and be Great!
How would you manage to get your plan (repeal it all) through Congress this year without inevitable filibusters?
Obamacare Lite, SHALL.....NOT....PAAAAAASSSSS!!!
@SpeakerRyan @GOP @TheDemocrats AHCA is a disaster. ACA can and should be fixed. REPEAL of ACA gives the wealthy a big tax break
free universal for all  healthcare paid for by taxing the uber rich and cutting the Military.
if you had your way there would be no Medicaid, Medicare, or employers plans. So No thank you.
you had 6 years to find a replacement, and couldn't.

As much as it pains me to say .... Single payer?
You're not a conservative, Rand. Try supporting something that has a chance of passing like an adult would.
give me free market or give me death! Oh wait..
your like every polititain, you don't listen 1st its 3 steps 2nd you guys get 1 chance3rd get it done before aug
what's your plan to handle the subsidized on Obamacare now? Tax credits need to apply to insurance premiums
Get rid of the individual mandate and ACA dies on the vine. Roll back IRS regs too
Dems are already taking the fall. This is their mess
It was set up to fail from the beginning. Single payer was the real goal
We conservatives stand by you, Rand!  The RINOs and Trump are wrong on this one.
He did. Ryan is a RINO puppet.
Paul has followed Trump's advice, he knows when to walk away from a bad deal! No to #RyanCare!
#StandWithRand
If the 'free market' is so good at solutions, then why did we need legislation in the first place?
who says WE needed legislation? I didn't, for sure!
Healthcare legislation started appearing in the 19th century. Didn't know you were around then.
Doesn't Rand Paul ever do news shows?
Stick to your guns, Rand! No #RyanCare.
When the pics show before the show. Expect a rousing what for before he kneels before @SpeakerRyan #KY
But free market solutions might involve the philanthropically motivated concerns of doctors. Horrors!
The PPACA is a market based solution. We buy a regulated product in a marketplace. "Free market" is meaningless buzz word
Free market is the only way to bring cost down.
Any talk about medical malpractice reform?

@FoxNews @edhenry
yes they said they are addressing that. They want to follow what Texas did
I'm pretty sure @SpeakerRyan just called you a liar on @SeanHanntiy  show. Might want to look into that.
lol
