@AJDelgado13 @RandPaul From a failed candidate got an axe to grind?
Ya its thick stuff 
Why didn't you do everything you could to stop Hilary Clinton from being Secretary of State?
minor details
Oh well thank you.
// maybe Hillary is available?
@trackerem @RandPaul BOLTON will Never be SOS!!! Neither will Traitor Romney!!!
Bolton is a nut.
.@FoxNews @RandPaul Trump turns out 2 B changeable - not that there aren't any precedents or nobody predicted it :|
.@officialmcafee problem with @realDonaldTrump isn't his gut feeling, vigor nor boldness but that he's superficial, populistic, changeable[1
.@FoxNews @RandPaul ...I'm just astonished how damn quick his wiggling started, he's not even in office & only ~10 days since election O_O
.@FoxNews & I've got to thank @RandPaul for already pointing towards Trump's faults that quickly!
Just don't get this, Trump could use his knowledge to his advantage.
see how media jumps on anything which undermines DT. Great job on the election. Congratulations.
I trust that DT knows what he is doing and we have to trust his judgment
Trump doesn't know what he's doing. He has to literally be Obama's apprentice to learn the basics. Because he has no clue
And by what proof do you have of this, bc the MSM told you so..do u know him personally? have u talked to him personally
have you? What media do you consume? Brietbart? Or just forwarded racist chain emails?
@veganvecoh @RandPaul Rand Paul better put his negative attitude aside for the betterment of AMERICANS. Behave Rand Paul.
@veganvecoh @RandPaul 
Don't like Bolton, he works for the bushes
he is anti american
@AJDelgado13 @RandPaul 
I'd have to agree on Rand on this one.  Just doesn't go with the direction Trump wants.
Trump has no idea how to pick a cabinet, Pence is make Trumps decisions.
Bolton is a good person but I agree with Rand. He's pro-regime change = Not a good pick IMO. Rand should be the pick!!
how can you the Rep are the majority good luck
didn't you know they won the house and congress
@rosalokey @RandPaul The whole bunch of you were AGAINST Trump from the get go. Trump can APPOINT WHOMEVER. YOU NEED TO GO AWAY.
Shocked that Pres Elect that says whatever crowd in front of him wants to hear is untrustworthy
@AJDelgado13 @RandPaul So glad your not our president Rand.
Bolton is a chicken hawk who supports the Iranian Communist MEK terrorists.
You're kidding
the msm media wishes he elects him, but it wont happen,
@Jdavis1097 @RandPaul  rand is the man
probably because @realDonaldTrump changes his opinions  and policies as frequently as most people change their underwear!
But @SenBobCorker Is ok? WTF? He helped push the crappy Iran deal explain yourself Rand? Corker is garbage
#StandWithRand
Rand is a pussy for doing this in the public eye.  He should have quietly met with @realDonaldTrump & expressed this.
- No to Bolton.
maybe you should get on board already!
no Bolton!!! No Bolton! Yes to someone fresh contemporary pleasant smart diplomatic and peace-carrying
u dont know who he is picking so stop the drama!
@cjsienna55 exactly ,
Seriously, Why do you not want Bolton and who  would you like to see in that position
#notobolton

.@FoxNews @Singularitybook @RandPaul Just like George W Bush ran on a policy of smart non-interventionism and non-nation building.
@realDonaldTrump speak to Mr.Elect President.He is a businessman you a politician.#Worktogether #teamwork #GoRand
@KellyannePolls  Which team is Rand playing on today?
No Bolton, no recycled neocons.  What was the point of electing Trump if we get Jeb Bush's cabinet?
#RandPaul2020
I wish you would attempt to influence Trump's decision in private rather than in public. Infighting leads to divisiveness
though personally I prefer Dana Rohrabacher for SOS
kerry is okay but not bolton? Y the double standard
could it be that Trump is a compulsive liar, and almost everything he said during the election was false? Hmm
I don't see how nutbars like you and your dad get elected. GO AWAY
you lost....go away
I'd be totally devastated if he appoints bolton
did they pick allteadu
this from someone whose main qualification for being a Senator appears to be that his father was one.
It would be helpful in making a point to include some examples of the criticism.
who cares he is not really a republican
when will you realize you are not the president. You lost. Suck it up. Stop fighting Trump
... completely disagree with Rands comment. Bolton would be perfect for Trump.
SUCK An egg
if you"fight4the Constitution"u have the duty of calling on @POTUS to explain his dirty business with #CorruptoConfeso.
cause ur weak and don't like war
trump owes republicans,  liberals., democratic,  nothing, again u lost
Sometimes, people who disagree with you have value. #JohnBolton #notayesman
DJT is the new President and I'm sure he knows what he is doing. #draintheswamp #MAGA
We'll see.
what planet are you from.  Bolton is in-line with @realDonaldTrump
That statement by Rand was crazy.
You have no idea who's he's gonna pick stop assuming and shut up til he says be 4 you all go running your mouths
Sounds like a threat to John Bolton Scary

Because Rand he has set of cajones something you lack! Bolton would b a good SOS-You JEALOUS? GET OVER YOURSELF!
Don't worry.  Bolton won't be the pick.
Bet you he will not give it to John Bolton!
Not true!
uh oh. Honeymoons over. Is Trump pulling a con on us AND them?
@alllibertynews @FoxNews @RandPaul No, not so fast.
Sometimes Rand Paul is a big boob.  Like in this case.
GET OVER YOURSELF RAND. WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING IS LISTENING TO WHAT YOUR COMMANDER & CHIEF DIRECTS YOU TO DO.
Are you looking at the same John Bolton that I'm looking at? Be specific.
Rand please you lost
if Rand doesn't like him, I don't like him
Giuliani.
Teeheehee
thank you for holding Trump accountable
Paul needs to look in mirror, He was one of the losers in the Primary. Vote how he wants in the Senate but expect conseq.
I don't think it your call rand
Come on Rand you are familiar with hypocrisy
well, because it is a NEW President setting the agenda. Bolton is NOT a free agent. Get past yourself. Its Trumps agenda.
Sen.Paul, @AmbJohnBolton is an experienced Diplomat.He'll do what's best for the United States & Pres. @realDonaldTrump.
why are you listening to the media they don't know who is in line for any position i dont know why u fall for the media
we do need to win and end the wars we are in but not engaging in new ones
why don't u just change parties?
Rudy for Secretary of State! He would be great!
you aren't Pres elect.
-Paul is a wind bag he should be happy Trump closer to his ideal than any other candidate EVER !!
Bolton is very, very smart.....   unlike Rand Paul !
Ron- u represent a nat's asx- go away- u lost !
just vote "yes" when asked to. Try not to think to much or to often. @AmbJohnBolton
Bolton is not opposed to anything @realDonaldTrump ran on. He'd make a great SoS.
stand with rand on this one
Because @realDonaldTrump said whatever he needed to get elected. He is an empty vessel with racial undertones. #Trump
easy. It's called hypocrisy and $$
what? Now we are surprised @realDonaldTrump is a compulsive liar? 
opinions are not useful ! Just support our President elect Donald J Trump ! Its his call.
This quote by Rand Paul is patently false. Bolton would be a terrific choice of SoS, and Paul will eventually cave like with Hagel.
rand is right we don't want a certain philosophy but libertarians also really suck on the foreign policy front 
Hmmm
Speculation 
Let's wait until we hear from
President Elect Trump
Final word comes from him
All other to make news
I thought it was the Dems who could not tolerate diversity of opinion. Bolton will not let Trump down. Paul will.
a real isolationist calls out @realDonaldTrump a fake isolationist.  I disagree w/RP, but he has integrity.
On Wiki his biography looks impressive
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Bolton â€¦
maybe he should come ask you and daddy your opinions. I guess he doesn't prefer loser opinions. Still early to see who.
- Fox when are you going to find Two and fire Megyn Kelly. All her guest are anti-Trump. Not what fox watchers want.
Typical Rand Paul.  Never missing a chance to display his irrelevance.
; Honorable Speaker Paul, do not forget that The Donald is not a GOP life member. He is a pragmatist, not an ideologue.
agreed rand
he is a Republican a plan is required. Not a Democrat. Where we can go ahead and pass it. We can read it later. Smh
neo-con Bolton would be the worst of the bunch.
we're looking for someone who can follow orders and be strong they must understand what the president agenda is
@realDonaldTrump I may of looked at Newt Gingrich  1st ? As Secretary of State
He hasn't selected anyone yet.  Stop looking for attention  You lost.
??????????????????????????????????????????
Go away Rand Paul. You have no clue. You're a Liberal in disguise
RAND PAUL WOULD ARGUE WITH THE POPE
Senator Paul I took your side. This nonsense about John Bolton. Who the hell do you think you are! Step aside SIR!
THIS IS SUCH A lie
Just because he ran on an issue....  He has no game plan or vision, other than promote his brand and feed his ego.
He could do it because he has no core ideologies, he just says whatever the crowd want to hear.
so right, Bolton is one of the worse necon. It's a McCain but more dangereous as Bolton has a brain.
can't help but love Ambassador Bolton I would really miss him on all the shows if he became the Secretary of Defense
bye bye status quo, probably should have supported President Trump.
Because @realDonaldTrump has no real ideology! Fight the good fight, Rand!
GO HOME AND HAVE SHOT OF BRANDY AND RELAX AND STOP YOUR NUISANCE!! NO ONE HAS ANY TIME TO LISTEN TO YOUR BULLSHIT!!!
Good. Neocon Bolton would mean more pointless wars.
#manlet
That's not true. He's very part of the Deplorables non-PC campaign. Rand needs a safe place and a safety pin lol
It's a Trump admin NOT a @RandPaul admin. Drain the swamp!!
It's not a Trump Senate, Genius.
You sound bitter, Jackass.
You sound like a toolbag hypocrite, so there's that.
Senator Paul... please stop Bolton, Flynn et al... All Americans Do. Not. Want. War.
is just short of being a capitalist conservative, maybe that is why he got crushed in the Republican primary.
I agree
Bolton is a neocon on steroids...
Rand is an idiot. Sore loser. Another one of those that got a trophy for showing up. No effort required
President Trump does not appear to know what he is doing...

i agree. Shocked bolton's name has even came up
Ah!!! Shut up!!!
@SebGorka 4 sec of state

he needs to go away he thinks hes all knowing
