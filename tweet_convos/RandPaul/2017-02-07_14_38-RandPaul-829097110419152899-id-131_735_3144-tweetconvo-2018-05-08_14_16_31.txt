Don't vote for animal testing. They always use Beagles. Please...
speaking of dogs...
so true. Forgive me. I have three of my own
you are meeting dogs & talk show hosts while #Americans fight sexist and racist Senators
you are right dogs are important, it helps to use them while remaining silent while Sexism continues in the senate.
That's awesome, Senator Paul. We have a President that needs a new home too. Any help appreciated.  #resist

GOD= DOG
@LeahR77 @beaglefreedom @TuckerCarlson We have two rescue mixes. Lab/Pit and Beagle/Boston Terrier. Can you tell which is which?

That dog now has more rights to an equal education than my son with Down syndrome. Thx for your DeVos vote, Randy!
That poor dog looks anxious to escape the clutches of you two
My little man was in bad shape when he rescued me, but life's good now.
@j0vFeet1 @beaglefreedom @TuckerCarlson 
I love a beagle!
I love the pic of the pooch. You guys are greAT
Dog is best one there.
Should have nominated the dog instead of Sessions, he would be more fair
Dogs are pure love! @TuckerCarlson
I love that you are advocating for animals!! 
And then u lost some more respect ..
Who is that propagandist you're sitting next to?
Thank you for your reminder that "all lives matter"! @Rand Paul, we appreciate this! #Srsvote
Now you can meet Frank Zappa-The Cat....
  Don't Breed Or Buy While Homeless Pets Die Adopt From A Shelter Or Rescue Group  
@CorrellConnor
but u voted for DeVos so wtf cares? Thought u were smarter than that
arrrooooo.  love my beagle!
@RandPaulFlorida @beaglefreedom @TuckerCarlson Really look forward to any way you can get Sessions on record re: common law/corpus
Are they house broken, do they have all their shots and do they follow any commands or do tricks? :)
Cool story, bro. Perhaps you should have spent more time reading up on DeVos + listening to your constituents.
Lovely pic I never thought Tucker would be interviewing Rand awesome job Tucker Rand is the best#SWR
you had a chance to rescue our kids education, but I guess money was more important. Hope devos can afford to buy you an election

@Shawn_Farash
So set the example and adopt one. We'll wait to see the proof.
Mason says hi fellow beagle!
I love it!  My profile pic is of our rescued beagle.
drain the swamp from neocons! bring peace to the world
Doesn't our President need a dog ??
make usda animal testing info available on the website again
@Elise_Jordan @beaglefreedom @TuckerCarlson Rescue dogs make the BEST FRIENDS!
Seriously? You just sold out our public education system so you tweet about dogs?
Take him home Tucker!
I love beagles, I got "Max" from a Shelter.  He rescued me from PTSD!
he is always by my side...
hello again Cousin George! Your getting so famous!
Naming a dog after a person is highly disrespectful, hence why popular names used to be King or Rex
because after our independence we mocked our former king. Also in the 1900's "no dogs allowed" meant
"no n*****rs" which at the time meant "no Irish"
and Tucker Carlson is a lap dog for conservatives.
Thank you for acknowledging that these dogs need help. We can't ignore them.
I like both of these guys. The dog too.
We have got to get this man in the White House 2020 and the Beagle!!!
#StandWithRand
I hope this means you're willing to work to prevent animal testing and cruelty.
thank you for all you do the smart people of America are with you we love you
cute.
thank you for the tweet and picture gentlemen. We really appreciate it. -@ryanmoore
my 3 beagles have passed. My hubby said Beagle? Never again.
Don't let crazy Carlson use leeches on that pooch like they did with the original GW!
Please make @USDA put animal welfare records back up! BFP can't rescue these dogs without it!!!
Super Pupper!!
Aww, beagly boos are so cute!!
@EveEdens94 @beaglefreedom @TuckerCarlson I like Rand Paul even more now.
Good for some huntin
Cool story.
Bend Trump's ear about that Federal Reserve now.
Perfect job for you--working w/rescue programs
This should be a bipartisan issue!!
Help restore animal welfare records deleted from the @USDA website! That would help all animals!
sweet! Give each lefty 1 quick! They need healing!!! Especially @chuckschumer@NancyPelosi @SenWarren
Why did you vote yes on Betsy Devos
@CarmelJudeobsc1 @RandPaul @TuckerCarlson @beaglefreedom cowards
; Then maybe you should advocate for the return of transparency at @USDA so more beagles can be saved
Nice dog, rescues are best. If @realDonaldTrump adds #FirstDog I vote for rescue English Bulldog @RandPaul @TuckerCarlson @beaglefreedom
The John Kerry picture ruined it for me.
ALWAYS RESCUE/ADOPT A DOG AS THEY NEVER STOP GIVING UNCONDITIONAL LOVE-I HAD MORE THAN 1==========
PLEASE FIND A WAY TO ARREST GEORGE SOROS IMMEDIATELY
ABSOLUTELY
Awwww; I agree Adopt; Adopt; Adopt all da little muzzle-tovs - luv 'em all
then why allow @USDA to compromise animal welfare by deleting records?
Dogs rule!!
Please help restore access to animal welfare statistics from @USDA. Only way to track beagle abuse.
What a great dog!
Good looking hound.
Hey, why don't you stop pushing Trump's agenda and fight? I love dogs, too but c'mon.
Thanks senator, I'm glad you're taking a stand against animal testing.

Please make the USDA/APHIS stop their anti-transparency bullshit.
awesome
Shame for not standing up to Trump nominee DeVos who was no doubt unqualified.  Country before party Senator!
nice looking dog. Tucker give it to @TheJuanWilliams, he needs a friend who listens.
Did you vote DeVos?
Yes he did!!!
great photo. Three winners.
u misspelled. It's Whiners
Thank you, Senator!!!
Democrats in KY are working hard & will hold you accountable.  #dontrepealACA
.@RandPaul @beaglefreedom @TuckerCarlson Look! That dog shit out a Carlson.
I guess that makes you a nasty MAN!
you just voted yourself out of office
Beagles are the best!
