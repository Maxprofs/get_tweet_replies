Wow Rand another tv show. Do your JOB and come back to your home state and do a town hall.
I agree. Single payer. Done
Did you ever take one single dollar of Pell Grant or Stafford loans? Yes, your a hypocrite. No, your privileged and this convo is over
So you were able to pay for 8 years of med school by waiting tables? Amazing
Stand strong! No surrender. Full repeal. #FullRepeal   #UnitedForFreedom! Nothing less is acceptable. You do NOT compromise on principle.
Principle over people?  That doesn't sound insane at all. Y r u against regulating healthcare like we do utilities, fire, police?
Full repeal
No bailouts! #REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! #UnitedforFreedom!
Your "No" vote is a yes vote for continuing Obamacare. How is that principled? You haven't helped with anything! Pass it & deal with it!
Thank U for standing up us  @RandPaul. We need more who will stand up for us. Govt is killing our HC. . Don't replace! Repeal. 
#fullrepeal
Please stand for full repeal Senator. Your legacy depends on it. Our future rests on it.
I believe Rand Paul just likes to hear himself talk!!!
Please stand strong against the BCRA, which does not repeal Obamacare. We do not want Single Payer/Socialist Healthcare!#FullRepeal.
Why don't you join the Republicans in congress? Your either part of the solution or part of the problem. You are part of the problem.
BCRA doesn't offer the ONLY real solution - FREE MARKET! #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Rand Paul gave excellent explanation, how Malfeasant Healthcare Insurance coupled with Government misappropriate our TAX DOLLARS to hurt us.
Reminds me of the little Dutch boy who saved Holland!
One of these talking head shows actually talks about the issue and what needs to be fixed?  Why can't have moderate, conservative and lib?
Stand your ground! We The People will not accept anything less than what was promised! #fullrepeal #unitedforfreedom
Rand, not a perfect bill, but a starting point! The American people deserve that at least! Support!
Your standing on principal McCain hiding behind illness McConnel gets a free pass for icompetancey America gets none of its agenda Traitors!
Thank you for fighting & trying to do what best for us & our country.Its very much appreciated!!God bless you! #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Most Americans oppose the Senate healthcare bill. We will oppose you if you vote for it.
AHIP opposes the Senate healthcare bill. It will undermine insurance markets & increase premiums.
Blue Cross opposes the Senate healthcare bill. The bill will lead to long term losses in coverage for millions.
The AMA opposes the Senate healthcare bill. They say the bill will not improve affordability, coverage or quality. https://www.ama-assn.org/ama-announces-opposition-senate-health-system-reform …
Cruz/Lee amendment was the ONLY tolerable aspect of BCRA. Without it, just Ocare II. #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Americans let DC know, loud and clear: #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom #NoSocializedHealthcare
Main reason we gave GOP all 3 branches of Govt over the last 7 yrs is due to the promise of #Fullrepeal. Not a replacement or amendment!!!
Thank you for continuing to fight for a #Fullrepeal. Stay strong, we need you! #UFF
like that you work for conservative principles but there must be compromise, repeal and replace or Dems get everything. Nothing doesn't work
#FullRepeal waspromised to the people keep your promises #United for freedom
Get 2 work & get that #FullRepeal! USA isn't meant 4 Marxism! Address price gouging & abuse of the system. Common sense! #UnitedForFreedom!
No replace @RandPaul, full repeal NOW!
#FullRepealaspromised! #UnitedforFreedom
Stand fast Rand for WE THE PEOPLE! #FreeMarketOnly, #REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! #UnitedforFreedom! NO trumpcare!
We, the People were promised #FullRepeal! #KeepYourPromise #CongressDoYourJob Get the gov't. out of healthcare!#UnitedForFreedom
ThanQ Sen.Paul for restoring my confidence in your ability to maintain the Constitutional line and keeping your promise of #FullRepeal. #UFF
#FullRepeal stop playing with our lives..




Stand on that promise Senator.  Those who will blame or shame you have already surrendered their honor!  America needs a #FullRepeal of ACA!
Hey Rand! Why not pass a law forcing Americans to read and understand their health insurance contracts before purchase? HA HA HA HA HA!
That should be that person's own responsibility, not put on the tax payers.
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! #UnitedforFreedom!
Money on paying for surgeries for sex changes in the military? You want to decrease Medicaid to to make sure you have money for something
Please explain to me how it's so hard for y'all to get together on healthcare, yet have no problem passing bill now that requires my tax
Please stand for liberty and against socialism. Fight for #FullRepeal!
Quit playing games. Unite. And complete our ahenda
#FullRepeal. Vote NO. McConnell and the RINOs are going to pull another fast one and mandate socialism. Please. Vote NO.#UnitedForFreedom.
THANK YOU, Rand for being a stalwart for Americans and their liberty!
I'm an independent watching your vote.
Thanks rand Paul for your NO@vote.
Which is better, to pass BCRA Healthcare Reform now and win a Super Majority in 2018, or wait for a FULL REPEAL and risk losing Congress?
small # of Americans are Libertarians! You will be replaced for stopping tax reform Infrastructure bill, security illegal alien legislation
PASS BCRA!! We need to move on with POTUS agenda!
Can amend BCRA as we go...PLEASE!!!
isn't the senate bill like Obamacare?
Senator please pass the bill. We have to have a free market.  We can do reform after. Just please pass the bill
Which is better, to pass BCRA Healthcare Reform now and win a Super Majority in 2018, or wait for a FULL REPEAL and risk losing Congress?
Pass this bill then use your voice to tweak it. Stand with us please. Tired of this! The citizens want all of you working for us.
Each in our family committed to contribute Max allowable $$ to whomever runs against @RandPaul next election if he's a health No vote!
Bad choice, he is the only one making sense. No deal, repeal only.
Rand losses big time for us if he's a No
Go create your own party and see what gets done. It's always all or nothing for you and then the other extreme @SenatorCollins .
VOTE REPEAL ONLY
In a perfect world.Too late for that. Once you give entitlements very hard to take them away.As long as it's free market it's a good start 
Its amazing after 7 years to think about it, this mish mash is what the Republicans come up with.
IT'S THE HEALTH INSURANCE LOBBY..  POLITICIANS CAN'T STAY IN OFFICE WITHOUT DOING THE BIDDING OF THEIR MASTERS
This bill is a total disaster. The republicans look like a disaster. I think Mitch McConnell should step down as leader.
Real smart there Rand. Vote against something that would end the Individual and Employer Mandates and penalties then kill Obamacare anyway?
Pass it!!!!!!!
Enough is enough. Let's get it done. Can perfect later.
PASS THE DAMN BILL
Ever notice none of the Politicians ever say how much they have to pay for Insurance? What's your copay Senator?
right no copay free dining vacation every other month doesn't sound like serving the people
@POTUS @GOP You've had seven years to get something ready to replace Obamacare, promises!  Blame Nothingburgers like McConnell and Ryan!!!!
@GOP Republicans exempt their own insurance from Obamacare rollback - now that's Pure Arrogance!!!!!  Who do they think they are.  @POTUS
You bet it will
Take a step towards ending obamacare Sen Paul. We need this now or GOP losing in 2018 both house and senate. dems stick together, GOP should
Vote to protect Americans with disabilities, vote against cuts to Medicaid!
Medicaid was created to help the poor and ppl w/disabilities. Not able bodied working age ppl.
Snooze fest
Talk with left wing do nothing media par for the course.

Special k report

Big mistake: Using Obamacare as a template for the ACHA. Sad to see Americans turning their healthcare over to the government.  A no win!
It's too late. We got screwed already. Some morons think government can make better healthcare decisions about their heath then they can
Get a deal done on health care!
You need to figure this out!
You have no idea how this is hurting regular people...
They all got free healthcare on our dime.
For quite some time now, it is a perk of being in government, why do you think they fight so hard to stay in power? #TermLimits
Agree 100%
What are political bent of the three panelists? Two seem to be from liberal bent newspapers.
Please do what u r paid a lot to do and vote yes just remember the American people are watching you
20+M Americans. What ever happened to taking care of your neighbors?? American VALUE??? Don't kick them to the curb!! NO ONE LEFT BEHIND!!
I stand with Rand on healthcare.
Choose to pass the bill or choose to let Democrats take control in 2018.
Sorry, just not buying party before country. This bill is bad, debates are needed. Why the rush? Repeal now, no replacement needed.
Rand Paul is a nut.  just like his dad...
witty! need to work on your spelling though bubba...
Why is government in the health insurance industry AT ALL ???
Please explain @RandPaul s alternative HC bill and advise all the majority support it has, since all he can do is bash the bill on table.
I respect Rand Paul...but...will not watch Face the Nation
GETTING TIRED OF REPUBLICANS BEING DIVIDED.  WE NEED A NEW PARTY.
I'm just not into paying the medical bills of the Leftists and their grotesque degeneracies.
One of the dumbest tweets I've ever seen. Take care
Your ignorance is palpable.
yes and you are clearly a genius. You going to pay for healthcare for anyone? How bout people you agree with instead of "lefties"?
Grotesque Leftists have a tendency to bring ill health on themselves by the habits they practice more than anyone else.  A perverted bunch!
Ah yes as I suspected. You're a genius. Good night
Just factual reality. Leftists on the whole are a very debauched group.  Smokers, drunks, sexual deviancy, druggies, highwire acts,speeders.

Wouldn't watch FTN for $
This could not be more true. The Senate GOP bill is a disaster, worse than ObamaCare, and WE WILL OWN IT. We'll 100% lose the House in 2018.
#StandWithRand

Repeal #Obamacare. THEN start the #healthcare replacement debate here:  https://files.acrobat.com/a/preview/11996a07-db43-405a-a8bf-97b352b67c3e … Complicated = Corrupt.
If you lose your job, have a preexisting condition but can't afford continued COBRA coverage, what healthcare will you get without the ACA?
you will be covered and  have tax benefits if you are in lower income bracket
Rand Paul needs to join his father
You forgot to get McCain, and Graham. Get all the loser GOP'rs onboard on the same show. Can't be the Clinton Bias Service otherwise.
