I need RAND for president! #RandPaul2020
~ I LIKED @RandPaul's ideas to replace Obamacare!!
good job !
No thanks
I agree w/ everything U said on Tucker about Health Care. Please do everything u can to get ur plan passed
RAND THE GENIUNE GENIUS RAND!!! #STANDWITHRAND...
Maybe you should watch this for tips beforehand...
I hope you don't rush to repeal obamacare. When you rush you can make big mistakes.
plan for 6 years. Introduce your own!! Good luck  with that . Repeal and replace!!
Senator y absol correct to replace http://Ob.car   at the same time of repeal. Y. Lazy rep.       Didn't intr....
What's sad is RP will stand against the bad budget and trumpers will not get it. Budget HAS TO BALANCE!!
Watch out. If he doesn't like what you say, he'll talk over you and won't let you finish your sentence.
I caught it & noticed UR a lone voice 4repeal/replace but the RIGHT voice.
It was a great show as always. #Tucker
If you'd paid attention, you'd know this was Trump's plan all along. Partner with Tom Price. #GetterDone
come on Rand WHY did you have to go on his show!!! Also where is that guys now tie?
a great interview by tuck the cuck slayer Carlson with one of our greatest minds!
Tucker, you look so cute in grown up clothing.
Repealing ACA subsidies for Congress would incentivize Democrats to support needed reform of horrific ACA.
Congress needs to start by repealing their ACA subsidies for people earning below poverty line.
awesome!!!!
dump&paul, birds of a feather
Great interview. Spoken with sound facts that make cents of Healthcare $$$ and Choice!
you guys are my favorite people! We need more people like you two! Modern day heroes to be given praise!
Great interview https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xG6uPThzk40 …
great show tonight Tucker without haters were not profitable
@TCuccio @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Rand. Paul is a Coward! Grow some Cajones, Senator! Stop worrying about your election!
Usually don't watch Fox News but I love the sharp questioning of Tucker Carlson
Make sure you do away with any mandates when replacing Obamacare.
.@RandPaul Your great idea: replace ACA - except for Health Savings Accounts. People can't discipline themselves. It won't work. Disaster!
Love your show Tucker; looking forward to watching at 9 pm..starting Monday.
Can't wait to see your HC plan! I agree, repeal and replace the same day, as @realDonaldTrump called for! Good Luck!!!
As a health ins agent I support your comments tonight. Keep pre-existing & do all u discussed. Good luck
Finally!!!!.....someone with a proposed solution for failed ObamaCare.
I agree with Sen. Paul; must replace when you repeal or it will be a rope around the necks of Repubs.
Great segment! Made perfect sense on #RepealAndReplace ! Please get it out there. I love HSA's!!
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Just watched you on the show. Started following you. Hope PE Trump is listening to you.
good segment please introduce the bill next week!!
Not so much a fan of yours but what you stated on Tucker makes sense, so PLEASE help GOP with the ACA!
Was Tucker wearing socks with his penny loafers?  America wants to know.
Why is this being allowed??? #terrorist #Gitmo #FortLauderdale  @TuckerCarlson @LouDobbs @SenatorSessions
Obama starts mass transfer of fanatics who have threatened to bomb and behead Americans http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4085516/Twenty-two-Guantanamo-detainees-freed-days-Obama-plans-mass-transfer-fanatics-threatened-bomb-behead-Americans.html …
obamacare. Closing rural hospitals and look good at policy rules.
where's the silly little bow tie the little tyke liked to wear? tucker to orielly to hannity: Comedy Club
Maybe but rather be there instead of a circus
I was at your dad's convention in 08 when tucker bailed as emcee. He's an unprofessional clown.
Here is your clown!!
i actually agree with that childishly shitty meme
Senator's say they want the truth all BS if it make's Government look bad the truth is irrelevant Aug 2001
Oh Mr. Paul, I know you are a public figure, but you're better than Carlson.
IT'S HAPPENING!
Tucker Carson is hyper-partisan and not credible
tucker needs to get approval from the kremlin first
plse help to keep @realDonaldTrump in check. Too few Republicans are sticking to their principles.

Btw, @TuckerCarlson is a hack
I would rather watch the hanging of a close personal friend.
I'm not a fan of Tucker as well. I'd rather see @brithume interview him instead.
