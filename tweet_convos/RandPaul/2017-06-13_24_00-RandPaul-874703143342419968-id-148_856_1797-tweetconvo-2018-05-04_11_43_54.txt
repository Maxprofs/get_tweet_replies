 he talks like he was living in S.A &knows what happened there ..dont sell ur precious weapon to S.A but dont tell lies.
Can you please send me proof that Rand Paul is lying?

So what do u think saudi planes ar doing to the yemeni people? >throwing 'Roses' on their heads that Mass Murder!! W\UP Saudi Govt=Zionist!!

deal is a deal , dont Forget he is called President Trump , not a thief Trump .
I freaking can't stand @RandPaul in general but on the #SaudiArmsDeal, I agree with him  percent!

Thank you Senator Paul.

#Yemen
Yes, selling weapons to the Saudi's is bad. Yes, we can't make SA be like us, a democracy who unlike SA won't help ppl w/ healthcare. #ACHA
uh isn't it the zionist agenda to destroy Yemen and Syria by proxy?
Not to mention exporting Wahhabism
Globalists Created Wahhabi Terrorism> http://www.google.com/search?client=ms-rim&hl=en&q=globalists%20created%20Wahhabi%20Terrorism&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&channel=browser …
Right now, Saudis are funding Wahabist preachers around the world
Agreed! And US too is funding Terrorists http://www.google.com/search?client=ms-rim&hl=en&channel=browser&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=isis+funded+by+american+government&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi89s-F47zUAhWJZ1AKHYnpCsAQ1QIIBg …
Yes, agreed.
Thankfully the vote failed. All Senators wanting to defeat #ISIS & #AlQaeda voted to let the arms sale go through, protecting the #USA.
The Saudis are supplying Isis and they treat their own ppl horribly!
What if we are tyrants?
These arms shouldn't go anymore to Saudi BCUS thousands of Yemeni kids, young & old have been killed by the U.S weapons sold to Saudi.

Go Rand Go!!!  It is TRUTH!!! STAND FIRM and please DON'T back down!
I'd like to know why you and @SenMikeLee voted to ease sanctions on Russia after they blatantly attacked our country via 216 elections?
Get behind our @POTUS for the good of our country.Enough opposition to your own party. Mandate on Nov 2016
And yet the Republican Party continues to support the removal of gun owner responsibility here in America!!  $??? Shame on YOU!!
PREACH IT BROTHER!!  .. Why no mention of @johnmccainpr @Johnmccain, @HillaryClinton and #DOJ #doj arming Daesh/FSA
Paul for President!
He is better than trump or killary
Please let me introduce Acan, he is a pro Putin anti Israel troll.  Now Block.
The CIA does a great job supplying guns to terrorist and drugs to America.
Wouldn't you say the same applies to domestic gun laws?
you don't want to arm other countries which I SUPPORT but then you want no gun control here..?????????????
Last month Rebles were pictured with CIA supplied rockets used in chemical attacks on civilians... as no Assad troops not in range of site
STOP cover LAIR trump TRANSPARENCY American people deserve truth over Russian&trump tides corruption conflict of interest
Thank you for making a stand we all need to start working together and do what's right in this country
Thank you for your integrity and bravery
I agree that Saudi Arabia is not to be admired.  However we *sold* rather than *gave* them weapons. The workers at @BoeingDefense need jobs.
Can you divert the weapons to the people of Venezuela? It's millions of people fighting against what the Left wants to do to the USA.
Sen. Rand Paul is a man of conscience. The vote to sell arms to Saudi Arabia was totally irresponsible on part of most Republicans.
Not the guns fault. It's the person. 2nd amendment rights. 99.9% of gun owners are not nuts. If going to blame something, look at liberal BS
But tomorrow back to "Iran sponsor terrorists" for yet another war for AIPAC-ZioCon lobby & more USAvaglandia support for JS Juhadi-stan?
Unfortunately their war behavior is very much like us. That is why WE are giving them arms We need to turn away from war!
YES ! You seem to not know,intentionally, that Israel also funds terrorists and has formed an unholy alliance with Saudi Arabia stop bowing
Powerful speech! Thank you Rand Paul for reminding the people who side Saudia Arabia is really on.
Did you stand and oppose Obama's secret deals with Iran?
Guns SAVED LIVES today!
May fall? How?
That's a real joke!! You are fooling your supporters, Senator! Shame on you!
AMEN! problem seems to be: profits supercede ethics/morality...
@JeffFlake @RepBradWenstrup @RepJoeBarton @RepChuck @ConawayTX11 @RepMoBrooks @RepJeffDuncan  Luckily no one killed this time. So glad ur ok
@JeffFlake @RepBradWenstrup @RepJoeBarton @RepChuck @ConawayTX11 @RepMoBrooks @RepJeffDuncan  It's time to END this Hate. Must Stand Up!
@JeffFlake @RepBradWenstrup @RepJoeBarton @RepChuck @ConawayTX11 @RepMoBrooks @RepJeffDuncan  and Media for all the HATE & LIES; responsible
BREAKING!  Shooter was a @SenSanders Supporter & @realDonaldTrump Hater! The LEFT caused this with HATE, LIES.

Thank you, Senator!
"We can't make them be like us". Congratulations. You found the wrong way to be on the right side of an issue.

And he Rand
He Rand so far a-wayyyyyyyyy https://twitter.com/ALT_uscis/status/874972509875183616 …
Someone is thinking ahead......
Talking about Democrats, right?
You could be president except for your blind acceptance of the other terrorist state Israel. Remarks 50 yr anniv. USS Liberty?? crickets!
Saudi Arabia should be embargoed
Saudi arabia is ISIS and 15 of 19 WTC hijackers
By enemies, you mean the groups Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is trying to get us to not sell weapons to?
I hope that you can find enough support to stop any arms deal with saudi. While maintaining our skill set
Saudi Arabiaand sunni nationalism has been ethnic cleansing the middle east since the 600s. We are failures if we cannot out maneuver them
Paul you say "we cant make them be like us" Yet you continue to argue for immigration without assimilation enforcement Make up your mind
I am so proud of you.
You were my first choice for POTUS for 2016 . 
I wish you had gotten the nomination . 
You put reason before profit.
Continue your good work senator
Be like url! U mean Mass Murderers> America Slaughtered over 20 Million in 37 Victim Nations> http://www.google.com/search?client=ms-rim&hl=en&q=US%20Wars%20killed%204%20million%20Muslims%20and%2020%20million%20in%20Victim%20Nations&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&channel=browser …
I'm sickened that USA meddles in the Middle East creating more people who hate our country. Wish Ron Paul had become President! He knew.
I find it insulting that our govt gives OUR GUNS that we use to protect from EVIL PEOPLE to a country that gives guns to EVIL PEOPLE.
well done BUT ........
I made the mistake of voting for you!
You just like to hear yourself talk.
Bahahaha we can use their billions, that the Democrats have squandered! Have you ever run a business? I doubt it!
You should be the #POTUS ! Go Rand!
Only logically consistent to oppose Saudi deal if we oppose the Iran deal, good on you Sir for having more integrity than your colleagues.
THANK YOU for your backbone!! Oh how this arming of these folks has to stop.

We never learn from our past.
For once, I agree with you.
I love Trump but I agree. Install a kill switch if your gonna send weapons
courageous!
Outstanding speech! Thank you, Senator.
Too bad you couldn't tell Obama that on fast and Furious and the Iran deal.
Love you R P  Stand Strong

Hannibal
Thank you Rand
But you are victorious oppressed for the oppressor thank you Sir 
Also We the People of United States of America are wanting an end to this ridiculous and dangerous behavior going on in DC.#End the Treason
@RandPaul Senator Graham said: you are just anti Trump and that you are despicable.
Sir while you are there if you are still there please ask how much this witch hunt is costing taxpayers that is taking place with Russia.
#Syria #NEVERForgetSYRIA!!!
We can't make them be like us, but we don't have to encourage their behavior by giving them weapons that may fall into the hands of enemies. 
But you're cool with giving billions per year to Israel, so they can steal land and slaughter Palestinians, you hypocritical fraud
It's even worse.
God-damned Rand Paul. Can't ever get anything right. Stupid ass. http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/06/13/sen-rand-paul-if-support-israel-cant-support-more-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia.html …
#AwanBrothers
Again! Most of ISIS tanks, artillery and rifles are US bought. Fool me once......etc
The Force using the intelligence community to Attack American values is THE threat, not the nation that surrendering its wealth to America.!

I urge that we should not be selling weapons at all.. My elected officials need to govern, not be arms dealers.
Like fast an furious?
https://youtu.be/S_LNjpSDQsg  what about this
#StandWithRand
As always, @RandPaul makes a clear, rational statement, the Saudis are not to be trusted and they are not our friends or allies.
Please for the love of god run in 2020.
actually what ur sayin' is so what iran and iran supporter would say
Nonsense. Iran sponsors terrorism, of course, but nothing compared to SA. Next you'll say ISIS is Iranian
Sure wish u would support POTUS and his American agenda.
Not sure that's possible,also lacks the detail
u know that ISIS and IRAN did all the terrors in S.A . the government did not throw any weapon on any body.. Lier
Well said on the floor Senator. I agree.
Would you mind assisting your president in beating back the seditious internal rebellion please? Jesus Christ.
You don't sell arms to the people that brought us 9/11...#StandWithRand
Pat that you for bringing reason to this discussion.
Ted Cruz is a loser
because he voted against Rand's resolution.
Do deals with the Devil...you will get burned....ME will never be like "us"...USA....and there will never be Peace in the ME
Do not do a mistake. They are ur enemies themself. They are spreading the ideology of terrorism
Watch #Israel - #Saudi Tactical Nuclear Strike on #Yemen (Neutron Bomb)
Wouldn't a nuke give off an EMP that would have rendered the camera useless?
Violent Arabs killing violent Arabs ,win win sounds like to me !
I'm a progressive Berniecrat and I disagree with Rand Paul on many things. On this issue though, we agree.
