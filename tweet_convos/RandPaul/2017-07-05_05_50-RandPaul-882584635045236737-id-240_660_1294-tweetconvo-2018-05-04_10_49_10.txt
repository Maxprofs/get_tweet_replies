I don't know what to say. You so right,but, are you in different D.C. Than I remember. Please work together. Then, lets primary the bums.
So basically many Republicans are lying for the last 7 years repeal and replace what happened to that give me a break just as bad as the Dem
If passed you wont get your KICKBACK?
@RandPaul - are you making an honest effort to get a health care bill or making a career out of criticizing every proposal?
@freedomcaucus Full repeal.SOL states took Medicaid expansion http://bribe.GOP  cowards,tough http://decisions.Safety  net after retro
I disagree with Rand Paul 99% of the time (he's one of my senators), but at least he's not rank and file. He speaks his mind, which is rare.
He's not my Senator, but I do love how he speaks his mind. We need more men with courage like Rand Paul.
I never hear you ever getting with the other side and trying to fix it. Many of us have suffered because of Obamacare! The time is now!
Stand be behind our President!!!
No repeal Congress and you'll turn off voters with nowhere to run except to the Independents in 2018- probably a good thing.
REPEAL the bill and REPLACE 80% of Congress!
You should just run as a Democrat I'm sure  Schumer would love to have you on his side you have done more to stop ACA repeal than he has
Shame on u think of the USA not u getting reelected.
Sen Paul-saying you see Mitch McConnell all the time but you haven't spoken to him directly about Healthcare isn't leadership.  #BeProactive
get ur shit together and get this done #healthcare
REPEAL REPEAL REPEAL. - DO WHAT YOU RAN ON & PROMISED. @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan (traitor) @gop @senategop. @potus @vp #maga #tcot #ccot
The ridiculous positions that you are promoting about Healthcare are doing nothing but helping the Democrats for fill their agenda.
I say repeal and not replace! I do not believe the govt should be in charge of our HC!
Why not think about lowering/regulating the cost of health care and drugs first, then come up with a plan.....
Yeah but it defunds Planned Parenthood & is better than Obamacare. Please consider helping instead of letting thousands of innocent die.
And 700 billion lose their insurance. - M. Waters
To say ppl millions of ppl are going to die is nothing but a bunch of propaganda and lies! Not falling for this load of crap!
Don't leave us with failing Ocare. Do your job!
Follow Paul on Twitter, he's expert on healthcare not @SenateMajLdr Mcconnel who is beholden!@GovMikeHuckabee @ScottAdamsSays @frugalvoter
I am praying that you Republicans all vote with one voice.  Do something together to fix rotten Obama Care.
Vote for the new health care bill!
@DrRandPaul @RandPaul This bill is a good start. Get off of your ass and be a team player. You are screwing with our majority.
Great....stick to your guns.  Now instead of Obama Care lite, we are going to accept actual Obama Care w/fixes. Nobody needs u now, Rand.
Rand, that is probably true. But, half the Republicans are rhinos and the other are deep state. We need to just repeal first
Everyone is over-thinking this!
@RandPaul @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @POTUS @VP @SenSchumer @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr

WHAT'S IT GONNA BE PPL? WHAT'S THE COMPROMISE OR SOLUTION...I AM STILL WAITING IN PURGATORY WHILE U PPL GO ON HOLIDAY?! I AM DRIVING
The ornaments are people who need healthcare. #ACA needs fixing, not gutting. Remember, Do No Harm? Drs. know best. Why don't you? #BCRA



Looking more like "compromise and collapse" than it is "repeal or replace"… #AHCA
@RandPaul is the only one with a common sense solution. All the swamp creatures want their subsidies in tact. Lets get on with the draining
Please Senator Paul, fight for us on this health care bill!!! The one that is being proposed is nothing more then OBama care all over again!
The GOP will burn for their bullshit
Stick to your guns some ones got to fight for the American people
#StandWithRand 
Full Repeal is the ONLY deal
The GOP doesn't get it. Healthcare is for the people, not their donors 
.
Americans deserve SO MUCH BETTER #ThreePointEightTrillion
REPEAL!!!
This is going to be a big problem for the whole GOP and President Trump.

@realDonaldTrump Must be difficult & tiring for GOP to convince their base they are conservatives while never delivering what they promise.
and can he explain WHY he campaigned for and endorsed mcconnell for reelection?  cant have it both ways, sir.
Typical GOP 

All talk No action

Keep up the fight Rand
We voted for a clean repeal bill. Thank you Dr. Paul, please don't give up.
Some good points but #RandPaul should remember he represents very few people.  He is extreme and the majority is not.
Universal HC is a DISASTER 4 patient rights!
Govt goal will be cost containment, NOT YOUR WELL BEING. 
 #Repeal
@DrRandPaul @RandPaul our Healthcare System was the best in the world before Obamacare go back to what worked
I agree with you lets repeal then fix the heath care system lets get rid of this stupid law and move on to something better with less cost
I agree!! Free market!!
Most Repubs =bunch of wusses. Too many able bodied people ( most foreign) getting free healthcare sapping our tax $ & increasing premiums.
You should have supported the public option. After all we are one big association called the citizens of the USA.
Thank you for doing what you can to block Obamacare 2.0.  What should be signed is a bill voiding all provisions of Obamacare.
Why put the burden on individual Americans to form associations- why not move to a single payer system now & let everyone have access?
Tell um we need the gov out of health care period! #freemarket
This man is the only one with any dignity left in the legislature.
Just give us whatever healthcare you have Rand.
DC politicians-REPEAL was promised! replace! Get govt OUT of HC! @GOP @RandPaul @tedcruz @SenMikeLee @SenDeanHeller @realDonaldTrump
That's because u & the other heartless ppl who want to take HC away from everyone have LOST, HC is now a right, get used 2 it, fix ACA
Giving Federal Government control over Healthcare is the surest way to a communist nation. #FULLREPEAL and be DONE!
It's simple. This bill repeals the aca in its intierity. Period.  Vote on it. Done
Come on already get it done !!! This is a side show now!!
U can thank all the GOP liars who promised to repeal & now refuse to do it
Keep trying youll get it right!
Stay the course
Still confident that HC bill repeal and replace will pass .
Instead of FREE healthcare, discount it but still make folks pay a little towards this benefit.
The more that I hear you the more I like you!  Make sure Ocare is Repealed! Then If you have to replace it. #FreeMarketInsurance
Rand repeal
Keep fighting the good fight for the American people. Be strong. And thanks you for your amazing service to this great country. God bless
Repeal the darn bill already!
This all seems like you are discussing welfare reform and not healthcare improvement and cost reduction.

Keep up the fight Mr. Rand Paul!! Never heard repeal and "replace" during Trumps campaign nor Republican Congress. SMH. How weak!!!
Your comments please Rand..?..
Let's just repeal. Its unconstitutional for government running healthcare. Healthcare is not a right. Let's make it free market again
@RandPaul , Please stay the course...America is counting on you...!!!
Please keep up your reasonable expectations for us. We need you to stop the handouts for able ppl&open borders, pre-existing&catastrophic.
Because it's a recon bill. #FullRepeal
BBB vaccine B.B. can bvbb
GOP Socialist hate free market principals that made America great. They want US to be a 3rd world Econ, no freedom dependent on Gov #MAGA
May God spare us of all those greedy hypocritical politicians who swore an oath to defend our LIBERTY'S & FREEDOMS, but who do the opposite.
REPEAL AND NOTHING!!!!!!! insurance is a SCAM!!!! STOP MAKING WARREN BUFFETT RICHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Leave healthcare alone Rand Paul!
“The principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.”--Jefferson
The "age old" GOV 100% guarantee...Loss of INDIVIDUAL freedoms...Price increases up to 3,000%...& loss of quality.
"I predict future joy for Americans, if people can prevent GOV from wasting their labors under pretense of taking care of them".--Jefferson
GOV... Where employee's make all the rules, control all the $, call all the shots, & even extort their EMPLOYER'S from cradle to grave.
"A nation that tries to tax itself into prosperity, is like a man standing in a bucket who tries to lift himself by the handle".-- Churchill
Is Matt. 23 a timeless "warning" of the "true nature" of man when given authority...i.e. Scribes, Pharisee's, & Politicians?...Sad.
GOV...People elected by people to "serve" US. But alas! The inherent GREED of man cannot get him past repeating Egypt or Rome... Sad.
INSANITY... Doing the same thing over & over again & expecting different results.
So repeal now and take action to replace later

Miles de miyones y vivo en el barro lacras.
Get down to the real thing and lower premiums for all. Quit trying to buy votes and get a workable plan for all

Exactly.."Working as Expected"....Read between the lines...Obamacare was created to fail.
What do people have between repeal and replace?
That's right!  The American people want their healthcare.  The GOP hasn't figured out how to explain that their plan will work cuz it won't.
I'll be glad when you pass it so I can read it.
LOL
#StandWithRand
Can the president use executive order to give all citizens a waiver from Obamacare mandate?
Congress Leave your Pork Barrel Money Grab For Another Time and Do What's Right For America or Have You Forgotten How? R.Paul is Right!dts
The most important thing is to support the President! It may not be the best bill but it's moving in the right direction! Solidarity!
R.Paul is right Dissenters on Health Care Want to Blowup the Legislation With Pork Barrel Monies for Their Pet Programs Back Home!dts
This is my favorite quote which really does help all of us understand Trump's HC plan. Basically, we have a plan to make a plan. Awesome.
Trump is not a seasoned politician when he talks. He means we will think outside the box and come up with ways no one has done before
Tell the chief, he'll listen.
Do a separate repeal bill.  Force a vote on it.
Just in case anyone wants to read the bill https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628 …
Okay, Mr. After-the-Fact, RandPaul, I ask, again, where U been these past 15-years?
Probably doing cataract surgery. Might have good insight into the healthcare system.
we just want a tax Bill do healthcare later !
This is unconscionable.  These RINO clowns were elected with the promise to REPEAL, no exemptions, no delays.  You're FIRED!
Because you Republicans don't give a shit about the American people. Single Payer will solve your problems
This must be repealed! $1,400 a month premium w/ a $5,000 deductible is not affordable #Healthcare #RepealAndReplace
There are 2 versions of the healthcare out. What the left forgot to say is the Senate version is the one in the news right now. It sucks...
Under Trumpcare, the biggest cuts to Medicaid will happen when the baby boomers are needing it most to pay for nursing care homes.
Trumpcare is not a health plan it is a tax cut on the investment income of wealthy people and enables insurance Co. to rip us off.
Really  Read the Bill https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628 …
I'm pretty well versed on the ever changing bill.  That one is the House bill.  We are now in the Senate.
I’m aware of that 
Under Trumpcare pre existing conditions won't be covered which is a convenient loophole insurance companies use to refuse payments.
If you got cancer then diagnosed with a heart issue you wouldn't be covered under ObamaCare either. What's your point?
Yes you would, where are you getting your info?
Watch the documentary "Sicko" if you want to see what health insurance was like before the ACA/Obamacare.  It was nothing but a scam.
Insurance companies have profited greatly since Obamacare.  Michael Moore-style single payer will lead to more cases like Charlie Gard.
Why do all these guys have shitty makeup
The ACA allowed my son to quit his job and start his own business, now he pays for the platinum plan for nine people.

Could you cite your source? I don't understand what you object to.
Sure can the ACA wanted to fine small businesses. Read the IRS ruling  http://www.hh-law.com/new-law-permits-employers-to-reimburse-employees-for-individual-health-insurance-premiums/ …
My son pays for his employees platinum plan-- 100% medical, dental, and vision.   I don't think he could have done that without the ACA.
Before the ACA we had to stay with our crappy soul sucking jobs just for the health insurance.
Under Trumpcare if you miss 2 payments they will suspend your health insurance coverage for 6 months.
You do know there are 2 versions of the AHCA??? The Senate version & House version. Which do you think Trump is siding with???
Under Trumpcare, a premature infant could reach their lifetime limit before they took their first step.
What does a leftist care about that for? They prefer abortions anyway.
Nobody wants an abortion, just sometimes it's not the right time to have a baby.  Abortions have always been a reality in women's lives.
Hang tough, @RandPaul!!!  Billions spent to prop up ins.cos. and subsidies is NOT what we need...it drives costs up!
Under Trumpcare we will go back to the time when insurance companies could sell us sham policies that didn't cover anything and had limits.
That's exactly what ACA/ObamaCare did... So, that just means no change.
No, under the ACA insurance companies have to provide essential services and can't have annual or lifetime limits.
Sooo,  what exactly is YOUR healthcare plan Rand? As a constituent I've been asking for 6 months still unsure. Keep helping your Overlords
He released a plan back in January you can read through: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiZu6KQzPLUAhXJ4IMKHX7iBb0QFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paul.senate.gov%2Fimo%2Fmedia%2Fdoc%2FObamacareReplacementActSections.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFFjyt98I1tE0aKFYP4i9y8huhRxg&cad=rja …
Yes thanks I've read that but we have many, many questions.
I'm sure you do, but it's disingenuous to imply that Rand hasn't been upfront with what he'd like to see in healthcare
Not disingenuous at all, are you a constituent? A two page google docs is not a healthcare bill
Highly disingenuous. The PDF lays out the full plan for how he would replace. You don't need mechanisms to understand his intentions
Again not at all. I am a constituent. I feel my Senator is NOT representing my needs or the needs of my family. A 2page GDoc is not enough.
We must repeal. The ACA should never been made law. It must go.
Bunch of damn RINOs.
Try the, "No insurance for you" speech.
Come on GOP, get it together. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Socialized medicine bad for a free people. Surrender control of your HC & you lose personal Liberty. "Liberty once lost cannot be regained"
#RepealFirst  #REPEALthenREPLACE
#SaveObamaCare
Congress beware, we voted on Trump's promise to REPEAL Obamacare.
Stand our ground Senator Paul. We trust you to always do what is right.
Fake Fox news don't care about the poor and middle class.
Neither does MSLSD, Communist News Network, All Communist News, Communist Broadcast System. What's your point???
Hold their BIG SPENDING feet to the fire Rand. Just say NO to government run healthcare.
@SenateGOP (w/exception of @RandPaul /@tedcruz ) are MORE pathetic than #liberals. #Wussy Hypocrites ALL need to be voted OUT in 2018! smh
The people who voted for repeal will be very angry. If it's loaded with entitlements it will fail also. Congress, Be Careful!
You're going to have to compromise with repeal & replace. Replacement is going to be a lot better to negotiate with GOP now than Dems later
Repeal O'care.
I don't trust Rand Paul! All Senators need to look at this as helping poor & middle class! Also all of them will buy the same as us
Medicaid out of control. Why buy a new wheelchair every 2 yrs. contributing 2 the Opioid addiction. More taxpayers money going 2 lobbyists!
