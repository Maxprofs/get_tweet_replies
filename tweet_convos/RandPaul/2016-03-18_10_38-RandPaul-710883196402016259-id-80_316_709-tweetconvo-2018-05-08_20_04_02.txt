@RandPaul why not for Banghazi put her in Jail
@ISABELVERDECIA @RandPaul ....as soon as they execute Bush/Cheney for the 4000+ U.S. soldiers we lost bcos of their f-up.   Too soon?
@AlecStopalec @ISABELVERDECIA @RandPaul How about the more than that lost by Obobo in Afghanistan since he took over? *crickets*
@disturbedsauce @ISABELVERDECIA @RandPaul ....how about learning math instead of spewing nonsense? http://icasualties.org/oef/ 
@AlecStopalec @ISABELVERDECIA @RandPaul So where's the 4,000? And this chart proves my point more died after obobo took over.
@disturbedsauce @AlecStopalec @ISABELVERDECIA @RandPaul ...my point.  Total deaths 2001-present far below Bush's Iraq.
@RandPaul You NON PRO LIFE SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO EVERY PALESTINIAN CIVILIAN LIFE LOST FROM YOUR FUNDING NAZI ISRAELI GENOCIDE OF PALESTINIANS
@StageYaneu @alllibertynews @RandPaul , WOW!  How much koolaid have you had?
@RandPaul Apologize? U 1st Rand. What have u & @SenateMajLdr done 4 KY jobs? Remember that jobs bill u passed? Me neither @GOP=No jobs!
@iHarry @RandPaul Jobs are not created by politicians. They are created on the free market, which Hillary would like to destroy.
@Gunsight416 @RandPaul BULLSHIT! @GOP Politicians blamed Obama when millions were out of work thnx 2 #republican policies
@iHarry @RandPaul @GOP Not true. Democrats and republicans are both to blame. The 10 poorest cities in America are democratic.
@Gunsight416 @RandPaul @GOP 1st I said States. 2nd Both parties not 2 blame republicans fiscal policy of austerity trashed economy
@iHarry @alllibertynews @Gunsight416 @RandPaul @GOP We are 19 trillion in debt? Hello? Where is the austerity? 300 billion budget deficit?
@disturbedsauce @alllibertynews @Gunsight416 @RandPaul @GOP Deficit cut by 1/2 in 7yrs in spite of massive military spending tax cuts 4 rich
@iHarry @alllibertynews @Gunsight416 @RandPaul @GOP LOL And if you look at the graph the deficit was only cut after the GOP took over.
@RandPaul @mycn2/ Dr. Paul you are either ignorant, forgetful or very cruel to decieve your constituents. How long will u force Koch policy?
@RandPaul @mycn2/U  took Clintons quote out of context. She only said that as a prelude 2 pouring funding in2 KY 4 retraining 4 clean energy
@RandPaul @G6throughF5 Clinton, gonna kill your way of life and economy, but you can still vote for me! Piss off Hillary, Liar!
@RandPaul Ever heard of the free market? Cheap oil and gas along with solar and wind power are killing coal.
@RandPaul They should thank her for saving their lives.
@RandPaul When she is across from Donald Trump She will..
@RandPaul -OR- Kentucky could move into the 21st century and attempt to become a leader in new energy sources...
@RandPaul @mycn2 - what policies? She's not president.  Her role as SoS had nothing to do with coal.
@RandPaul @NRSC TRUMP; TRUMP; TRUMP
@RandPaul @mycn2  Thats what she does uses all Americans then leavesem to die or struggle before death cold hearted. #StandWithRand #SFR
@RandPaul Someone said coalminers should get off their fat asses, etc. etc. I think they probably work the hardest but need help.
@RandPaul oh never mind. They're the ones funding your failing campaigns while real Kentuckians lose their jobs.
@RandPaul or maybe you could call out the big wigs in the coal industry since thy haven't reinvested is the industry for the last 100 years
@RandPaul We don't want her apology, we want her in jail and not in the WH. We know she won't be prosecuted by DOJ, perhaps Trump's DOJ.
@RandPaul @RandPaul Or the coal industry could stop fucking up our planet and Kentucky could use cleaner energy sources....
@RandPaul amen and amen
@RandPaul @mycn2  Hillary's coal comments were a Freudian slip, and shows her true nature.
@RandPaul I agree Rand 100%
@RandPaul tell your buddy Mitch and john c of texas too kiss my a,,,,ss
@RandPaul and you should apologize and return your pay since all you have done is run for an office. Go @JimGrayLexKY
@RandPaul Who are you running against? I just love it when you Republicans run against someone you who isn't in the race you are.
@RandPaul @uknowthagod @NJW13250 And to every American just Coz
@RandPaul HC "policies" ? Don't insult Kentucky miners, they know realty.  Question, what r u gonna do to help them reinvent themselves ?
@RandPaul Bengazi is a dead horse, stop beating it.
@RandPaul @mycn2. Perhaps the coal miners should find different employment...such as solar panel manufacturing?  #cleanenergy
@RandPaul why don't you tell you constituents to get their fat asses up & get a education to get a better job. It's 2016 not 1916
@melloyellow80 @RandPaul Fewer lazy fat asses in the coal industry I bet than the rest of the country. Good advice for everyone!
@RandPaul Support the move to clean energy! Provide safety net for those displaced and education for future generations.
.@RandPaul This like saying that people who pass child labor laws should apologize to every child that lost their jobs.  #nonsense
@RandPaul Much of KY coal goes to export otherwise it meets these  standards.http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/studies/the-facts-about-air-quality-and-coal-fired-power-plants/ … Research then spew the dogma.
@RandPaul why?  It makes sense to cut back coal, environmentally and economically
@RandPaul @mycn2 Hillary Clinton actually have a detailed plan to help communities. Thanks for bringing her up http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/11/12/3721674/hillary-coal-plan/ …
@RandPaul and receive a "thank you" note from #solar workers, who out number coal miners, even in #Kentucky
@RandPaul Wow, after how well Coal Companies have treated their own workers over the years, this is laughable.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Trump champions Clean Coal....and unlike Mitch McConnel...Trump will actually get something done!!!
@RandPaul thank you Rand Paul for standing up for the coal workers WAKE UP AMERICA
@RandPaul mind if i smoke my cigerattes n same room as u! tobacco ind. wants2 no why u didnt stand 4them.if coal use is alrite so is smoking
@RandPaul Except that "her policies" didn't put those coal miners out work now did they?
@RandPaul @mycn2 those jobs are all gone in a decade anyway. Pull the bandaid off now
@RandPaul a bit obsessed with hildog huh?
@RandPaul @mycn2 And you should apologize to @realDonaldTrump for being a tyrant in this election process.Listen to  millions who want him
@RandPaul Coal is not healthy for children or other living things. Hey Kentucky, retrain YOUR workers #Kentucky #coal
@RandPaul  Since when has a Democrat ever apologized for anything? We're still waiting for an apology for their past treatment of blacks.
@RandPaul KY & WV
@RandPaul @GinnieLumpkin @mycn2 To Hell with apologies Rand, How about we put a foot in the @FBI s ass & step up indictment process & ARREST
@NewsToYouToday @RandPaul the coal miners didn't kill anyone!
@RandPaul She really does not care about blue collar workers or the common person. She only cares that she gets their votes.
@RandPaul @mycn2 how about and your colleagues apologize for doing nothing to impact this country positively for the last 7 years!!
@RandPaul The one thing @HillaryClinton will never do is apologize.  The best you're going to get her to say is that she "misspoke."
@RandPaul What about all the blood sacrifices she made to Cthulhu? Do THOSE not count for anything??? IS SHE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?!?!?!?!
@RandPaul should she apologize  to horseshoers, blacksmiths, and employees of other by gone industries?
@RandPaul sure..just like we should apologize to all of the tobacco farmers. Some industries present a hazard to public health...coal is one
@RandPaul the fact that KY must diversify it's economy is something u choose to ignore. Try listening to your consistency once in a while.
@RandPaul Policies? HRC hasn't implemented anything 2 cause job losses in KY.Maybe u shld help your state diversify.KY 10th highest poverty
@RandPaul conservatives like yourself should apologize for digging in your heels to the idea of clean energy & the replacement of coal.
@RandPaul @mycn2 you should apologize for dropping out.
@RandPaul
@RandPaul I think you're very underrated. You would be a great president. Give it a go again in 2020.
@RandPaul she probably owns part of the companies supplying her so called "clean energy"
@RandPaul coal is destroying this planet and if you are not smart enough to figure it out then sit down and shut up
@RandPaul don't forget Pennsylvania families and their children. #NoMoreClinton
@RandPaul yea but they still voting for her evil ass
@RandPaul i'd prefer she just disappeared. Her apologies are stale meaningless excuses - no accountability in government #Elections2016
@RandPaul She should drop out of the race, too, but that's something else that will never happen.
@RandPaul Those that continue to protect Wall Street will never care about middle class jobs ... only consolidation of power & wealth!
@RandPaul She should apologize to a lot of people.
@RandPaul when will those harmed by polluted air get an apology from the coal industry?
@PiratePete89 @RandPaul seriously. Coal ash is more radioactive than a nuclear plant. And this guy complains about govt spending? This is
.@RandPaul You should apologize for that hair style that wont go away
@RandPaul @mycn2 Get her Rand! #standwithrand
