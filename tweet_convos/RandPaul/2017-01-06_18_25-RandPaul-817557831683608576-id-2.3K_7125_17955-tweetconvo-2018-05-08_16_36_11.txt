No replace. Just repeal. No government healthcare!!!

#FullRepeal
Will you be laying hands on the people who will die w/o the ACA?
Don't be silly. It has been more a harm than a good, overall. The facts prove that.
What harm? When the ED is no longer used as a PCP, that's a good thing. Do all lives matter to you? What state do u live in?
NO government healthcare, from either side. Name one thing government has run well. I'll wait.
What blood are you referring to? I'm confused. 
I'm going to mute you now. My points been made and stands. Have a great day! 
Another charlatan who would be on the sidelines yelling crucify him, he's a Muslim!
will it provide birth control so women can responsibility decide when & if they start to  plan a family? @realDonaldTrump
nice Idea but in reality, flawed. The pill isn't the  answer for every woman. Only a doc can decide @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
. @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump We are gonna REPEAL!!!!!!!!!!!! ......... then r-re-replace? 
yes!!!
fuckwads. The poor will suffer, the lower middle  class will suffer-but you knew that. Shame you greedy bastards.
@fmanjoo @realDonaldTrump Senator, you are in over your head.
with what?
just a little something called the "free market", it's some new trendy idea
If you can replace it with nothing, that would be great. Let the market do what markets do everywhere else.
.  Must be nice to be well off and could give a flip about anyone else. Hope you never need help!
when health care is in demand the free market will significantly lower prices to win the consumer
.      If you think the free market will lower cost of Healthcare, I belivered your are sadly mistaken!
it's simple economics. You want to win the consumer, whoever has the lower price gets more consumers
Works with grocery stores, for example. We all need to eat, almost nobody advocates gov groceries.
@maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump Question:Replace with what? Answer: With something terrific.
@alexburnsNYT @realDonaldTrump Divulge details. A black box is of no value whatsoever.

@realDonaldTrump
Did he ask you for a donation to pay for the wall?
too bad you don't have a plan Dr? Why not improve the ACA and make it better for all Americans?
why replace it to anything? Leave it to the free market
You are the best Senator!
boo to you and your taking of healthcare from 20M people. the people will remember.
what about the rest of us that are being robbed in order to pay the bills???
#whowasthedumbestpersoninthatconversation #idiots
Replace with what??
Glad to hear you two are working together for our Nation!!
Better yet, give waivers from #Obamacare penalties to all Americans until the single Repeal & Replace is done. @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
Yes I agree time to act is now. I will be fighting you the whole way. #TheResistance #notmypresident
The time has come for you to develop a soul. Imagine yourself without healthcare.
You're acting like someone gives a shit what you think.
Replace with what? The GOP hasn't yet coalesced around a single alternative (& all proposals reduce # insured).
@alexburnsNYT @realDonaldTrump. The American people deserve the same Healthcare that we pay for you to get. Repeal you Healthcare
you're a traitor !!! Hitch ur wagon to Trump and you're finished !
GO GET,'EM LET REPLACE WITH HSA PLANS, LOWER PREMIUMS, LOWER DEDUCTIBLES, MORE AFFORDABLE.
With WHAT? REMINDER tht ACA or Obamacare is in-fact Romneycare a republican hc plan so u r repealing u own plan
R's trying to not get blamed when people die from losing coverage-like watching dog who caught the car
Would love to see that replacement plan. Been waiting for a long time...
Past 6 years, there’s been 25 versions of replacement plans proposed. Republicans can’t agree on one. That’s the issue.
no, the issue has been obama saying he'd veto it & Reid not letting it go to vote.
The Republicans have never produced a DETAILED replacement plan for the ACA.
I hope that they never DO! Govt is not AUTHORIZED 2 force us to purchase any product or be fined if you can't afford it
Replace it with nothing!
Must be great being well off and don't give a flip about anyone else.
And, what the Hell are you going to replace it with, HDHP with HSA's.  Not affordable!
@alllibertynews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Your Obamacare must be subsidized by people like me.
nope, I HAVE UNION BENEFITS!
@mike_seitz @realDonaldTrump What's taking so long senator???
And here you thought he would be a disaster to conservative policies and purposes...
Replace it w what? pls health insurance = life or death for some of us not political what is the plan? consensus?
replace with the free market system and no state borders please.
where can we read that plan?

How Sen. @RandPaul would replace #Obamacare

top, dankje!
Graag gedaan. Meer dan tipje van sluier is het niet, maar private Pools zijn onderdeel van plan.
I like the sound of it
Replace with . . . what? I'm a physician, and you're an idiot.
I think I'm pretty good with medical economics. 35 years in the biz will do that. How about you?
What's wrong with socialists?l They've done pretty well world wide in the tide of history.
@JonesCoRW @realDonaldTrump I'll wait to hear that from President Trump.
What's your plan for me? A cancer survivor who lost everything while sick? Tapping my savings is no longer option
you have orange cum on your chin
Congress doesn't need to replace Obamacare.  They should repeal almost all fed. health law.  Those laws disobey the 10th Amend.
lol
Hate to tell you, @realDonaldTrump has nodded to every replacement plan.
What is your plan?
Woop Woop !!!!
that's because you're the last person to have spoken with him. Wait an hour and see what he has to say then.
@PinkwvPink @realDonaldTrump  I'd suggest a simultaneous, parallel plan so people can transition and adjustments be made as u go.?
Single Payer.  Do it. Saves money.  Smart. @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
I just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now.
Is single payer an option? Most affordable way to cover the most people. I'm sure you'll consider it, right?
u know u aren't tweeting Bernie sanders right?
or every country in the developed world other than the United States
perhaps u could move to one of these socialist paradises?
yeah, I don't think it's his America, but the Canadians are very heavily taxed
not his any more than it was ever Barry's
First this.
if your "plan" is HSA's and high risk pools, go back to the drawing board. #notevenclosetogoodenough
Give us the same insurance all those Senators enjoy or make them have the same as us! Sounds fair!
@PresWallace @realDonaldTrump 
Gitter done!
You are both domestic terrorists and should be dealt with as such.
It's repulsive that you are legitimizing this hacked election.
What happened to "fully support" replacing O'care the very day it's repealed? I'm getting confused by it all.
yes the sooner the better.what I do not understand is why the Goverment don't stay out of it.
How's that plan working out for you? I haven't heard much for a while... oops.
Any update for us on Don's support for your plan Senator?  He is what we knew he is and you believed him? So much Winning. 100 days of?
Can't  be any worse than what they have.
Because now he's honest and principled? You're being scammed. He's saying what you want to hear.
WITH WHAT? Do you have something specific? Please sent link to specific plan.
- "we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it"
Actually you can give the public details on the bill first! Be transparent please.
Why repeal then? Why cost the country $1.3 TRILLION bc you hate black people?
Vanta sees everything by race never learned about MLK's dream.
he lied to you lol
Even if concept is good (it isn't), that is massively disruptive 2 entire HC system. No time to adapt.
replace it with what? what is the plan?
perhaps you should read what he has proposed
.@RandPaul Fun! You can make up anything, and it won't matter if he calls you out or not because neither of you has any credibility anyway.
I just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now.
liars! Every republican who backs trump is a traitor and a liar and complicit in taking down the USA!!
You don't need to repeal the ACA, just improve it. Sick of gop games on this.
Never needed Librocrats to ruin the best health care system in the world so please find yourself a nice safe space.
Rand, Mr. Trump would ask anyone anything to extricate himself from a disaster of his own making. Caution.
Do you have a Crystal ball Jim? Guess so if you know what Trump will do. Really?
I know what he will do, whatever benefits the 1%.
Waaa waaa waaa your apparently poor with your hand out-  join the rest of the "whataboutmes" no one is just going to give you money.
fix the price discovery mechanism. Encourage docs to post their prices in a central online forum for comparison!
Docs don't get paid for what they charge if you have insurance. Ever looked at an EOB stmt?
yep, thanks, Fran. That's part of the issue I'm talking abt: you should be able to see the “cash” price BEFORE a procedure.
not b/c you're necessarily paying w/ cash (unless you're using a #HSA) but b/c that's how you “shop around” & lower prices.
once it's easy & transparent to compare prices for common procedures (like #MRI's) b/t providers, they'll start to compete.
Sounds good, Radiologist gets paid for MRI. Who pays the tech? Associated costs?
it's all factored into the cost (which you OR your insurer then pay), check this out: http://surgerycenterok.com/pricing/ 
the idea is to empower you by letting you know BEFORE how much things cost. Even if you know your insurance will be paying.
@jbarro @realDonaldTrump Repeal it with what? The #GOP plan is "let them die!" Just ask your dad.
You have no plan and Obamacare WORKS for millions of Americans. Improve it or face the consequences in mid-terms
it does not work at all. Sadly Trump will just put his name on it and call it great.
Great. Can we se the plan? Or is the plan to just toss me and my family off the rolls and let us...um...die?
Well, since it's the insurance companies that raised rates...oh, the false racial slur gets ya blocked.
ACA works for me. And many I know. Fix it. Don't just strip it. It's a fucking GOP plan, ferchrissakes.
Yeah. That has been working so well. Maybe this time it'll be great!
Except that it won't. When collusion starts...
It is too complicated to do right away!
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump haha like you have a plan. This is going to be good with only 2 days prep
Bravo Senator!!! I'm sure the usual gang of RINO senators will cave as always.
if it wasn't for the dems the coal miners would be without benefits too. Are you going to screw us all?
@1tiffanyl @realDonaldTrump get it done!
God bless those 20 plus millions...
@LoopEmma @realDonaldTrump at least you have a plan. Doing nothing would be, well, sad!
Fighting for the Costitution? supporting adolph (HITLER) tRUMP?
Get a room at the(his) new D.C. Post Office
you have no plan to replace ACA. 7 years and still no plan
Is this code for "I want to score cheap political points and try to show that I have a spine, though tiny?"
@Farzad_MD @realDonaldTrump Will you make sure I have coverage on that same day? Do you care? 30 Mil people certainly do.
Even stupid horrid Russia has universal healthcare for its citizens. Leave the ACA ALONE.
right on somebody needs to look out for kentuckians, McConnell, Rand are not and that includes Barr
Absolutely the right thing to do- and why we elected you!
There is no plan that can replace Obamacare now without injuring millions of people.
what would you replace it with and how long would it take to implement?and what parts of Obama care stay in the new system? Thanks
Does that support have a due date?
what day did u speak to him? He prob already changed his mind.
Great idea!
Awesome!!!
lmao, your plan. He has always stated that he would repeal and replace same day
..Rand Paul's plan for repeal & replace should be accepted. Deficit should be cut! Politicians want nothing done!
Why the rush to "replace"...? Damned government has to be in this at all? GTFO
#MAGA #MAGA #MAGA. @realDonaldTrump
WHY ARE WE REPLACING
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump IT'S ALREADY LATE. OBAMA & OBAMACARE HAVE DESTROYED SO MANY LIVES. HURRY
Great. So what's your plan?
Yes the Dems keep saying GOP has no plan...they've had several plans for years!
with what exactly?  Foolishly playing with ppl lives.
The Rs had YEARS to come up with a plan. Watching them scramble now is hilarious.
TRANSLATION:
Neocon Papi$t$, faux-right quislings to PERPETUATE gov't control of healthcare, Not end it.
#SSDD
If he didn't tweet it, it didn't happen.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump
you called single payer healthcare akin to slavery. You shouldn't touch my healthcare either.
Now, so that voters forget what you've done by the next election
You are such a clown. "Slavery"? What the hell is going on in your head? Paleolibertarian buillshit.
for fucks sake you voted 52 times already to repeal it with no plan what's one more. Oh this one counts this time
wait u believed him, Rand? Serial liar that he is, do not hold breath
With what will you replace ACA? Don't repeal without having a plan! All Americans need #healthcare!
it's people like you that make me lose hope in humanity. #Disgusted 
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump We're with you
@brianmcarey @realDonaldTrump oh and by the way your party owns Donald Trump and all his crimes
Fantastic. Work with Trump. You are both on same page. Hold DC accountable! Get your Dad's in for meetings w/DJT.
fools
Trump lies all the time, this time is no different, you gullible fool!!
Awesome that ya'll are working together. Love the balanced budget in 5 years!  that will Make America Great Again
he lies all the time
NOW, or when you come up with a plan? 

You can't have both.  YOU HAVE TO GIVE US 90 DAYS TO READ UR PLAN LOL
@erica4oux2 @realDonaldTrump  What is your plan, Rand? U Seem too smart for the rest us.
same day is far too late! The replacement must be spun up, tested, and fully functional BEFORE you shut down the live system
It freaks me out that this needs to be said.  Who shuts down a running system before the replacement is even beta tested?
has ALWAYS been a con man much like his father. NYers r 2 familiar w this lying fraud.USA'll get 2 find out
replace it with what? Why does our health care system need to be profit driven? Why must you assholes privatize everything?
apologies, just reread Trumps original policy, the last paragraph is his problem  https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/HCReformPaper.pdf …
Do it. I need to be able to Buy a major medical policy for less than 100 a month. Like I had before.
@RubberBlon @realDonaldTrump #ENDTHEFED
Will you support insurance companies telling folks what doctors they have to see?
Yes, do it now
@RealBPhil @realDonaldTrump Let the free markets replace it. Just give it bones like can buy across state lines and have HSAs
Thought Trump had a terrific plan & so many ways to do it? Guess his plans are asking others to come up with them
@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump whatever. You just better not hold up repealing this disastrous law or we're voting your azz out too.
Pretty sad day when a libertarian demands a big govt program to replace a failed govt program.
and what is the answer then, to cover our Americans? Are you and yours willing to give up their funded care?
RandCare?
Hopefully you also discussed auditing the Federal Reserve.
my problem with you is that when it comes to people like us you deny that we didn't get a silver spoon
Replace it with what? Another government program?
Replace with what? Will it eliminate State by State insurance? Will is allow medicare to negotiate drug  prices?
medical school would be cheaper than Obamacare premiums
dont do HSA they take a year to become viable.  Plus people need to pay into it, who has that money! R u matching
Replace with what? #thin-skinned #narcissism
Why do you believe anything he says? He will tell you anything you want to hear.
You realize he is bullshitting you right? He tells you what you want to hear and will flip in 2 hours. He lies!
@aduanebrown @realDonaldTrump No disrespect but better if PE Trump states it. Too many would take advantage of speaking for him.
And why would you trust the words of a man who's repeatedly shown to be untrustworthy?
2 dicks! WHAT IS YOUR PLAN?!?!?!?!
If I could afford the premium and Rx I could need less healthcare in the future as my diabetes is early stage
Great news! Sure you can agree on a reasonable alternative to the ACA Failure Taxation scheme.
Employer have had National Plans forever, but still must follow STATE MANDATES.  OUT OF TOUCH!
Again I ask how this will happen. Revert to a system that caused more than 50% of bankruptcies? I'm Stage IV cx. My 2016 costs were $270k.
@NobamaDotCom @realDonaldTrump . Replace NED,usaid-venezuela. Americans are wasting their taxes there.
what are you going to replace it with? None of you have offered a replacement.
@Elise_Jordan @realDonaldTrump And....you think he will remember that conversation! Yer funny.
Awesome!
Dont allow the dishonest Dems, Success in there mission to destroy your relationship. OCARE IS there's!
Yeah, but Donald's a pathological liar. @realDonaldTrump
With what will you replace it? Please share details!
what will you replace it with? more government control and mandates?
>@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump THIS unique concept can Replace Failed Obamacare Medicare & Medicaid at once! Pls READ
Please, explain your plan to the masses. Show that younreplace it with something better, Obamacare was dreadful
Get ready 2 be the fall guy. Good luck w/ that.U haven't noticed? takes no responsibility so he can blame others
Are u fucking kidding me? This man in a traitor! An enemy of the State. Do not normalize! Complicit?
@RandPaulFlorida @realDonaldTrump Rand, when does the GOP ever support your common sense and great ideas?
Medicare for all, it's the only solution #MAGA
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump HEY, REPEAL IT THEN READ it 
It's suspect that we don't have national health care when other countries do.
get him to put it in writing. Or tweet at least.
With what?
0bama care is very very bad joke that helps No-one but gov. Dems exempted themselves from this bad rubbish...
Great idea! Rand! #Respect...
@TexitDarling @realDonaldTrump Outstanding ! A PLAN!!
I agree. Word is changes will not take place until 2018 so they can make sure those who need it will not suffer a loss of coverage
BS
with what shall we replace it dear Donald dear Donald with what shall we replace it replace it with what?#ACA
don't believe him, he lies about everything!
Does your PLAN have you pulling your thumb out of your ANUS?
#AuditTheFed
as long as the same amount of people are covered by insurance and get the same care at the same cost sure.
Thank You!
How much will the replacement plan cost the average American?
Great news. Glad "delayed replace" lunacy out the window. Also must not let Ds off the hook for ACA. Hammer them.
yes hammer them for enabling 30 million people to get healthcare and saving lives.  Have they no shame?
@Elise_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Question is what are you going to replace it with?! The American people want to know.
"Rand Paul Supports Free-Market Principles in Health Care and the Repeal of Obamacare" That's all I could find. Great plan!!!
No constitutional case for the fed govt to legislate on health insurance in any way.
so what are you replacing it with?
that's the only way this will work..we need to see it Before its law, not the way Obamacare was done
so had 7 yrs now going to come up w something w/i a week. yeah thatll work #impeachtrump
Will the new plan cover pre existing conditions or will I be marked for death as a diabetic?
Feel lucky, many working Americans have been priced out of coverage while illegals get it free
#RepealAndRefundTheFines , we won't accept any mandate!
@hughhewitt good to know Trump is listening to solid conservatives in senate
let the free market work!  Markets are the best way to reduce cost and increase services
you mean cartels, monopolies, etc.. sure, they work. By slaving you  in the worst way.
would you rather be a slave to the government
at least we have a choice of getting rid of them every 4 years.
