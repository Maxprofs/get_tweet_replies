@truthstampede @RandPaul There is a generation of "texters" who are only marginally able to compose a proper sentence; he is one of them.
@needham_don @RandPaul who is the generation

— A LINCOLN.

@RandPaul We Need a Bit of Humor.. Love it.. #StillRanding

@RandPaul Do U realize people R taking this as a Cruz endorsement?! Ur becoming establishment. Don't bother trying to run for Pres again.
@RandPaul @TIME You had me fooled… not! If you could, you'd endorse Bernie, I know, but it would ruin your career. #ToneDownForWhat
@RandPaul Rand is back in the presidential race. #Aprilfools. Sorry no losers.
@RandPaul do you not like his anti-war stance, or do you just not believe he's sincere?
@randpaul You're out of the race, it's over. Go troll Washington
@RandPaul @TIME  of course it was a joke! Ha.ha.ha.....
@RandPaul just added this to my festivus list. Congrats.
@RandPaul LOL.  Are you endorsing someone else?
@RandPaul and here I though we had hope!
@RandPaul I fell for it!
@RandPaul har dee har har
@RandPaul @TIME Paul RESIGN Senate Seat..Asks Obama to pick successor.
@RandPaul @TIME No donation for you. Enjoy Trump.
@RandPaul @TIME this guy is the man!
@RandPaul @TIME Time screwed up his state Rep(R-Tx not R-Ky) typical. Nice one bud.
@RandPaul you missed a good opportunity to rickroll, though!
@RandPaul @TIME Good one!
@RandPaul @TIME Miss u as pres candidate, Dr. Paul. My 21,23 yr old kids also feel U R voice of reason. Use in Senate!
@RandPaul You could have been a bigger man and helped unify the GOP. Trump + Cruz both did well in your state primary, better than you! SAD!
@RandPaul well played sir. Well played.
@RandPaul I supported your dad. Campaigned for him door to door in NH. I hope you lose your Senate seat. The unity of America isn't a joke.
I'm not joking about testifying before Congress on the consequences of drug testing. OD's have increased every year since 1991
@RandPaul
@RandPaul You say it's a prank, but entropy will get us all in the end, Fed or no Fed...
@RandPaul Grrrrr
@RandPaul I love this guy.  Never change, @RandPaul , never change
@RandPaul 
WHY IS THAT FUNNY RAND.. SUCH A JERKOFF
@RandPaul based on your views and integrity. Why haven't you. U no Cruz lies and steals ideas. You no Cruz .. Stand up man!!!
@RandPaul #StandWithRand
@RandPaul And for some reason you chose to get ppl disappointed even tho there would have been nothing to gain?
@RandPaul you too Paul. Still would love you in a VP spot.
@RandPaul I already 'got' 2 peeps ("Did you know Michael Jackson is still alive?"she bought it!)(I met a guy on FB yesterday&weMarry today)
@RandPaul @MaryStewart01 we got played. #AprilFools
@randpaul

I had no idea you were joking. I'm just an uninformed, uneducated crazy woman voting for @realDonaldTrump

#TrumpTrain
@RandPaul not funny or even amusing.  Crawl back into your cave caveman.
@RandPaul Watching Hillary react would be priceless..
@RandPaul It would be cool if we had a presser where Trump,Cruz,Kasich and Sanders all claim to have decided to suspend their campaigns..
@RandPaul Glad I didn't send $$$$. Don't like jokes on me, even on April 1. Good luck Doc
@RandPaul "(R-TX)"????
@RandPaul  I knew it!
@RandPaul @TIME lol same to you
