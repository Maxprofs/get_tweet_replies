.@RandPaul Please reconsider & oppose Sheldon Adelson's anti-#TenthAmendment bill to close states' poker websites.
When did Rand support Sheldon Adelson's backed bill?
True, but its still in the house. I think you need worry about Paul Ryan in the house. He's Adelson's new puppet for 2020.
It's in the House and the Senate now. Yes, we definitely have to worry about leadership in both houses in lame duck pushes.
who's the co-sponsor of the bill in the Senate? Reid?
Reid backs it but isn't cosponsoring. Graham is sponsor, w/ Rubio, Feinstein, Ayotte & others on: http://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1668/cosponsors â€¦
Anything sponsored by Graham & Feinstein is cause for alarm & yep more gov stomping on US freedom.
.@RandPaul If someone in Kentucky tries to access a NV or NJ #poker website, they are blocked by geolocation tech.
so...government leaves everyone alone but poker players? Their liberty not important to Dr Paul?
Please respect the rights of states by rejecting calls to ban state-licensed online poker sites. Thank you. #TenthAmendment
Support Regulated Online Poker in America.  Oppose HR 707 & S 1668 - We don't need a Federal Poker Ban.  Let the states decide.
Please oppose RAWA legislation. The bills were written by Sheldon Adelson's lobbyists & is crony capitalism. #NoPokerBan
well Rand with all the imports brought in with such a hands-off attitude your nation is gone Sir it really is bad.

Exactly! And legal, regulated online poker represents enhanced liberty, more consumer protection & new revenue. Please support it.
I agree with @RichMuny & the others that support online poker.  Please support the licensing and regulation of online poker.
Tax and regulate i-poker and states rights.

Allow online gaming sites.  I wish to play poker online. My freedoms are violated by special interests paying off politicians.

Start by opposing S. 1668 instead of just giving lip service to freedom. RAWA is crony capitalism and you and your father know it!

I would love to be left alone to freely play online poker. Please oppose RAWA, which tramples on the freedom of all Americans.
Please oppose RAWA legislation. The bills were written by Sheldon Adelson's lobbyists & is crony capitalism. #NoPokerBan
What you better do is help us fight Hillary or there wont be any Constitution left if she Wins
For over 3 years licensed Internet poker in NV, NJ & DE has been proven to be safe for consumers & players. Please oppose S.1668.
please oppose RAWA, allow the states to decide on i-poker!
.@RandPaul The bill to close state-licensed #poker websites is anti-#TenthAmendment. Why won't you oppose it? #c4l
Probably because >> @RandPaul << et al hasn't received $$$ for it.

Too cynical?
Count me in on your team to fight for smaller government!! Keep up the good work.
I'm for fighting for Liberty but I have no money to give you if that's what it takes but I could probably do something else
so are you guys going to give Hillary a pass for lying to you under oath? #perjury #wikileaks #Libya #demexit
With a G so small you can drown it in a bathtub .. who makes and enforces the rules for a free market?
Most people want a government that represents them and helps them live a richer life. Wake the fuck up.
we need a fight against corruption and deception
I would settle for a government half the size of what we have now. Also need to cut in half the number of military officers.
why then is Kentucky so heavily dependent on federal handouts ? Why don't we shut down federal offices in KY first then see ..
How can we make sure that Ted Cruz never gains a foothold again?
@MarkSargent1 what is this, a government for ants?
@billmaher this!!! Why can't Liberals understand??? This is what our founders had in mind.
What is your definition of liberty again?
why haven't you endorsed Gary Johnson??
your family have the power not to need the gov , small gov theory is good for rich people only Without gov rich will eat the poor
i don't.
Amen Brother
you left us, we want a balanced budget ,the borders sealed, Medicare and Social Security protected.
, you are the right person for the WH, you have 4 years to prepare now!
How about a government that acts more like a Customer Service Organization than an Evil Overlord?
I'll volunteer to boot you out of the Senate. You're awful
so are we actually gonna fight, or are we gonna use words that we have already said a million times over?  The gov is a cruel joke
