@RandPaul shut up bitch
@randygdub @RandPaul Yeah. Socialism rules.
@cushbomb @RandPaul socialism dislikers can suck my dick
@randygdub @cushbomb @RandPaul that's the socialist way! Don't like it? Suck my dick!
@sharpndpensel @randygdub @cushbomb @RandPaul It's also the libertarian way.
@PlankySmith @randygdub @cushbomb @RandPaul nah. You can do what you want. Just can't force me to do something I don't want to.
@sharpndpensel @randygdub @cushbomb @RandPaul lol. Libertarians have a very fluid definition of "force"
@PlankySmith @randygdub @cushbomb @RandPaul nah. It's pretty damn literal.
@RandPaul If we have to spend much money to defeat socialism I'm afraid it is too late. Socialism defeated itself a long time ago
@RandPaul This is socialism. Having others pitch in their own for greater good. Wow the irony. Pitch in for more Stickers. #stickerfaceguy
@RandPaul http://www.reasonifyouwill.com/2016/01/socialism-is-tyranny-and-theft.html …
@RandPaul so you're against subsidizing healthcare and education for the poor - but okay with us subsidizing your sloppy campaign?
@chuckn0804 Liberty amounts to rhetoric w/o opportunity. Can the US prosper with crumbling schools and no job prospects 4 the vast majority?
@chuckn0804 Interesting. How do we resolve income inequality without government policies?
@chuckn0804 Nothing 2 do with Europe. Its about investing in America. Our role in the world depends on American’s being educated and healthy
@RandPaul IDK if u have seen this or not, but heads up, @BernieSanders is 2nd choice for a bunch of ur supporters. Might reconsider. 
@JackComplex Actually, I'll be running the VIP line. I'll probably see you there. Make sure your name's on the list!
@RandPaul My donation will go to @BernieSanders. #feelthebern
.@RandPaul 
I like how Rand has determined that the POTUS race is def going to be him vs Sanders.
.@randygdub
.@Trillburne
@RandPaul Fund it yourself or fail. Welcome to capitalism. I'm saying no to socialism by saying no to giving you my money to help you
@RandPaul @SquareCash
@RandPaul How very socialist of you. o.O
@RandPaul Tell that to our socialist military.
@RandPaul @deep_beige Ever wonder why no one is attacking you, Rand?
@carsonstanwood @RandPaul @deep_beige
They are.
@Rubberdong No one gives a shit about Rand Paul. He's irrelevant.
@RandPaul If we as a community pool our $ together for the common good we can defeat something? Democratic Socialism used to defeat itself?
@RandPaul Irony: asking people to donate a little bit of their resources into a big pool to "defeat Socialism."
@RandPaul this reminds me to donate to @BernieSanders campaign.
@RandPaul Not being snarky at all. Just a heads up to your Twitter crew.  Happy campaigning!
@RandPaul Irony: "No free stuff!" "Give me contributions!"
@RandPaul @yashalevine lol, Mr 3% says what?
@RandPaul @D_Rich012 no
@RandPaul you better beat the other 12, 13 or how ever many GOP candidates are still in that clown car.
@RandPaul You have to defeat your GOP rivals first.
@RandPaul But you can't even defeat Trump. most likely you won't make main stage for next debate.
@RandPaul #Fail
@RandPaul Don't use public roads, the Postal Service. law enforcement , or fire department and call it a good start.
@AnglerArcher @RandPaul yes he will use Fedex, Ups, shun pikes and private toll roads, & what else you mentioned you muppet?! #spankingtime

@RandPaul sorry Dr. Rand:  priv healthcare Insur BIG profit making industry & pharmaceuticals!!We are #47 globally!  It's 2016;need a change
@RandPaul yes. If we pool in collectively we can defeat socialism. What's it about again?
.@RandPaul Are you going to mail "no thank you" cards to socialism? What percentage of my money then goes to stamps?
@RandPaul Yes, gotta keep those rich people happy haven't you rich man.
@RandPaul so you're using socialism to try and defeat socialism?.....
@T_Raww91 @RandPaul A donation is not socialism. Forcing someone to pay is.
@RandPaul If I donate will you actually start talking about stopping ISIS?
@RandPaul
@RandPaul so..Eliminate social security ,Medicare,police ,40 hour week ,minimum wage , NASA, FBI, CIA, arts grants? Tk God U won't b prez
@RandPaul #FeelTheBern Mr. Paul. Your time to drop out of this race is long overdue.
@RandPaul @SquareCash ask #monsanto You voted in their favor, I'm sure they'll gladly return it.
.@RandPaul how about u go earn $5-8 on the free market. lotta snowed-in driveways out east
@RandPaul Well look who's all "from each according to his abilities, to me according to my needs."
@RandPaul I'm gonna steal all the money you get and give it to Bernie
@hugefuckboy @RandPaul Yes to a communist dictator, go Bernie go!  gotta love the Bern.
@Rhinoeatone @RandPaul I'm gonna give you liberty AND death bud

@RandPaul haven't you already lost or something
I'll give you $10 to shut the fuck up “@RandPaul: I'm running to defeat socialism. Chip in $5 or $8 to tell Bernie Sanders "no thanks" to...
A blend of @RandPaul and @BernieSanders is what America needs right now.
@RandPaul u throw a hissy fit about the debate then ask for money?  Things don't go your way and u cry. Man up before u ask me for $
@RandPaul @SquareCash Give me some of your money so I can stop other people from taking some your money. Is your campaign socialist?
@RandPaul 
#Trump2016

@RandPaul lol what are you even polling @ dude
@grabmybutstick @RandPaul bc there's nothing socialist about crowdfunding
@RandPaul Pay for it yourself and stop begging for money
@RandPaul
@RandPaul @SquareCash Will u support an end to copyright welfare and demand a rollback of 170 yr copyrights?
@RandPaul There's a reason his campaign is doing much better than yours. BTW, how was the last debate?
@RandPaul @SquareCash you don't have the votes Rand
@RandPaul @SquareCash Why do you pick such seemingly random numbers for donation amounts, what is the algorithm
@RandPaul "Democratic socialism"
@RandPaul Dude how much do you tweet?
Don't you have a campaign to run?
@RandPaul I'm going to send you $0 and donate to Bernie.   I still think the GOP needs your sensibility tho
.@RandPaul LOL, eff you Norwegians and your awesome quality of life!
