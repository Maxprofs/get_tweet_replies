@justinamash @HillaryClinton Comey said, "We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI."
He said she lied to the public.
.@justinamash Jason Chaffetz asked: Did Hillary Clinton lie?

Mr. Comey: “We have no basis to conclude that she lied to the F.B.I.”
Again. TO THE FBI. Not in her answers to the American public. Or is it ok to lie then?
answering incorrectly but in good faith is not lying. But y'all haters never gonna accept that.
So Clinton was "answering in good faith" when she told in a press conference there ARE NO classified emails?
yes.
Then you're a buffoon. She commented in an area she had no business commenting on.
Sen @RandPaul was the only one in chambers to expose her.https://youtu.be/XeVGUzd4h1Q  via @YouTube
Sen @RandPaul was only one trying to stop arming ISIS 2013 & Syrian War
TYSM @endcomputed @RandPaul great man of character, listened to his floor speech, hadn't seen this   @CynthiaStillBB @ChristophHeer52
Rand was also the only senator to vote against Comey.
Probably he was the only one not receiving kickbacks from Clinton Fdn
Yes & Saud.. @endcomputed @freedom3556 @RandPaul @ChristophHeer52
----> @RandPaul tried to stop arming ISIS @ChristophHeer52 But John McCain is friends w/ISIS
Come on Rand, you're smart enough that you don't have to lie about Hillary. You want Trump as President? @RandPaul @HillaryClinton
What was his lie? Its an absolute fact  @HillaryClinton lied about what Comey said. Repeatedly. @RandPaul
Hasn't about 70% of the things Trump has said this campaign been rated false?
Don't deny it. Hate Trump. But about 70% of what  @HillaryClinton has said is also lies Double standard? @RandPaul @Montgomery_bjm
No actually Hillary is rated around 90% accurate. @BonkPolitics @bret1555 @HillaryClinton @RandPaul
No agenda or slant with CTR, no-sirrie-bob.
Great thing about the "media-bias" narrative, for you guys...
Obama pays $400M ILLEGAL ransom, story becomes Trump/video. MEDIA BIAS @lawrance_joe @Montgomery_bjm @HillaryClinton @RandPaul
- she "short circuits" every time she opens her mouth. #CrookedHillary
another schizoid embolism & the poor SS guy has to carry her Valium
- is it really a Secret Service Agent or a healthcare professional in disguise?  #HillarysHealth
good question!
@rharrisonfries @HillaryClinton very good!
@carolinagirl217 @HillaryClinton Its a sad day in America when ppl vote to keep Paul Ryan.
@Trump4Hope @HillaryClinton that's what I also thought. Why didn't she just say I LIED ! Wait she always lies
#ClintonCrimeCartel #Haiti #4Fedinv #wikileaks #Guccifer2
Short circuit also conveys some loose wires possibly. Shot fuses~!
how about you help us all with liberty and endorse Gary Johnson and Bill Weld
lol he's better off endorsing the constitutional party.
Are they on the ballot in all 50 states, polling near 15%? Nope.. CP is more religious right bs.
so i should vote for Gary Johnson, the sellout, because of his polling?  That's retarded
@GovGaryJohnson a sellout but not Rand Paul?? #irony #TeamGov makes their positions clear always
@alllibertynews @HillaryClinton the bigger issue for GOP is the nonchalant support for a pro Russian,hate inciting wanna-be Hitler
that is because, as usual, you have your head stuck up the lower portion of your anatomy. You are a day late & a dollar short.
If medical rumors are true, maybe was a "short circuit".
........................LOL..LOL
should be happy she lives where with due process has otherwise she's a traitor who deserves death.
@LindaSuhler @HillaryClinton
. Hillary is a pathological liar and should never be president. Unbelievable USN Veteran
Is it possible to censure #HilllaryClinton as a presidential candidate? 
Comey's testimony proves she lied much
@sauod_898 @HillaryClinton I was bhind on my linguistics2.Apparently,u can make up a phrase N context or explain&may gain traction
PERFECT
And you should know darned well that her email issue is NOTHING like Petraeus deliberately sharing secrets. @RandPaul @HillaryClinton
@TommyRennison @HillaryClinton so we really don't give two s**** what you saying you're a piece of s***
@TommyRennison @HillaryClinton we really don't give a s*** what you got to say Paul you're letting Christian Killer in America
IMO, more concerning than that. Our President needs mental acuity and decisiveness. Her medical records?
@Max.dixieHayes @HillaryClinton                                                 MORE please!
delete this tweet! She was not lying,she was parsing words. She did not intend to send classified info
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton
It goes a lot deeper than lies Rand.
You condemn Hillary, what about Powell and Rice using private servers?  What about them? @RandPaul @HillaryClinton
@JOMainEvent @HillaryClinton Ok Rand. I'll admit that is a very good tweet so giving you a .... 
good one! She is pure evil. The Queen of Lying!
HaHaHaHaHaHeHeHeHeHoHoHo good one!
@LindaSuhler bingo
I think if you were to run as the Libertarian candidate or as an independent candidate, you would win the election
@LexxiFlowers1 @HillaryClinton WHERE HAVE YU BEEN DR PAUL WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO DONALD TRUMP TO DEFEAT ALLCROOKED DCN INCLUDING HC
Yes. It also means "my Dsupports R so dumb they believe everything I say.Especially @CNN @jaketapper
I think HRC suffers with dementia or some other neurological problem Hillary used 2 B able to handle such situations
~ Their euphemisms are running out. She's a flat out liar!
I didn't either
I wont VOTE FOE EITHER OF YOU LOOSERS.
@ChristiChat @HillaryClinton  She short circuited here. Again. #NeverHillary
Agree Hillary is a pathological liar. At least she is well poised,polished unlike you Donald.
@BossHoggUSMC If @HillaryClinton short-circuits in the WH like Woodrow Wilson will Bill Clinton become shadow POTUS?
One in the same Dr Paul ... she is a #deceitful liar that has a lot of the #USA fooled unfortunately ... #WakeUp
Is Short-Circuited a lie? "It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is" Enough lawyers in DC. Doctors ok
@carriemichelle0 @HillaryClinton 
She's building an insanity case for herself.

@imx007 @HillaryClinton @maddow @MSNBC @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNNPolitics @PaulManafort @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @wolfblitzer @CNBC
@dragonian3333 @HillaryClinton It is synonymous with alcoholism.
. Vote Trump
Chris Wallace said this morning that there was no short circuit. Four more pinochios, Hillary.
do I gotta go back & look up ur lies exposed by Maddow? I'd forgotten the specifics but if ur gonna dish it....
@Trader_Moe @HillaryClinton QE = printing money. New speak = 1984.
@mhooshma16  #even KGB affiliations. Hillary a secret Marxist? http://freedomoutpost.com/exposing-the-marxistcommunist-past-of-hillary-clinton/ …
@tullyframe @HillaryClinton why wasn't she prosecuted??!!!!!
It's right there Dr. Paul in the Clinton synonym book along with BJ synonymous with platonic.
Her politically abuse of English
@TraciLbertyBell @HillaryClinton Do we want her around the nuke button when she short circuits hillary #unfit
@HillaryClintonI am adding "short circuit" to my list to use for my cover ups at http://work.How  creative?!
@kathy_hoffman @HillaryClinton are you backing Trump or no sir?
what kind of person is still voting for this lying sack of dog shit after all of this? Seriously. She's so evil
@Christi19127023 @HillaryClinton lololololol...Thank you for the laugh!! Your definition is perfect 
jastone@ikedog101 ilove it its simply brilliant,she the truth if it her in the face lying to long
For once I thought she was  being honest about her brain injury, referring to her cog impairment
I believe you're speaking about your #TrickyTrump and his #TrickyTrumpkins. @HillaryClinton by a landslide. GOP will lose BIG!
A lying criminal should not be running for president!!
WAKE UP #WeThePeople That is ALL @HillaryClinton #hilLIARy knows how to do! #AmericaFirst #TrumpPence16
And in either case, just imagine what this means for someone who might have a finger on the "nuke button." Unfit!
@Rockprincess818 hope she doesn't "short circuit" with her hands on a nuke!
does she seem healthy?
.@RandPaul @HillaryClinton You should be knighted as "Sir Randsalot, the Savage"
@siesienna @HillaryClinton Yeh Rand!!!
Wasn't something I learned in nursing school either or my 25 plus years in nursing.
@Alicebonniesmom this is coming from a guy who is well known for plagiarizing work...? People who live in glass houses Rand.
@UTHornsRawk @HillaryClinton
@uthornsrawk When lying is the default action there has to excuses. Misspoke, short curcuit, deny or lie some more
@dragonian3333 @HillaryClinton
@sleeepycurtis @HillaryClinton dad
Actually, I take it to have alternate meaning. No one has uncontrollable movements of neck & head w/o brain damage
Even when @HillaryClinton says "short-circuited" she's lying about that too.
is a pita, she sure used you for her gain. Get away from her. Vote Trump
oh shit. rand's got jokes
@zebra78610 can someone with a top security clearance confirm that a top secret email states it is so in big bold letters? SMH
com'mon Rand....ya gotta admit @hillaryclinton is the spin #Queen
The March of the lying pantsuit continues.
@Tea4Freedom @HillaryClinton Yes Hillary!  Heard it ALL before! 
@SPQRzilla @HillaryClinton How about an independent bid for POTUS? You could win.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton
Good one!
@DarHuddleston @HillaryClinton can we talk?
that's how it is with the hillabreast
Friend already said she becomes confused often her mind may be going she's old
respect than they now show  President Obama? Would they think because she is a woman that she would be weak and ineffective?
Question? I have not heard this asked or answered. If we have Hillary as President, would the Middle East show her even less respe

I have to disagree with this statement. The word again should have been all caps. "AGAIN".
Leave Hillary alone, I think she'll make a great President. She has my full endorsement
Dr.Paul, you're a good man.
cell phone too close to her circuit board
Hillary may "short circuit" that US nuclear button. Yikes!
It is truly a concern to me. IMO, every American should be concerned. 'short-circuited' = lack of acuity
@justinamash Paul Amash 2020
you should have been our next president
Rand, An amazing line, keep them coming.
It's like someone saying they 'misspoke'. How the hell does anyone misspeak? Unless they lied.
Man, I wish you had run as a Libertarian this year

@HillaryClinton
@paulbenedict7 @HillaryClinton Short Circuit is synonymous with lying through my teeth Senator Paul sums up Hillary in 1 sentence
@onlyXknives @HillaryClinton @scottienhughes ROFLMAO Great One Senator Paul..
The American government is corrupt: Obama, Comey, Lynch, crooked Hillary, many others. Sick.
@paulbenedict7 @HillaryClinton HA You & Huckabee should write a book of political one liners. You're BOTH hilarious & spot ON
@RandPaul @GR13579Z @HillaryClinton
@kickitdotcom @HillaryClinton all it takes to Challenge the narrative.  Why is it not being challenge?
add it with "mis-spoke" been used a lot with this administration. http://tinyurl.com/hhutp7m 
@charlotta615 @HillaryClinton That was a close one
Right after she wiped it with a cloth, it short circuited.
@DianaChic1 @HillaryClinton  She doesn't lie; she amends the truth to fit the Liberal Narrative!
seems she can't open her wicked mouth without lying !
@219112 @HillaryClinton Great movie, but I liked short circuited 2 better. "Johnny 5 is alive"
@jaeaa @HillaryClinton -She's Definitely Lost it and America is now closing the Lost & Found Dept.
It's one of her major accomplishments. @RandPaul @jasian12345 @HillaryClinton

@woodseysmith @HillaryClinton did she come up w this word by herself ?? Who even thinks of using this word like this ? She lies!!
@KimMoor20918476 @HillaryClinton Touché 
@OlgaOlgamsmith try 2 tell ur employer u short circuited when u didn't encrypt a sensitive email! #NotQualified #CantPassACori
why aren't you running as the Libertarian candidate?
, @HillaryClinton is so despicable. She's like some cartoon Disney villain, except this monster actually exists.
I #StandWithRand For Senator in Kentucky ... He will stand with Trump.

@RandPaul @HillaryClinton
I had not previously realized that "short circuited" was synonymous with "got caught lying through my teeth, again" @HillaryClinton
Did @HillaryClinton ”short circuit” under oath? https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/761612551335636992 … cc: @TGowdySC
I had not previously realized that "short circuited" was synonymous with "got caught lying through my teeth, again" @HillaryClinton
The FBI didn't put her under oath in their super secret *interview* with her.
.@RandPaul @CockyShark @HillaryClinton Liar liar pantsuit on fire LOL
it's called liberal speak.
p.s. "I was confused on some minor details" means she was caught dropping a major factual dookie on tv
could you define the word "is" please http://painefultruth76.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-rule-of-hillary-clinton.html …
@coolbearcjs @HillaryClinton the circuit shorted when her line of BS didnt work
Muy bueno!
and she continues to lie about the lie about the lie!!! She really thinks The People are stupid!
@AlexisinNH @HillaryClinton Either way, she's unfit to serve as our POTUS.
she can make up some strange words for the words, "I'm a lying"
oh, you're still here, Rand?
Not too much of a shocker when Clinton is synonymous with duplicitous
BASED PAUL
@thompsoncheri22 @HillaryClinton I think "short circuited" is her acknowledgement that she is mentally impaired
There is definitely something seriously Wrong with her
Isn't short circuited a medical term for "I forgot I lied"?
@OmaTalley1 @HillaryClinton 
Did you see her Outrageous Accusation that Mr Trump & His Kids kill lots of Animals. Where's MSM
@Stand4Liberty_ @HillaryClinton It would be for me and thee, but not for Hillary!
I understood her explanation. And I don't even run my own professional association.
@instapundit @HillaryClinton #HillaryClintonShortCircuited
she is a class all her own she makes liars look good
Hard to stop the habits of a lifetime.
Everytime she talks I get vertigo! Man that woman can spin it, can't she! 
@NateHnsn You might call these things "short-circuits."

Oh contrar Mr Rand. Donny lies through his teeth daily. Pound Hillary about emails. Your boy lies about everything
The closest to an honest president was Carter. That worked out well, eh?
