I don't trust @SpeakerRyan at all! Can the bill presented be reworked to gain your approval? Is it total rubbish?
Repeal is separate legislation than replace. 2 bills needed, GOP being dishonest
@bobbiefiles @RandPaul @SpeakerRyan
I don't trust @SpeakerRyan at all! Can the bill presented be reworked to gain your approval? Is it total rubbish?
I think, if I remember correctly, they have the bill to repeal already approved.
Obama vetoed the healthcare repeal,now traitor Paul Ryan refusing to bring the bill up again.#RyanCare
@bobbiefiles @RandPaul @SpeakerRyan
Ryan is a disgrace!!!
I wil! The rest of the Dems will go!! We will vote in more conservatives!
agreed repeal it entirely!please!
@freedomusa_ 
@POTUS Trump is trying to rebuild America but "Politicians" are more worried about reelection, SAD!!

A "REMINDER" to the @GOP @TheDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems

@POTUS Trump didn't cause our problems, You Did!!
all i hear is my plan my plan you are not in charge get on board and make it right
Good, back to the drawing board ! It's not what we want. We want free market competition. Not gov. controlled or run healthcare!
Keep pushin'
@JudgeCarter vote for TRUE repeal & replace with a market based approach.
repeal, remove #BigPharma regulations, and let the free market take over.  Reinforce charity! #liberty
What regulations!? They're part of the Oligarchy that controls this country, now under Trump!
plenty of regulations like buying drugs, selling across state border, etc.
And yet they still manage to control half our government in the process, poor them
if Trump keeps us going the way things are PLEASE run against him in the primaries in 2020
You go Rand...your the man..Trump will listen...he knows exactly who Ryan is. 

 @treed_cat
there you go @BrentRandolph
Is @POTUS open to hear what you three have to say?
NO FORCED N UNCONSTITUTIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE!!
November 6, 2018!
shut it down rand!!!
Just repeal it!!!!
@MariaBartiromo Repeal and Replace Only Acceptable Otherwise there isn't any real change
keep on fight Rand make establishment politicians own their mistakes
if what I have read about it any one voting to pass should be voted out..it's in moral and mostly screws america
According to McCain, your position must mean you're working with Vladimir 
We need a health care bill for majority of Americans, not for your small group of hardliners! Bipartisan COMPROMISE!  #FixNotFight
Gee, Paul, if you don't like the bill, then amend it.  Or offer your own bill.  The whole idea is get a bill into reconciliation.
Not after 7 years of congress running on the promise for a full repeal. They were elected to GET RID of it
We'll have to let Obamacare fail completely first.  Only then will we have the support necessary for a repeal.
You wait. I'll scream and bitch and fight. I'm beyond tired of this crap. I MUST HAVE repeal 2 get by anymore.
Good!  Write your Congressman.  He needs to hear from you.
Ive got his number on speed dial
Umm.  As you were saying about War &JMcCain last night? How's that Trump/Russia obfuscation &now NorthKorea threats working 4 you?
@SpeakerRyan as I say time after time GET IT RIGHT, and get government OUT OF HEALTHCARE
@MariaBartiromo 

Rand needs cut the BS and do his job!
been trolling you for a while. Glad to see you're not in favor of this ryancare plan. Still against u on a full repeal thou.
I agree. So how many Republican parties are there now?
Why can't the Paul Ryan obamacarelite RINOcare be revised and revsied to reflect a conservative plan that does not involve gov't.
Continue to fight for the best HC !!
I sure hope he doesn’t get it passed. We were promised a "repeal of Obamacare."
#SaveACA
Full repeal, then replacement
Isn't Obamacare Lite, by definition, better than Obamacare?  Why not support that, move the chains, and then improve it?
btw, keep up your great work, ty
he is only there thanks to President Trump and won't be there in 2018, bye Ryan
Horrible Bill--Subsidies by any other name......
you keep fighting the good fight @POTUS I know you are 10 steps ahead of the #Establishment We have no reason not to do this right
Why does @GOP screw up whenever they become the majority. Although @newtgingrich didn't with Contract for America. He was a win.
GIVE HIM HELL RAND !!!!
BEWARE #TheWisconsinWeasel  AKA The IDIOT In Charge AKA RINO SCUMM @PRyan ! What a LOAD of Excrement HE REALLY IS!
Can Bird rule go away and put the entire plan in at once?
@NetworksManager repeal back to day before ocare. The takers free trial is over
Keep fighting Senator Paul!  Give us the proper healthcare

If the bill comes to the senate can you make changes to it? If so do it and stop the infighting! You all are hurting 2018 & 2020!!
Ryan needs to go away!
Pl @realDonaldTrump Trust Rand over Paul, any day of the week. #ResistTheLeft
Repeal...then replace
hold their feet to the fire! We demand nothing less than total repeal! Then let the free market do its thing! Get out of the way.
@mariannecope Ryan doesn't cry as much as Boehner......? but still shitty.   Get him out!  Rand you?
we do NOT want Obamacare lite.
@MariaBartiromo republican need to work things out instead of threatening each other. American first and for all Americans
I am with you on this. Do not pass Paul Ryan's bill. Americans want free market healthcare &we want government to stay OUT of it!
@MariaBartiromo Then you get to keep Obamacare.  Compromise!
Neither should any current GOP plan. We should join the rest of western democracies and provide universal coverage.
Why disagree on every tv outlet? Can’t you work directly with the leadership and show some solidarity in public? Get your stuff in
Good. REPEAL and let the FREE MARKET replace.
In Senate you can basically scratch Ocare 2 and re-write it. Do that!
Then I hope you have the votes to fix it. Obama lite, as you call it, achieves many good things.
you can't have inexpensive health insurance with the cost of health care. Those costs have to come down first. You know that !!!
the collusion between Dr., hospital, drug co. and insurance has to go away. Huge money machine, wrecking our country !
He just said it took him a year to draft this ACA amendment. A YEAR! I could have hired a law school student to write this mess!
Why are we not doing an end run on insurance issues by pursuing ways to commoditize health care?
We begged our reps not to vote for him....but noooooooooooo...
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity DISHONEST @SpeakerRyan 2SAY 1 thing & DOanother. U SAY Uwant best AHA butU DO NOT allow improvements
@NetworksManager Let's get Lyin' Ryan's resignation!
I surely hope y'all can learn to compromise. United we stand. . . Need to get in a room and don't come out until the job is done.
All these GOP politicians do are talk, talk, talk in the media. Talk to each other and get it passed. SMH
Everything insurance or gov. pays for sooner or later becomes beyond reach for the average Joe. Easy Money Price goes up!
Can your drafted bill with other amendments be immediately merged into the Ryan bill when it gets to the Senate?
@SpeakerRyan I'm reaching out every day to my reps asking to stand against #RINO #RyanCare. Ryan is arrogantly dismissing us.
@MariaBartiromo    And that makes Paul happy ??????
This is not patient choice - we need to be calling it what it is: an insurance company bailout.
@MariaBartiromo We need ACA repealed ASAP! Please get issues worked out now...
ask the people what they expect to see in the healthcare plan. #1 goal it remove the invisible lines. #Competitive
#2 don't fine people that can't afford the health insurance or don't want it.
Not enough old people dieing soon enough?
Make Ocare voluntary, replace it with nothing, deregulate  healthcare sector, exempt personnel & businesses from income tax.
@MariaBartiromo this is going to be another long drawn out issue. I don't understand how these ppl can't get anything right!?!
Stick to your beliefs. Don't bow down to pressure. You represent the people of your state not the House or the Senate.
Stand your ground Senator Paul
@SpeakerRyan
We didn't vote for RYAN's #BetterWay. We voted for #TrumpsWay it's #OurWay We put them in Congress to HELP TRUMP.
#StandWithRand
@NetworksManager you are up to bat senator ... go for it
Ins area my entire life. Rand Paul's plan is excellent!! Ryan care will fail miserably. Rand fight on!!!
Senator please stick to your guns! Or better yet end this socialist program/tax once and for all! Get the gov out of insurance biz
thanks for standing firm!
@NetworksManager ...come on Rand, lock Ryan in a closet and go make a deal with Trump
We need @HouseGOP @SenateGOP 2 fulfill their word to US their VOTERS! @POTUS
REPEAL WILL TAKE GUTS!
they need guts, please do it right so it doesn't haunt us
he's a openly secret globalist
I'm with you Senator Paul.  No "ObamaCare lite"
#Rinocare is what I like to call it. It rolls of the tongue  better and gives some homage to its creator #speakerRyan.
@NetworksManager Twitter deleted this tweet.  Keep fighting, Senator Paul!
Senator Paul. Can you get the votes with your plan? You make more sense,  but just wondering about ideas on how to get it passed.
steadfast freedom caucus @SpeakerRyan should step down, #AHCA not good! @realDonaldTrump If #AHCA pass, trouble 4 @POTUS in future
@FoxNews @SpeakerRyan Rand you continue to make yourself look small, your 60 vote approach corners us AHA ,stop,vote w GOP,chill
Why should the ppl who were elected to repeal govt healthcare piss on their constituents for you?
Keep up the good fight for we the people.
@ed_grimly Can Rand Paul get the votes with his plan? His makes more sense but just wondering if anybody knows.
10DemSens up for reelection in Trump states. Remember, #RyanCare's 3rdStep requires 60votes too.
Govt hurt healthcare BEFORE=$20 copay& $500 deduct+$490/mo prem; NOW=$7500pp deduct+$1900/mo Just an expensive catastrophic policy
You are 100% correct! We waited every 2 yrs 4 you ppl to REPEAL. Now you CAN DO IT & refuse to. Never voting GOP again if U dont
One question Mr. Senator. Isn't this new bill better than the original ObamaCare? 337 billion less in subsidies w/ state control
I love it when y'all fight
seems that may be the point. GOP can say they tried and move on. This, with exception of freedom caucus input, has been a joke.
wondering if this "conservative" "stand your ground" stance is really just a pissing match? UNITED WE STAND!
These ppl have been elected BCUZ they promised a full repeal for years. It's THEIR promise to their voters
As Seen ON TV @seanhannity
I hope not. Great work @RandPaul
Paul Ryan is an idiot and needs to resign it be fired....
Do you believe In Jesus and if he had a choice do yo believe he'd be your friend. #ThisIsUs
Neither will anything else you guys propose.
Thank you 4 holding Ryan's "feet to the fire" on the replacement of O-Care. The American PPl don't want a water-downed version.
The base is with YOU, Rand! Clean repeal & don't replace. We know Ryan is a Traitor - don't let up on him! 
@NetworksManager Your plan to straight repeal is equally disastrous Ran.
explain how, & "ppl will lose their plan" isnt good enough. WE WHO PAY FOR THEIRS lost ours
Most repubs in both houses are there bcuz the voters are TIRED OF BEING COMPROMISED by the GOP
please get with @POTUS to make this happen. @SpeakerRyan is hurting us
Thank you Senator Rand Paul for standing up for you fellow Americans.  #NoCadillacTax
@NetworksManager Why wasn't your plan even considered???
Rand's bill already passed but Obama veto, now Paul Ryan refusing to move it forward again.#DC
@3pawpundit @RandPaul
@NetworksManager Why wasn't your plan even considered???
They always think theyve got a few more yrs of power B4 ppl revolt.
Senator do you believe Tort Reform is the root of rising healthcare cost? Isn't this a large part of the issue?
- #TrumpCare
sorry to say he's a scoundrel
Time to make the move to a new Speaker, how about Jim Jordan or Mark Meadows? Please. Thank you.
Ryancare needs to burn.
thank you for fighting for a better health plan
Isn't this standard procedure for Republicans to shoot themselves in the foot just when they are winning the race!
We don't want Obamacare-lite, we want freedom markets without federal involvement!
Exactly! Regs by govt on businesses cause them to take their losses out of customers. Free market needs govt OUT
Good job Rand. This is why we in Idaho still stand with you!
Please repeal ObamaCare. I cannot afford it!
It's about control. If most health care is affordable w/o insurance, the people will have more power(freedom) reserved to them.
Yes, you had many years to do this. What is taking so long?
If the PEOPLE 
Get what they want

It'll be a WH
without 
Ryan

He can't 
#MAGA

He can TRY to
Bring obama 
Back again
That's it
Don't give in rand! We're counting on you to resist this steaming pile of crap
Stop #ObamacareLite  give us #FullRepeal and  #FREEMARKET  Thanks for telling the truth about #Rinocare  Kentucky blessings
full repeal then replace with a free market plan by removing regulations
Get your own "house" in order. Push @SenateGOP to revise antiquated Senate Rules (esp XXII). Nov'18 is coming fast.
My fear is that he will have the votes.
AHCA is a disaster that is only there to repeal ACA to save rich @GOP donors big tax $$. FIX ACA, you know what it's problems are
Make them compromise, don't you.  It's about time the liberals compromised.
you referring to the MASSIVE TAX BREAK FOR WEALTHY (oops "healthcare plan")?
Get with the Pres., Tom Price,House Leadership and work this out...we all know not everyone will be covered because they choose NO
I hope so. We need the free market to replace Obamacare, with legislation geared towards preserving people's Liberties and rights.
Scrap that beast, hit the reset button and start over Rand
I don't trust Ryan. I have always trusted the Pauls and will continue to. Make sure you let President Trump know Ryan is a moron
