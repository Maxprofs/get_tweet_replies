@alyssastew77 @FoxNews @RandPaul Um? Ya. Trump is against all strict regulations. Lies? Lie
@Trump4Hope @RandPaul that is good.
I work for a major hospital in the Northeast and may not have a job next November. I'm a 32 yr old female veteran.
See the greed dripping from care act, with incentive to fail, billions in bailouts. Everyone wants a bite of seniors
Obamacare will go down as the biggest boondoggle in History and has wasted Billions we didn't have to waste
Unless they make business decisions he dislikes, then he'll punish them through gov power.
Obamacare is a joke and people need to just say NO
@KYGOP @KYHouseGOP @KYSenateDems @GrayforKentucky Dems get your talking pts correct-like HRC-lie
Your support of #Trumpocrats  is embarrassing. I regret donating money to you. I genuinely thought better of you.
so against protecting the health of our workers, children, and environment then
it should be.
You support a guy like Trump.  No more talk about morality from you.  Hypocrite.
@GrayforKentucky Rand Paul receives the worse grade possible from the NEA for education!
I thought that know one saw this. Why? same as war on tobacco. Power. Soros picking up bankrupt companies. They are evil
boo boo
lol Shawn Lucas got bang bop banged in the head for suing Hillary over Berne cheating! Lol
RandPaul is for corruption, scams, breaking Fed Laws, Criminals in office. How much is he making off Dem Gov?
Thank you for your support which is so sorely lacking from the Republican Party
#StandWithRand he is 4 us..
...Trump can't be against something he knows absolutely nothing about!!!
Regulation protects the consumer. Regulation protects the environment. Regulation protects and keeps companies in check.
FOCUS! Trump is too stubborn to fail as president! Hillary is a epic fail b4 she even starts!
he is also against basic human decency
#Killary , her #RiggedMedia and her supporters are in favor of even more red tape and taxes. Brain dead or beneficiaries.
no he's not.
--  Thanks Senator Paul
trumpnis helping the coal miners stay employed.  Hillary wants to put them out of work.   Wake up Rand Paul
How about DOJ interfering with banking for gun shops?
That Ramen top in full effect yo.
Leave it to Rand & @tedcruz two of the FEW willing to talk common sense when @GOP are too SCARED to speak up 4 truth!!
Maybe Rand Paul but Ted Cruz is a dangerous nutcase
Dangerous b/c he knows the Constitution bkwards&forwards & willing to fight
No because he is a brain washed nutjob & nutjobs like to fight!

IF YOU SEE TRUMP'S WATCH THUGS INTIMIDATE VOTERS VIDEO THEM AND CALL POLICE
Obama& HRC want to change USA to resemble Germany,1 million Unvetted Refugees, Open Borders, Globalism, U will pay for it
Sounds like a Trump vote,about time.
@woodboxer851 @RandPaul trump has a war on anything ain't white or not making him more rich
trump is against everything except himself.
libertarians 2020
We only get one planet. Coal has decimated the land banks have stolen homes,farms have polluted water,hospitals superbugs
Trump is also a bully and a pathological liar, but sure, take his stated positions at face value. #facepalm
OMG a real republican surfaces
And so?
Why not make it simple and state, @realDonaldTrump is against regulating hard working America loving people.
So, #RandPaul & #Trump thinks banks shouldn't be regulated?? LOL! The banks that ran off with money?
and what about the Obama coup corrupting and compromising our government from within?
Just like Trump - Bad hair, good ideas

Stop all Federal regulations everything wii be BEAUTIFUL.
Coal=high pollution/toxic water. Time to move into the 21st Century & use clean, decentralized energy.#SmartEnergy
@PhinsDiehard @RandPaul
there you @RandPaul now put some back into it.  Right or wrong you support the people's choice and they will remember.
Was he still involved in politics??
I missed seeing that crazy hair man! #StandWithRand
The bureaucracy is part of the lefts war on success. It's also a cause for all the damn pollution people are sucking in.
Rand Paul we need to hear more from you they would not allow u in de bates your experience is priceless
you are a good man RAND!  #MAGA
Cuuckoo!
So, Rand Paul, do you really want Hillary for president?
We only have two candidates to choose from and one is a sexual predator. America needs prayer.
.
Literally, the statement make no sense.
.
He's just your regular anti-regulatory kinda guy
And your point is...
Its simple, Repubs = bigger business more jobs. Dem = bigger Government and more government control
Except in reality where the opposite is true. http://politicsthatwork.com/graphs/job-creation-president …
It is a fact dems are always for more gov control. Deny and twist. Won't change the facts
Yes their policies work better. Fact. You see not all regulation is bad. Fact.
and you keep believing that. How sad people don't realize who he really is.
Trump's against Zoning, Fire, Building Codes Regulations. That's his business, property development.
Obama has used the EPA and the FDA to attack the groups he doesn't like
http://facebook.com/fixamericafirstpac/ …
...if I were Rand, i would have walked off your show. Why do you interview people if you wont let them talk? Disgraceful
That means that he is for the American people!
Fuck Fox New and Cnn! You cannot be news if you pick sides like this. Should be ashamed to call yourself news.
gruber has been caught lying to the American people by his own words why trust him again jackasses
Rand I'm starting to like you as much as I love your dad. #MAGA
