No U R Wrong Rand, Bolton would be the best choice, we need someone who isnt going to put up with crap from the UN.
No he is not, he is the best choice and I hope he gets the pick.
please tell me 3 worthwhile things about Bolton
He is intelligent, tough, and knows forign policy almost without peer. NEXT.
http://reason.com/blog/2016/11/15/five-horrifically-bad-foreign-policy-ide …
Dont see a disqualifying thing about him.
omg! The iran deal is a farse!  Complete idiot!!!!!
The Iran deal was very succesful idiot. We got everything we wanted.
@alllibertynews @SwaggisBroathe1 @RandPaul @politico Depends on who he means by "we".
I mean the US
That just not what research says. Try it. It brings knowledge.
until a bunch of chest beating morons decided to reimpose sanctions. Try doing your research.
Alternative media has had enormous viewership gains. Msm-(distorted untruths) are at lows.
Know what else doesn't work? Isolationism.
Rand isn't an isolationist.  That's a neocon attack line

'this Wall Street Journal headline confirms my belief, must be true'
It's fairly common knowledge. Also, Washington Post. Read with your eyes open.
It's really not.  Neocons call anyone against regime change isolationists.
You know who was the wrong choice, Trump, yet, GoP prioritized personal interests (per usual) over America.Bravo. #YourMess
Bolton carries the stamp of John Foster Dulles when it comes to Iranian regime change. NOT GOOD.
@alllibertynews @politico 
Regime change didn't worked bc personal interest conflict at the same US admin
Honestly, how do republicans not gag on this kind of rhetoric after electing Trump.  Clean up your own mess.
@alllibertynews @politico I don't endorse John Bolton 
However look at Egypt comparing to Iraq we export from them oil and food
I still believe your father @RonPaul is the RIGHT choice for Secretary of State! If only @realDonaldTrump agreed with me...
Bolton should be bolting when he sees big white vans, w Men in White. Mean tough, not tough.
@Norsu2 @politico Doesn't matter much, because I don't see Trump investing much power in the UN.
Who knows... Trump "I'm a big fan of the United Nations and all it stands for" http://www.c-span.org/video/?187762-1/united-nations-headquarters-renovation …
Who knows?
@alllibertynews @politico agreed
@alllibertynews @politico "Let's just bang on it" - said the hammer.
@alllibertynews @politico John Bolton is a douche
Agree. Regime change doesn't work and we need to stop trying to do it.
Sen  Paul, who  do you  believe is the best person for Sec of State? Your opinion would be a welcomed change to the pundits.
@alllibertynews @politico we need to keep our goddamn noses out of others business
great choise for donald trump
#StandWithRand trust him America..
@ngjarhead @politico Why don't you give Corker a hug!!!!
It worked great with Germany, Japan, and Italy.
if regime change in Iran is not an option how is Romney's regime change in Syria via arming FSA an option? http://m.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2012/1010/Mitt-Romney-wants-to-arm-Syrian-rebels-What-are-the-risks …
Sen @RandPaul don't see why you would oppose Giuliani as SOS, while support Romney who would bring us into direct confrontation with Russia.
Bolton has it right in my opinion. Give him a chance please.
@alllibertynews, so true @RandPaul
would that be Ayatollah Obama & Ayatollah Clinton & Ayatollah Netenyahu? or the one doing our dirty work in Mosul as we tweet?
Wish you were POTUS
War monger just like the rest... Support the Military Industrial Complex and the cost for profits are death of soldiers.
GET EM RANDY
ya boy about to handbag the Baltics to Russia. http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN13F140 …
@AJDelgado13 @politico #Bolton misspoke or was misquoted- he meant #Cuba
@veganvecoh @politico 
Sorry, regime changing other countries is not America's job. Mind your own country.
@veganvecoh @politico Call up Trump Rand! I support you. Get into Trumps ear. You should apply for the job. Come on!
@veganvecoh @politico 

Agree.....also need: Rand Paul to be in charge of auditing the Fed Reserve
@AJDelgado13 @politico in other words, stop hassling UR new Prez & get out of the way.
@AJDelgado13 @politico Bolton brilliant guy.U &UR dad both rejected.Go back to senate,do a good job &stop vying for Nat attention
Senator, I supported your election in 2010 and 2016. When Republican Party has to be united now why don't you stop to be negative?
@AJDelgado13 @politico DT will make his choice known, you have no say in the matter.
@AJDelgado13 @politico Utterly stupid nonsense. There's no principle making "regime change" always good or always bad.
I agree with #RandPaul. Bolton is a #NeoconDisaster. He is part of the #PNAC conspirators who want constant war.
Rand Paul is right.  American "regime changes" have caused more problems than they have solved.
Why, Why, Why neocon like Bolton,,,Rino & weasel  Romney,,pls someone explain to me....
@AJDelgado13 @politico Bolton Weasley  his way out of the Vietnam War but has no problem sending other people to war.
@AJDelgado13 @politico I would prefer Mitt for that post
@AJDelgado13 @politico let Dr. @RonPaul  do it!!!!! Come on @realDonaldTrump HEAR US!!
@AJDelgado13 @politico you think they would learn that after the failures of Iraq and Libya
Thank you Senator. I agree.
@alllibertynews know what "isolationist even means.
@alllibertynews Morons throw that "isolationist" term around to attack anyone against free trade or imperialism. They don't even..
How would a Pres Paul deal w/a nuclear Iran, the influence of Iran w/in Iraq & other Middle East nations?
@mariannecope @politico agree. "regime change" has to be initiated by the people of the country
Irak, Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and the endless "revolution" in Syria are too many history lessons to ignore
Can't believe i agree with rand Paul. Haha he is right Bolton is a menace
let us know what you think of the sessions appointment. Maybe he's there because of immigration but he has some other views 2
We must support regime change in Iran, but not by Bolton, Giuliani or anyone supporting the terrorist group PMOI.
I love you @RandPaul and agree with you on Bolton. However, as a Persian I strongly blv we need regime change in Iran, not by Bolton.
Iran is a rogue state and nobody knows what it will do
After 38 years close encounter with Islam the reality of Iran is much different from other Islamic countries.
What must worry about Iran is it can hide its intentions very well
If that is ur only concern, then Bolton is OK.
Regime change (stalin, pol pot, ceacescu, franco, burmese junta...) works
John Bolton had his chance in the Bush administration and failed America miserably.
Sen. Rand Paul is an asset to America,must be included into MAGA Administration.
regime change is what brought us the ayatollah.  Regime change isn't installing a puppet government.
"It would take 2 or 3 GOP defectors to block some of #Trump's extremist cabinet picks. @RandPaul is one."
- @Old_Bern_Kenobi
We need more...
Amen, but why is Corker any less scary? https://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/07/patrick-j-buchanan/republicans-are-despicable/ …
the people of Iran have the right to choose their own leaders without interference from our CIA, STOP THE USELESS WARS
The number of court filings against Trump cost him his credibility, he should be held accountable.
Her we go again, meddling ion other people business, when will theses folks learn that wars cost our children their lives. .
.@RandPaul agree wholeheartedly with you, Senator! @TheDemocrats
@djbeatty1 @politico He is too reactionary
The USA needs to clean up their own back yard and get out of the bus of regime change. syria egypt iraq didn't go well.
@DustinGrage @politico Sorry YOU are wrong! Bolton is perfect!
regime change will never work because the out of power party will always be against for the sake of votes.
@alllibertynews @politico his answer to EVERTHING.
Regime change CAN work, but if you half-ass it or try to do it on the cheap, you get what you deserve.
Right, which is why Tojo, Hitler, the Taliban, and Saddam Hussein are still in power.
Regime change is the ONLY option. If you like those kidnappers please go and live in Tehran.
if you don't shut up, you will find yourself out of a job.
@mvbcdo @politico so was trump. Hence, we have to have this Bolton discussion.
"What difference does it make"
Question is What difference does it make to you.
#TrumpProtest #Killery
@JasonFQuick @politico Fuck not him
I hope mr trump picks you to be on his cabinet. I personally believe you would make an excellent sos. Keep up the good work
@alllibertynews @The_Tugboat69 @RandPaul libertarian philosophy is respect and people learning to talk things out... Nut jobs!
Really appreciate your thoughtful comments about the role of the SoS. Funny how only the #CorruptMedia is pushing Bolton.
I wonder about the Rudt rejection. Corker is as no go as Bolton.
So handing them $1.6 Bn was a better solution? Stick to being silent and maybe you'll learn something.
We'll see who he actually puts forth but in the end we expect u to represent us and what we want. Don't decide on you on
It sounds to me like you Senator Paul, may be blinded by your own light!
Opposition to Bolton vs  your like for Corker??
uh yeah.....   i think @realDonaldTrump influenced the Ford deal
Rand Paul's foreign policy equals the new code pink.
I was prepared to be disappointed & angry when Eric Bolling introduced u with your positions on Bolton, et al, but NO. Thank you.
rand paul was trounced for a reason
Fu€k rand paul!
almost as wrong as his choice of facial hair
Mr. Bolton instead of change let's just buy it. It would be cheaper.
What does work? Oreos?
Regime change in the direction of libertarianism IS the answer. Instead, USA likes to promote evil democracy & welfare statism.
stand down poncho. Are you a politition 1st or an American 1st? Don't be mad b/c you couldn't close the deal.
If anyone hasn't supported someone it's DJT Rands always stood alone they fear his intelligence don't hate appreciateGB
Senator, we're going to need you to protect our first amendment as well. Please maintain our freedoms.
It hasn't n no we don't need anyone from the UN nope.. #StandWithRand
know what does work is non-interventionism. Good for you Dr. Paul!
Sen Corker would be a fine choice for Sec of State; but so would #JohnBolton who understands the Iran regime as well as anybody.
The #IranDealAtAnyCost was not only a Kerry/Obama failure, it will prove to be a catastrophic failure for America & entire world!
Other than war there are other methods of regime change. USSR regime was changed by Reagan et al withouit war. Not zero sum game.
Regime change worked in WWII.  Please re-consider ur supprt of Corker over Bolton for Sec of State. Iraq was won, then lost by BO.
@wisdomfromage @politico I agree.
its not your choice Paul u dropped out remember
We always support the wrong person.
back off! You and the Democrats obviously haven't learned a thing!
@shupe_laura @politico Some people never FUCKING GET IT
Will you vote against Pompeo confirmation?
I agree he is looking zombie like.
Trump appointing a hawk like Bolton would switch me from "He's better than Hillary, give him a chance" to "AW HELLZ NO!" instantly
NeoCon, No!
hopefully @realDonaldTrump will listen to you.  I think he will.
He's out of his f'cking mind - He and his can't fight Zionism's wars - not one more drop of Goyishe blood for Israel
agree with you we have screwed up the Middle East
Honestly, I wouldn't take your word on anything.
Bolton is part of the group I thought #DrainTheSwamp would get. Out with this old cronyism. Come on #Trump don't waste my vote.
YOU ARE SO RIGHT!
Speaking of learning from history, do we have your vow that you'll vote against Sessions and Pomeo? Silence is troubling
@RandPaulFlorida @politico keep all of the PNAC neocons out of this administration.
In 2009,may have been serious change in Iran from their people. Was crushed partly due to Obama's silence.Off base senator #NO
no Earmarks restored or the same thing will happen in mid terms
but it's none of our business which country wants which regime in charge....
Regime change in Iran is how we got into the mess we have there in the first place. You tell them, Senator.
Kinda hard to get along with a government that thinks we are "the great Satan" & sponsors terrorism world wide.
@capreble @politico He's got such a neocon stache. #chickenhawk
regime change does work...when the regime is in a country that seeks change to common values.  See WWII.
Dr. Rand we thought this is what you advocated:
unless the people in Iran want it and do it.
Thanks for being the voice of reason
.@RandPaul @politico absolute wrong choice. He should be doing penance for the rest of his life for the Iraq debacle. #FridayFeeling
even if it comes with no lost of life and little cost? Looking for the midway point in opinions.
I agree.  We are very much counting on your voice in these matters.
you are right regime change don't work.Bolton want to make war companies rich.
@MarkHalperin @realDonaldTrump @morningmika http://www.thebrodcastbooth.com/donald-trump-kowtowing-heinous-neoconservative/ …
John Bolton is definitely the wrong choice for America. He has been wrong in every policy decision he has ever made.
NEW FACES WOULD BE NICE
When will @RandPaul gather forces against evil & #WarProfiteering ?
