NRA MONEY BAYBEEEEE!
Do something besides pray
Ever get tired of being divisive during tragic events, perhaps try being civil
Divisive is not trying to lift a finger for smart gun safety measures and laws.
You'll only ever know how to argue politics, typically people have a moment of grieving before starting political discussions.
Sure you had no problem with talks of a Muslim ban 15 minutes after San Bernadino shooters were identified.
You need to do something. Prayer is clearly not enough.
Ban assault weapons. License guns.
We don't need your prayers. We need legislation. Do something or step out of the way so others can!
Congratulations! One of the top earners from the NRA in 2016. Bought and paid for. Now, about that silencer bill...
If, as you were praying for the Vegas shooting victims, you were handed this picture of two 15 year old Kentuckians and told they’d be gunned down at their high school on a Tuesday morning - would you have been inspired to take any action? Or just praying and taking NRA $?
What action could he have taken to stop this crime from happening?
Since you took NRA money their blood is on your hands #NRAComplicity
Do something.  We need gun control. People don't need military style guns or ability to make.  Do the right thing.
you are responsible for these deaths. Give the NRA money back. Act like you care.
HOW about doing something about automatic weapons, Senator @RandPaul? How about PREVENTING these types of slaughters with a VOTE? #NRAdeaths
Thoughts and prayers mean absolutely nothing anymore. DO SOMETHING!
Oligarchs allow thoughts & prayers so that's easy. Profits >people & keeping corporate investors ("donors") happy is easy too w/ campaign .
save yr worthless prayers...why don't u and kelley return the $10K u got from the NRA?
you took cold hard cash from the NRA. This is your fault.
So politicians that took money from big pharmaceutical companies are to blame for high medical costs? Dems took tons. Sound logic
good job, you're totally correct! Politics is a facade for the rich to run away with more money.
You have blood on your hands.  You took $9900 from the NRA.  You're bought and paid for by the NRA.  Save your condolences.
I can see by comments that the #NRA propaganda thats been going around for all 50 yrs of my life about  #GunControl have done it's damage
why don't you donate the $10,000 in NRA money you took to the victims who need medical care?
Your thoughts &prayers &Mien Kampf Trump throwing paper towels is as useless as all you Repugs put togather!Total Disgrace!&Sick!

What ever !!!! 
You don't care about the victims. You do nothing to prevent this. Do your job, protect Americans with gun control laws. Stop NRA donations!
You could also send the $9,900 you got from the NRA. @RandPaul
Blah fucking blah. Go snuggle up to your NRA donors. American Carnage indeed.
Quit taking NRA money......2 children in KY and 17 in Florida when do you say ENOUGH ~ #STOPtheKilling
#NoMoreThoughtsAndPrayers It's time to have that uncomfortable national discussion now, Senator. You can help stop the next one.
How dare you. You took $9900 from the NRA for your 2016 campaign. Shame on you. Keep your prayers. Pack your bags. I live in KY and I vote.
Lady, for the love of God I hope you rally as many people as humanly possible and vote this bastard out!
Thanks for your support. Kentucky has had enough. #banrand #ditchmitch
I hope so...the rest of us are counting on you guys.
Ur prayers aren't enough.  Do something about the bump stock & how can someone have that many guns & ammo.  Insane

Counting your blood money from the NRA?
Prayers and condolences aren't now, and never have been enough. It is time for responsible #GunContolNow
Their blood is in YOUR HANDS. Z
Your thoughts and prayers are worthless unless you take actions on serious gun legislation!
Your prayers? If you gave a shit about those folks, your thoughts would be with gun control, not accepting money from the NRA.
hypocrit
You took money from the NRA so your prayers are hypocritical. DO something - vote AGAINST S. 446 #VegasStrong #SandyHook
They don't need your love but your action on some common sense. A knife or a car wouldn't do that kind of damage in 15 minutes.lots of PTSD
Do more than pray. Make a difference by refusing to accept money from the NRA. #guncontrolnow
Yes, that sure was some tragic news, but your "prayers and deepest condolences" are just bullshit, as you accepted $9,900 from the NRA.
How bout you do something besides pray.
Stopped sending prayer and thought do something about it. Prayer is vague but actions are better
if all u do is pray & take donations, maybe it's time to do us all a favor & leave politics for the priesthood. #ResistTheNRA
#ThoughtsandPrayers r NOT ENUFF, you hypocrite. U took $10k from #NRA in 2016. This #domesticterrorist's act IS ON U. #GunControlNow #WeSeeU
Condolences? Shame on you @RandPaul You took $9,900 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
They don't want your prayers. They want you to stop making automatic weapons available to killers.
Guns cost Americans $2.8 billion per year in hospital care to treat wounds http://bit.ly/2fHdJKi  
you took as much an NRA money as you could get... blood money
empty empty words from a hypocrite who takes money from the NRA. Just disgusting
what are you going to do to end mead shootings?
NRA 2016 contributions:
Paul, Rand (R-KY)Senate$9,900
$9,900 from the @NRA you spineless 
their blood is on your hands for TAKING NEARLY 10K in NRA contributions. SHAME SHAME SHAME!
Your prayers mean nothing while you continue to take NRA money. #emptythoughtsfullpockets
how can U say this when U take $$$from NRA. Stand up to them for US!
Did the NRA pay you in 9,900 singles or a mixture of $10s and $5s, or is it strictly part-check and part-cash? How does that work exactly?
Hope you're enjoying that blood $ from the domestic terrorist org, the NRA. They advocate further death - silencers, armor piercing ammo.
send that NRA 10k to one of the victims
Time 4 congress 2 make a NRA return box.And every candidate that took money just drop a check there for every dollar they received from them
thoughts and prayers in a tweet, that's gonna help! Do something GOD would be proud of, maybe that will save you from helll.
bullshit. Stop taking money from the NRA, put through a bill that restricts purchases of automatic weaponry, then I'll believe you
if you took the amount of $ you got from the NRA and divided by the amount of people dead in Vegas it equals about $167 a person
Politicizing this immediately makes me sick!Think it's time to look into the ones that are on the gun grab train!
not a Mention of gun control.  Is another 10k from the NRA really that important to your rich ass?
work on true gun control legislation, tell the @NRA your vote and conscience cannot be bought #PrayForVegas
maybe you could donate the $9900 you received from the NRA to the survivors ---- MAKE CHANGES TO SAVE LIVES
Please do something about the neverending gun violence in our country. We can't take it anymore.
And you will of course not be swayed by the $9,900 you took from the NRA
This PSA provided by the $9900 paid you by the NRA in 2016. Blood is on ur hands.
Taking money from the NRA does not change the laws to prevent this! Stand up to the most powerful lobby in this country and say no!

$9,990 $9,990 $9,900 $9,990 $9,990 $9,900 $9,990 $9,990 $9,900 $9,990 $9,990 $9,900 $9,990 $9,990 $9,900 $9,990 $9,990 $9,900
Hmmmmm....you feel bad but not bad enough to return the money you took from the NRA??? Why don’t you pray about it before your trip to hell.
You received $9,900 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle. No more thoughts and prayers - legislate gun control!

There not going to do anything. why  thirty pies of silver
Somebody needs to put a cap in this tweet.
Just using the good doctor's preferred language.  My senator is so fucking funny.
I didn't run to put a cap ON Obamacare, I ran to put a cap IN Obamacare #killObamaCare #nofakerepeal https://twitter.com/thisweekabc/status/911975453531000833 …
This is on you
Jesus says don't follow other channels if teaching or PROPHECY but this His very own channel.
you have blood on your hands, Senator.  Donate the money you took from the NRA to the victims of this heinous crime if you care so much
Tragic that you and other congressmen continue to take money from the NRA who promote the type of behavior we saw today in Las Vegas
Ur prayers & condolences are irrelevant.U took $990 from NRA & are responsible 4 this tragedy. STOP ACCEPTING NRA FUNDS NOW! Pass gun laws.
Your prayers mean absolutely nothing. Zero. They not only ring hollow. They are insulting. Give your NRA money back and I’ll listen to you.
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul received $9,900 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
tragic news that makes you complicit, since you received money from the NRA. People in Vegas have no use for your prayers
Will you be returning that 9k to the NRA? #Hypocrite
nobody needs 40 guns!!!! NOBODY NEEDS semi automatic weapon that can be converted to an automatic!
The NRA owns you
Condolences and prayers are the extent of your "help" to reduce these tragedies.  You continue to suck off the NRA teat, you shill!
Stop prostituting yourself out for NRA money instead of tweeting worthless condolences
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul received $9,900 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Senator, you received nearly $10,000 from the NRA.

You are complicit.
How much did the NRA donate to your campaign? #BloodOnYourHands
I'm praying you grow a spine to start taking ACTION to stop these incidents and not just plying honeyed words after each tragedy #Hypocrite
kind words. Better would be sending the NRA it's $9,900 you accepted in 2016 election cycle. We need action.
may you please also send the NRA their money back. or better yet donate it to save lives. thank you.
Someone needs to put a bug in the FB I ‘s ears since they can’t find a motive . Isis related .
Pray all you like, but we'll continue to see massive gun violence in this country until people like you decide to take action.
Prayers: because actually doing something is hard, and would piss off the NRA. And they paid you off long ago.
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul received $9,900 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Prayers r hollow devices. Banning guns is what we need.


Either give the cash you happily grabbed from @NRA to victims and enact smart gun control laws or stop insulting us with your fake concern.
keep your prayers, change the gun laws.
HOW DO YOU SLEEP @ NIGHT ???
This blood is on YOUR HANDS
Funny, I thought your prayers were for the $9,900 you took from the NRA in the last election cycle #NRATOOL
Why don't you send back the money you got from the NRA?
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul received $9,900 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Your condolences are hollow. You are bought by the NRA and blood is on your corrupt hands.
Do your bloody hands affect your marriage?
$9,900 from NRA. #policynotprayers
I think he is more focused on promoting sane people
So the @NRA cheque never bounced though.
Stop accepting NRA money and then we will believe you

"prayers & condolences" are useless. Stop taken money from NRA & take action!
Whole lot of good those do. Maybe give the @nra the money they paid you back?
Your in a position to stop this kind of violence.
Stop taking money from the NRA and we will believe you
Then return your blood money to the NRA. You are complicit through your inaction.
Be honest, the only thing you're praying for is more of that devil money from the NRA.
Will you send back the money the nra gave you to make sure this will keep happening?
Will any of the $9,900 you took from the NRA in the 2016 election cycle help the families of the victims Senator?
You care about those lives taken exactly $167 each. That's how much the #NRA has paid you.
Oh, shut up or give back the $9900.
stop silencers and automatic weapons, your prayers mean nothing without action.
. How about sending a bill to the floor to help prevent these in the future,  in addition to your condolences?
Stop praying & stop taking NRA money. DO something! Enact and enforce gun laws to curtail the large scale loss of life. #GunContolNow
Dont avcept money from the nra
Prayers but no thoughts? Don't you know the script?
Keep your BS "thoughts and prayers" and start legislating for gun control.  Quit taking $ from the dirty NRA!
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
is this tragic enough that you'll stop taking blood money from the NRA?
take the $9,900 received from the NRA and donate to @RedCross #bloodmoney
