Thank you Sen Paul for working to repeal #FATCA! Please also help restore US to residence based taxation.
Senator @RandPaul, what are you doing to convince Trump (who doesn't want to work wknds) to go to Camp David instead of FL?
Thank you for fighting to restore the rights @IRSnews and @SenatorShaheen stripped from me!! #FATCA #WaAreInnocent

@realDonaldTrump Please follow through and end FATCA.  I have personally been forced to close my account @RBC due to this law
McCain voted w/ Dems for 2010 H.I.R.E. Act creating the FATCA nightmare tax regulation #azsen #azright #azgop #draintheswamp

I stand with you on the issue of the IRS being out of control.

Thank you!

You are sounding and acting like your dad.  Ahhh.....the memories.
