@RandPaul  that's awesome!! And so fitting.  Senator, you ROCK!! thanks for all you do
@funtrouble1 I would love to see him at the bottom of the ticket... unless Condeleeza would answer the call...
@WordsMeanThingz ha yeah he would be awesome but so would she
@funtrouble1 She is definitely overqualified. As a Libertarian, he could bring in a lot of the disenfranchised Bernie voters.
@WordsMeanThingz I couldn't agree more if I tried. They are both great..but we need some of the left to really give us a boost
@funtrouble1 I think Trump can capture some traditional dems - union members mostly - who the dem party has taken for granted.
@WordsMeanThingz yes I agree and I'm glad I'm not the only one who sees that. The unions are annoyed with the left
@funtrouble1 Dems have abandoned their traditional base in favor of moonbats. The base just pulls the "D" lever cuz that's all they know.
@RandPaul you do not get to use a unicorn to forward your political agenda.
@Justineplays @RandPaul in spite of you little can't do anything on your own liberals, we are will forever be a free nation. So he gone
@funtrouble1 @Justineplays @RandPaul WTF are you talking about @funtrouble1? Your tweet makes no sense.
@Sub_JB @Justineplays @RandPaul how is that so hard to understand? Can't read?
@funtrouble1 @Sub_JB @Justineplays @RandPaul no like it makes no sense at all
@ReynoldsTime07 @Sub_JB @Justineplays @RandPaul well not to you guys sure..but logic never does. It's why you vote Sanders or killery.
@funtrouble1 @Sub_JB @Justineplays @RandPaul I'm not voting
@ReynoldsTime07 @Sub_JB @Justineplays @RandPaul shocker and thank you
@RandPaul Free for the underdogs* 
People like your billionaire friends are definitely not getting anything free, though.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Thank you, Sir, for voicing conservative ideas.
@RandPaul you were probably the best republican running. We respected you. But People didn't appreciate your programs & you had to drop out!
@WorldForBernie @RandPaul that's false.
@RandPaul @CROD026
@RandPaul Funny, we have all that in Scotland and the unicorn is our national animal. Tit!
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @SooperMexican @mitchellvii @RealAlexJones @BernieSanders @amrightnow @LindaSuhler @PoliticalLaughs
@RandPaul That would be Scotland!  Thanks for including our national animal in the picture too!
: edjumacation quality already low; that would accelerate the rot @alllibertynews
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Cite the reason WHY it's a bad idea! Because government money gets swallowed up by beaucracy that always takes $$.
@RandPaul  if bernie doesn't win im voting for santa!
is that like the FREE slave labor but refusal to FREE the PEOPLE of the U.S. & give us LIBERTY & JUSTICE FOR ALL in This Country . .
@freedomtex somebody is paying for it, eventually you find out YOU are.
@RandPaul weren't you the guy that couldn't make it out of Iowa? Oh yeah you were. #loser
@RandPaul Come to Scotland.... we have all of these things. AND the Unicorn is our national animal.
@RandPaul Take a look at Scotland! They have all that and Unicorns!
Not Fair I understand Free is not FREE Business Negotiations 4 our Nation now is key & ripe.
Funny that, seeing as other developed countries can afford to look after its people.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews trump 
@RandPaul @alllibertynews
@RandPaul you heard of scotland?
.@RandPaul so much butt hurt in the comments lol

Ask Me Now!!!! DO YOU GUYS WANT FREE JERSEYS #giveaway #vote #win #freestuff
@RandPaul god the disappointment your father must feel towards you.
@LauraTiz @RandPaul Uh Oh. A butthurt Bernie-fan. Who would of thought mocking his nonsense would upset you guys :-(  #TruthHurts
@GotchYaSon @RandPaul not butt hurt. Informed: http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/03/01/ron-paul-elections-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-nr.cnn …
@RandPaul 
So apparently every other industrial country has unicorns.
@RandPaul ...@BernieSanders is Santa Claus, promising gifts that the parents pay for.
@RandPaul love you man, but it would appear Bernie is still in the race.
@RandPaul They're also as real as your presidential run
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Don't doubt it's doable. Just doubt if everyone agrees.
@RandPaul works fine for Scotland...
@RandPaul @justinamash investing in education and health of young people. yeah what a terrible idea. more wars please.
@RandPaul we all want "free" stuff. You just want free bombs and corporate bailouts. We want free shit the country actually needs
@Derigitable @alllibertynews @RandPaul 
But his feelings are hurt!
@RandPaul @alllibertynews @realDonaldTrump @LindaSuhler As real as our votes counting in the Republican primaries
@RandPaul @alllibertynews just like the "freedom" you espouse #WakeUp #FreeForWhom #AllocateTaxesProperly
@RandPaul: You got that right! KY's blessed to have a man of your caliber in office, Dr Paul.
@RandPaul @justinamash This can be a huge gift, not for the people, rather for the corporations who would not have to pay that part of wage
@RandPaul  Good morning, here to share the wealth, Its free people ****Paypal Verified**** http://ftr.io/r/GNGBUX91 
@RandPaul And free unicorn rides ....
@RandPaul
@RandPaul @TheLetahlp we do need child care assistance. kids are the future soldiers, thats something real. but yeah bernie a riot.
@RandPaul if you knew anything about policy (or, in this case how to read I'm assuming) you wouldn't make such ignorant statements
@BigAdkins You actually have the audacity to talk shit about commonsense and intelligence to @RandPaul who happens to be a Doctor?
@warpathsaint @RandPaul George Bush graduated from Harvard, I wouldn't call him intelligent
@RandPaul well I've actually seen a couple unicorns in Europe....
@RandPaul @Bhill3308 rand paul 
@RandPaul @Findaddy81 Many countries have free education programs... they just make the rich pay their fair share to pay for it.
@RandPaul lol shots fired
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Thanks to Republicans we have socialism for the rich and debt slavery for college grads.  http://www.ibtimes.com/panama-papers-corporations-shifted-half-trillion-dollars-offshore-tax-havens-2012-2351814 …
@RandPaul I feel you might be missing the point.
@RandPaul @amanduhbassett @AliGoldber97 this sounds like our video
@katiecollins143 @RandPaul @amanduhbassett this is literally exactly how I pictured bern when we were talking about it hahahha
@RandPaul so what you're trying to say Is that Unicorns only exist in Europe?
@RandPaul EPIC!!
@RandPaul part time republican, full time savage
@RandPaul @AmericnElephant Rand, lol
@RandPaul RAND PAUL YOURE AN ABSOLUTE SAVAGE
@RandPaul @Urboy_andyb @NickAguila @richiepaglia

@RandPaul God bless you Rand
@RandPaul @_aspease7 this tweet is the goat
@RandPaul part time politician, full time savage
@RandPaul at least Bernie Sanders is still in the race XD
@RandPaul Savage
@RandPaul it's as real as you winning the presidency!
@RandPaul I saw this on ifunny and this is real.. You're my hero now 
@RandPaul Just so you know, your tweet made it in the featured of the comedy app @iFunny
@RandPaul They're as real as your chance at being president.
@RandPaul @brynnifer171 show Mitchell this
@RandPaul tax payers
@RandPaul Someone said Espana dreams are wonderful, but forgot to say that nightmares are also dreams .. careful what you deams.
@RandPaul full time savage
@RandPaul and I thought @realDonaldTrump was savage 
@RandPaul #FreeDumb
.@RandPaul  at least you know why your are not a presidential candidate.  Immaturity on Twitter is not president of the U.S. Material.
@RandPaul amen
@RandPaul "Free" college, healthcare, and daycare combined are much cheaper than the War in Iraq. If we can afford 1, why not the other?
@RandPaul I am getting free healthcare... So...
@RandPaul Hahaha. Give it 4 years and run again, Rand. Next time come out swinging, taking names. #randpaul2020
@RandPaul "Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose" ~ Janis Joplin #BernieBernOuts.
Apparently it's #NationalUnicornDay. They're as real as "free" government programs. 
@RandPaul @kaiyybee I Wonder if La La Land is having an upcoming election soon, he's their man
@RandPaul @karmasupra16 you seriously posted a meme and anyone is supposed to take you seriously?
@RandPaul 2020
So, instead of joining more civilized countries, better to keep the populace meek and in debt.

Gotcha.

@RandPaul @AfroXero843
@Pawkeshup  more civilized countries like which ones
Canada. Great Britain. France. Sweden.Germany. Netherlands. Norway.

Gee, a LOT of the world has health care free...
@AfroXero843
Yet, USA turns your health into a profit, and drains every penny they can from those who can least afford it.
@AfroXero843
Yup, no issue literally holding your life hostage to earn a living. No issue at all......
@AfroXero843
@Pawkeshup It is illegal for a hospital to not care for a patient in the US try to use logic before spouting BS...
It's illegal you say? Well gee, let me just go over and get free treatment! Oh wait, they still charge!
@AfroXero843
@Pawkeshup as i already stated of course it cost cuz doctors ain't free and hospitals don't like to be sued
@RandPaul SHEEPLE just doing what they do when FREE is offered...
@RandPaul Thank you Rand! #StopSanders
@RandPaul @HaydnRogers lmao Rog cmon. call me if you would like to talk about this
@RandPaul @jackhunter74 should be riding Starlight Glimmer and not Rarity
@RandPaul @Noah_Brunson You say that when all your Red States take more money from the government than they give back.
@BenCofield1 @RandPaul >implies I'm a Republican. >implies I support any form of government
@Noah_Brunson @RandPaul you are closer to Republican than anything else. You hate government programs as much as any other Republican.
@RandPaul I'm sure someone said the same thing about K - 12 a couple hundred years ago
@RandPaul need to stamp out free school too! its terrible people can learn without paying for the privilege.
@RandPaul @irootsorg yes, next thing you know Bernie will be giving us all a free Squatty Potty!  Mr. unicorn.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Why Bernie Supporters Should Vote Donald Trump https://youtu.be/DsjpkyWzjgA 
@RandPaul @damon_thayer better be careful not to cross Ken Hamm, Answers In Genesis
@RandPaul @damon_thayer " To think of the biblical unicorn as a fantasy animal is to demean God’s Word which is true in every detail." AIG
@RandPaul I wish you were still running for president
@RandPaul Sanders is a looter. He raises taxes on rich and poor, destroys the economy, blames free markets. Grim.
@planetaryjim @alllibertynews @RandPaul And gives everyone free healthcare. Lowers cost as he attacks Big Pharma.
@jperotti2 @alllibertynews @RandPaul I have seen no lower costs. TANSTAAFL. Someone always pays. Sanders will plough people under.
@planetaryjim @alllibertynews @RandPaul That is because your eyes are closed not to mention so is your mind.
@jperotti2 @alllibertynews @RandPaul I have lived in fully socialist countries, and seen the mass graves. Have you?
@planetaryjim @alllibertynews @RandPaul I didn't have to leave the U.S. To see mass graves.
“@RandPaul: Apparently it's #NationalUnicornDay. They're as real as "free" government programs. ”
.@RandPaul Why don't unicorns get mentioned when wealthy and large corporations go tax free, and oil companies get huge subsidies? #tcot
@RandPaul we spend hundreds of millions in foreign aid before we take care of home... what about the care of our vets? Try that first
@RandPaul Trump/Cruz ticket only ticket to take down nuts like Hillary/Bern's..Cruz nor Trump can do it alone.TRUMP/CRUZ #NEVERCONVENTION
@RandPaul @justinamash I wonder if you realize how many Bernie fans voted for your father to become President. Hint: lots of us.
@RandPaul 
Lol holy crap, I didnt know this was Rand's real profile. I posted the same pic before seeing this. Keep up the good work Rand.
@RandPaul You know what is going to happen at the end... I am saving this post for you to remember it later...
@RandPaul correction:free *tuition @ public colleges&universities Gosh Rand-you're  starting 2 sound like HRC-not a complement! #FeelTheBern
@RandPaul @justinamash is that like the free tax breaks large corporations get?  And every one knows they aren't free, but tax payer funded.
@JasonMcCorkel
Subsidies and special (targeted) tax breaks are identical from an economic standpoint. Let me explain why. => https://www.facebook.com/justinamash/posts/10153740170803866 …
@justinamash @JasonMcCorkel corporations don't pay taxes people who buy from then do
@RandPaul I see they pulled the $15 an hour min wage and parental leave off the meme...
.@RandPaul Yep. And one day they'll be able to fit into those skinny jeans.  #NationalUnicornDay #Health4All
@RandPaul @JohnCzer1 Sad when young people have to go overseas to get their degrees. http://www.scholars4dev.com/4031/list-of-european-countries-with-tuition-freelow-tuition-universities-colleges/ …
@RandPaul @JohnCzer1 This is nothing but propaganda. Other countries have it and physicians here want it. http://www.pnhp.org/ 
@RandPaul I have a free college plan where those that opt in pay an additional tax for life
@RandPaul cotton candy
@RandPaul @justinamash I got a free jetpack, an Xbox gold membership, and FREE Nicoderm with my social assistance. Socialism is rad as fuck!
@RandPaul @justinamash Fact: low information memes are the demise of the American political system.
@jimkey123 @RandPaul @justinamash A point you've got there, & it is pretty close. People think 'the news' is what happens on talk-TV shows
@RandPaul why doesn't anyone ask how do we achieve this free stuff initiative?  I guess the job creators will, while the free loaders take.
@RandPaul topkek
@RandPaul libertarianism is astrology for men
@RandPaul or free college education1
@RandPaul  @kyle_kremer
@RandPaul
@RandPaul Only $206 a week in extra taxes for a family of four making $80k... when "free" doesn't mean what you think it means.
@RandPaul well there are a bunch of free gov programs out there and it can be done with proper spending #unicorn is gov doing there job
@RandPaul why did you say this - his plan is solid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acZ-IkwnQ5s …

@RandPaul Or as real as Rand in the polls
@RandPaul @thetimewasthen  @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor Unless  you and your father wake up and support Mr Trump the GOP will be gone.
@alaimoa1981 @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor

@RandPaul @PizzaPartyBen what a GOAT
@RandPaul unicorns are real u know!! #LyinWithTed
@RandPaul @BernieSanders makes more sense than Rand.  That's why Rands out the race:
@RandPaul *accepts millions from donors and gets owned in the primary by the shittiest people on earth* get a load of this dreamer over here
@RandPaul true..and if unicorns are "free" why do silicon valley-types want billions to finance their unicorns?
@RandPaul Yea I know! It's not like citizens in other first world countries have these.

Idiot.
@RandPaul 
The libertarian worldview, reject socialism while accepting free college and Medicare after your husband dies.
@RandPaul Strange in this day and age to have your entire political identity be trolling, and yet fail so hard
@RandPaul  @Adam_Kral97
@RandPaul every time you tweet unique  words come out of you rhetorical fingers what are you a doctor of #idiocracy
@RandPaul
@RandPaul WHY hasn't REED been STOPPED??
@RandPaul hey Rand youre a miserable failure
Remember when you got annihilated by a screaming orange baboon, sleepy Ben Carson and the Zodiac Killer and dropped out? @RandPaul
@RandPaul this is comedy! Love it!!!
@RandPaul go get crushed in the primaries again
