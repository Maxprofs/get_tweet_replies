@FoxNews @RandPaul no, Cruz is way more conservative.
@FoxNews @RandPaul  Hes the only fiscal moron
@FoxNews @RandPaul I hope he used air quotes with that
@FoxNews @RandPaul nobody cares Paul. You're an egomaniac motivated by your own self interests. We all see it! Hence, 1%
@FoxNews @RandPaul Oh, and you could never win.
@FoxNews @RandPaul AND..... you STILL suck!  #BoycottFoxNews #BoycottFoxNewsDebate
@FoxNews @RandPaul also a loser
@FoxNews @RandPaul finally a candidate the  #KellyFile is qualified to question.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Douche
@FoxNews @RandPaul also a hypocrite berating trump for doing what you did last debate
@FoxNews @RandPaul with poodle hair.  What's with the GOP candidates and the goofy hair?
@FoxNews @RandPaul - People are to ignorant to understand a serious politician. They don't want to engage, just want ... Who knows?
@FoxNews @RandPaul   YES YOUR NUMBERS R GREAT 2. LOL
@FoxNews @RandPaul ledge in your own mind......
@FoxNews the uniqueness is that ur done. Not even a contender-very unique
@FoxNews @RandPaul no I think your hair is
@FoxNews @RandPaul Unique is accurate. I'd also go with floundering and pitiful. Time to pack it up
@FoxNews @RandPaul really the only fiscal idiot. Wait, that's not actually true. But gold, really? Why not seashells?
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump what does that even mean anymore?That's stuff doesn't fly in TRUMPland.  We are in different worlds!
@FoxNews @RandPaul also the most unlikable candidate
@FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump If only you could get in. That is the dilemma!
@FoxNews @RandPaul Rand I really like ya, but ur not the ONLY fiscal conserv. We DNT want 2 hear "I'm the only one". It's BS & it ain't cool
@FoxNews @RandPaul ..... You're the only weirdo
@FoxNews @RandPaul Laughable, u happy u got on stage by default?
@FoxNews @RandPaul Is there a machine that will combine Ron and Rand's DNA? That will be a dream come true!
@FoxNews @RandPaul true dat
@FoxNews @RandPaul rand you are a kook
@FoxNews @RandPaul and the only one voting to Rand Paul
@FoxNews @RandPaul we need a candidate who can win over independent voters. A full fledged fiscal conservative can't do that

@FoxNews @RandPaul Good for you #PartyInsider. How's that working for ya!?
@FoxNews @RandPaul you did not do a good job of implementing your views..largest debt ever..another joker

@FoxNews @RandPaul so fiscal conservative must mean unmedicated delusional isolationist??
@lilcarreras @FoxNews @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump LILIANA, YOUR SO BAD. LOVE IT WHEN YOU TAKE DIRTY. LOL
@FoxNews @RandPaul it will also be quickly forgotten.. Maybe you can investigate the FED.. That's your future I think
@foxnews @randpaul 25 years ago Donald Trump said this:
@FoxNews @RandPaul Rand made some great points. Rand has stood with Cruz on some issues in the senate.
@vancoes @FoxNews @RandPaul Rand and Cruz share a lot of similar views. Rand just wants the govt smaller than Cruz does.
@FoxNews Meghan Kelley has to interview Rand Paul, the low man on the totem pole, b/c Trump will not show up for debate!
@FoxNews @RandPaul your not going to win drop out . please
@FoxNews @RandPaul So Rand Paul boycotting the last debate worked out for him...back on the big stage and pre-debate Fox build up..
@FoxNews @RandPaul You need to freshen your msg. Heard it over & over & over & over
@FoxNews @RandPaul @megynkelly there are 2 x trending tonight in America; and both are the same smug smerk on your faces. #losersunite
@FoxNews @RandPaul @megynkelly hmmmm. Not skewering Rand for not going to last undercard debate?
@FoxNews @RandPaul You had me listening till saw your hash tag.
@FoxNews @RandPaul you're also a no show and don't deserve anyone's vote.
