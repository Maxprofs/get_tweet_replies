Don't worry hypocrite, they'll release it soon enough.. they're actually reading the bill before they pass it...
They don't have a bill. They're just discussing how to strip ppl of healthcare & blame it on Obama
You really don't understand the gravity of this, do you? No one cares about Obama.

Yea, that's not a valid rebuttal. But hey, ignorance is bliss.
Facts dont matter to you guys.
Who are "you guys?" Facts don't matter to politicians, regardless of affiliation.
Pass it to find out what is in it. Found another picture of you.
Nancy,  do you not remember that you said 'we have to pass the bill to know what's in it'?
- I think you may need to vote for the bill to find out what's in it. NP
or OBUMERS college papers and LA times video??!!!
Pelosi u were a child of privalage and know nothing of hard work if u r so concerned let us have your coverage
why   ? you never read the last one nancy.   this is all your fault
I actually agree with @NancyPelosi !! #LEThimIN
GOP need A LOT OF HELP! @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenOrrinHatch @SenTedCruz @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @Joenbc
@Melody_Va @RandPaul isn't part of your job to create bills and pass legislation? You constantly complain but what else?
"We need to pass this Bill to find out what's in it".
Great Shade!! @RandPaul Good luck with your colleagues!!
- Remember that time you said “we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it"?
are those your advisors on the leash?
Senator Paul you will never repeal the ACA. The majority will stop you.
@MrDane1982 @RandPaul indeed let's take back both the house and Senate and damage limitation under  @POTUS
this is comical!
May the LORD Protect Strenghten&Provide Wisdom To Do Your Job forALL Americans!Without Ego&Personal Agenda Guiding Decisions.
Cute joke but wish the two parties WOULD actually work together. All this division is demoralizing. Country first.
Good thing @alfranken can still write comedy.....
Argh
you need to retire or find a new medication.
Oh, how convenient, Nancy. You want the public to see this bill, but not the Obamacare bill until AFTER it was passed
good to know you'll pass it without reading it Nancy
that's actually funny.
@thepoliticalcat @RandPaul   While you 're at it can you get those tax returns so we can clear up Putingate?
I despise Pelosi but that funny
can't we just pass it, so we can see what's in there?
Poor @NancyPelosi always inappropriately laughing. yet he who laughs last laughs, best.  Thank you @RandPaul
Nancy it'll have to be PASSED first and THEN you can read it. I'm SURE you'll be ok with that, yes?
this is so good. #wheresthebill
Sorry @NancyPelosi not sure @RandPaul needs your help.  He likes to read bills before they are passed! #FullRepeal @SpeakerRyan
....he's following your philosophy....you have to pass it to see what's in it....
We need humor in these grim times. May the hounds be successful !!! Thanks.
don't you have to pass the bill first so you can see what's in it?
Haven't you heard? You have to sign the bill before you can know what's in the bill. Silly Nancy. @NancyPelosi @RandPaul
However, only ONE of you do so consistently. Remember this: We must, "Pass the bill to see what is in the bill?"
Come on Hounds find the health bill Ryans hidden, got to be somewhere  @RandPaul
No. nance must first pass it then read it.  Same as her suggestion before.  How 2 faced..lol..
The people would like to see it before it can be passed!!  Know our history so we dont make the same mistake #ACA
Priceless.  Thanks, I needed the laugh.  But don't divert focus for too long.  Sessions is the important weak link.
remember same question people were asking you during #Obamacare ? It's called "karma" Nancy. Learn abt karma...
Perfect!
That's rich.  From the lady who said Obamacare must be voted on before we could see what's inside?  #MAGA
NP has no credibility to say this. "Pass it to see what's in it" ring a bell? Rand is the man. Pelosi is a hypocrite!
Hey @NancyPelosi YOU helped create this mess now @SenRandPauI is fixing it. Best thing an old crow like you can do is stay out of his way
How DARE you, Ms. "We have to pass the bill so you can see what's in it."

if Obamacare was so great why are there 29 million people without healthcare?
this woman is a doofus.  She moved OBAMACARE and never read the damned thing. Wish one pup would bite her ass
Don't U want to pass it 1st so you can see what's in it? Of course we should see the bill, but your hypocrisy's repulsive!
really Ms "we have to pass it to find out what's in it"? @RandPaul is absolutely right, but YOUR hypocrisy knows no bounds
Nancy, you're the last person who should be asking for the bill... until it is passed, that is.
Its in the same locked room that YOU used. #repealobamacare

What's going on in this country is not funny. Leave the funny to the late night shows. PS #ImWithYou but please!
Where is your fellow Statesman from KY? 
I have come to admire you,sir, nut have SERIOUS questions for Mitch.
"We have to pass the bill to find out what's in it." I don't think you're one to being calling the Republicans out on this one.
you, the one who passed the ACA so we could see what was in the piece of crap! For ahame
Real funny from the woman who said we needed to pass Obamacare to see what it said. #recall #MAGA #drainTheSwamp
@resistthis2017 @RandPaul 
Bloodhounds might do the trick, checking on the bloodwork :) Donald pays.
really? can't make this up.  No shame no humility. @RandPaul is known for transperancy, you on the other hand are the opposite
LOL "We have to pass the bill so you can find out what's in it..."
LOL you are so weird @NancyPelosi
@MattWelch @RandPaul you want to 'strengthen the middle class and create jobs'? Unemploy yourself.
#WheresTheBill well, we have to pass it so we can find out what's in it.....

@allisonmuzik @RandPaul
Flashback: "we will find out what is in it when we pass it" WRONG then WRONG now
thanks for taxes I now owe 10000 that I cant pay.why not help for a change Im in Detroit, scary, right?
Beagles ! Beagles looking for a bill! RT @NancyPelosi: Just helping out @RandPaul. #ReleaseTheHounds #WheresTheBill
If u love America so much and women with a business, well you're another lying dem. I've lost all, thanks
another thing let the man bring jobs back to America. We don't get what you're up to. 
Ohhhh, money figures
Nancy- you're pathetic as usual. At least Rand wants to READ the Bill before its passed.
are you walking your dog?WISH I COULD WALK MY DOG. But I'm busy working for welfare folks are u?
this was funny also!
The least you could do is show the man some respect. You care more about politics than our soldiers who care for you!
You should be ashamed of yourself! Not standing up for the Widow of a Navy Seal who died fighting for you!
arent you still busy reading the last one you put out? #just putitoutandreaditlater
We should pass the Rep healthcare bill and find out what's in it! Don't  cha' think Nancy?
nope drafts of bills should be open to the public
Ryan abused his power & public funds by guarding an empty room. Lots of petulant scofflaw thuggery in GOP these days.
You nimrod, where'd you put it after you "passed it so you could see what was in it..."
They're hiding it in the one place Democrats will never look, under the Constitution.
God, I love it!
You can't find it because they haven't passed it. Isn't that the only way to find out what's in it Nancy???
Drag him.
https://youtu.be/LH2VYne6rSE 
Everyone knows your Asst posts your tweets. You can't even do that!
Oh, hi Nancy! Hi Chuck! Time for
kibbles and bits!!
Nancy's senile doesn't remember where she put it, just wait until election time Nancy
Pelosi u were the imbecile that wanted the freaking thing passed before it was read. Unamerican, not 4 the people
I think you should release the flying monkeys.
No you are not Nancy. Don't fall for it Rand, she wants to use you and your position.
Hahahahaha ...
Hounds are cuter (and smarter) than @NancyPelosi you're a waste of Tax Dollars. At least @RandPaul does his job.
Sshhhhhhhhh
Pelosi knows dirty tricks behind closed doors- SHE did same when Obamacare rammed down our throats-
Why the secrecy? @SpeakerRyan #PrivateRyan #WheresTheBill
You're the hound Pelosi
not a Pelosi fan, but that is funny.
My first reaction was, "And your little dog too..." Run Dorothy, run!
Please retract fangs NP you are commandeering a regular snakepit
We found it up Obama's ass. When we clear you, Schumer and the media out we will show it to you.
WHERE  IS THE BEEF? I mean... BILL?
does she really care about the bill? Wouldn't she rather pass it and then read it afterwards?
I have two more in Texas that would love to help you look.
not sure I would give rand paul my dogs name
maybe they are actually reading it
@MattWelch @RandPaul do the dogs read the bill before they find it?:)
you dont help people! Lol silly old bat
@maggiethepirate @RandPaul 
.@NancyPelosi @RandPaul Yeah, you're not helping.
Hey Nanc, have you tried Biotene for that dry mouth you have? Licking lips of disdain for jobs = major health issues.@RandPaul
20 bucks says it doesn't exist. Reality TV type stunt.
@NancyPelosi @RandPaul #ReleaseTheHounds #WheresTheBill
- We The People (remember us?) want to see it too!
don't associate yourself with this hag
you didn't complain about lynches secret meetings to protect your criminal friend Hillary. Vote Pelosi out
# you resign


Nancy wouldn't have any idea where the bill is, everybody knows she doesn't read bills.
Pelosi doesn't wanna pass it first so we can see what's in it? I guess old dogs can learn.
You took the words right out of my mouth!  (keyboard ) @NancyPelosi @RandPaul
don't worry. I'm sure President Bush can find it
@RandStudents @RandPaul  yeah!  We need to pass the replacement and then read it to find out what's in it!
you voted on Obamacare without reading it. Why the actual crap would we think you want to read it's replacement?
Hard to tell from this angle. Are you the one on the left or the right?
#FakenewsCNN #Trump #MeltingWaxFacedHag
Bring in Benedict Cumberbatch - this is a job for Sherlock Holmes!
doesn't want a fuckin leak from u grimey two faced slimey career politicians... #DrainTheSwamp Pelosi is the devil
Are you drunk....AGAIN? 
It would be ignorant to think they're going to strip people of healthcare? Get a grip!

Put my Beagle-Basset Maggie on the job. She'll find it
@pdacosta @RandPaul Uly will help...
don't see her as the "helping out" type
Filed under defeated ISIS, obv!
Nancy, stay out of it. You told us we couldn't read the Obamacare bill until it passed.
u could do better by resigning I'd love it
WE HAVE TO PASS IT BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT'S IN IT!  REMEMBER?  #HYPOCRITE  @NetworksManager @RandPaul
dude? Really @RandPaul ??? you're siding with Miss "have to pass it to see what's in it"?
Let it be known as the White Aged Legislators Destroying Obamacare (WALDO) Act.
Pelosi isn't a senator
