“Qualem blennum!”@ohsofarmygirl @RandPaul
@Geraldanthro @ohsofarmygirl @RandPaul Government has not served the people...regardless of Party. I'm an Independent. We need honesty.

Racist, bigot

  @JamesOtisJr2016 @ohsofarmygirl @RandPaul
@Geraldanthro @ohsofarmygirl @RandPaul The debt & taxation without representation will make us a 3rd world nation soon. We are in trouble.
@JamesOtisJr2016 @Geraldanthro @RandPaul What did you think of Rand's tax plan and plan to balance the budget in 4 or 7-8 years?
@ohsofarmygirl @RandPaul I liked Rand's plan. But I'll never understand why Ron or Rand Paul didn't call for removal of SS Income Tax Cap.
@RandPaul How come no-one complained when GW Bush amassed so much power for the office but went ballistic when Obama wouldn't give it back?
@wjn3tweets I saw @RandPaul addressed that slippery slope when I read this article.
@RandPaul Stay at work and fight the fight; stop conceding.
@RandPaul there should be a peoples congress a peoples representative so americans can have greater say and influence in politics
.@ArleneSmart Ummm. @RandPaul is 1 among many. Need more Constitutionalists in Congress.
@RandPaul I propose your get back in the race...and soon!
@RandPaul @SassyPantsjj now there's a thought!
@RandPaul Lead by example and support the other Senators that do like @tedcruz
@RandPaul @freedomtex Senator Paul you should've #ImpeachObama as soon as he started his dictatorship not after all the damage has been done
@RandPaul @EspositoJo @BreitbartNews  i propose rand not sell out any more and reattach his balls beyond dc...impotency can be cured!
@RandPaul to new pres. Just because congress gives you money, doesn't mean you have to spend it.
@RandPaul @freedomtex That's why we elected the bunch we have now was to stop runaway government(Obama). Done little to stop him- too late?
@Been_Grubered @RandPaul Look at the #ExIm vote. Only ~25% of Congress is conservative. Still a ton of RINOs that need to get primaried.
@RandPaul @socialistmop Obama has made Congress COMPLETELY irrelevant--with a LOT of help from Congress!
@RandPaul Rand, the way to do this is shift more power back to 50 states, with resources and authority, they will back you agst exec
@RandPaul @alllibertynews Your all bought, we all know, till you get money out, shuttfup
@RandPaul  don't complain about #executiveorder too much.  The new pres will need it to fix this country. Can't rely on congress.
@RandPaul @WinnaWinna2016 Then you should put your support behind Ted Cruz! Help put a constitutionalist in office.
@RandPaul @alllibertynews I propose Congress take bach its power from Wall Street, Pharma, Insurance Corps, Monsanto, Mil Ind Complex. #$$$$
@RandPaul @alllibertynews
@RandPaul @Iloveperfumeso little late with that one!
@RandPaul Dr. Paul please start a bill for no more taxes until all government spending is accounted to the American people.
@missvickee54 @RandPaul Also how about we cut government spending starting at the top until things get back to sanity?
@blackdragonetm @RandPaul Yes, good. Past presidents no longer get paid!
@RandPaul @RobinEnochs @BreitbartNews  Amen Rand! Theres that knowledge we so miss come back soon Rand.  #StillRanding #RandingStrong
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews  Please do not standup n take your roll n do your jobs or leave plzs #StillRanding #RandingStrong
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews how about states taking back the power that Congress seems to be having problems with?
@RandPaul Look foward to @thedemocrats & @gop ceding unaudited @federalreserve counterfeit FRN power to @whitehouse for another100 years...

@RandPaul Thanks for sharing that update - it's now live here: http://rbl.ms/1AtPNBq

@RandPaul It starts with invoking the power of the purse. DO NOT fund any more of these horrible bills! #StandWithRand #StillRanding
@RandPaul make it happen Rand. Just baffled as to what Americans are to do now that our choice of the right president has been taken again
@RandPaul i miss the only sane voice running for president 
@RandPaul Are you working with @SenMikeLee on the Article I Project? #A1P
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews I agree with Rand Paul and support his efforts for #Termlimits
#RandingStrong
@RandPaul @AnnCoulter How about forcing SCOTUS to confirm definition of Natural Born Citizen?
@RandPaul Agreed
@RandPaul I propose you're colleagues do their job and join you!
@RandPaul I propose We the People take back our power.
@RandPaul Live from the refuge -- FBI Standoff Happening. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOlrSain0lk&feature=youtu.be …
@RandPaul Congress has too much power to prevent domestic policy from gaining traction and getting through for Presidential signature.
@RandPaul you've got my vote next cycle
@RandPaul about time you do your job
@RandPaul about freakin time
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews Try... Wait for it... Working together. 
@RandPaul miss u
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews You should have shoveled the slop to your idiot base. You could have changed the world. "BUILD A WALL!" Then don't.
@RandPaul  Are you ready to get back in the race again yet? Because I will totally take you back. It'll be like this week never happened...
@RandPaul I propose kentucky elect a new senator this election
@RandPaul break up the too big to fail and corporate controled US
@RandPaul I propose that Congress put aside it's blatant racism and get some work done for it's constituents.
@RandPaul I'll fight for term-limits. #Libertarian for WI's 1st Congressional District. http://facebook.com/JasonLebeck2016  http://democracy.com/JasonLebeck2016 
@RandPaul - #Constitution - Article I, Sec 1 : #Congress & the Power vested in that body. There's a reason the Founders put Congress first.
@RandPaul @uknowthagod Why aren't you still running for president?  We need you!
@RandPaul I suggest Congress take back Power from the Lawless Bureaurocracies they have Created and failed to control some of which violate
@RandPaul Some make that many to Most violate Constitutional laws.
@RandPaul  I suggest that Congress the House start Representing the People INSTEAD of the Abusive Lawless Bureaucracies
@RandPaul I propose Dr Paul officially endorse Ted Cruz 
@RandPaul @georgeunangst33 EITHER TAKE BACK OUR POWER...OR...WE WILL TAKE IT BACK!!  Americans ARE SICK OF ALL WASHINGTON POLITICS!! #NOMore
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews GOOD it's time to TAKE WHAT IS R'S..
@RandPaul No fast tracking, no omnibus bills. A deadlock is better than a bad bill getting passed.
@RandPaul I propose the states take back their power. I support the @COSProject!
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews DITCH MITCH! He's the appeaser.
@RandPaul I propose we Vote for Integrity.
@RandPaul Congress needs to do their job.
@RandPaul Remember the constitution y'all separation of power the house write bill Senate pass it president sign it
@RandPaul You give us hope Senator Paul; with you at the helm I have faith that at least there's one true conservative in the beltway.
@RandPaul loser!
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews congress better take control because if trump gets in because he will abuse his power worse than obama.
@RandPaul I understand your frustration. We need a leader we can trust. I am that person. I met with the great people of South Carolina.
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews, Congress w/ ppl from all over the country. Not a single dictator. Change comes from  within us, not the president.
@RandPaul exactly! We wouldn't be witnessing the rise of the outsider if this had happened over the last 7 years!
@RandPaul unique idea. Follow the Constitution! It's a great document that is time tested but being tested again.
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews come back into the race.
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews we need term limits....now
@RandPaul that's what I'm talking about. President only gets away with what Congress lets him get away with.
@RandPaul I propose that all current congressmen be immediately replaced. And up for reelection once a year.
@RandPaul @BreitbartNews get Governors to take back their power and Congress is done, finally.
@RandPaul i propose rechange back the pseudological postmodern lies feminism-samesexuality-atheism into true progression again, yes we can!
@RandPaul You're right! But Donald Trump real strong polities than all. People vote Donald Trump have high polls.
@RandPaul Congress has done enough damage, it's time someone else had a turn
@bastardsni @RandPaul Yeah, let's abolish the assembly and let the tyrant fix things!  Didn't work in antiquity...
@KurtMyers0369 @RandPaul Or just try legislating?
@RandPaul I propose the PEOPLE and STATES take back their power! And not concede more to the federal government!
. @RandPaul You're such a radical! I wanted to vote for you for president.
