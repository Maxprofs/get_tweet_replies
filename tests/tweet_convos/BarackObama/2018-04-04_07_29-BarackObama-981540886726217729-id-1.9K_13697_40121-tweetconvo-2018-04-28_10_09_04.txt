I don't think MLK would respect anything you have done, by the way what have you done besides dividing America?
So upset that he’s more popular than trump? 
Are you I hope you're talking about Martin Luther King because if you're talking about Obama then I don't know what the hell you're talking about
 I’m talking about Obama, if you think trump is more popular why couldn’t he win the popular vote? 
He did. He won by not going to graveyards copying names off of tombstones.  Barack Obama had an advantage by going to graveyards in Africa.  This is exactly why Democrats don't want voter ID laws
You got to admit it was fun having two dudes in the White House
Always knew her balls were bigger than his n hilliarys
Two living legends speak about a past legend. I have no choice but to watch.
Past legend was very important!
Obviously.
The power of hope
We support you. We are together to unit defend democracy!

All thanks to #CivilRights hero Dr. King for advancing #Equality!

Let's continue his legacy & demand #EqualRights for women with the #EqualRightsAmendment in all 50 states: Call upon #Illinois to #RatifyERA!

 #ERAnow #PassTheERA #MLK #MLK50 #MenForERA  #SJRCA4 #ILleg
You might also want to give a shout out to Corretta Scott King as well. She campaigned hard to get ERA passed during the 1970's
Worst president ever.  You almost succeeded in destroying USA, but good always wins over evil.

Barrack Obama is a wonderful example of what a PRESIDENT Should be!                       #TheResistance
Suuuuure he was.
Find something better to do than spreading your Hateful Rhetoric!  What is up with the MAGATS making nasty remarks trying too bait people into arguments? Work in your community! Teach your children to be respectful!
Good read !
Which is if I may?
#Inevitable 
@BarackObama is a criminal & a puppet of globalists.
Take a look.

TRUMP DERANGEMENT MAKING IT HARD TO DIGEST FACTS?
Try #Reality 
Sometimes it might be nice to turn off @CNN & think for yourself...
Embrace #Reality 
It's where facts live!!
100% of US Presidents recommend #Reality as a cure for Trump Derangement Syndrome, isn't that right guys?
I rather have a President that doesnt have 3 wives and 2 mistresses, who tells the truth for one day,  who doesn't  tear down others, and ask a foreign country to interfere  WiTh our  election system. Plus where are all the jobs??
That this is the President that you would prefer says everything that anyone would ever need to know about you.
#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
GET WELL SOON!
Trump's claim about weak economic growth under President Obama doesn't tell the full story | PolitiFact@
Guessing you weren't valedictorian...
Some of the most powerful people have not used force to exercise that power!  Dr. King was one; John Lewis, another.  Thank you, President Obama!
John Lewis has lived such an amazing life! So glad there are young people following in his footsteps.
Thank you, President Obama and Rep. Lewis for your service, your courage and for this post honoring MLK Jr., inspiring our future leaders.
Thank you for not retiring. We love you and still need your voice more than ever!
Obama failure is Trump result
Obama was elected to be a real secular but he was not look what he did to world and americs
Never forget his life and legacy.
Rep. Lewis is a national treasure, and we should be getting every story that he has to tell down on audio for the next generation of activists who won’t be able to hear him actually speak.
And you single handedly erased everything Dr King stood for.
Says an old white dude
A Great Legacy.Thanks for sharing
In the work of you two great leaders, we see the power of Dr. King' s legacy, and the promise.

Measured by the content of your character, your legacy is one of hatred, divisiveness, violence, indebtedness, poverty, minority unemployment, dependency, lawlessness, no borders, & sedition. Alinsky would be proud, but history will remember you only as an evil insurgent #MAGA
He might be dead but his ideas still live on. If you aspire to be immortal have great ideas.

What a blessing to have had you both.
Can someone tell me why are melinated people brown folks I didn’t say black because we are not really black they say we are black but I am original! But why the so called white hates and don’t wants us to have equality??? Where is this extreme hate comes from
Simple dude! Whites used to own slaves. So they don’t see black people as human but as property. As sub-humans. As animals. They think they’re superior when in reality the opposite is true.
Only the elite Illuminati feel that way. Everyday Americans, black & white all inbetween can see that they try to keep us divided! No one gets to chose their race. We do get to chose how we treat each other! #HumanKindness
It was my surprise and pleasure to meet Rep. Lewis at the rally at the Atlanta-Hartsfield Airport, 2017. (regarding the travel ban trump tried to invoke) There is a huge presence around Rep.Lewis. He looked me in the eyes as we briefly spoke, it was a life changing moment. 
What did the rally accomplish?
What most rallies do - showed the nation that there were large numbers of people that did not agree with the governments purposed law. This time it was a travel ban. Also allows freedom of speech - your collective voice to be heard. I believe you might already know this Mike. 
Maybe if they tried lobbying their disagreements and voting as a collective force it might be more productive.
Oh but he is. Martin Luther King would have been so proud of him. He is the Martin Luther King of today...such a great, charismatic man, with such integrity, class, & compassion. He is so loved, that America voted him in twice...What a great amazing president!

Jay Z recently said why are white men are so privileged in this country”. Maybe we should talk about how former crack cocaine dealer can come up from nothing & make hundreds of millions pushing shitty rap music that promotes violence, drugs & women abuse.

Yes, We can....

Two amazing men that have shaped this country talking about a legend that lost his life too soon fighting for equality. President Obama is inspiring and outstanding. I miss his leadership and his passion to unite us all,
Thank you so much for sharing these reflections with us.  I was in Chicago on that dark day 50 years ago with a singing group on tour.  We retired to a private space to sing some spiritual music in King's honor.  Then we walked out to see smoke rising from the inner city.
Hard to believe we have gone from men like these to Don the Con.
I feel for you guys. I'd feel for you even more if us Brits didn't have enough troubles of our own Conservative Government to suffer. You should have gone the way of China...Obama for life!
NOPE!
Hah, well in your case ...you've got what you deserve. How does 'Make America Great Again' look to you? 
Didn't vote for him!
the same Obama my Kenyan brother ended the life of Africas best Muamar Gaddafi..double standards
Your Kenyan brother Obama!!!
yeaaa Obama is Kenyan-American
And the other half isis!!!
To mark 50 yrs since MLKjnrs assignation BBC 4 showed two documentaries tonight

Caught red handed - Staged ISIS execution. 
Leaked footage obtained from a staffer of US Senator John McCain shows the making of an ISIL “execution” video similar to the videos portraying the beheading…
You sold your people out!!  What did you ever do for them?  Not a thing, you just wanted to make this country divided and weak and easily defeated, but you didn't think about how tough the American People are.  Fill your pockets, God will deal with you in the end.
Obuma... yep.. it’s spelt right 
he had a dream, and he knew one's dreams could be realized by constant effort that will never hurt others meaninglessly as you and other politicians know.

Not even right!
On this Day we should honor Martin Luther King, a great American of the 20th century but instead the White House is silent. Little can be expected from a POTUS who has attacked various minorities.A Day to honor the courage & intelligence that Robert Kennedy displayed 50 years ago
POTUS gave the great Martin Luther King Jr.  a special ceremony and signed special 
Paper honoring this day in his name & spoke highly of him.But fake news ignored it.
Yes he also had Wayne LaPierre to white house dinner on the 5th anniversary of Sandy Hook.... thoughtful POTUS
Please explain Wayne LaPierre,
Sandy Hook connection.
Are you serious?

Don’t you remember me? I used to be your best cooperative partner， a Chinese citizen called Xiaochuan Sun(孙笑川). If you know the chinese social software,please search ‘带带大师兄‘.
I love you guys. 
We sure miss you mr. President Barack Obama you're one of the best presidents ever you're classy respectful and HONEST, Now we have a #CrookedTrump that's a IGNORAMUS ! hopefully we'll get over this  And we be better for IT ! God BLESS, #FoxFakeNews #BlueWave2018
Name 5 things Obama did to help out the US in his 8 years?
28 things I could think of but not enough space 1, Rescue are country from a Great Recession cut unemployment from 10% to 4.7% 2, Sign of fordable Care Act over 20 million uninsured people were insured,3 order the captured or killed Osama Bin Laden.4 Save the US Auto industry...
5. Help support the veteran as a $78 tuition assistance GI Bill, 6, Launch My Brother's Keeper, White House intervention to help minorities received their full potential.7 Help sign a hate crime act bill against minorities LGBT community. And much more
Why would I wanna do any of that,?? How bout help support wounded warrior fund or homeless veterans fund??

This was inspiring to watch. I truly love and respect @repjohnlewis and President Obama.
Lewis is racist.
You did obsoutotly did nothing but make the USA hate our cops, made it hard for vets, kill tons of babies, almost destroy our economy, and destroyed our welfare and health care system SHIT. 
So I thank you osada Ben Obama.
@BarackObama I’m so happy you are out of office any longer and you would have destroyed The United States of America .
I have a question for you.
I think you left few loose war crimes unreported????¿
Only thing u two stand for is your pocket full of money  odumer & Luie have dun nothing to help black peoples.just illegals u know u already have the black vote

Spies against Dilma and US Department of Justice involvement in Lava Jato shows: US has promoted yet another coup in Brazil. Dilma, elected and without crime, was removed. LULA, the greatest president is arrested without evidence. US are responsible for what will happen in Brazil

Thanks Michelle, but I don't need the government to be a "parent" to me..#MichelleObama
You're such a traitor to our beautiful country . PROJECT PELICAN . giving out our ports in Florida to IRAQ and RUSSIA to sell our URANUIM.  You corrupt leaders were going to have us nuked while you hide in a bunker.  I say off with your heads . All of you need to hang.
The true Gospel of God has nothing to do with social issues.  The social gospel is a bastardization of the true Gospel of Christ that saves. It detracts from the truth.  In God's kingdom men of all colors are brothers because we have one Lord, one faith and one baptism. Fear God.
Mr. Barack Obama don’t you think you should take president out of your title on Twitter you are no longer our president Donald Trump is the president of United States not you!! He deserves that respect!!!
civil rights movement ended segregation and discrimination under the leadership of MartinLKING
Can you please tell the haters and Hollywood buddies to stop this disgraceful rhetoric towards my President. I think it will make a huge difference. Stop the hate!!! Shameful.
FYI Barack. Your not president anymore praise be to Allah brother.
